Due to its various benefits, HM products are acquiring more popularity among the individuals. As there are different varieties of HM products available in the market, the confusion arises in choosing a HM which suits the individual’s hair profile and causes less side effects. Here, we have employed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) combined with fuzzy set theory to obtain better results. We used the extended Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method based on trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy set (TIT2FS) in this research paper to handle vagueness and complexity in real-world problems. For determining the objective weights of the criteria, we used the entropy method of weight finding. An example of selecting a hair mask product (HMP) among four alternatives based on five criteria is provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. In comparison to other MCDM methods, the approach yielded more practical results. By doing a sensitive study, the method’s stability is also assessed.},

  abstract     = {The main objective of this article is to lay the foundations of a novel multi-criteria optimization technique, namely, the complex Pythagorean fuzzy N-soft VIKOR (CPFNS-VIKOR) method that is highly proficient to express a great deal of linguistic imprecision and vagueness inherent in human assessments. This strategy provides a versatile decision-making tool for the ranking-based fuzzy modeling of two-dimensional parameterized data. The CPFNS-VIKOR method integrates the ground-breaking specialities of the VIKOR method with the outstanding parametric structure of the complex Pythagorean fuzzy N-soft model. It is exclusively designed for the specification of a compromise optimal solution having maximum group utility and minimum individual regret of the opponent by analyzing their weighted proximity from ideal solutions. The developed strategy factually permits specific linguistic terms to demystify the individual perspectives of the decision-making experts regarding the efficacy of the alternatives and the priorities of the applicable criteria. We comprehensively assemble these independent appraisals of all the experts using the complex Pythagorean fuzzy N-soft weighted averaging operator. Moreover, we calibrate the ranking measure by utilizing group utility measure and regret measure in order to specify the hierarchical outranking of the feasible alternatives. We demonstrate the systematic methodology and framework of the proposed method with the assistance of an explicative flow chart. We skilfully investigate an empirical analysis related to selection of constructive industrial robots for the modernization of a manufacturing industry which really justifies the remarkable accountability of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, we validate this technique by a comparative study with the existing complex Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS (CPF-TOPSIS) method, complex Pythagorean fuzzy VIKOR (CPF-VIKOR) method and Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS (PF-TOPSIS) method. The comparative study is exemplified with an illustrative bar chart that visually endorses the rationality of the proposed methodology by interpreting highly compatible and accurate final outcomes. Finally, we holistically analyze the functionality of the developed strategy to enlighten its merits and prominence over other available competent approaches.},

To promote and spread the cultural knowledge of the Liao Dynasty, an intelligent question-and-answer system is constructed based on the knowledge graph in the historical and cultural field of the Liao Dynasty. In the traditional question answering system, the quality of answers was not high due to incomplete data and distinctive vocabulary. To solve this problem, a combination method of Liao Dynasty question-and-answer database and KB is proposed to realize knowledge graph question answering, and a joint model of Siamese LSTM and fusion MatchPyramid is proposed for semantic matching between questions in the question-and-answer database. With the joint model, it is easy to perform semantic matching by fusing sentence-level and word-level interactive features through LSTM and MatchPyramid. Furthermore, the question sentence with the same semantics as the user input question sentence is retrieved in the question-and-answer database, and the answer corresponding to the question sentence is returned as the result. The experimental results show that our proposed method has achieved relatively good performance in the historical domain of the Liao Dynasty and the open-domain knowledge graph, and improved the accuracy of question and answer.},

Taking into account the relationship of raw materials, inventory cost and product demand, a multi-objective programming model for multi-product APP problem is established to minimize total production costs and instability in the work force. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, the feasible region of the planned production and the number of workers in each period are determined and a local search algorithm is used to improve the search ability. Based on the analysis of the feasible range, a genetic algorithm is designed to solve the model combined with the local search algorithm. For analyzing the effect of this algorithm, the information entropy strategy, NSGA-II strategy and multi-population strategy are compared and analyzed with examples, and the simulation results show that the model is feasible, and the NSGA-II algorithm based on the local search has a better performance in the multi-objective APP problem.},

In this paper, we develop an effective system to diagnose diabetes disease using a hybrid optimization-based Support Vector Machine (SVM).The proposed hybrid optimization technique integrates a Crow Search algorithm (CSA) and Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (BGWO) for exploiting the full potential of SVM in the diabetes diagnosis system. The effectiveness of our proposed hybrid optimization-based SVM (hereafter called CS-BGWO-SVM) approach is carefully studied on the real-world databases such as UCIPima Indian standard dataset and the diabetes type dataset from the Data World repository. To evaluate the CS-BGWO-SVM technique, its performance is related to several state-of-the-arts approaches using SVM with respect to predictive accuracy, Intersection Over-Union (IoU), specificity, sensitivity, and the area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The outcomes of empirical analysis illustrate that CS-BGWO-SVM can be considered as a more efficient approach with outstanding classification accuracy. Furthermore, we perform the Wilcoxon statistical test to decide whether the proposed cohesive CS-BGWO-SVM approach offers a substantial enhancement in terms of performance measures or not. Consequently, we can conclude that CS-BGWO-SVM is the better diabetes diagnostic model as compared to modern diagnosis methods previously reported in the literature.},

First, various membership matrices are created after running FCM multiple times, based on the randomization of the initial cluster centers, and a vertical ensemble is performed using the maximum membership principle. Second, after each execution of FCM, multiple local membership matrices of the sample points are created using multiple K-nearest neighbors, and a horizontal ensemble is performed. Multiple horizontal ensembles can be created using multiple FCM clustering. Finally, the final clustering results are obtained by combining the vertical and horizontal clustering ensembles. Twelve data sets were chosen for testing from both synthetic and real data sources. The LI_BIFCM clustering performance outperformed four traditional clustering algorithms and three clustering ensemble algorithms in the experiments. Furthermore, the final clustering results has a weak correlation with the bi-directional cluster ensemble parameters, indicating that the suggested technique is robust.},

In the existing literatures, only the rule of RSSD localization circle of two monitoring stations and the geometric relation of RSSD localization circle of five monitoring stations were analyzed, but the number and the station layout of the minimum RSSD localization network have not been investigated. In the present work, first, based on the existing RSSD localization equation, the constants of the commonly used wave propagation models are provided. Then, the minimum RSSD localization network is proved through algebraic analysis, which is that four monitoring stations not distributed on a straight line can locate the signal source at one point. The relationship between the localization accuracy and the signal strength error of the RSSD location network with different scales is studied further and formulated as a nonlinear programming optimization problem. It is found that the localization stability of the network with four stations is poor, and there is a serious localization deviation outlier phenomenon. Therefore, the network with four stations is not available for radio monitoring networks with a signal strength error of ± 5 to  ± 10 dB. The RSSD network with five stations is basically the minimum available size, and the RSSD network with nine stations can approach the localization accuracy of the angle of arrival (AOA) network with three stations.},

  abstract     = {People counting has been investigated extensively as a tool to increase the individual’s safety and to avoid crowd hazards at public places. It is a challenging task especially in high-density environment such as Hajj and Umrah, where millions of people gathered in a constrained environment to perform rituals. This is due to large variations of scales of people across different scenes. To solve scale problem, a simple and effective solution is to use an image pyramid. However, heavy computational cost is required to process multiple levels of the pyramid. To overcome this issue, we propose deep-fusion model that efficiently and effectively leverages the hierarchical features exits in various convolutional layers deep neural network. Specifically, we propose a network that combine multiscale features from shallow to deep layers of the network and map the input image to a density map. The summation of peaks in the density map provides the final crowd count. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed deep network, we perform experiments on three different benchmark datasets, namely, UCF_CC_50, ShanghaiTech, and UCF-QNRF. From experiments results, we show that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) values.},

  abstract     = {With rapid development of the Internet, people have undergone tremendous changes in the way they obtain information. In recent years, knowledge graph is becoming a popular tool for the public to acquire knowledge. For knowledge graph of Chinese history and culture, most researchers adopted traditional named entity recognition methods to extract entity information from unstructured historical text data. However, the traditional named entity recognition method has certain defects, and it is easy to ignore the association between entities. To extract entities from a large amount of historical and cultural information more accurately and efficiently, this paper proposes one named entity recognition model combining Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (BERT-BiLSTM-CRF). First, a BERT pre-trained language model is used to encode a single character to obtain a vector representation corresponding to each character. Then one Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer is applied to semantically encode the input text. Finally, the label with the highest probability is output through the Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer to obtain each character’s category. This model uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pre-trained language model to replace the static word vectors trained in the traditional way. In comparison, the BERT pre-trained language model can dynamically generate semantic vectors according to the context of words, which improves the representation ability of word vectors. The experimental results prove that the model proposed in this paper has achieved excellent results in the task of named entity recognition in the field of historical culture. Compared with the existing named entity identification methods, the precision rate, recall rate, and $$F_1$$ value have been significantly improved.},

Because of the high dimension and complex features of sensor data in RUL prediction, this paper proposes a model combining deep convolution neural networks (DCNN) and the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm to estimate the RUL. Compared with traditional prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques, signal processing of raw sensor data and prior expertise are not required. The procedure is shown as follows. First, the time window of raw data of the aero-engine is used as the input of DCNN after normalization. The role of DCNN is to extract information from the input data. Second, considering the limitations of the fully connected layer of DCNN, we replace it with a strong classifier-LightGBM to improve the accuracy of prediction. Finally, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted some experiments on the C-MAPSS data set provided by NASA, and obtained good accuracy. By comparing the prediction effect with other commonly used algorithms on the same data set, the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages.},

Deep neural networks are adopted to artistic style transfer and achieve remarkable success, such as AdaIN (adaptive instance normalization), WCT (whitening and coloring transforms), MST (multimodal style transfer), and SEMST (structure-emphasized multimodal style transfer). These algorithms modify the content image as a whole using only one style and one algorithm, which is easy to cause the foreground and background to be blurred together. In this paper, an iterative artistic multi-style transfer system is built to edit the image with multiple styles by flexible user interaction. First, a subjective evaluation experiment with art professionals is conducted to build an open evaluation framework for style transfer, including the universal evaluation questions and personalized answers for ten typical artistic styles. Then, we propose the interactive artistic multi-style transfer system, in which an interactive image crop tool is designed to cut a content image into several parts. For each part, users select a style image and an algorithm from AdaIN, WCT, MST, and SEMST by referring to the characteristics of styles and algorithms summarized by the evaluation experiments. To obtain richer results, the system provides a semantic-based parameter adjustment mode and the function of preserving colors of content image.

However, the lack and imbalance of research data and the insufficient performance of the model have led to the complexity and uncontrollability of flood forecasting. To forecast coastal floods accurately and reliably, the Internet of Things technology is used to collect data on floods and flood factors in smart cities. An ensemble learning method based on Bayesian model combination (BMC-EL) is designed to predict flood depth. First, flood intensity classification and K-fold cross-validation are introduced to generate multiple training subsets from the training set to realize uniform sampling and increase the diversity of subsets. Second, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) are used as the base learners to build the prediction model and then import it into training subsets for training purposes. Finally, based on the prediction performance of the base learner in the validation sets, the Bayesian model combination strategy is formulated to integrate and output predicted values. We describe experiments conducted to forecast flood depth 1 h in advance that several machine learning models were trained and tested using real flood data taken from Macao, China. The models include linear regression, support vector machine, BPNN, RF and BMC-EL models. Results prove the accuracy and reliability of the BMC-EL method in flood forecasting for coastal cities.},

However, variations of target appearance caused by heavy occlusion, rotation, background clutters and target deformations are the major challenges for tracking. To solve these problems, many works put on exploiting the power of target representation, such as high-level convolutional features. Nonetheless, these methods make a great compromise between the speed and performance. At the same time, there are few researches on improving the performance of model updater and the ensemble methods. In this paper, a multi-experts joint decision strategy base on kernelized correlation filters is proposed to obtain robust and accurate visual tracking, two trackers with handcrafted features and deep convolutional neural network features are integrated in this framework. We also investigate the mechanism of tracking failure caused by occlusion and background clutters, and propose a novel criterion to evaluate the reliability of samples.

The survival quality of these patients depends on the reliable prediction of NPC stages III and IVa. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework to produce the classification probabilities for predicting NPC stages III and IVa. The preprocessing of MR images enhance the quality of images for further analysis. In stage one transfer learning is used to improve the classification effectiveness and the efficiency of CNN models training with limited images. Then in stage two the output of these models are aggregates using soft voting to boost the final prediction. The experimental results show the preprocessing is quite effective, the performance of transfer learning models perform better than the basic CNN model, and our ensemble model outperforms the single model as well as traditional methods, including the TNM staging system and the Radiomics method. Finally, the prediction accuracy boosted by the framework is, respectively, 0.81, indicating that our method achieves the SOTA effectiveness for LA-NPC stage prediction. In addition, the heatmaps generated with Class Activation Map technique illustrate the interpretability of the CNN models, and show their capability of assisting clinicians in medical diagnosis and follow-up treatment by producing discriminative regions related to NPC in the MR images.},

  abstract     = {Tubular structure enhancement plays an utmost role in medical image segmentation as a pre-processing technique. In this work, an unsupervised 3D tubular structure segmentation technique is developed, which is mainly inspired by the idea of filter combination. Three well-known vessel filters, Frangi’s filter, the modified Frangi’s filter and the Multiscale Fractional Anisotropic Tensor (MFAT) filter, separately enhance the original images. Next, the enhanced images obtained using three different filters are combined. Different categories of vessel filters have the ability of complementarity, which is the main motivation of combining these three advanced filters. The combination of them ensures a high diversity of the enhancing results. Weighted mean and median ranking methods are used to conduct the operation of filter combination. Based on the optimized weights for all the three individual filters, fuzzy C-means method is then applied to segment the tubular structures. The proposed technique is tested on the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, the public synthetic vascular models (2011 and 2013 VascuSynth Sample), and real-patient Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art filter combination-based segmentation methods. Moreover, our proposed method is able to yield better tubular structure segmentation results than that of each individual filter, which exhibits the superiority of the proposed method. In conclusion, the proposed method can be further used to facilitate vessel segmentation in medical practice.},

In addition, the intuitionistic fuzzy tree is becoming increasingly significant as it is applied to different areas in real life.

We investigate the types of arcs, for example, $$\alpha _{\mu }$$ -strong, $$\beta _{\mu }$$ -strong, and $$\delta _{\mu }$$ -arc in an intuitionistic fuzzy graph, and introduce some of their properties. In particular, the present work develops the concepts of intuitionistic fuzzy bridge (IFB), intuitionistic fuzzy cut nodes (IFCN) and some important properties of an intuitionistic fuzzy bridge. Next, we define an intuitionistic fuzzy cycle (IFC) and an intuitionistic fuzzy tree (IFT). Likewise, we discuss some properties of the IFT and the relationship between an intuitionistic fuzzy tree and an intuitionistic fuzzy cycle.

  abstract     = {Decision-making environment often encounters complexity along its processes, especially in the context of multidisciplinary scientific research. This can commonly be seen in engineering, computing, finance, astrology and other different areas. It is of great restriction in dealing with the practical problems which have diverse demands and properties. There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of dealing with the complexity in decision making environment. The reliability and the transparency are the dominant feature of the integration of fuzzy network and Z-numbers. However, much of the research up to now has been descriptive in nature of the features. Hence, this proposed method is unique and novel because it offers some interesting insight of dealing with reliability and transparency of information in Z-hesitant fuzzy network decision-making environment. The fuzzy networks have the functionality under rule bases of fuzzy systems where it is recognized by its transparency and precision. The proposed method makes use of fuzzy network with the incorporation of hesitant fuzzy sets to assimilate decision information towards alternatives. For the validation and applicability purposes of the proposed method, the case study of stock evaluation assessed by a number of decision makers has been utilized as a real-world problem. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated respectively by applying the Spearman’s rho correlation. The result shows that the proposed method performs as the established method with the consideration of additional dominant features.},

  abstract     = {The algorithm wingsuit flying search (WFS) mimics the procedure of landing the vehicle. The outstanding feature of WFS is parameterless and of rapid convergence. However, WFS also has its shortcomings, sometimes it will inevitably be trapped into local optima, thereby yield inferior solutions owing to its relatively weak exploration ability. Spherical evolution (SE) adopts a novel spherical search pattern that takes aim at splendid search ability. Cooperative coevolution is a useful parallel structure for reconciling algorithmic performance. Considering the complementary strengths of both algorithms, we herein propose a new hybrid algorithm that is comprised of SE and WFS using cooperative coevolution. During the search for optimal solutions in WFS, we replaced the original search matrix and introduced the spherical mechanism of SE, in parallel with coevolution to enhance the competitiveness of the population. The two distinct search dynamics were combined in a parallel and coevolutionary way, thereby getting a good search performance. The resultant hybrid algorithm, CCWFSSE, was tested on the CEC2017 benchmark set and 22 CEC 2011 real-world problems. The experimental data obtained can verify that CCWFSSE outperforms other algorithms in aspects of effectiveness and robustness.},

It is challenging for the UAV to decide a track by itself in a complex geometrical environment. This paper presents a UAV intelligent navigation method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We propose using geographic information systems (GIS) as the DRL training environment to overcome the inconsistency between the training environment and the test environment. We creatively save the flight path in the form of an image. The combination of the knowledge-based Monte Carlo tree search method and local search method can not only effectively avoid falling into local search, but also ensure learning the optimal search direction under the limitation of computing power. Experiments show that the trained UAV can find an excellent flight path by intelligent navigation, and able to make effective flight decisions in a complex geometrical environment.},

  abstract     = {In both theoretical and applied mathematics fields, integral inequalities play a critical role. Due to the behavior of the definition of convexity, both concepts convexity and integral inequality depend on each other. Therefore, the relationship between convexity and symmetry is strong. Whichever one we work on, we introduced the new class of generalized convex function is known as LR- $$\left({h}_{1}, {h}_{2}\right)$$ -convex interval-valued function (LR- $$\left({h}_{1}, {h}_{2}\right)$$ -IVF) by means of pseudo order relation. Then, we established its strong relationship between Hermite–Hadamard inequality (HH-inequality)) and their variant forms. Besides, we derive the Hermite–Hadamard–Fejér inequality (HH–Fejér inequality)) for LR- $$\left({h}_{1}, {h}_{2}\right)$$ -convex interval-valued functions. Several exceptional cases are also obtained which can be viewed as its applications of this new concept of convexity. Useful examples are given that verify the validity of the theory established in this research. This paper’s concepts and techniques may be the starting point for further research in this field.},

  abstract     = {A common practice to capture the non-stationary characteristics of the time series data in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is by randomly dividing the whole set of available data into training, validation and testing, i.e. the data in validation and testing are represented in the training data. Consequently, the usability of the developed model on data not represented by the training data used during the network model development process is always doubtful. In this work, we present a back-propagation neural network (BNN) model trained using one-day history data to predict soil moisture data at 1 km resolution for two future dates. Specifically, high soil moisture values were observed in the training data while the testing data were characterized by drier conditions due to minimal or no rainfall. Our model uses separate mean and standard deviation statistics values from the training and testing data, respectively, to the z-normalized data. With data pre-processed using this method, the BNN model next uses a moving window of size 4 km × 4 km to capture the spatial variability of the soil moisture throughout the 40 km × 40 km study area. The coupling of the normalization and moving window method managed to achieve average soil moisture with Root Mean Square (RMSE) of 3.67% and correlation coefficient, R2 of 0.89. By only using the suggested normalization without the moving window method, the BNN model managed to achieve an average RMSE of barely 5.82% with R2 = 0.83. When comparing with the normal practice of using the same mean and standard deviation statistics of the training data in the testing data, the retrieval accuracy of the BNN model deteriorates to 8.86% with R2 = 0.32. The experiment results demonstrated that the proposed coupling method performed better in terms of both RMSE and R2 for soil moisture retrieval.},

Classical problems, which are getting bigger and bigger, require more and more resources for their processing, and Big Data technologies offer many solutions. Although the principal algorithms for traditional vector-based problems are available in Big Data environments, the lack of tools for time series processing in these environments needs to be addressed. In this work, we propose a scalable and distributed time series transformation for Big Data environments based on well-known time series features (SCMFTS), which allows practitioners to apply traditional vector-based algorithms to time series problems. The proposed transformation, along with the algorithms available in Spark, improved the best results in the state-of-the-art on the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection dataset, which is the biggest publicly available multivariate time series dataset in the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. In addition, SCMFTS showed a linear relationship between its runtime and the number of processed time series, demonstrating a linear scalable behavior, which is mandatory in Big Data environments. SCMFTS has been implemented in the Scala programming language for the Apache Spark framework, and the code is publicly available.},

Beside the proposed methodology, a few non-fundamental properties of complex spherical fuzzy weighted averaging (CSFWA) operator inclusive of shift invariance, homogenous, linearity, and additive property are also explored. The proposed procedure validates the individual opinions into an acceptable form by the dint of CSFWA operator and the aggregated opinions are further analyzed by the proposed complex spherical fuzzy- ELECTRE I (CSF-ELECTRE I) method. Within the consideration of proposed methodology, normalized Euclidean distances of complex spherical fuzzy numbers are also contemplated. In CSF-ELECTRE I method, the score, accuracy, and refusal degrees determine the concordance and discordance sets for each pair of alternatives to calculate the concordance and discordance indices, respectively. Based on aggregated outranking matrix, a decision graph is constructed to attain the ELECTREcally outranked solutions and the best alternative. This article provides supplementary approach at the final step to profess a linear ranking order of the alternatives.

Meanwhile, a huge number of meta-heuristic algorithms have been suggested to overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods.

In this paper, we suggested an enhancement to TSA, named Enhanced Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (ETSA), based on a novel searching strategy to improve the exploration and exploitation abilities. The proposed ETSA is applied to 20 unimodal, multimodal and fixed dimensional benchmark test functions and compared with other algorithms. The statistical measures, error analysis and the Wilcoxon test have affirmed the robustness and effectiveness of the ETSA. Furthermore, the scalability of the ETSA is confirmed using high dimensions and results exhibited that the ETSA is least affected by increasing the dimensions. Additionally, the CPU time of the proposed algorithms are obtained, the ETSA provides less CPU time than the others for most functions. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied at one of the important electrical applications, Economic Dispatch Problem, and the results affirmed its applicability to deal with practical optimization tasks.},

Computing facilities have emerged to an extent where algorithms can attain near human accuracy in prediction of diseases, offering better treatment to curb further proliferation. The work introduced in the paper provides an interface in mobile platform, which enables the user to input histopathology image and obtain the prediction results with its class probability through embedded web-server. The trained deep convolutional neural networks model is deployed into a microcomputer-based embedded system after hyper-parameter tuning, offering congruent performance. The implementation results show that the embedded platform with custom-trained CNN model is suitable for medical image classification, as it takes less execution time and mean prediction time. It is also noticed that customized CNN classifier model outperforms pre-trained models when used in embedded platforms for prediction and classification of histopathology images.

  abstract     = {Logistics processes have been analyzed as one of the most critical expense items for companies. Companies that failed to manage their logistics processes well could not reach the desired growth rates, and some even disappeared. Logistics management without process optimizations can be time and money consuming for the companies. Logistics processes significantly influence organizations&#39; efficiency. Logistic professionals should keep the process flow quality at a certain level, and some decision problems should be analyzed and answered well. Location selection of a warehouse is one of the most crucial decision problems of supply chain and logistics management. Alternatives are evaluated in quantitative and qualitative criteria to decide the best location alternative using scientific MCDM techniques. Different scientific methods have been developed and used to solve this problem. As for this study, the aim is to investigate the warehouse location selection of third-party cold chain logistics suppliers. The importance of keeping perishable products under the right conditions increased, since it is realized that cold chain warehousing and transportation prevent the product spoiled. Organizations can save their funds and time by having effective cold chain management. This study&#39;s main scope is to give a new scientific perspective for warehouse selection in cold chain logistics. MCDM technique of Interval-Valued Neutrosophic Fuzzy (IVNF) EDAS method has been used to evaluate essential criteria and choose the best option. Critical cities of Gulf Region countries have been considered alternatives in a numerical illustration.},

Due to its complexity and nonlinearity, however, ship’s heave motion prediction is a difficult task to be solved. In this paper, a new method for predicting ship’s heave motion is proposed based on an improved back propagation neural network (IBPNN). To overcome the gradient saturation phenomenon of traditional BPNN, the mean square error (MSE) loss function is replaced with a cross entropy (CE) loss function in IBPNN. Meanwhile, the weights of IBPNN is regularized by $$L_2$$ norm to enhance the generalization ability of traditional BPNN. Finally, conjugate gradient method is adopted to train IBPNN. The IBPNN is used to predict ship’s heave motion and the prediction results prove its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Detecting various attacks and abnormal traffic in the network is extremely important to network security. Existing detection models used massive amounts of data to complete abnormal traffic detection. However, few-shot attack samples can only be intercepted in certain special scenarios. In addition, the discrimination of traffic attributes will also be affected by the change of feature attitude. But the traditional neural network model cannot detect this kind of attitude change. Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of few-shot sample abnormal traffic detection are very low. In this paper, we proposed a few-shot abnormal network traffic detection method. It was composed of the multi-scale Deep-CapsNet and adversarial reconstruction. First, we designed an improved EM vector clustering of the Deep-CapsNet. The attitude transformation matrix was used to complete the prediction from low-level to high-level features. Second, a multi-scale convolutional capsule was designed to optimize the Deep-CapsNet. Third, an adversarial reconstruction classification network (ARCN) was proposed. The supervised source data classification and the unsupervised target data reconstruction were achieved. Moreover, we proposed an adversarial training strategy, which alleviated the noise interference during reconstruction. Fourth, the few-shot sample classification were obtained by combining multi-scale Deep-CapsNet and adversarial reconstruction. The ICSX2012 and CICIDS2017 datasets were used to verify the performance. The experimental results show that our method has better training performance. Moreover, it has the highest accuracy in two-classification and multi-classification. Especially it has good anti-noise performance and short running time, which can be used for real-time few-shot abnormal network traffic detection.},

In the second phase, Random Forest, and XGBoost are applied as lately they have been showing significant improved performance in supervised learning. Finally, deep learning techniques, namely, Feed Forward, LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit neural network are applied to conduct the experiment. Kyoto Honeypot Dataset is used for experimental purpose.

While computer-aided translation tools, such as translation memories, are considered to be part of a translator&#39;s work, lately, machine translation (MT) systems have also been accepted by human translators. However, many human translators are still adopting the changes brought by translation technologies to the translation industry. This paper introduces a novel approach for seeking suitable pairs of n-grams when recommending n-grams (corresponding n-grams between MT and post-edited MT) based on the type of text (manual or administrative) and MT system used for machine translation. A tool that recommends and speeds up the correction of MT was developed to help the post-editors with their work. It is based on the analysis of words with the same lemmas and analysis of n-gram recommendations. These recommendations are extracted from sequence patterns of the mismatched words (MisMatch) between MT output and post-edited MT output. The paper aims to show the usage of morphological analysis for recommending the post-edit operations. It describes the usage of mismatched words in the n-gram recommendations for the post-edited MT output. The contribution consists of the methodology for seeking suitable pairs of words, n-grams and additionally the importance of taking into account metadata (the type of the text and/or style and MT system) when recommending post-edited operations.},

First, the one-half rule is introduced in the mutation process, that is, half of the individuals perform differential evolutionary mutation, and the other half perform evolutionary strategy reorganization, which increases the diversity of the population and avoids premature convergence of the algorithm; Second, set up an adaptive mutation operator and a crossover operator to prevent the algorithm from falling into the local optimum and improve the accuracy of the solution. Finally, classical high-order algebraic equations and nonlinear equations are selected for testing, and compared with other algorithms. The results show that the improved algorithm has higher solution accuracy and robustness, and has a faster convergence speed.

Existing text classification models based on supervised learning, especially deep learning models, have made great progress on public datasets. But most of these methods rely on a large amount of training data, and these datasets coverage is limited. In the legal intelligent question-answering system, accurate classification of legal consulting questions is a necessary prerequisite for the realization of intelligent question answering. However, due to lack of sufficient annotation data and the cost of labeling is high, which lead to the poor effect of traditional supervised learning methods under sparse labeling. In response to the above problems, we construct a few-shot legal consulting questions dataset, and propose a prototypical networks model based on multi-attention. For the same category of instances, this model first highlights the key features in the instances as much as possible through instance-dimension level attention. Then it realizes the classification of legal consulting questions by prototypical networks. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results compared with baseline models.

  abstract     = {Service composition and optimal selection (SCOS) is a core issue in cloud manufacturing (CMfg) when integrating distributed manufacturing services for complex manufacturing tasks. Generally, a set of recommended task parameter sequences (Tps) will be given when publishing manufacturing tasks. The similarity between the service composition parameter sequence (SCps) and Tps also reflects the rationality of the service composition. However, various evaluation models based on QoS have been proposed, ignoring the rationality between the Tps and SCps. Considering the similarity of the Tps and SCps in an evaluation model, we propose a manufacturing SCOS framework called MSCOS. The framework includes two parts: an evaluation model and an algorithm for both optimization and selection. In the evaluation model, based on the numerical proximity and geometric similarity between the Tps and SCps, improving the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) with the grey correlation degree (GC), we propose the GC&amp;TOPSIS (GTOPSIS). In the optimization and selection algorithm, an improved flower pollination algorithm (IFPA) is proposed to achieve optimization and selection based on polyline characteristics between the fitness values in the population. Experiments show that the MSCOS evaluation effect and optimal selection offer better performance than commonly used algorithms.},

Extracting semantic features from different levels and granularities of text is a basic and key task in multi-label text classification research. A topic model is an effective method for the automatic organization and induction of text information. It can reveal the latent semantics of documents and analyze the topics contained in massive information. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-label text classification method based on tALBERT-CNN: an LDA topic model and ALBERT model are used to obtain the topic vector and semantic context vector of each word (document), a certain fusion mechanism is adopted to obtain in-depth topic and semantic representations of the document, and the multi-label features of the text are extracted through the TextCNN model to train a multi-label classifier. The experimental results obtained on standard datasets show that the proposed method can extract multi-label features from documents, and its performance is better than that of the existing state-of-the-art multi-label text classification algorithms.},
