  abstract     = {Natural phenomena can be quantitatively described by means of mathematics, which is actually the only way of doing so. Physics is a convincing example of the mathematization of nature. This paper gives an answer to the question of how mathematization of nature is done and illustrates the answer. Here nature is to be taken in a wide sense, being a substantial object of study in, among others, large domains of biology, such as epidemiology and neurobiology, chemistry, and physics, the most outspoken example. It is argued that mathematization of natural phenomena needs appropriate core concepts that are intimately connected with the phenomena one wants to describe and explain mathematically. Second, there is a scale on and not beyond which a specific description holds. Different scales allow for different conceptual and mathematical descriptions. This is the scaling hypothesis, which has meanwhile been confirmed on many occasions. Furthermore, a mathematical description can, as in physics, but need not be universally valid, as in biology. Finally, the history of science shows that only an intensive gauging of theory, i.e., mathematical description, by experiment leads to progress. That is, appropriate core concepts and appropriate scales are a necessary condition for mathematizing nature, and so is its verification by experiment.},

As such, they embraced nonlinear dynamics, but in an interpretable form. Most importantly, it was the first mathematical formulation to emphasize the significance of interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neural populations, thereby incorporating both cooperation and competition. Subsequent research by many has documented the Wilson–Cowan significance in such diverse fields as visual hallucinations, memory, binocular rivalry, and epilepsy. The fact that these equations are still being used to elucidate a wide range of phenomena attests to their validity as a dynamical approximation to more detailed descriptions of complex neural computations.},

  abstract     = {In so-called interactive biorobotics, robotic models of living systems interact with animals in controlled experimental settings. By observing how the focal animal reacts to the stimuli delivered by the robot, one tests hypotheses concerning the determinants of animal behaviour in social contexts. Building on previous methodological reconstructions of interactive biorobotics, this article reflects on the claim, made by several authors in the field, that this strategy may enable one to explain social phenomena in animals. The answer offered here will be negative: interactive biorobotics does not contribute to the explanation of social phenomena. However, it may greatly contribute to the study of animal behaviour by creating social phenomena in the sense discussed by Ian Hacking, i.e. by precisely defining new phenomena to be explained. It will be also suggested that interactive biorobotics can be combined with more classical robot-based approaches to the study of living systems, leading to a so-called simulation-interactive strategy for the mechanistic explanation of social behaviour in animals.},

  abstract     = {Facing the threat of rapidly worsening water quality, there is an urgent need to develop novel approaches of monitoring its global supplies and early detection of environmental fluctuations. Global warming, urban growth and other factors have threatened not only the freshwater supply but also the well-being of many species inhabiting it. Traditionally, laboratory-based studies can be both time and money consuming and so, the development of a real-time, continuous monitoring method has proven necessary. The use of autonomous, self-actualizing entities became an efficient way of monitoring the environment. The Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC) will be investigated as an alternative energy source to allow for these entities to self-actualize. This concept has been improved with the use of various lifeforms in the role of biosensors in a structure called ”biohybrid” which we aim to develop further within the framework of project Robocoenosis relying on animal-robot interaction. We introduce a novel concept of a fully autonomous biohybrid agent with various lifeforms in the role of biosensors. Herein, we identify most promising organisms in the context of underwater robotics, among others Dreissena polymorpha, Anodonta cygnaea, Daphnia sp. and various algae. Special focus is placed on the ”ecosystem hacking” based on their interaction with the electronic parts. This project uses Austrian lakes of various trophic levels (Millstättersee, Hallstättersee and Neusiedlersee) as case studies and as a ”proof of concept”.},

  abstract     = {African weakly electric fish communicate at night by constantly emitting and perceiving brief electrical signals (electric organ discharges, EOD) at variable inter-discharge intervals (IDI). While the waveform of single EODs contains information about the sender’s identity, the variable IDI patterns convey information about its current motivational and behavioural state. Pairs of fish can synchronize their EODs to each other via echo responses, and we have previously formulated a ‘social attention hypothesis’ stating that fish use echo responses to address specific individuals and establish brief dyadic communication frameworks within a group. Here, we employed a mobile fish robot to investigate the behaviour of small groups of up to four Mormyrus rume and characterized the social situations during which synchronizations occurred. An EOD-emitting robot reliably evoked social following behaviour, which was strongest in smaller groups and declined with increasing group size. We did not find significant differences in motor behaviour of M. rume with either an interactive playback (echo response) or a random control playback by the robot. Still, the robot reliably elicited mutual synchronizations with other fish. Synchronizations mostly occurred during relatively close social interactions, usually when the fish that initiated synchronization approached either the robot or another fish from a distance. The results support our social attention hypothesis and suggest that electric signal synchronization might facilitate the exchange of social information during a wide range of social behaviours from aggressive territorial displays to shoaling and even cooperative hunting in some mormyrids.},

This paper asks whether the use of a robotic facsimile representing an archerfish can elicit a social response if it approximates an archerfish’s appearance, along with key features of its hunting behavior. We found that the fish respond to the robot when it hunted, as indicated by decreasing distances between the robot and fish (and among the fish) during the robot’s hunting behavior sequence, as well as higher net transfer entropy when the robot was hunting. These effects were present even when the robot’s “hunt” was unproductive and did not result in food. The temporal pattern of fish approach to the robot and each other indicated that the segment of robot hunting behavior proximal to the robotic facsimile shot elicited fish behavior initially. However, earlier cues in the robot’s hunting sequence became important following more experience with a food contingency. This indicates that further studies could use a robotic facsimile to conduct a detailed stimulus analysis, changing aspects of the robot’s appearance and behavior to uncover the basic mechanisms of information transfer among individuals in a social hunting scenario.},

  abstract     = {Soon after hatching, the young of precocial species, such as domestic chicks or ducklings, learn to recognize their social partner by simply being exposed to it (imprinting process). Even artificial objects or stimuli displayed on monitor screens can effectively trigger filial imprinting, though learning is canalized by spontaneous preferences for animacy signals, such as certain kinds of motion or a face-like appearance. Imprinting is used as a behavioural paradigm for studies on memory formation, early learning and predispositions, as well as number and space cognition, and brain asymmetries. Here, we present an automatized setup to expose and/or test animals for a variety of imprinting experiments. The setup consists of a cage with two high-frequency screens at the opposite ends where stimuli are shown. Provided with a camera covering the whole space of the cage, the behaviour of the animal is recorded continuously. A graphic user interface implemented in Matlab allows a custom configuration of the experimental protocol, that together with Psychtoolbox drives the presentation of images on the screens, with accurate time scheduling and a highly precise framerate. The setup can be implemented into a complete workflow to analyse behaviour in a fully automatized way by combining Matlab (and Psychtoolbox) to control the monitor screens and stimuli, DeepLabCut to track animals’ behaviour, Python (and R) to extract data and perform statistical analyses. The automated setup allows neuro-behavioural scientists to perform standardized protocols during their experiments, with faster data collection and analyses, and reproducible results.},

  abstract     = {Pathogen transmission is a major limit of social species. Social distancing, a behavioural-based response to diseases, has been regularly reported in nature. However, the identification of distinctive stimuli associated with an infectious disease represents a challenging task for host species, whose cognitive mechanisms are still poorly understood. Herein, the social fish Paracheirodon innesi, was selected as model organism to investigate animal abilities in exploiting visual information to identify and promote social distancing towards potentially infected conspecifics. To address this, a robotic fish replica mimicking a healthy P. innesi subject, and another mimicking P. innesi with morphological and/or locomotion anomalies were developed. P. innesi individuals were attracted by the healthy fish replica, while they avoided the fish replica with morphological abnormalities, as well as the fish replica with an intact appearance, but performing locomotion anomalies (both symptoms associated with a microsporidian parasite infesting P. innesi and other fish). Furthermore, the fish replica presenting both morphology and locomotion anomalies in conjunction, triggered a significantly stronger social distancing response. This confirms the hypothesis that group living animals overgeneralize cues that can be related with a disease to minimize transmission, and highlights the important role of visual cues in infection risk contexts. This study prompts more attention on the role of behavioural-based strategies to avoid pathogen/parasite diffusion, and can be used to optimize computational approaches to model disease dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Noise in spiking neurons is commonly modeled by a noisy input current or by generating output spikes stochastically with a voltage-dependent hazard rate (“escape noise”). While input noise lends itself to modeling biophysical noise processes, the phenomenological escape noise is mathematically more tractable. Using the level-crossing theory for differentiable Gaussian processes, we derive an approximate mapping between colored input noise and escape noise in leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This mapping requires the first-passage-time (FPT) density of an overdamped Brownian particle driven by colored noise with respect to an arbitrarily moving boundary. Starting from the Wiener–Rice series for the FPT density, we apply the second-order decoupling approximation of Stratonovich to the case of moving boundaries and derive a simplified hazard-rate representation that is local in time and numerically efficient. This simplification requires the calculation of the non-stationary auto-correlation function of the level-crossing process: For exponentially correlated input noise (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process), we obtain an exact formula for the zero-lag auto-correlation as a function of noise parameters, mean membrane potential and its speed, as well as an exponential approximation of the full auto-correlation function. The theory well predicts the FPT and interspike interval densities as well as the population activities obtained from simulations with colored input noise and time-dependent stimulus or boundary. The agreement with simulations is strongly enhanced across the sub- and suprathreshold firing regime compared to a first-order decoupling approximation that neglects correlations between level crossings. The second-order approximation also improves upon a previously proposed theory in the subthreshold regime. Depending on a simplicity-accuracy trade-off, all considered approximations represent useful mappings from colored input noise to escape noise, enabling progress in the theory of neuronal population dynamics.},

We describe a direct constructive method of realising finite state input-dependent computations on an arbitrary directed graph. The constructed system has an excitable network attractor whose dynamics we illustrate with a number of examples. The resulting CTRNN has intermittent dynamics: trajectories spend long periods of time close to steady-state, with rapid transitions between states. Depending on parameters, transitions between states can either be excitable (inputs or noise needs to exceed a threshold to induce the transition), or spontaneous (transitions occur without input or noise). In the excitable case, we show the threshold for excitability can be made arbitrarily sensitive.},

  abstract     = {Neural circuits contain a wide variety of interneuron types, which differ in their biophysical properties and connectivity patterns. The two most common interneuron types, parvalbumin-expressing and somatostatin-expressing cells, have been shown to be differentially involved in many cognitive functions. These cell types also show different relationships with the power and phase of oscillations in local field potentials. The mechanisms that underlie the emergence of different oscillatory rhythms in neural circuits with more than one interneuron subtype, and the roles specific interneurons play in those mechanisms, are not fully understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of all possible circuit motifs and input regimes that can be achieved in circuits comprised of excitatory cells, PV-like fast-spiking interneurons and SOM-like low-threshold spiking interneurons. We identify 18 unique motifs and simulate their dynamics over a range of input strengths. Using several characteristics, such as oscillation frequency, firing rates, phase of firing and burst fraction, we cluster the resulting circuit dynamics across motifs in order to identify patterns of activity and compare these patterns to behaviors that were generated in circuits with one interneuron type. In addition to the well-known PING and ING gamma oscillations and an asynchronous state, our analysis identified three oscillatory behaviors that were generated by the three-cell-type motifs only: theta-nested gamma oscillations, stable beta oscillations and theta-locked bursting behavior, which have also been observed in experiments. Our characterization provides a map to interpret experimental activity patterns and suggests pharmacological manipulations or optogenetics approaches to validate these conclusions.},

  abstract     = {Skilled interception behavior often relies on accurate predictions of external objects because of a large delay in our sensorimotor systems. To deal with the sensorimotor delay, the brain predicts future states of the target based on the current state available, but it is still debated whether internal representations acquired from prior experience are used as well. Here we estimated the predictive manner by analyzing the response behavior of a pursuer to a sudden directional change of the evasive target, providing strong evidence that prediction of target motion by the pursuer was incompatible with a linear extrapolation based solely on the current state of the target. Moreover, using neural network models, we validated that nonlinear extrapolation as estimated was computationally feasible and useful even against unknown opponents. These results support the use of internal representations in predicting target motion, suggesting the usefulness and versatility of predicting external object motion through internal representations.},

  abstract     = {The ability of neural systems to turn transient inputs into persistent changes in activity is thought to be a fundamental requirement for higher cognitive functions. In continuous attractor networks frequently used to model working memory or decision making tasks, the persistent activity settles to a stable pattern with the stereotyped shape of a “bump” independent of integration time or input strength. Here, we investigate a new bump attractor model in which the bump width and amplitude not only reflect qualitative and quantitative characteristics of a preceding input but also the continuous integration of evidence over longer timescales. The model is formalized by two coupled dynamic field equations of Amari-type which combine recurrent interactions mediated by a Mexican-hat connectivity with local feedback mechanisms that balance excitation and inhibition. We analyze the existence, stability and bifurcation structure of single and multi-bump solutions and discuss the relevance of their input dependence to modeling cognitive functions. We then systematically compare the pattern formation process of the two-field model with the classical Amari model. The results reveal that the balanced local feedback mechanisms facilitate the encoding and maintenance of multi-item memories. The existence of stable subthreshold bumps suggests that different to the Amari model, the suppression effect of neighboring bumps in the range of lateral competition may not lead to a complete loss of information. Moreover, bumps with larger amplitude are less vulnerable to noise-induced drifts and distance-dependent interaction effects resulting in more faithful memory representations over time.},

  abstract     = {In several papers published in Biological Cybernetics in the 1980s and 1990s, Kawato and colleagues proposed computational models explaining how internal models are acquired in the cerebellum. These models were later supported by neurophysiological experiments using monkeys and neuroimaging experiments involving humans. These early studies influenced neuroscience from basic, sensory-motor control to higher cognitive functions. One of the most perplexing enigmas related to internal models is to understand the neural mechanisms that enable animals to learn large-dimensional problems with so few trials. Consciousness and metacognition—the ability to monitor one’s own thoughts, may be part of the solution to this enigma. Based on literature reviews of the past 20 years, here we propose a computational neuroscience model of metacognition. The model comprises a modular hierarchical reinforcement-learning architecture of parallel and layered, generative-inverse model pairs. In the prefrontal cortex, a distributed executive network called the “cognitive reality monitoring network” (CRMN) orchestrates conscious involvement of generative-inverse model pairs in perception and action. Based on mismatches between computations by generative and inverse models, as well as reward prediction errors, CRMN computes a “responsibility signal” that gates selection and learning of pairs in perception, action, and reinforcement learning. A high responsibility signal is given to the pairs that best capture the external world, that are competent in movements (small mismatch), and that are capable of reinforcement learning (small reward-prediction error). CRMN selects pairs with higher responsibility signals as objects of metacognition, and consciousness is determined by the entropy of responsibility signals across all pairs. This model could lead to new-generation AI, which exhibits metacognition, consciousness, dimension reduction, selection of modules and corresponding representations, and learning from small samples. It may also lead to the development of a new scientific paradigm that enables the causal study of consciousness by combining CRMN and decoded neurofeedback.},

Developing a physiologically motivated computational model of a neural controller with good performance is a central component for a large range of potential applications, such as the development of therapeutic and assistive devices, diagnosis of balance disorders, and designing robotic control systems. In this paper, we characterize the biomechanics of postural control system by considering the musculoskeletal dynamics in the sagittal plane, proprioceptive feedback, and a neural controller. The model includes several physiological structures, such as the feedforward and feedback mechanism, sensory noise, and proprioceptive feedback delays. A high-gain observer (HGO)-based feedback linearization controller represents the CNS analog in the modeling paradigm. The HGO gives an estimation of delayed states and the feedback linearization control law generates the feedback torques at joints to execute postural recovery movements. The whole scheme is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme is robust against larger perturbations, sensory noises, feedback delays and retains a strong disturbance rejection and trajectory tracking capability. Overall, these results demonstrate that the nonlinear system dynamics, the feedforward and feedback mechanism, and physiological latencies play a key role in shaping the motor control process.},

Reduced order models enable modeling of a biological system at different levels of complexity and the quantitative analysis of its properties, like sensitivity to parameter variations and resilience to exogenous perturbations. However, available model reduction methods often fail to capture a diverse range of nonlinear behaviors observed in biology, such as multistability and limit cycle oscillations. The paper addresses this need using differential analysis. This approach leads to a nonlinear enhancement of classical balanced truncation for biological systems whose behavior is not restricted to the stability of a single equilibrium. Numerical results suggest that the proposed framework may be relevant to the approximation of classical models of biological systems.},

  abstract     = {When learning a movement based on binary success information, one is more variable following failure than following success. Theoretically, the additional variability post-failure might reflect exploration of possibilities to obtain success. When average behavior is changing (as in learning), variability can be estimated from differences between subsequent movements. Can one estimate exploration reliably from such trial-to-trial changes when studying reward-based motor learning? To answer this question, we tried to reconstruct the exploration underlying learning as described by four existing reward-based motor learning models. We simulated learning for various learner and task characteristics. If we simply determined the additional change post-failure, estimates of exploration were sensitive to learner and task characteristics. We identified two pitfalls in quantifying exploration based on trial-to-trial changes. Firstly, performance-dependent feedback can cause correlated samples of motor noise and exploration on successful trials, which biases exploration estimates. Secondly, the trial relative to which trial-to-trial change is calculated may also contain exploration, which causes underestimation. As a solution, we developed the additional trial-to-trial change (ATTC) method. By moving the reference trial one trial back and subtracting trial-to-trial changes following specific sequences of trial outcomes, exploration can be estimated reliably for the three models that explore based on the outcome of only the previous trial. Since ATTC estimates are based on a selection of trial sequences, this method requires many trials. In conclusion, if exploration is a binary function of previous trial outcome, the ATTC method allows for a model-free quantification of exploration.},

We illustrate our results with a mechanical analogue. We use our analytic results to predict behaviours in arbitrary parameter regimes and show how this led us to explain and extend recent numerical continuation results of the full HKB model. The key finding is that the HKB model contains a significant amount of behaviour in biologically relevant parameter regimes not yet observed in experiments or numerical simulations. This observation has implications for the development of virtual partner interaction and the human dynamic clamp, and potentially for the HKB model itself.},

  abstract     = {Molecular fluctuations can lead to macroscopically observable effects. The random gating of ion channels in the membrane of a nerve cell provides an important example. The contributions of independent noise sources to the variability of action potential timing have not previously been studied at the level of molecular transitions within a conductance-based model ion-state graph. Here we study a stochastic Langevin model for the Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) system based on a detailed representation of the underlying channel state Markov process, the “ $$14\times 28$$ D model” introduced in (Pu and Thomas in Neural Computation 32(10):1775–1835, 2020). We show how to resolve the individual contributions that each transition in the ion channel graph makes to the variance of the interspike interval (ISI). We extend the mean return time (MRT) phase reduction developed in (Cao et al. in SIAM J Appl Math 80(1):422–447, 2020) to the second moment of the return time from an MRT isochron to itself. Because fixed-voltage spike detection triggers do not correspond to MRT isochrons, the inter-phase interval (IPI) variance only approximates the ISI variance. We find the IPI variance and ISI variance agree to within a few percent when both can be computed. Moreover, we prove rigorously, and show numerically, that our expression for the IPI variance is accurate in the small noise (large system size) regime; our theory is exact in the limit of small noise. By selectively including the noise associated with only those few transitions responsible for most of the ISI variance, our analysis extends the stochastic shielding (SS) paradigm (Schmandt and Galán in Phys Rev Lett 109(11):118101, 2012) from the stationary voltage clamp case to the current clamp case. We show numerically that the SS approximation has a high degree of accuracy even for larger, physiologically relevant noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that the ISI variance is not an unambiguously defined quantity, but depends on the choice of voltage level set as the spike detection threshold. We find a small but significant increase in ISI variance, the higher the spike detection voltage, both for simulated stochastic HH data and for voltage traces recorded in in vitro experiments. In contrast, the IPI variance is invariant with respect to the choice of isochron used as a trigger for counting “spikes.”},

  abstract     = {Detection of looming obstacles is a vital task for both natural and artificial systems. Locusts possess a visual nervous system with an extensively studied obstacle detection pathway, culminating in the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron. While numerous models of this system exist, none to date have incorporated recent data on the anatomy and function of feedforward and global inhibitory systems in the input network of the LGMD. Moreover, the possibility that global and lateral inhibition shape the feedforward inhibitory signals to the LGMD has not been investigated. To address these points, a novel model of feedforward inhibitory neurons in the locust optic lobe was developed based on the recent literature. This model also incorporated global and lateral inhibition into the afferent network of these neurons, based on their observed behaviour in existing data and the posited role of these mechanisms in the inputs to the LGMD. Tests with the model showed that it accurately replicates the behaviour of feedforward inhibitory neurons in locusts; the model accurately coded for stimulus angular size in an overall linear fashion, with decreasing response saturation and increasing linearity as stimulus size increased or approach velocity decreased. The model also exhibited only phasic responses to the appearance of a grating, along with sustained movement by it at constant speed. By observing the effects of altering inhibition schemes on these responses, it was determined that global inhibition serves primarily to normalize growing excitation as collision approaches, and keeps coding for subtense angle linear. Lateral inhibition was determined to suppress tonic responses to wide-field stimuli translating at constant speed. Based on these features being shared with characterizations of the LGMD input network, it was hypothesized that the feedforward inhibitory neurons and the LGMD share the same excitatory afferents; this necessitates further investigation.},

  abstract     = {Modulation of the firing times of neural oscillators has long been an important control objective, with applications including Parkinson’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome, epilepsy, and learning. One common goal for such modulation is desynchronization, wherein two or more oscillators are stimulated to transition from firing in phase with each other to firing out of phase. The optimization of such stimuli has been well studied, but this typically relies on either a reduction of the dimensionality of the system or complete knowledge of the parameters and state of the system. This limits the applicability of results to real problems in neural control. Here, we present a trained artificial neural network capable of accurately estimating the effects of square-wave stimuli on neurons using minimal output information from the neuron. We then apply the results of this network to solve several related control problems in desynchronization, including desynchronizing pairs of neurons and achieving clustered subpopulations of neurons in the presence of coupling and noise.},

Human balance perception is evaluated by the subjective upright posture, the posture at which a person does not feel he/she is at an incline. Our balance experiments in the seated posture showed that the subjective upright posture changed after the balancing task where the participants needed to incline to maintain their balance. This paper aimed to explain this adaptive phenomenon by reproducing the experimental results using computer simulations. Hypothesizing that “humans gradually come to recognize the posture they need to take to maintain their balance as being upright,” an adaptation rule for subjective upright posture is defined, so that it approaches the averaged posture in the period of the balancing task. For the balance control, center of pressure feedback is adopted. As a result, the similar changes in subjective upright posture are simulated with a two-link model with a base link, implying that our hypothesis is one possible explanation on the mechanism for human balance control and perception.},

  abstract     = {The inhomogeneous Poisson point process is a common model for time series of discrete, stochastic events. When an event from a point process is detected, it may trigger a random dead time in the detector, during which subsequent events will fail to be detected. It can be difficult or impossible to obtain a closed-form expression for the distribution of intervals between detections, even when the rate function (often referred to as the intensity function) and the dead-time distribution are given. Here, a method is presented to numerically compute the interval distribution expected for any arbitrary inhomogeneous Poisson point process modified by dead times drawn from any arbitrary distribution. In neuroscience, such a point process is used to model trains of neuronal spikes triggered by the detection of excitatory events while the neuron is not refractory. The assumptions of the method are that the process is observed over a finite observation window and that the detector is not in a dead state at the start of the observation window. Simulations are used to verify the method for several example point processes. The method should be useful for modeling and understanding the relationships between the rate functions and interval distributions of the event and detection processes, and how these relationships depend on the dead-time distribution.},

However, the primate visual system contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism’s performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic post-synaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.},

Our CPG comprises a half-center oscillator with conductance-based Morris–Lecar model neurons. Output from the CPG drives a push–pull motor system with biomechanics based on experimental data. A sensory feedback conductance from the muscles allows modulation of the CPG activity. We consider parameters under which the isolated CPG system has either “escape” or “release” dynamics, and we study both inhibitory and excitatory feedback conductances. We find that increasing the FB conductance relative to the CPG conductance makes the system more robust against external perturbations, but more susceptible to internal noise. Conversely, increasing the CPG conductance relative to the FB conductance has the opposite effects. We find that the “closed-loop” system, with sensory feedback in place, exhibits a richer repertoire of behaviors than the “open-loop” system, with motion determined entirely by the CPG dynamics. Moreover, we find that purely feedback-driven motor patterns, analogous to a chain reflex, occur only in the inhibition-mediated system. Finally, for pattern generation systems with inhibition-mediated sensory feedback, we find that the distinction between escape- and release-mediated CPG mechanisms is diminished in the presence of internal noise. Our observations support an anti-reductionist view of neuromotor physiology: Understanding mechanisms of robust motor control requires studying not only the central pattern generator circuit in isolation, but the intact closed-loop system as a whole.},

One avenue that has been proposed to change this is to strengthen the interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) research and neuroscience. Since their historical beginnings, ANNs and AI, in general, have developed in close alignment with both neuroscience and psychology. In addition to deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) is another approach that is strongly linked to AI and neuroscience to understand how learning is implemented in the brain. In a recently published article, Botvinick et al. (Neuron, 107:603–616, 2020) explain why deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is important for neuroscience as a framework to study learning, representations and decision making. Here, I summarise Botvinick et al.’s main arguments and frame them in the context of the study of learning, memory and spatial navigation. I believe that applying this approach to study spatial navigation can provide useful insights for the understanding of how the brain builds, processes and stores representations of the outside world to extract knowledge.},

When self-consistency is imposed, it is found that broad distributions of synaptic strength are a necessary concomitant of the known massive convergence of inputs to individual neurons, and observed widths of lognormal distributions of synaptic strength and firing rate are explained provided the brain is in a near-critical state, consistent with independent observations. The strongest individual synapses are shown to have an effect on soma voltage comparable to the effect of all others combined, which supports suggestions that they may have a key role in neural communication. Remarkably, inclusion of moderate randomness in characteristic axonal ranges is shown to account for the observed $$\sim 10^3$$ -fold variability in two-point connectivity at a given separation and $$\sim 10^5$$ -fold overall when the known mean exponential fall-off is included, consistent with observed near-lognormal distributions.

  abstract     = {All organisms must be able to adapt to changes in the environment. To this end, they have developed sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to ensure homeostasis. Control engineers, who must design similar regulatory systems, have developed a number of general principles that govern feedback regulation. These lead to constraints which impose trade-offs that arise when developing controllers to minimize the effect of external disturbances on systems. Here, we review some of these trade-offs, particularly Bode’s integral formula. We also highlight its connection to information theory, by showing that the constraints in sensitivity minimization can be cast as limitations on the information transmission through a system, and these have their root in causality. Finally, we look at how these constraints arise in two biological systems: glycolytic oscillations and the energy cost of perfect adaptation in a bacterial chemotactic pathway.},

  abstract     = {The free energy principle (FEP) in the neurosciences stipulates that all viable agents induce and minimize informational free energy in the brain to fit their environmental niche. In this study, we continue our effort to make the FEP a more physically principled formalism by implementing free energy minimization based on the principle of least action. We build a Bayesian mechanics (BM) by casting the formulation reported in the earlier publication (Kim in Neural Comput 30:2616–2659, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01115 ) to considering active inference beyond passive perception. The BM is a neural implementation of variational Bayes under the FEP in continuous time. The resulting BM is provided as an effective Hamilton’s equation of motion and subject to the control signal arising from the brain’s prediction errors at the proprioceptive level. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we adopt a simple agent-based model and present a concrete numerical illustration of the brain performing recognition dynamics by integrating BM in neural phase space. Furthermore, we recapitulate the major theoretical architectures in the FEP by comparing our approach with the common state-space formulations.},

  abstract     = {Trial-to-trial variability during visuomotor adaptation is usually explained as the result of two different sources, planning noise and execution noise. The estimation of the underlying variance parameters from observations involving varying feedback conditions cannot be achieved by standard techniques (Kalman filter) because they do not account for recursive noise propagation in a closed-loop system. We therefore developed a method to compute the exact likelihood of the output of a time-discrete and linear adaptation system as has been used to model visuomotor adaptation (Smith et al. in PLoS Biol 4(6):e179, 2006), observed under closed-loop and error-clamp conditions. We identified the variance parameters by maximizing this likelihood and compared the model prediction of the time course of variance and autocovariance with empiric data. The observed increase in variability during the early training phase could not be explained by planning noise and execution noise with constant variances. Extending the model by signal-dependent components of either execution noise or planning noise showed that the observed temporal changes of the trial-to-trial variability can be modeled by signal-dependent planning noise rather than signal-dependent execution noise. Comparing the variance time course between different training schedules showed that the signal-dependent increase of planning variance was specific for the fast adapting mechanism, whereas the assumption of constant planning variance was sufficient for the slow adapting mechanisms.},

We start with an analysis of a model for single-frequency networks previously shown to learn and memorize phase differences between component oscillators. We then study a model for gradient frequency neural networks (GrFNNs) which extends the single-frequency model by introducing frequency detuning and nonlinear coupling terms for multifrequency interactions. Our analysis focuses on models of two coupled oscillators and examines the dynamics of steady-state behaviors in multiple parameter regimes available to the models. We find that the model for two distinct frequencies shares essential dynamical properties with the single-frequency model and that Hebbian learning results in stronger connections for simple frequency ratios than for complex ratios. We then compare the analysis of the two-frequency model with numerical simulations of the GrFNN model and show that Hebbian plasticity in the latter is locally dominated by a nonlinear resonance captured by the two-frequency model.},

  abstract     = {A key problem for biological motor control is to establish a link between an idea of a movement and the generation of a set of muscle-stimulating signals that lead to the movement execution. The number of signals to generate is thereby larger than the body’s mechanical degrees of freedom in which the idea of the movement may be easily expressed, as the movement is actually executed in this space. A mathematical formulation that provides a solving link is presented in this paper in the form of a layered, hierarchical control architecture. It is meant to synthesise a wide range of complex three-dimensional muscle-driven movements. The control architecture consists of a ‘conceptional layer’, where the movement is planned, a ‘structural layer’, where the muscles are stimulated, and between both an additional ‘transformational layer’, where the muscle-joint redundancy is resolved. We demonstrate the operativeness by simulating human stance and squatting in a three-dimensional digital human model (DHM). The DHM considers 20 angular DoFs and 36 Hill-type muscle–tendon units (MTUs) and is exposed to gravity, while its feet contact the ground via reversible stick–slip interactions. The control architecture continuously stimulates all MTUs (‘structural layer’) based on a high-level, torque-based task formulation within its ‘conceptional layer’. Desired states of joint angles (postural plan) are fed to two mid-level joint controllers in the ‘transformational layer’. The ‘transformational layer’ communicates with the biophysical structures in the ‘structural layer’ by providing direct MTU stimulation contributions and further input signals for low-level MTU controllers. Thereby, the redundancy of the MTU stimulations with respect to the joint angles is resolved, i.e. a link between plan and execution is established, by exploiting some properties of the biophysical structures modelled. The resulting joint torques generated by the MTUs via their moment arms are fed back to the conceptional layer, closing the high-level control loop. Within our mathematical formulations of the Jacobian matrix-based layer transformations, we identify the crucial information for the redundancy solution to be the muscle moment arms, the stiffness relations of muscle and tendon tissue within the muscle model, and the length–stimulation relation of the muscle activation dynamics. The present control architecture allows the straightforward feeding of conceptional movement task formulations to MTUs. With this approach, the problem of movement planning is eased, as solely the mechanical system has to be considered in the conceptional plan.},
