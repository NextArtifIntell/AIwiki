  abstract     = {This paper proposes an optimal control design framework for hybrid nonlinear time-dependent dynamical systems involving an interacting mixture of continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics. Aiming to extend hybrid linear optimal control synthesis to nonlinear non-quadratic formulation, a hybrid version of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation with time-dependency is first presented. A hybrid computational framework, which alternates between continuous-time and discrete-time subsystems at an appropriate sequence of time instants, is then developed to solve the resultant set of the HJB equations in an interacting manner. The proposed control scheme is subsequently applied to spacecraft formation flying establishment with a hybrid source of actuation, namely Lorentz force and impulsive thrusting. By optimal combination of the Lorentz force and impulsive thrusting proposed in this paper, not only are the uncontrollability issues pertinent inherently to the Lorentz-actuated control systems effectively resolved, but use of both Lorentz and impulsive control inputs is also optimized. As a consequence, the expendable chemical fuels required to actuate thrusters are significantly reduced, thereby extending the duration of such space missions.},

The UAVs are subject to minimum and maximum speed, maximum angular rate constraints, as well as inter-vehicle safety requirements and no-fly-zones. The problem is formulated as a continuous time nonlinear optimal control problem. This problem is first simplified by using a sequential approach, which significantly reduces its complexity. Then, by defining the desired trajectories to be tracked by the UAVs as Bernstein polynomials, it is transcribed into a nonlinear optimization problem. It is shown through numerical simulations that the present approach is computationally efficient, and thus it is well suited for trajectory planning/re-planning to monitor a target of unknown speed, heading direction and unexpected detours. Moreover, the proposed method guarantees satisfaction of feasibility and safety constraints for the whole planning time period, rather than only at discrete time points.},

Applications are also represented by the graph of Computational Units they require for execution. The problem is then to decide how to allocate Computational Units to applications to guarantee execution of a safety-critical application. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with the form of an Integer Linear Program. A state-of-the-art solver is then used to solve the problem. Decentralizing the allocation process is achieved through redundancy of the allocator executed on the architecture. No centralized element decides on the allocation of the entire architecture, thus improving the reliability of the system. Inspired by multi-core architectures in avionics systems, an experimental illustration of the work is also presented. It is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed allocation process to maintain the operation of a physical system in a decentralized way while individual components fail.},

The objective is to create a mixed-integer linear model that would be competitive in speed and in its closeness to reality against a current model using simulated annealing, while trying to improve both models. Each satellite has the choice between a number of possible events, each event having a utility and a cost, and the chosen schedule must take into account numerous time-related constraints. The main difficulties appeared in modeling realistically a battery level and in handling infeasible configurations due to inaccurate parameters. The obtained linear model has enabled a better understanding of the performance of the simulated annealing solver, and could also be adapted to different real-world scheduling problems.},

The proposed technique greatly diminishes the impact of uncertainties in the system parameters and the initial condition of the state. In this design, a much lesser number of free variables is used in the process than the existing unscented optimal control methods. As the optimization problem eventually leads to the optimal selection of coefficients of the basis functions, the overall dimension of the optimization process is significantly reduced. The significance of the proposed technique is demonstrated by successfully solving the soft-landing problem on asteroid Vesta.

The proposed strategy involves translation of the infinite horizon nonlinear optimal control problem into a Diagonal stability problem, followed by the formulation of a set of criteria for the synthesis of a stabilizing feedback control law. Hence, the proposed controller design methodology is refered to as inverse optimal control via diagonal stabilization. Besides providing a closed-form solution, the methodology also possesses the added advantage of inherent robustness, on account of adequate stability margins. Most importantly, the methodology ensures an estimate of the associated domain of attraction, which is a highly desirable feature especially in the case of crucial and stringent aerospace applications. The proposed methodology is applied for the re-entry control of a reusable launch vehicle which provides a full envelope optimality-based design philosophy. For this, the control-oriented attitude model based on the three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is utilized. The resulting control law possess desirable features of guaranteed estimate of stability domain, assured design flexibility, and inherent robustness. Simulation results verify the validity of these theoretically proven facets in terms of the efficacy and robustness of the proposed controller.},

Attitude is represented on the group of three dimensional rotations. The angular velocity is expressed as weighted sum of some basis functions, and the weights are obtained by solving a constrained minimization problem in which the objective is the maneuvering time. However, the analytic expressions of objective and constraints of this minimization problem are not available. To solve the problem despite this obstacle, we propose to use a derivative-free approach based on sequential penalty. Moreover, to avoid local minima traps during the search, we propose to alternate phases in which two different objective functions are pursued. The control torque derived from the spacecraft inverse dynamics is continuously differentiable and vanishes at its endpoints. Results on practical cases taken from the literature demonstrate advantages over existing approaches.},

The FBL helps in transforming the system model into two decoupled subsystems in Brunovsky’s canonical form to reduce the computational complexities. Minimum control effort and constraint satisfaction are guaranteed by ROC while regulating the attitude of the 3-DOF tandem helicopter from a nominal initial condition. The Lyapunov stability theorem is employed for illustrating the stability of the closed-loop system. The robustness analysis gives a measure of perturbation that the designed controller can accommodate. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority over an FBL-based linear quadratic regulator controller. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is substantiated by experimental results.},

Both approaches are based on the extremum seeking perspective, which has previously been reported for real-time optimization problems by exploring sinusoidal excitation signals to estimate the Gradient (first derivative) and Hessian (second derivative) of unknown quadratic functions. In order to compensate distinct delays in the inputs of the players, we have employed predictor feedback. We apply a small-gain analysis as well as averaging theory in infinite dimensions, due to the infinite-dimensional state of the time delays, in order to obtain local convergence results for the unknown quadratic payoffs to a small neighborhood of the Nash equilibrium. We quantify the size of these residual sets and corroborate the theoretical results numerically on an example of a two-player game with delays.},

  abstract     = {Direct optimization of many-revolution spacecraft trajectories is performed using an unconstrained formulation with many short-arc, embedded Lambert problems. Each Lambert problem shares its terminal positions with neighboring segments to implicitly enforce position continuity. Use of embedded boundary value problems (EBVPs) is not new to spacecraft trajectory optimization, including extensive use in primer vector theory, flyby tour design, and direct impulsive maneuver optimization. Several obstacles have prevented their use on problems with more than a few dozen segments, including computationally expensive solvers, lack of fast and accurate partial derivatives, unguaranteed convergence, and a non-smooth solution space. Here, these problems are overcome through the use of short-arc segments and a recently developed Lambert solver, complete with the necessary fast and accurate partial derivatives. These short arcs guarantee existence and uniqueness for the Lambert solutions when transfer angles are limited to less than a half revolution. Furthermore, the use of many short segments simultaneously approximates low-thrust and eliminates the need to specify impulsive maneuver quantity or location. For preliminary trajectory optimization, the EBVP technique is simple to implement, benefiting from an unconstrained formulation, the well-known Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno line search direction, and Cartesian coordinates. Moreover, the technique is naturally parallelizable via the independence of each segment’s EBVP. This new, many-rev EBVP technique is scalable and reliable for trajectories with thousands of segments. Several minimum fuel and energy examples are demonstrated, including a problem with 6143 segments for 256 revolutions, found within 5.5 h on a single processor. Smaller problems with only hundreds of segments take minutes.},

  abstract     = {A new method is developed for solving optimal control problems whose solutions are nonsmooth. The method developed in this paper employs a modified form of the Legendre–Gauss–Radau orthogonal direct collocation method. This modified Legendre–Gauss–Radau method adds two variables and two constraints at the end of a mesh interval when compared with a previously developed standard Legendre–Gauss–Radau collocation method. The two additional variables are the time at the interface between two mesh intervals and the control at the end of each mesh interval. The two additional constraints are a collocation condition for those differential equations that depend upon the control and an inequality constraint on the control at the endpoint of each mesh interval. The additional constraints modify the search space of the nonlinear programming problem such that an accurate approximation to the location of the nonsmoothness is obtained. The transformed adjoint system of the modified Legendre–Gauss–Radau method is then developed. Using this transformed adjoint system, a method is developed to transform the Lagrange multipliers of the nonlinear programming problem to the costate of the optimal control problem. Furthermore, it is shown that the costate estimate satisfies one of the Weierstrass–Erdmann optimality conditions. Finally, the method developed in this paper is demonstrated on an example whose solution is nonsmooth.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of low-thrust trajectories is necessary in the design of space missions using electric propulsion systems. We consider the problem of limited power trajectory optimization, which is a well-known case of the low-thrust optimization problem. In the article, we present an indirect approach to trajectory optimization based on the use of the maximum principle and the continuation method. We introduce the concept of auxiliary longitude and use it as a new independent variable instead of time. The use of equations of motion in the equinoctial elements and a new independent variable allowed us to simplify the optimization of limited power trajectories with a fixed angular distance and free transfer duration. The article presents a new form of necessary optimality conditions for this problem and describes an efficient new numerical method to solve the limited power trajectory optimization problem. We show the existence of several trajectories with a fixed transfer duration and free angular distance that satisfy the necessary optimality conditions. Using numerical examples, we confirm the existence of the limiting values of the characteristic velocity and the product of the cost function value and the transfer duration as the angular distance increases. The high computational performance of the developed technique makes it possible to carry out and present an analysis of the angular flight range and initial true longitude impact on the cost function, transfer duration, and characteristic velocity.},

  abstract     = {The detection of optimal trajectories with multiple coast arcs represents a significant and challenging problem of practical relevance in space mission analysis. Two such types of optimal paths are analyzed in this study: (a) minimum-time low-thrust trajectories with eclipse intervals and (b) minimum-fuel finite-thrust paths. Modified equinoctial elements are used to describe the orbit dynamics. Problem (a) is formulated as a multiple-arc optimization problem, and additional, specific multipoint necessary conditions for optimality are derived. These yield the jump conditions for the costate variables at the transitions from light to shadow (and vice versa). A sequential solution methodology capable of enforcing all the multipoint conditions is proposed and successfully applied in an illustrative numerical example. Unlike several preceding researches, no regularization or averaging is required to make tractable and solve the problem. Moreover, this work revisits problem (b), formulated as a single-arc optimization problem, while emphasizing the substantial analytical differences between minimum-fuel paths and problem (a). This study also proves the existence and provides the derivation of the closed-form expressions for the costate variables (associated with equinoctial elements) along optimal coast arcs.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the sliding mode control approach, a stochastic controller design methodology is developed for discrete-time, vector-state linear systems with additive Cauchy-distributed noises, scalar control inputs, and scalar measurements. The control law exploits the recently derived characteristic function of the conditional probability density function of the system state given the measurements. This result is used to derive the characteristic function of the conditional probability density function of the sliding variable, utilized in the design of the stochastic controller. The incentive for the proposed approach is mainly the high numerical complexity of the currently available method for such systems, that is based on the optimal predictive control paradigm. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated numerically and compared to the alternative Cauchy controller and a controller based on the Gaussian assumption. A fundamental difference between controllers based on the Cauchy and Gaussian assumptions is the superior response of Cauchy controllers to noise outliers. The newly proposed Cauchy controller exhibits similar performance to the optimal predictive controller, while requiring significantly lower computational effort.},

By using robust optimization and a modified $$\varepsilon $$ -constraint scalarization methodology, we first present the relationship between robust $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi solutions of the uncertain optimization problem and that of its corresponding scalar optimization problem. Then, we obtain necessary optimality conditions for robust $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi Pareto efficient solutions of the uncertain optimization problem in terms of a new robust-type subdifferential constraint qualification. We also deduce sufficient optimality conditions for robust $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi Pareto efficient solutions of the uncertain optimization problem under assumptions of generalized convexity. Besides, we introduce a Mixed-type robust $$\varepsilon $$ -multiobjective dual problem (including Wolfe type and Mond-Weir type dual problems as special cases) of the uncertain optimization problem, and explore robust $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi weak, $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi strong, and $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi converse duality properties. Furthermore, we introduce an $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi saddle point for the uncertain optimization problem and investigate the relationships between the $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi saddle point and the robust $$\varepsilon $$ -quasi Pareto efficient solution for the uncertain optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {We propose new mathematical optimization models for generating sparse dynamical graphs, or networks, that can achieve synchronization. The synchronization phenomenon is studied using the Kuramoto model, defined in terms of the adjacency matrix of the graph and the coupling strength of the network, modelling the so-called coupled oscillators. Besides sparsity, we aim to obtain graphs which have good connectivity properties, resulting in small coupling strength for synchronization. We formulate three mathematical optimization models for this purpose. Our first model is a mixed integer optimization problem, subject to ODE constraints, reminiscent of an optimal control problem. As expected, this problem is computationally very challenging, if not impossible, to solve, not only because it involves binary variables but also some of its variables are functions. The second model is a continuous relaxation of the first one, and the third is a discretization of the second, which is computationally tractable by employing standard optimization software. We design dynamical graphs that synchronize, by solving the relaxed problem and applying a practical algorithm for various graph sizes, with randomly generated intrinsic natural frequencies and initial phase variables. We test robustness of these graphs by carrying out numerical simulations with random data and constructing the expected value of the network’s order parameter and its variance under this random data, as a guide for assessment.},

This gives rise to a discrete-time optimal control problem. Then, we derive the gradient formulas of the cost and constraint functions with respect to the decision variables and present a gradient computation procedure. On this basis, a gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed to solve the resulting discrete-time optimal control problem.

We consider several polytopes to model the uncertain energy consumption, and we propose a decomposition approach based on Benders’ combinatorial cuts.

Our progress can be explained by a finer specification of the problem class. The main idea of this approach consists in implementation of the third-order scheme from Nesterov (Math Program 186:157–183, 2021) using the second-order oracle. At each iteration of our method, we solve a nontrivial auxiliary problem by a linearly convergent scheme based on the relative non-degeneracy condition (Bauschke et al. in Math Oper Res 42:330–348, 2016; Lu et al. in SIOPT 28(1):333–354, 2018).

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of sampled-data Nash equilibrium for a general class of differential games with impulse controls. We specialize our results to a scalar linear-quadratic differential game and show that the equilibrium impulse timing can be obtained by determining a fixed point of a Riccati-like system of differential equations with jumps coupled with a system of nonlinear equality constraints. By reformulating the problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, we compute the equilibrium timing, and level of impulses.

We consider an over-relaxation step size in the dual update and provide a detailed proof of the convergence for any step size $$\beta \in (0,2)$$ . We prove the convergence of the sequence generated by the PADMM by showing that it has a finite length and it is Cauchy.

More precisely, we show that if the (KŁ) exponent $$\theta =0$$ , the sequence generated by PADMM converges in a finite numbers of iterations.

The main goal is to find the optimal replenishment and stocking policy in each stage in order to keep the total relevant cost as low as possible, which is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem. Using the alternating minimization method and the optimization theory, we develop a closed-form solution to the optimal inventory model and provide an optimal replenishment strategy to the retailer. Some numerical experiments are made to test the validity of the model and the effect of the involved parameters to the replenishment policy.

In this paper, two accelerated subspace minimization conjugate gradient methods are proposed for unconstrained optimization. Motivated by the subspace minimization conjugate gradient methods and the finite termination of linear conjugate gradient methods, we derive an acceleration parameter by the quadratic interpolation function to improve the stepsize, and the modified stepsize may be more closer to the stepsize obtained by exact line search. Moreover, several specific acceleration criteria to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm are designed. Under standard conditions, the global convergence of the proposed methods can be guaranteed.

At each step, the algorithm alternates between solving a quasi-definite linear system with a constant coefficient matrix and a projection onto convex sets. The low per-iteration computational cost makes the method particularly efficient for large problems, e.g. semidefinite programs that arise in portfolio optimisation, graph theory, and robust control. Moreover, the solver uses chordal decomposition techniques and a new clique merging algorithm to effectively exploit sparsity in large, structured semidefinite programs. Numerical comparisons with other state-of-the-art solvers for a variety of benchmark problems show the effectiveness of our approach. Our Julia implementation is open source, designed to be extended and customised by the user, and is integrated into the Julia optimisation ecosystem.},

Surprisingly, in 2017, Burachik and Martínez-Legaz showed that the well-known Bregman distance is a particular case of a general family of distances, each one induced by a specific maximally monotone operator and a specific choice of one of its representative functions. For the family of generalized Bregman distances, sufficient conditions for convexity, coercivity, and supercoercivity have recently been furnished. Motivated by these advances, we introduce in the present paper the generalized left and right envelopes and proximity operators, and we provide asymptotic results for parameters. Certain results extend readily from the more specific Bregman context, while others only extend for certain generalized cases. To illustrate, we construct examples from the Bregman generalizing case, together with the natural “extreme” cases that highlight the importance of which generalized Bregman distance is chosen.},

We consider the case in which the set-valued objective mapping is identified by a finite number of continuously differentiable selections. The corresponding set optimization problem is then equivalent to find optimistic solutions to vector optimization problems under uncertainty with a finite uncertainty set. We develop optimality conditions for these types of problems and introduce two concepts of critical points. Furthermore, we propose a descent method and provide a convergence result to points satisfying the optimality conditions previously derived. Some numerical examples illustrating the performance of the method are also discussed.

  abstract     = {The present work was primarily motivated by our findings in the literature of some flaws within the proof of the second-order Legendre necessary optimality condition for fractional calculus of variations problems. Therefore, we were eager to elaborate a correct proof and it turns out that this goal is highly nontrivial, especially when considering final constraints. This paper is the result of our reflections on this subject. Precisely, we consider here a constrained minimization problem of a general Bolza functional that depends on a Caputo fractional derivative of order $$0 &lt; \alpha \le 1$$ and on a Riemann–Liouville fractional integral of order $$\beta &gt; 0$$ , the constraint set describing general mixed initial/final constraints. The main contribution of our work is to derive corresponding first- and second-order necessary optimality conditions, namely the Euler–Lagrange equation, the transversality conditions and, of course, the Legendre condition. A detailed discussion is provided on the obstructions encountered with the classical strategy, while the new proof that we propose here is based on the Ekeland variational principle. Furthermore, we underline that some subsidiary contributions are provided all along the paper. In particular, we prove an independent and intrinsic result of fractional calculus stating that it does not exist a nontrivial function which is, together with its Caputo fractional derivative of order $$0&lt; \alpha &lt;1$$ , compactly supported. Moreover, we also discuss some evidences claiming that Riemann–Liouville fractional integrals should be considered in the formulation of fractional calculus of variations problems in order to preserve the existence of solutions.},

Requiring local Lipschitz continuity of the operator, our proposed method improves the value of the extrapolated parameter and admits larger step sizes, which are predicted based a local information of the involved operator and corrected by bounding the distance between each pair of successive iterates. The correction will be implemented when the distance is larger than a given constant and its main cost is to compute a projection onto the feasible set. In particular, when the operator is the gradient of a convex function, the correction step is not necessary.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, large part of the technical knowledge associated with collapses of slabs is based on past failures of bridges, floors, flat roofs and balconies. Collapse mechanisms tend to often differ from each other due to unique features which make it difficult to derive a generalised technique that can predict the right mechanism. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for tackling the problem of detection of collapse mechanisms, which is part of a pseudo-lower bound method for assessing concrete slabs in bridges and buildings. The problem is generalised to a combinatorial one, and the solution is based on a set of well-known combinatorial optimization algorithms. The proposed approach enables an identification of the domain of existence of yield-lines potentially leading to collapse. The output provides an estimation of a hampered domain of feasible yield-lines through which engineers can quickly identify zones of the slab and directions in which yield-lines leading to collapse are more likely to occur. Numerical applications of the algorithm are presented herein.},

The existence, uniqueness, and weak asymptotic convergence of the generated trajectories are discussed. A variable metric forward–backward–half forward dynamical system with the essence of non-self-adjoint linear operators is introduced. The proposed notion, in turn, extends the forward–backward–forward dynamical system and forward–backward dynamical system in the framework of variable metric by relaxing some conditions on the metrics. The distributed dynamical system is further explored to compute a generalized Nash equilibrium in a monotone game as an application. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the convergence of trajectories.},

We find optimized step sizes using our bounds and precisely characterize the computational cost of risk aversion as revealed by the growth in $$\eta $$ . Our proposed algorithm makes a simple modification to a typical primal-dual stochastic subgradient algorithm. With this mild change, our analysis surprisingly obviates the need to impose a priori bounds or complex adaptive bounding schemes for dual variables to execute the algorithm as assumed in many prior works. We also draw interesting parallels in sample complexity with that for chance-constrained programs derived in the literature with a very different solution architecture.},

However, such schemes require two evaluations of the expected mapping at each iteration in general. In this paper, we present several variance-based single-call proximal extragradient algorithms for solving a class of stochastic mixed variational inequalities by aiming at alleviating the cost of an extragradient step. One salient feature of the proposed algorithms is that they require only one evaluation of the expected mapping at each iteration, and hence, the computation load may be significantly reduced. We show that the proposed algorithms can achieve sublinear ergodic convergence rate in terms of the restricted merit function. Furthermore, under the strongly Minty variational inequality condition, we derive some results related to convergence rate of the distance between iterates and solutions, the iteration and oracle complexities for the proposed algorithms when the sample size increases at a geometric or polynomial rate. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms are quite competitive with some existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Pollution management models of Shallow Lake type identify a well-known class of infinite horizon optimal control problems, characterized by the absence of concavity in the state equation and of compactness in the control space. The seminal paper by Mäler et al. (2003) generated a consistent stream of literature over the years, even though existence of solutions to the optimization problem had for long remained an open question. In a recent paper by the author, an optimal policy has been proven to exist, for models describing an endogenous pollution dynamics that decreases globally with the total amount of pollution. The present paper is concerned with the complementary situation, the one in which, mathematically speaking, the velocity field changes its monotonicity with respect to the space variable. For Shallow Lake models, such property corresponds to an hysteresis phenomenon. We prove the existence of an optimum in the same class as in the last-mentioned article, under the assumption that the discount exponent in the objective functional is sufficiently big compared to the spatial derivative of the velocity field. From the methodological viewpoint, this goal requires a significant improvement of the technique introduced to solve the monotonic problem.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a reformulation technique that converts a many-set feasibility problem into an equivalent two-set problem. This technique involves reformulating the original feasibility problem by replacing a pair of its constraint sets with their intersection, before applying Pierra’s classical product space reformulation. The step of combining the two constraint sets reduces the dimension of the product spaces. We refer to this technique as the constraint reduction reformulation and use it to obtain constraint-reduced variants of well-known projection algorithms such as the Douglas–Rachford algorithm and the method of alternating projections, among others. We prove global convergence of constraint-reduced algorithms in the presence of convexity and local convergence in a nonconvex setting. In order to analyze convergence of the constraint-reduced Douglas–Rachford method, we generalize a classical result which guarantees that the composition of two projectors onto subspaces is a projector onto their intersection. Finally, we apply the constraint-reduced versions of Douglas–Rachford and alternating projections to solve the wavelet feasibility problems and then compare their performance with their usual product variants.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in the sensor industry, smart metering systems and communication technology have led to interesting electricity consumption optimization opportunities that contribute to both peak reduction and bill savings and better integration of flexible appliances (including e-mobility). In combination with advanced tariffs, there has been a promising demand side management strategy devised from different perspectives: consumers interested in cost minimization, retailers and grid operators interested in peak minimization or hybrid solutions which reduce the costs to the extent of a certain peak level. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm that is significantly enhanced by a Stackelberg-type dynamic nonzero-sum game in which the consumers optimize and send their 24-h consumption schedules to the electricity retailer and receive the hourly tariff rates until their savings and the Flattening Index are maximized. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the one-iteration optimization is not as rewarding as the proposed game-optimization algorithm and that the results are heavily influenced by the degree of flexibility of the appliances. The algorithm is tested and validated using a large real input dataset, recorded at 15-min interval for a period of one year from a small residential community that consists of 11 modern houses with more than 300 appliances and high flexibility in terms of shifting, and the results highlight the consumers’ gain, FI and peak to average ratio indicators.},

One is a hybrid method combining a Fletcher–Reeves-type method with a Polak–Ribière–Polyak-type method, and the other is a Hager–Zhang-type method, both of which are generalizations of those used in Euclidean space. Moreover, we prove that the hybrid method has a global convergence property under the strong Wolfe conditions and the Hager–Zhang-type method has the sufficient descent property regardless of whether a line search is used or not. Further, we review two kinds of line search algorithm on Riemannian manifolds and numerically compare our generalized methods by solving several Riemannian optimization problems. The results show that the performance of the proposed hybrid methods greatly depends on the type of line search used.

If the weight vector is zero, the wCP reduces to a CP. In this paper, we present a full-Newton step infeasible interior-point method (IIPM) for the special weighted linear complementarity problem over the nonnegative orthant. One iteration of the algorithm consists of one feasibility step followed by a few centering steps. All of them are full-Newton steps, and hence, no calculation of the step size is necessary. The iteration bound of the algorithm is as good as the best-known polynomial complexity of IIPMs for linear optimization.},

The low-cost iteration complexity enjoyed by first-order algorithms renders them particularly relevant for applications in machine learning and large-scale data analysis. Relying on sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, we introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that give increasingly better convergence bounds for higher levels of the hierarchy. Alluding to the power of the SOS hierarchy, we show that the (dual of the) first level corresponds to the performance estimation problem (PEP) introduced by Drori and Teboulle (Math Program 145(1):451–482, 2014), a powerful framework for determining convergence rates of first-order optimization algorithms. Consequently, many results obtained within the PEP framework can be reinterpreted as degree-1 SOS proofs, and thus, the SOS framework provides a promising new approach for certifying improved rates of convergence by means of higher-order SOS certificates. To determine analytical rate bounds, in this work, we use the first level of the SOS hierarchy and derive new results for noisy gradient descent with inexact line search methods (Armijo, Wolfe, and Goldstein).},

To deal with this issue, one could reformulate it as a mathematical program with disjunctive constraints (MPDC). In this paper, we first survey recent results on constraint qualifications and optimality conditions for MPDC, then apply them to MPSC. Moreover, we provide two types of sufficient conditions for the local error bound and exact penalty results for MPSC. One comes from the directional quasi-normality for MPDC, and the other is obtained via the local decomposition approach.},

Along the way, we are able to derive a number of verifiable conditions for level-set subdifferential error bounds to hold, and necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for linear convergence relative to a level set for nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problems. The newly established results not only enable us to show that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by VBPG is at least a critical point of the limiting subdifferential or even a critical point of the proximal subdifferential with a fixed Bregman function in each iteration, but also provide a fresh perspective that allows us to explore inner-connections among many known sufficient conditions for linear convergence of various first-order methods.},

(J Optim Theory Appl 169(1):1–16, 2016), which defines extremal varieties in $$\mathbb {P}\left( {{ \bigwedge ^2}{\mathbb {R}^n}} \right) $$ , we define a more general concept of extremal varieties of the real Grassmannian $${G_p}\left( {{\mathbb {R}^n}} \right) $$ in $$\mathbb {P}\left( {{ \bigwedge ^p}{\mathbb {R}^n}} \right) $$ . This concept is based on the minimization of the sums of squares of the quadratic Plücker relations defining the Grassmannian variety as well as the reverse maximisation problem. Such extremal problems define a set of Grassmannian inequalities on the set of Grassmann matrices, which are essential for the definition of the Grassmann variety and its dual extremal variety. We define and prove these inequalities for a general Grassmannian and we apply the existing results, in the cases $${{ \wedge ^2}{\mathbb {R}^{2n}}}$$ and $${{ \wedge ^n}{\mathbb {R}^{2n}}}$$ . The resulting extremal varieties underline the fact which was demonstrated in Leventides et al. (2016, Linear Algebra Appl 461:139–162, 2014), that such varieties are represented by multi-vectors that acquire the property of a unique singular value with total multiplicity. Crucial to these inequalities are the numbers $$M_{n,p}$$ , which are calculated within the cases mentioned above.},

Due to the special structure of the constraints, the reformulation violates many standard assumptions and therefore is often solved using specialized algorithms. In contrast to this, we investigate the viability of using a standard safeguarded multiplier penalty method without any problem-tailored modifications to solve the reformulated problem. We prove global convergence towards an (essentially strongly) stationary point under a suitable problem-tailored quasinormality constraint qualification. Numerical experiments illustrating the performance of the method in comparison to regularization-based approaches are provided.},

In this paper, we build up a novel rule to choose the regularization parameter for NRM, with the help of the duality theory. Our result provides a safe set for the regularization parameter when the rank of the solution has an upper bound. Furthermore, we apply this idea to NRM with quadratic and Huber functions, and establish simple formulae for the regularization parameters. Finally, we report numerical results on some signal shapes by embedding our rule into the cross validation, which state that our rule can reduce the computational time for the selection of the regularization parameter.

  abstract     = {In an earlier analysis of strong variation algorithms for optimal control problems with endpoint inequality constraints, Mayne and Polak provided conditions under which accumulation points satisfy a condition requiring a certain optimality function, used in the algorithms to generate search directions, to be nonnegative for all controls. The aim of this paper is to clarify the nature of this optimality condition, which we call the first-order minimax condition, and of a related integrated form of the condition, which, also, is implicit in past algorithm convergence analysis. We consider these conditions, separately, when a pathwise state constraint is, and is not, included in the problem formulation. When there are no pathwise state constraints, we show that the integrated first-order minimax condition is equivalent to the minimum principle and that the minimum principle (and equivalent integrated first-order minimax condition) is strictly stronger than the first-order minimax condition. For problems with state constraints, we establish that the integrated first-order minimax condition and the minimum principle are, once again, equivalent. But, in the state constrained context, it is no longer the case that the minimum principle is stronger than the first-order minimax condition, or vice versa. An example confirms the perhaps surprising fact that the first-order minimax condition is a distinct optimality condition that can provide information, for problems with state constraints, in some circumstances when the minimum principle fails to do so.},

We show that any accumulation point of the iterates generated by this algorithm, if exists, is a solution of the considered WCP. Moreover, when the solution set of WCP is nonempty, under assumptions weaker than the Jacobian nonsingularity assumption, we prove that the iteration sequence generated by our algorithm is bounded and converges to one solution of WCP with local superlinear or quadratic convergence rate.

We first provide computable lower and upper bounds for the radius of robust feasibility for general uncertain linear conic programs under the commonly used ball uncertainty set. We then provide important classes of linear conic programs where the bounds are calculated by finding the optimal values of related semi-definite linear programs, among them uncertain semi-definite programs, uncertain second-order cone programs and uncertain support vector machine problems. In the case of an uncertain linear program, the exact formula allows us to calculate the radius by finding the optimal value of an associated second-order cone program.},

  abstract     = {A simple multi-physical system for the potential flow of a fluid through a shroud, in which a mechanical component, like a turbine vane, is placed, is modeled mathematically. We then consider a multi-criteria shape optimization problem, where the shape of the component is allowed to vary under a certain set of second-order Hölder continuous differentiable transformations of a baseline shape with boundary of the same continuity class. As objective functions, we consider a simple loss model for the fluid dynamical efficiency and the probability of failure of the component due to repeated application of loads that stem from the fluid’s static pressure. For this multi-physical system, it is shown that, under certain conditions, the Pareto front is maximal in the sense that the Pareto front of the feasible set coincides with the Pareto front of its closure. We also show that the set of all optimal forms with respect to scalarization techniques deforms continuously (in the Hausdorff metric) with respect to preference parameters.},

  abstract     = {During the past few decades, multi-agent optimization problems have drawn increased attention from the research community. When multiple objective functions are present among agents, many works optimize the sum of these objective functions. However, this formulation implies a decision regarding the relative importance of each objective: optimizing the sum is a special case of a multi-objective problem in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To enable more general prioritizations, we present a distributed optimization algorithm that explores Pareto optimal solutions for non-homogeneously weighted sums of objective functions. This exploration is performed through a new rule based on agents’ priorities that generates edge weights in agents’ communication graph. These weights determine how agents update their decision variables with information received from other agents in the network. Agents initially disagree on the priorities of objective functions, though they are driven to agree upon them as they optimize. As a result, agents still reach a common solution. The network-level weight matrix is (non-doubly) stochastic, contrasting with many works on the subject in which the network-level weight matrix is doubly-stochastic. New theoretical analyses are therefore developed to ensure convergence of the proposed algorithm. This paper provides a gradient-based optimization algorithm, proof of convergence to solutions, and convergence rates of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that agents’ initial priorities influence the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm and that these initial choices affect its long-run behavior. Numerical results performed with different numbers of agents illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Assuming strong convexity, precise results for the tracking iterate error (the limit supremum of the norm of the difference between the optimal solution and the iterates) for online gradient descent are derived. The paper then considers a general first-order framework, where a universal lower bound on the tracking iterate error is established. Furthermore, a method using “long-steps” is proposed and shown to achieve the lower bound up to a fixed constant. This method is then compared with online gradient descent for specific examples. Finally, the paper analyzes the effect of regularization when the cost is not strongly convex. With regularization, it is possible to achieve a non-regret bound. The paper ends by testing the accelerated and regularized methods on synthetic time-varying least-squares and logistic regression problems, respectively.},

The existence and uniqueness of an optimal strategy are proved for this infinite-horizon problem, and a full characterization of the solution is provided. The best policy consists in applying the maximal allowed social distancing effort until the end of the interval, starting at a date that is not always the closest date and may be found by a simple algorithm. Both theoretical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that it leads to a significant decrease in the epidemic final size. We show that in any case the optimal intervention has to begin before the number of susceptible cases has crossed the herd immunity level, and that its limit is always smaller than this threshold. This problem is also shown to be equivalent to the minimum containment time necessary to stop at a given distance after this threshold value.},

Our method produces a trade list that specifies the number of shares to buy of each asset and the number of shares to sell from each tax lot held. To avoid wash sales (in which some realized capital losses are disallowed), we assume that we trade monthly and cannot simultaneously buy and sell the same asset. The tax-aware portfolio construction problem is not convex, but it becomes convex when we specify, for each asset, whether we buy or sell it. It can be solved using standard mixed-integer convex optimization methods at the cost of very long solve times for some problem instances. We present a custom convex relaxation of the problem that borrows curvature from the risk model. This relaxation can provide a good approximation of the true tax liability, while greatly enhancing computational tractability. This method requires the solution of only two convex optimization problems: the first determines whether we buy or sell each asset, and the second generates the final trade list. In our numerical experiments, our method almost always solves the nonconvex problem to optimality, and when it does not, it produces a trade list very close to optimal. Backtests show that the performance of our method is indistinguishable from that obtained using a globally optimal solution, but with significantly reduced computational effort.},

The major focus is on comparisons between well-established approaches involving linear-elliptic operators for the extension and the effect of additional nonlinear advection on the set of reachable shapes. It is moreover discussed how the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm can be reduced. The benefit of the nonlinearity in the extension operator is substantiated by several numerical test cases of stationary, incompressible Navier–Stokes flows in 2d and 3d.},

We will answer two questions regarding them. What are the optimal upper bounds for their stepsizes? Do decentralized algorithms require more properties on the functions for linear convergence than centralized ones? More specifically, we relax the required conditions for linear convergence of both algorithms. For EXTRA, we show that the stepsize is comparable to that of centralized algorithms. For NIDS, the upper bound of the stepsize is shown to be exactly the same as the centralized ones. In addition, we relax the requirement for the objective functions and the mixing matrices.

This property—the so-called viability property—is equivalently characterized through a property involving normals to the given set of probability measures. We prove that, if the Hamiltonian is nonpositive at any normal distribution to the given set, then the feedback strategy realizing the extremal shift rule provides the approximate viability. This implies the usual viability property. Conversely, the Hamiltonian is nonpositive at any normal distribution if the given set is viable. Our approach enables us to derive generalized feedback laws which ensure the trajectory to fulfill the constraint.

This requires the capability of analyzing an existing design and proposing or ideally generating an optimal design using numerical optimization. In this context, efficient and robust realization of such a framework for numerical shape optimization is of prime importance. Another requirement of such a framework is modularity, such that the shape optimization can involve different physics. This requires that different physics solvers should be handled in black-box nature. The current contribution discusses the conceptualization and applications of a general framework for numerical shape optimization using the vertex morphing parametrization technique. We deal with both 2D and 3D shape optimization problems, of which 3D problems usually tend to be expensive and are candidates for special attention in terms of efficient and high-performance computing.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we solve a maximization problem where the objective function is quadratic and convex or concave and the constraints set is the reachable values set of a convergent discrete-time affine system. Moreover, we assume that the matrix defining the system is diagonalizable. The difficulty of the problem lies in the treatment of infinite sequences belonging to the constraint set. Equivalently, the problem requires to solve an infinite number of quadratic programs. Therefore, the main idea is to extract a finite number of them and to guarantee that the resolution of the extracted problems provides the optimal value and a maximizer for the initial problem. The number of quadratic programs to solve has to be the smallest possible. Actually, we construct a family of integers that over-approximate the exact number of quadratic programs to solve using basic ideas of linear algebra. This family of integers is used in the final algorithm. A new computation of an integer of the family within the algorithm ensures a reduction of the number of iterations. The method proposed in the paper is illustrated on small academic examples. Finally, the algorithm is experimented on randomly generated instances of the problem.},

New necessary conditions for optimal Bi-Elliptic Transfers are presented in terms of these transformed variables. The work is applied to examples in which the apses of the ellipses are aligned. The Generalized Hohmann, Bi-Elliptic and Bi-Parabolic Transfers are discussed. An example is presented that shows that Bi-Elliptic Transfer cannot be optimal if the final time is free. The approach can also be applied to determine optimality of transfers for other aligned configurations. This project is then changed to a fixed final time minimization problem. For this problem, it is found that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the final time and the apogee of the transfer ellipse. It is shown from this fact that there can be optimal Bi-Elliptic Transfers if the final time is fixed.},

The algorithm includes a regularization technique to prevent singularity of the matrix of the linear system at each iteration, when the second-order sufficient conditions do not hold at the solution. These conditions are replaced by a milder assumption related to a local error-bound condition. This new condition is a generalization of the one used in unconstrained optimization. We show that by an appropriate updating strategy of the barrier parameter and of the regularization parameter, the proposed algorithm owns a superlinear rate of convergence. The analysis is made thanks to a boundedness property of the inverse of the Jacobian matrix arising in interior point algorithms. An illustrative example is given to show the behavior and the gain obtained by this regularization strategy.},

These models include the most well-known classes of objective functions analyzed in the literature: nonsmooth Lipschitz functions and composition of a (potentially) nonsmooth function and a smooth function, with or without strong convexity. Based on the flexibility offered by our optimization model, we consider several variants of stochastic first-order methods, such as the stochastic proximal gradient and the stochastic proximal point algorithms. Usually, the convergence theory for these methods has been derived for simple stochastic optimization models satisfying restrictive assumptions, and the rates are in general sublinear and hold only for specific decreasing stepsizes. Hence, we analyze the convergence rates of stochastic first-order methods with constant or variable stepsize under general assumptions covering a large class of objective functions. For constant stepsize, we show that these methods can achieve linear convergence rate up to a constant proportional to the stepsize and under some strong stochastic bounded gradient condition even pure linear convergence. Moreover, when a variable stepsize is chosen we derive sublinear convergence rates for these stochastic first-order methods. Finally, the stochastic gradient mapping and the Moreau smoothing mapping introduced in the present paper lead to simple and intuitive proofs.},

We developed and validated an optimal dosing algorithm (OptiDose) that computes the optimal individualized dosing regimen for pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic models in substantially different scenarios with various routes of administration by solving an optimal control problem. The aim is to compute a control that brings the underlying system as closely as possible to a desired reference function by minimizing a cost functional. In pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modeling, the controls are the administered doses and the reference function can be the disease progression. Drug administration at certain time points provides a finite number of discrete controls, the drug doses, determining the drug concentration and its effect on the disease progression. Consequently, rewriting the cost functional gives a finite-dimensional optimal control problem depending only on the doses. Adjoint techniques allow to compute the gradient of the cost functional efficiently. This admits to solve the optimal control problem with robust algorithms such as quasi-Newton methods from finite-dimensional optimization. OptiDose is applied to three relevant but substantially different pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic examples.},

Our approach is a variational one under application of the Euler–Lagrange equations with reference to the initial studies of this problem. First of all, we distinguish the navigation cases in non-critical, i.e. weak or strong, and critical winds, which are then unified into an arbitrary wind. After having considered the second variation of a given functional, we obtain the conditions for both time-minimal, i.e. the typical solutions to Zermelo’s problem, and time-maximal extremals. The anomalous paths are also emphasized. Moreover, some classification results are presented with respect to the kinds of perturbation considered separately and under an arbitrary wind. This study is illustrated at its end by a two-dimensional example including a prolate ellipsoid in the presence of a rotational vector field, wherein the solution types are being compared.},

This characterization for the strong ACQ is used to provide the exact calmness modulus of a convex multifunction. Finally, we apply these results to local and global error bounds for a convex inequality defined by a proper convex function. The characterization of the strong ACQ enables us to give primal equivalent criteria for local and global error bounds in terms of contingent cones and directional derivatives.},

These constraints assert that for all (medial-level) variable values from a set of infinite cardinality, there must exist (lower-level) variable values from a second set that satisfy an inequality. Existence-constrained semi-infinite programs are a generalization of regular semi-infinite programs, possess three rather than two levels, and are found in a number of applications. Building on our previous work on the global solution of semi-infinite programs (Djelassi and Mitsos in J Glob Optim 68(2):227–253, 2017), we propose (for the first time) an algorithm for the global solution of existence-constrained semi-infinite programs absent any convexity or concavity assumptions. The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate with a globally optimal solution with guaranteed feasibility under assumptions that are similar to the ones made in the regular semi-infinite case. In particular, it is assumed that host sets are compact, defining functions are continuous, an appropriate global nonlinear programming subsolver is used, and that there exists a Slater point with respect to the semi-infinite existence constraints. A proof of finite termination is provided. Numerical results are provided for the solution of an adjustable robust design problem from the chemical engineering literature.},

We conceptualize the problem as a poly-linear programming problem. Then, we regularize the poly-linear functional employing a regularization approach over the Lagrange functional for ensuring the method to converge to some of the Nash equilibria of the game. This paper presents two main contributions: The first theoretical result is the proposed iterative approach, which employs both the proximal and the gradient method for computing the Nash equilibria in Markov games. The method transforms the game theory problem in a system of equations, in which each equation itself is an independent optimization problem for which the necessary condition of a minimum is computed employing a nonlinear programming solver. The iterated approach provides a quick rate of convergence to the Nash equilibrium point. The second computational contribution focuses on the analysis of the convergence of the proposed method and computes the rate of convergence of the step-size parameter. These results are interesting within the context of computational and algorithmic game theory. A numerical example illustrates the proposed approach.},

In this paper, we derive and evaluate different approaches for computing lower bounds for the cubic problem. Alternatively to semidefinite programming relaxations proposed in the literature, our approaches do not lift the problem to higher dimensions. The strongest bounds are obtained by Lagrangian decomposition, resulting in a number of parameterized quadratic problems for which the above-mentioned results can be exploited, in particular the existence of a tractable dual problem. In an experimental evaluation, we consider the cubic one-spherical optimization problem, with homogeneous objective function, and compare the bounds generated with the different approaches proposed, for small examples from the literature and for randomly generated instances of varied dimensions.},

  abstract     = {In the development of first-order methods for smooth (resp., composite) convex optimization problems, where smooth functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients are minimized, the gradient (resp., gradient mapping) norm becomes a fundamental optimality measure. Under this measure, a fixed iteration algorithm with the optimal iteration complexity for the smooth case is known, while determining this number of iteration to obtain a desired accuracy requires the prior knowledge of the distance from the initial point to the optimal solution set. In this paper, we report an adaptive regularization approach, which attains the nearly optimal iteration complexity without knowing the distance to the optimal solution set. To obtain further faster convergence adaptively, we secondly apply this approach to construct a first-order method that is adaptive to the Hölderian error bound condition (or equivalently, the Łojasiewicz gradient property), which covers moderately wide classes of applications. The proposed method attains nearly optimal iteration complexity with respect to the gradient mapping norm.},

The basic idea is to piecewise construct convex relaxations of the follower’s problems, replace the relaxed follower’s problems equivalently by their Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions and solve the resulting mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints. The convex relaxations and needed parameters are constructed with ideas of the piecewise convexity method of global optimization. Under mild conditions, we show that every accumulation point of the optimal solutions of the sequence approximate problems is an optimal solution of the original problem. The convergence theorems of this method are presented and proved. Numerical experiments show that this method is capable of solving this class of bilevel programs.},

The method is realized by combining a theoretical result regarding the computation of descent directions for nonsmooth multiobjective optimization problems with a practical method to approximate the subdifferentials of the objective functions. We show convergence to points which satisfy a necessary condition for Pareto optimality. Using a set of test problems, we compare our method with the multiobjective proximal bundle method by Mäkelä. The results indicate that our method is competitive while being easier to implement. Although the number of objective function evaluations is larger, the overall number of subgradient evaluations is smaller. Our method can be combined with a subdivision algorithm to compute entire Pareto sets of nonsmooth problems. Finally, we demonstrate how our method can be used for solving sparse optimization problems, which are present in many real-life applications.},

First, we give a combinatorial method to deal with the labelling version of some classical combinatorial optimization problems including minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, minimum dominating set and minimum set cover, and convert the labelling problems into the original problems by polynomial-time reduction. We show that, although the labelling version of these problem seems more universal than their original counterparts, they are actually equivalent to the corresponding original problem from an algorithmic point of view. Moreover, we generalize the greedy approach for solving submodular cover problem to its labelling version, and as simple applications of our new method, we use it to solve the labelling versions of the minimum weighted spanning tree and connected vertex cover problem in a unified way.},

The proofs are based on arguments of lower semicontinuity, compactness and Mosco convergence of sets. Our results are useful in the study of various mathematical models in contact mechanics. To provide examples, we introduce 2 models, which describe the equilibrium of an elastic body in contact with a rigid body covered by a rigid-plastic and an elastic material, respectively. The weak formulation of each model is in the form of a minimization problem for the displacement field. We use our abstract well-posedness results in the study of these minimization problems.

A well-known approach of the literature is represented by the class of penalty decomposition methods, where a sequence of penalty subproblems, depending on the original variables and new variables, are inexactly solved by a two-block decomposition method. The inner iterates of the decomposition method require to perform exact minimizations with respect to the two blocks of variables. The computation of the global minimum with respect to the original variables may be prohibitive in the case of nonconvex objective function. In order to overcome this nontrivial issue, we propose a modified penalty decomposition method, where the exact minimizations with respect to the original variables are replaced by suitable line searches along gradient-related directions. We also present a derivative-free penalty decomposition algorithm for black-box optimization. We state convergence results of the proposed methods, and we report the results of preliminary computational experiments.},

We show that the method converges weakly to an optimal solution in Hilbert spaces, under mild standing assumptions without the global Lipschitz continuity of the gradient of the differentiable function involved. Our standing assumptions is weaker than the corresponding conditions in the paper of Salzo (SIAM J Optim 27:2153–2181, 2017). The conventional complexity of sublinear convergence for the functional value is also obtained under the local Lipschitz continuity of the gradient of the differentiable function. Our main results are about the linear convergence of this method (in the quotient type), in terms of both the function value sequence and the iterative sequence, under only the quadratic growth condition. Our proof technique is direct from the quadratic growth conditions and some properties of the forward–backward splitting method without using error bounds or Kurdya-Łojasiewicz inequality as in other publications in this direction.},

When each cluster is a singleton, the problem reduces to the well-known Minimum Branch Vertices problem, which is NP-hard. We show some properties that any feasible solution to the problem has to satisfy. Some of these properties can be used to determine useless vertices or edges, which can be removed to reduce the size of the instances.

From the technical perspective, the analyses exploit the systems similarities to a convex combination of discrete-time systems, where one of the systems is trivial, and thus, the overall properties are mostly dependent on the other one. Stability results are formulated for the nonlinear system and its linearization with respect to the systems, in general, multiple equilibria.

Assuming that the gradient of this function is Lipschitz continuous, the existence of solutions to the gradient system is guaranteed. We study the asymptotic behavior of these solutions in continuous and discrete times. More precisely, we show that, if a solution is bounded, then it converges weakly to a critical point of the function; otherwise, it goes to infinity (in norm). We also provide several sufficient conditions for obtaining strong convergence in both continuous and discrete cases. Our work is motivated by an open problem proposed by Khatibzadeh and Moroşanu (J Convex Anal 26:1175–1186, 2019), and we solve this problem in the case, where the gradient of the function is Lipschitz continuous on bounded sets.},

The goal is to smoothly match, at very fast rate, finite sequences of observed 3D-snapshots extracted from movies recording the smooth dynamic deformations of “soft” surfaces. We have implemented our algorithms in a proprietary software installed at The Methodist Hospital (Cardiology) to monitor mitral valve strain through computer analysis of noninvasive patients echocardiographies.},

We further calculate the quantization dimension, the quantization coefficient, and show that the quantization dimension is equal to the dimension of the object, and the quantization coefficient exists as a finite positive number. Then, we define a mixture of two uniform distributions on the boundary of a semicircular disc and obtain a sequence and an algorithm, with the help of which we determine the optimal sets of n-means and the nth quantization errors for all positive integers n with respect to the mixed distribution. Finally, for a uniform distribution defined on an elliptical curve, we investigate the optimal sets of n-means and the nth quantization errors for all positive integers n.},

  abstract     = {Direct Multisearch is a well-established class of algorithms, suited for multiobjective derivative-free optimization. In this work, we analyze the worst-case complexity of this class of methods in its most general formulation for unconstrained optimization. Considering nonconvex smooth functions, we show that to drive a given criticality measure below a specific positive threshold, Direct Multisearch takes at most a number of iterations proportional to the square of the inverse of the threshold, raised to the number of components of the objective function. This number is also proportional to the size of the set of linked sequences between the first unsuccessful iteration and the iteration immediately before the one where the criticality condition is satisfied. We then focus on a particular instance of Direct Multisearch, which considers a more strict criterion for accepting new nondominated points. In this case, we can establish a better worst-case complexity bound, simply proportional to the square of the inverse of the threshold, for driving the same criticality measure below the considered threshold.},

When the coefficient matrices are perturbed, the optimal values can change discontinuously as explained in concrete examples. We show that the optimal value of such a semidefinite program changes continuously under conditions involving the behavior of the minimal faces of the perturbed dual problems. In addition, we determine what kinds of perturbations keep the minimal faces invariant, by using the reducing certificates, which are produced in facial reduction. Our results allow us to classify the behavior of the minimal face of a semidefinite program obtained from a control problem.},

Based on the error bound condition, we prove that the sequence generated by the alternating direction method of multipliers converges locally to a critical point of the nonconvex optimization problem in a linear convergence rate, and the corresponding sequence of the augmented Lagrangian function value converges in a linear convergence rate. We illustrate the analysis by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers to solving the nonconvex quadratic programming problems with simplex constraint, and comparing it with some state-of-the-art algorithms, the proximal gradient algorithm, the proximal gradient algorithm with extrapolation, and the fast iterative shrinkage–thresholding algorithm.},
