  abstract     = {In this paper we show that two-stage adjustable robust linear programs with affinely adjustable data in the face of box data uncertainties under separable quadratic decision rules admit exact semi-definite program (SDP) reformulations in the sense that they share the same optimal values and admit a one-to-one correspondence between the optimal solutions. This result allows adjustable robust solutions of these robust linear programs to be found by simply numerically solving their SDP reformulations. We achieve this result by first proving a special sum-of-squares representation of non-negativity of a separable non-convex quadratic function over box constraints. Our reformulation scheme is illustrated via numerical experiments by applying it to an inventory-production management problem with the demand uncertainty. They demonstrate that our separable quadratic decision rule method to two-stage decision-making performs better than the single-stage approach and is capable of solving the inventory production problem with a greater degree of uncertainty in the demand.},

  abstract     = {The well-known M-P (Moore-Penrose) pseudoinverse is used in several linear-algebra applications; for example, to compute least-squares solutions of inconsistent systems of linear equations. Irrespective of whether a given matrix is sparse, its M-P pseudoinverse can be completely dense, potentially leading to high computational burden and numerical difficulties, especially when we are dealing with high-dimensional matrices. The M-P pseudoinverse is uniquely characterized by four properties, but not all of them need to be satisfied for some applications. In this context, Fampa and Lee (Oper. Res. Lett., 46:605–610, 2018) and Xu et al. (SIAM J. Optim., to appear) propose local-search procedures to construct sparse block-structured generalized inverses that satisfy only some of the M-P properties. (Vector) 1-norm minimization is used to induce sparsity and to keep the magnitude of the entries under control, and theoretical results limit the distance between the 1-norm of the solution of the local searches and the minimum 1-norm of generalized inverses with corresponding properties. We have implemented several local-search procedures based on results presented in these two papers and make here an experimental analysis of them, considering their application to randomly generated matrices of varied dimensions, ranks, and densities. Further, we carried out a case study on a real-world data set.},

A penalized DC (difference of two convex functions) formulation is proved to be equivalent to the original problem under a suitable penalty parameter. We employ quadratic-piecewise-linear approximations to the two parts of the DC objective function, resulting in a nonconvex subproblem. This is the key ingredient of our main algorithm. This nonconvex subproblem can be solved by a globally convergent alternating variable algorithm. Under some mild conditions, we prove that the proposed main algorithm for the penalized problem is globally convergent.

In order to solve it, we propose two linear integer programming formulations and a local search-based metaheuristic. The latter relies on auxiliary data structures to efficiently perform move evaluations during the search process. Extensive computational experiments on existing and newly proposed benchmark instances demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approaches when compared to those available in the literature. While the exact approaches obtained optimal solutions for open problems, the proposed heuristic algorithm was capable of finding high quality solutions within a reasonable CPU time. In addition, we also report improving results for the symmetrical version of the problem. Moreover, we show the benefits of implementing the efficient move evaluation procedure that enables the proposed metaheuristic to be scalable, even for large-size instances.},

A nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation is then defined to approximate the resulting variational inequality by using a power penalty approach. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the partial differential penalty equation are proved. It is shown that, under some mild assumptions, the sequence of solutions to the penalty equations converges to the unique solution of the variational inequality problem as the penalty parameter tends to infinity. The error estimates of the convergence of this penalty approach are also derived. At last, numerical experimental results are presented to show that the power penalty approximation method is efficient and robust.},

We consider a class of generally nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) with linear complicating constraints and integer linking variables. If the complicating constraints are removed, the problem becomes easy to solve, e.g. due to decomposable structure. Integrality of the linking variables allows us to apply a discretization approach to derive a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation and solve the problem to global optimality using branch-andprice. It is a remarkably simple idea; but to our surprise, it has barely found any application in the literature. In this work, we show that many relevant problems directly fall or can be reformulated into this class of MINLPs. We present the branch-and-price algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness (and sometimes ineffectiveness) in an extensive computational study considering multiple large-scale problems of practical relevance, showing that, in many cases, orders-of-magnitude reductions in solution time can be achieved.},

Low-density parity-check codes can detect and correct transmission errors if one encodes the original information by adding redundant bits. In practice, heuristic iterative decoding algorithms are used to decode the received vector. However, these algorithms may fail to decode if the received vector contains multiple errors. We consider decoding the received vector with minimum error as an integer programming (IP) problem and propose a branch-and-price method for its solution. We improve the performance of our method by introducing heuristic feasible solutions and adding valid cuts to the mathematical formulation. Our computational experiments reveal that our branch-cut-and-price algorithm significantly improves solvability of the problem compared to a state-of-the-art IP decoder in the literature and has superior error performance than the conventional sum-product algorithm.},

In a study of 2005, a fully interval arithmetic based global optimization method was introduced for the problem class, solving the cases 28, 29, 30. Until now, these were the largest problem instances solved on a computer. Using the techniques of that paper, the estimated solution time for the next three cases would have been 3–6 CPU months. In the present paper this former method is improved in both its local and global search phases. We discuss a new interval-based polygon representation of the core local method for eliminating suboptimal regions, which has a simpler implementation, easier proof of correctness, and faster behaviour than the former one. Furthermore, a modified strategy is presented for the global phase of the search, including improved symmetry filtering and tile pattern matching. With the new method the cases $$n=31,32,33$$ have been solved in 26, 61, and 13 CPU hours, giving high precision enclosures for all global optimizers and the optimum value. After eliminating the hardware and compiler improvements since the former study, the new proof technique became roughly about 40–100 times faster than the previous one. In addition, the new implementation is suitable for solving the next few circle packing instances with similar computational effort.},

We design a general algorithmic framework of iteratively reweighted algorithms for solving the proposed nonconvex and nonsmooth sparse optimization problems, which solves a sequence of weighted convex regularization problems with adaptively updated weights. First-order optimality condition is derived and global convergence results are provided under loose assumptions, making our theoretical results a practical tool for analyzing a family of various reweighted algorithms.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we extend the purely dual formulation that we recently proposed for the three-dimensional assignment problems to solve the more general multidimensional assignment problem. The convex dual representation is derived and its relationship to the Lagrangian relaxation method that is usually used to solve multidimensional assignment problems is investigated. Also, we discuss the condition under which the duality gap is zero. It is also pointed out that the process of Lagrangian relaxation is essentially equivalent to one of relaxing the binary constraint condition, thus necessitating the auction search operation to recover the binary constraint. Furthermore, a numerical algorithm based on the dual formulation along with a local search strategy is presented. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional Lagrangian relaxation approach in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

To relieve the computational burden, we show that, in some special cases, a closed form of the separation problem can be derived. For the general case, a brute-force algorithm, called exact separation algorithm, is employed in solving the separation problem of the considered polyhedron such that the constructed inequality guarantees to be facet-defining. Furthermore, a new technique is presented to accelerate the exact separation algorithm, which significantly decreases the number of iterations in the algorithm.

This paper first obtains two important theoretical results about partial optimum of biconvex programming by the objective penalty function. One result holds that the partial Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) condition is equivalent to the partially exactness for the objective penalty function of biconvex programming. Another result holds that the partial stability condition is equivalent to the partially exactness for the objective penalty function of biconvex programming. These results provide a guarantee for the convergence of algorithms for solving a partial optimum of biconvex programming. Then, based on the objective penalty function, three algorithms are presented for finding an approximate $$\epsilon $$ -solution to partial optimum of biconvex programming, and their convergence is also proved. Finally, numerical experiments show that an $$\epsilon $$ -feasible solution is obtained by the proposed algorithm.},

We consider Lasserre’s relaxation hierarchy to solve the problem of minimizing a polynomial over such a set. These relaxations give an increasing sequence of lower bounds of the infimum. In this paper we provide a new certificate for the optimal value of a Lasserre relaxation to be the optimal value of the polynomial optimization problem. This certificate is to check if a certain matrix has a generalized Hankel form. This certificate is more general than the already known certificate of an optimal solution being flat. In case we have detected optimality we will extract the potential minimizers with a truncated version of the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction on the optimal solution of the Lasserre relaxation. We prove also that the operators of this truncated construction commute if and only if the matrix of this modified optimal solution is a generalized Hankel matrix. This generalization of flatness will enable us to prove, with the use of the GNS truncated construction, a result of Curto and Fialkow on the existence of quadrature rule if the optimal solution is flat and a result of Xu and Mysovskikh on the existence of a Gaussian quadrature rule if the modified optimal solution is a generalized Hankel matrix . At the end, we provide a numerical linear algebraic algorithm for detecting optimality and extracting solutions of a polynomial optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies mean-risk portfolio optimization models using the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a risk measure. We also employ a cardinality constraint for limiting the number of invested assets. Solving such a cardinality-constrained mean-CVaR model is computationally challenging for two main reasons. First, this model is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problem because of the cardinality constraint, so solving it exactly is very hard when the number of investable assets is large. Second, the problem size depends on the number of asset return scenarios, and the computational efficiency decreases when the number of scenarios is large. To overcome these challenges, we propose a high-performance algorithm named the bilevel cutting-plane algorithm for exactly solving the cardinality-constrained mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problem. We begin by reformulating the problem as a bilevel optimization problem and then develop a cutting-plane algorithm for solving the upper-level problem. To speed up computations for cut generation, we apply to the lower-level problem another cutting-plane algorithm for efficiently minimizing CVaR with a large number of scenarios. Moreover, we prove the convergence properties of our bilevel cutting-plane algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared with other MIO approaches, our algorithm can provide optimal solutions to large problem instances faster.},

First, we present sufficient conditions under which the addition of scenario-based nonlinear cuts in the extensive formulation of TSS-CMIPs is sufficient to relax the integrality restrictions on the second stage integer variables without impacting the integrality of the optimal solution of the TSS-CMIP. We utilize scenario-based CMIR cuts for TSS-CMIPs and their distributionally robust generalizations with structured CMIPs in the second stage, and prove that these cuts provide conic/linear programming equivalent or approximation for the second stage CMIPs. We also perform extensive computational experiments by solving stochastic and distributionally robust capacitated facility location problem and randomly generated structured TSS-CMIPs with polyhedral CMIPs and second-order CMIPs in the second stage, i.e. $$p=1$$ and $$p =2$$ , respectively.

We then develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that exploits the unique structure of the proposed semidefinite relaxation, and applies a branching method different from the one commonly used in the existing algorithms. The symmetric structure of the solution set of the max-k-cut problem is discussed, and a strategy is devised to reduce the redundancy of subproblems in the enumeration procedure. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is promising.

  abstract     = {The 2-sets convex feasibility problem aims at finding a point in the nonempty intersection of two closed convex sets A and B in a Hilbert space H. The method of alternating projections is the simplest iterative procedure for finding a solution and it goes back to von Neumann. In the present paper, we study some stability properties for this method in the following sense: we consider two sequences of closed convex sets $${A_n}$$ and $${B_n}$$ , each of them converging, with respect to the Attouch-Wets variational convergence, respectively, to A and B. Given a starting point $$a_0$$ , we consider the sequences of points obtained by projecting on the “perturbed” sets, i.e., the sequences $${a_n}$$ and $${b_n}$$ given by $$b_n=P_{B_n}(a_{n-1})$$ and $$a_n=P_{A_n}(b_n)$$ . Under appropriate geometrical and topological assumptions on the intersection of the limit sets, we ensure that the sequences $${a_n}$$ and $${b_n}$$ converge in norm to a point in the intersection of A and B. In particular, we consider both when the intersection $$A\cap B$$ reduces to a singleton and when the interior of $$A \cap B$$ is nonempty. Finally we consider the case in which the limit sets A and B are subspaces.},

  abstract     = {A standard quadratic program is an optimization problem that consists of minimizing a (nonconvex) quadratic form over the unit simplex. We focus on reformulating a standard quadratic program as a mixed integer linear programming problem. We propose two alternative formulations. Our first formulation is based on casting a standard quadratic program as a linear program with complementarity constraints. We then employ binary variables to linearize the complementarity constraints. For the second formulation, we first derive an overestimating function of the objective function and establish its tightness at any global minimizer. We then linearize the overestimating function using binary variables and obtain our second formulation. For both formulations, we propose a set of valid inequalities. Our extensive computational results illustrate that the proposed mixed integer linear programming reformulations significantly outperform other global solution approaches. On larger instances, we usually observe improvements of several orders of magnitude.},

We show that the proposed framework closely relates to the superiorization methodology that is traditionally used for improving the efficiency of feasibility-seeking algorithms for constrained optimization problems in a derivative-based setting. We analyze the convergence behavior of the framework in the context of global search algorithms. A practical implementation is developed and exemplified with the global model-based solver Stable Noisy Optimization by Branch and Fit (SNOBFIT) [36]. To investigate the decomposition framework’s performance, we conduct extensive computational studies on a collection of over 300 test problems of varying dimensions and complexity. We observe significant improvements in the quality of solutions for a large fraction of the test problems. Regardless of problem convexity and smoothness, decomposition leads to over 50\% improvement in the objective function after 2500 function evaluations for over 90\% of our test problems with more than 75 variables.},

In this paper, we present a mixed integer programming formulation to construct optimal decision trees of a prespecified size. We take the special structure of categorical features into account and allow combinatorial decisions (based on subsets of values of features) at each node. Our approach can also handle numerical features via thresholding. We show that very good accuracy can be achieved with small trees using moderately-sized training sets.

Mechanistic multi-scale, multi-physics simulation models are often too hard to use for this purpose, especially for groundwater managers who do not have access to the complex compute resources and data. Therefore, we analyzed the applicability and performance of four modern deep learning computational models for predictions of groundwater levels. We compare three methods for optimizing the models’ hyperparameters, including two surrogate model-based algorithms and a random sampling method. The models were tested using predictions of the groundwater level in Butte County, California, USA, taking into account the temporal variability of streamflow, precipitation, and ambient temperature. Our numerical study shows that the optimization of the hyperparameters can lead to reasonably accurate performance of all models (root mean squared errors of groundwater predictions of 2 meters or less), but the “simplest” network, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs overall better for learning and predicting groundwater data than the more advanced long short-term memory or convolutional neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy and time-to-solution, making the MLP a suitable candidate for groundwater prediction.},

It linearizes the outer concave functions and solves the resulting convex, but still nonsmooth, subproblems by a special alternating linearization method. We provide proof of convergence to a stationary point of the method under mild conditions.

We adopt the content-based approach and propose to use the concept of resolving set that allows to determine the preferences of the users with a very limited number of ratings. We also show how to make recommendations when user ratings are imprecise or inconsistent, and we indicate how to take into account situations where users possibly don’t care about the attribute values of some items.

This is highly problematic with respect to the application of neural networks for safety-critical tasks, e.g. in autonomous driving. We provide an overview of algorithmic approaches that aim to provide formal guarantees on the behaviour of neural networks. Moreover, we present new theoretical results with respect to the approximation of ReLU neural networks. On the other hand, we implement a solver for verification of ReLU neural networks which combines mixed integer programming with specialized branching and approximation techniques. To evaluate its performance, we conduct an extensive computational study. For that we use test instances based on the ACAS Xu system and the MNIST handwritten digit data set. The results indicate that our approach is very competitive with others, i.e. it outperforms the solvers of Bunel et al.

  abstract     = {Piecewise affine functions are widely used to approximate nonlinear and discontinuous functions. However, most, if not all existing models, only deal with fitting a continuous function. In this paper, we investigate the problem of fitting a discontinuous piecewise affine function to a given function defined on an arbitrary subset of an integer lattice, where no restriction on the partition of the domain is enforced (i.e., its geometric shape can be nonconvex). This is useful for segmentation and denoising when the given function corresponds to a mapping from pixels of a bitmap image to their color depth values. We propose a novel Mixed Integer Program (MIP) formulation for the piecewise affine fitting problem, where binary edge variables determine the boundary between two partitions of the function domain. To obtain a consistent partitioning (e.g., image segmentation), we include multicut constraints in the formulation. The resulting problem is $$\mathcal {NP}$$ -hard, and two techniques are introduced to improve the computation. One is to adopt a cutting plane method to add the exponentially many multicut inequalities on-the-fly. The other is to provide initial feasible solutions using a tailored heuristic algorithm. We show that the MIP formulation on grid graphs is approximate, while on king’s graph, it is exact under certain circumstances. We conduct initial experiments on synthetic images as well as real depth images, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the two models.},

For this reason, we follow the current research trend of looking at Combinatorial Optimization tasks by using a Machine Learning lens, and we devise a framework for learning elimination rules yielding high-quality chordal extensions. As a first building block of the learning framework, we propose an imitation learning scheme that mimics the elimination ordering provided by an expert rule. Results show that our imitation learning approach is effective in learning two classical elimination rules: the minimum degree and minimum fill-in heuristics, using simple Graph Neural Network models with only a handful of parameters. Moreover, the learned policies display remarkable generalization performance, across both graphs of larger size, and graphs from a different distribution.},

  abstract     = {An interesting observation is that most pairs of weakly homogeneous mappings do not possess strongly monotonic property, which is one of the key conditions to ensure the unique solvability of the generalized variational inequality. This paper focuses on studying the uniqueness and solvability of the generalized variational inequality with a pair of weakly homogeneous mappings. By using a weaker condition than the strong monotonicity and some additional conditions, we achieve several results on the unique solvability to the underlying problem, which are exported by making use of the exceptional family of elements. As an adjunct, we also obtain the nonemptiness and compactness of the solution sets to the weakly homogeneous generalized variational inequality under some appropriate conditions. The conclusions presented in this paper are new or supplements to the existing ones even when the problem comes down to its important subclasses studied in recent years.},

In such problems there can be the requirement to optimise a mixture of continuous and discrete variables. Herein, we propose a new multi-objective algorithm capable of optimising both continuous and discrete bounded variables in an efficient manner. The algorithm utilises Gaussian processes as surrogates in combination with a novel distance metric based upon Gower similarity. The MVMOO algorithm was compared to an existing mixed variable implementation of NSGA-II and random sampling for three test problems. MVMOO shows competitive performance on all proposed problems with efficient data acquisition and approximation of the Pareto fronts for the selected test problems.},

This algorithm can not only avoid evaluating the exact full gradient which can be expensive in big data models but also weaken the stringent global Lipschitz gradient continuity assumption on the smooth part of the problem. However, under the nonconvex case, there is few analysis on the convergence of the PLIAG method. In this paper, we prove that the limit point of the sequence generated by the PLIAG method is the critical point of the weakly convex problems. Under further assumption that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) property, we prove that the generated sequence converges globally to a critical point of the problem.

Obtaining sharp and cheap bounds of the objective function over a simplex is very important in the construction of efficient Global Optimization B&amp;B algorithms. Although enclosing a simplex in a box implies an overestimation, boxes are more natural when dealing with individual coordinate bounds, and bounding ranges with Interval Arithmetic (IA) is computationally cheap. This paper introduces several linear relaxations using gradient information and Affine Arithmetic and experimentally studies their efficiency compared to traditional lower bounds obtained by natural and centered IA forms and their adaption to simplices. A Global Optimization B&amp;B algorithm with monotonicity test over a simplex is used to compare their efficiency over a set of low dimensional test problems with instances that either have a box constrained search region or where the feasible set is a simplex. Numerical results show that it is possible to obtain tight lower bounds over simplicial subsets.},

Belotti et al. (Electron Notes Discrete Math 36:805–812, 2010) and Miller et al. (SIAG/OPT Views News 22(1):1–8, 2011) showed that if there are additional upper and/or lower bounds on the product $$z=xy$$ , then the convex hull can be represented by adding an infinite family of inequalities, requiring a separation algorithm to implement. Nguyen et al. (Math Progr 169(2):377–415, 2018) derived convex hulls for $${(x,y,z)}$$ with bounds on $$z=xy^b$$ , $$b\ge 1$$ . We focus on the case where $$b=1$$ and show that the convex hull with either an upper bound or lower bound on the product is given by RLT constraints, the bound on z and a single second-order cone (SOC) constraint. With both upper and lower bounds on the product, the convex hull can be represented using no more than three SOC constraints, each applicable on a subset of (x, y) values. In addition to the convex hull characterizations, volumes of the convex hulls with either an upper or lower bound on z are calculated and compared to the relaxation that imposes only the RLT constraints. As an application of these volume results, we show how spatial branching can be applied to the product variable so as to minimize the sum of the volumes for the two resulting subproblems.},

  abstract     = {The computation of lower bounds via the solution of convex lower bounding problems depicts current state-of-the-art in deterministic global optimization. Typically, the nonlinear convex relaxations are further underestimated through linearizations of the convex underestimators at one or several points resulting in a lower bounding linear optimization problem. The selection of linearization points substantially affects the tightness of the lower bounding linear problem. Established methods for the computation of such linearization points, e.g., the sandwich algorithm, are already available for the auxiliary variable method used in state-of-the-art deterministic global optimization solvers. In contrast, no such methods have been proposed for the (multivariate) McCormick relaxations. The difficulty of determining a good set of linearization points for the McCormick technique lies in the fact that no auxiliary variables are introduced and thus, the linearization points have to be determined in the space of original optimization variables. We propose algorithms for the computation of linearization points for convex relaxations constructed via the (multivariate) McCormick theorems. We discuss alternative approaches based on an adaptation of Kelley’s algorithm; computation of all vertices of an n-simplex; a combination of the two; and random selection. All algorithms provide substantial speed ups when compared to the single point strategy used in our previous works. Moreover, we provide first results on the hybridization of the auxiliary variable method with the McCormick technique benefiting from the presented linearization strategies resulting in additional computational advantages.},

For the WDP, the shipper allows carriers to submit bids for a bundle of lanes. Then the winning carries are selected by solving the WDP. Specifically, this study considers the shipment distance-based and volume-based discounts for transportation cost, simultaneously. The state-of-the-art linearization technique is available to convert the MINP model into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to obtain a global optimum, but the solution time becomes inefficient when the problem size becomes large. To find efficient and effective linearization techniques for large-scale WDP, this study (1) proposes a novel WDP model with discount policies, (2) utilizes superior encoding formulation to avoid the unbalanced branch-and-bound trees in solving MILP, and (3) reduces big-M constraints to speed up the solving time. The proposed method leads to significant savings in computational efforts. Numerical experiments with real-world-sized truckload service procurement problems are solved by the proposed method and further confirmed the drastic reduction in computational time for solving the large-size WDP.},

CVRP is strongly NP-hard (even on the Euclidean plane), hard to approximate in general case and APX-complete for an arbitrary metric. Meanwhile, for the geometric settings of the problem, there are known a number of quasi-polynomial and even polynomial time approximation schemes. Among these results, the well-known QPTAS proposed by Das and Mathieu appears to be the most general. In this paper, we propose the first extension of this scheme to a more wide class of metric spaces.

With the help of the vector-valued Fischer-Burmeister function associated with second-order cones, the nonsmooth second-order cone complementarity problem can be equivalently transformed into a system of nonsmooth equations. To deal with this reformulated nonsmooth system, we present an approximation function by smoothing the inner mapping and the outer Fischer-Burmeister function simultaneously. Different from traditional smoothing methods, the smoothing parameter introduced is treated as an independent variable. We give some conditions under which the Jacobian of the smoothing approximation function is guaranteed to be nonsingular. Based on these results, we propose a smoothing Newton method for solving the nonsmooth second-order cone complementarity problem and show that the proposed method achieves globally superlinear or quadratic convergence under suitable assumptions.

  abstract     = {When solving large-scale cardinality-constrained Markowitz mean–variance portfolio investment problems, exact solvers may be unable to derive some efficient portfolios, even within a reasonable time limit. In such cases, information on the distance from the best feasible solution, found before the optimization process has stopped, to the true efficient solution is unavailable. In this article, I demonstrate how to provide such information to the decision maker. I aim to use the concept of lower bounds and upper bounds on objective function values of an efficient portfolio, developed in my earlier works. I illustrate the proposed approach on a large-scale data set based upon real data. I address cases where a top-class commercial mixed-integer quadratic programming solver fails to provide efficient portfolios attempted to be derived by Chebyshev scalarization of the bi-objective optimization problem within a given time limit. In this case, I propose to transform purely technical information provided by the solver into information which can be used in navigation over the efficient frontier of the cardinality-constrained Markowitz mean–variance portfolio investment problem.},

In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the sum of a monotone non-negative diminishing return submodular (DR-submodular) function and a supermodular function on the integer lattice subject to a cardinality constraint. By exploiting the special combinatorial structures in the problem, we introduce a decreasing threshold greedy algorithm with a binary search as its subroutine to solve the problem. To avoid introducing the diminishing return ratio and submodularity ratio of the objective function, we generalize the total curvatures of submodular functions and supermodular functions to the integer lattice version. We show that our algorithm has a constant approximation ratio parameterized by the new introduced total curvatures on integer lattice with a polynomial query complexity.},

The mixed-integer non-linear programming model, named MinPerim [17], works only for small to moderate-sized problems. Here we propose a polylithic framework of the problem for big problem instances by combining the following algorithms and models: (i) A fast disk-packing algorithm VOROPACK-D based on Voronoi diagrams, non-linear programming (NLP) models for packing disks, and an NLP model minDPCH for minimizing the discretized perimeter of convex hull; (ii) A fast convex-hull algorithm QuickhullDisk to compute the convex hulls of disk arrangements and their perimeter lengths; (iii) A mixed-integer NLP model MinPerim taking the output of QuickhullDisk as its input. We present complete analytic solutions for small problems up to four disks and a semi-analytic mixed-integer linear programming model which yields exact solutions for strip packing problems with up to one thousand congruent disks. It turns out that the proposed polylithic approach works fine for large problem instances containing up to 1,000 disks. Monolithic and polylithic solutions using minDPCH usually outperform other approaches. The polylithic approach yields better solutions than the results in [17] and provides a benchmark suite for further research.},

This problem includes various applications such as stochastic variational inequalities, stochastic Nash equilibrium problems, and nonconvex stochastic optimization problems. For solving this stochastic equilibrium problem, we propose an inexact stochastic subgradient projection method. The proposed method sets a random realization of the bifunction and then updates its approximation by using both its stochastic subgradient and the projection onto the constraint set. The main contribution of this paper is to present a convergence analysis showing that, under certain assumptions, any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the proposed method using a constant step size almost surely belongs to the solution set of the stochastic equilibrium problem. A convergence rate analysis of the method is also provided to illustrate the method’s efficiency. Another contribution of this paper is to show that a machine learning algorithm based on the proposed method achieves the expected risk minimization for a class of least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (lasso) problems in statistical learning with sparsity. Numerical comparisons of the proposed machine learning algorithm with existing machine learning algorithms for the expected risk minimization using LIBSVM datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm.},

Rather, our underestimator uses secant linear functions that interpolate the objective function at previously evaluated points. These linear mappings are shown to underestimate the objective in disconnected portions of the domain. Therefore, the union of these conditional cuts provides a nonconvex underestimator of the objective. We propose an algorithm that alternates between updating the underestimator and evaluating the objective function. We prove that the algorithm converges to a global minimum of the objective function on the feasible set. We present two approaches for representing the underestimator and compare their computational effectiveness. We also compare implementations of our algorithm with existing methods for minimizing functions on a subset of the integer lattice.

A general algorithm is presented and convergence to stationary points is demonstrated. Numerical results show that the algorithm is successfully able to detect and ignore outliers without too many specific parameters.

The feasible region induced by the intersection of circle-circle non-overlapping constraints is highly non-convex, and standard approaches to construct convex relaxations for spatial branch-and-bound global optimization of such models typically yield unsatisfactory loose relaxations. Consequently, solving such non-convex models to guaranteed optimality remains extremely challenging even for the state-of-the-art codes. In this paper, we apply a purpose-built branching scheme on non-overlapping constraints and utilize strengthened intersection cuts and various feasibility-based tightening techniques to further tighten the model relaxation. We embed these techniques into a branch-and-bound code and test them on two variants of circle packing problems. Our computational studies on a suite of 75 benchmark instances yielded, for the first time in the open literature, a total of 54 provably optimal solutions, and it was demonstrated to be competitive over the use of the state-of-the-art general-purpose global optimization solvers.},

  abstract     = {Solving mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems (MINLPs) to global optimality is extremely challenging. An important step for enabling their solution consists in the design of convex relaxations of the feasible set. Known solution approaches based on spatial branch-and-bound become more effective the tighter the used relaxations are. Relaxations are commonly established by convex underestimators, where each constraint function is considered separately. Instead, a considerably tighter relaxation can be found via so-called simultaneous convexification, where convex underestimators are derived for more than one constraint function at a time. In this work, we present a global solution approach for solving mixed-integer nonlinear problems that uses simultaneous convexification. We introduce a separation method that relies on determining the convex envelope of linear combinations of the constraint functions and on solving a nonsmooth convex problem. In particular, we apply the method to quadratic absolute value functions and derive their convex envelopes. The practicality of the proposed solution approach is demonstrated on several test instances from gas network optimization, where the method outperforms standard approaches that use separate convex relaxations.},

Specifically, we adapt the reformulation-linearization technique of Sherali and Adams (SIAM J Discrete Math 3, 411–430, 1990) to problems with linear complementarity constraints and discuss how this procedure reduces to its standard specification for binary mixed-integer programs. Then, we consider specially structured complementarity sets that appear in KKT systems with linear constraints. For sets with a single complementarity constraint, we develop a convexification procedure that generates all nontrivial facet-defining inequalities and has an appealing “cancel-and-relax” interpretation. This procedure is used to describe the convex hull of problems with few side constraints in closed-form. As a consequence, we delineate cases when the factorable relaxation techniques yield the convex hull from those for which they do not. We then discuss how these results extend to sets with multiple complementarity constraints. In particular, we show that a suitable sequential application of the cancel-and-relax procedure produces all nontrivial inequalities of their convex hull. We conclude by illustrating, on a set of randomly generated problems, that the relaxations we propose can be significantly stronger than those available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We propose a method called Polynomial Quadratic Convex Reformulation (PQCR) to solve exactly unconstrained binary polynomial problems (UBP) through quadratic convex reformulation. First, we quadratize the problem by adding new binary variables and reformulating (UBP) into a non-convex quadratic program with linear constraints (MIQP). We then consider the solution of (MIQP) with a specially-tailored quadratic convex reformulation method. In particular, this method relies, in a pre-processing step, on the resolution of a semi-definite programming problem where the link between initial and additional variables is used. We present computational results where we compare PQCR with the solvers Baron and Scip. We evaluate PQCR on instances of the image restoration problem and the low auto-correlation binary sequence problem from MINLPLib. For this last problem, 33 instances were unsolved in MINLPLib. We solve to optimality 10 of them, and for the 23 others we significantly improve the dual bounds. We also improve the best known solutions of many instances.},

The present paper complements the various suggestions for generalizations of partial lower bounds and of overall upper bounds by general constructions for overall lower bounds from partial lower bounds, and by the corresponding termination criteria and node selection steps. In particular, our branch-and-bound concept employs a new enclosure of the set of nondominated points by a union of boxes. On this occasion we also suggest a new discarding test based on a linearization technique. We provide a convergence proof for our general branch-and-bound framework and illustrate the results with numerical examples.},

Similarly, in this article, we characterize the class of multiobjective optimization problems having a polynomial-time computable approximate $$\varepsilon $$ -Pareto set that is exact in one objective by the efficient solvability of an appropriate auxiliary problem. This class includes important problems such as multiobjective shortest path and spanning tree, and the approximation guarantee we provide is, in general, best possible. Furthermore, for biobjective optimization problems from this class, we provide an algorithm that computes a one-exact $$\varepsilon $$ -Pareto set of cardinality at most twice the cardinality of a smallest such set and show that this factor of 2 is best possible.

In this paper, we present a proximity measure which characterizes the violation of the KKT conditions. It can be computed easily and is continuous in every efficient solution. Hence, it can be used as an indicator for the proximity of a certain point to the set of efficient (Edgeworth-Pareto-minimal) solutions and is well suited for algorithmic use due to its continuity properties. This is especially useful within evolutionary algorithms for candidate selection and termination, which we also illustrate numerically for some test problems.},

  abstract     = {It is a challenging task to identify the objectives on which a certain decision was based, in particular if several, potentially conflicting criteria are equally important and a continuous set of optimal compromise decisions exists. This task can be understood as the inverse problem of multiobjective optimization, where the goal is to find the objective function vector of a given Pareto set. To this end, we present a method to construct the objective function vector of an unconstrained multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) such that the Pareto critical set contains a given set of data points with prescribed KKT multipliers. If such an MOP can not be found, then the method instead produces an MOP whose Pareto critical set is at least close to the data points. The key idea is to consider the objective function vector in the multiobjective KKT conditions as variable and then search for the objectives that minimize the Euclidean norm of the resulting system of equations. By expressing the objectives in a finite-dimensional basis, we transform this problem into a homogeneous, linear system of equations that can be solved efficiently. Potential applications of this approach include the identification of objectives (both from clean and noisy data) and the construction of surrogate models for expensive MOPs.},

The objective is to minimize the total travel time of all vehicles while satisfying two types of time window constraints. The first requires each EMS vehicle to arrive at a patient’s location within a specified time window. The second requires the vehicle to arrive at the designated hospital within another time window. We allow an EMS vehicle to serve up to two patients instead of just one. The problem is shown to be NP-complete. We, therefore, develop a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for efficient solution in real-time. A column generation algorithm is developed for determining a tight lower bound. Numerical results show that the proposed SA heuristic provides high-quality solutions in much less CPU time, when compared to the general-purpose solver. Therefore, it is suitable for implementation in a real-time decision support system, which is available via a web portal ( www.rtdss.org ).},

We aim to maximize the the length of the shortest path from the root to all the leaves by increasing the weights of some edges such that the upgrade cost under unit/weighted $$l_1$$ norm is upper-bounded by a given value. We construct their mathematical models and prove some properties. We propose a revised algorithm for the problem (MSPIT) under unit $$l_1$$ norm with time complexity O(n), where n is the number of vertices in the tree. We put forward a primal dual algorithm in $$O(n^2)$$ time to solve the problem (MSPIT) under weighted $$l_1$$ norm, in which a minimum cost cut is found in each iteration. We also solve the problem to minimize the cost to upgrade edges such that the length of the shortest path is lower bounded by a value and present an $$O(n^2)$$ algorithm.

  abstract     = {A real symmetric matrix A is copositive if $$\left\langle {Ax},{x}\right\rangle \ge 0$$ for all x in the nonnegative orthant. Copositive programming gained fame when Burer showed that hard nonconvex problems can be formulated as completely-positive programs. Alas, the power of copositive programming is offset by its difficulty: simple questions like “is this matrix copositive?” have complicated answers. In 1958, Jerry Gaddum proposed a recursive procedure to check if a given matrix is copositive by solving a series of matrix games. It is easy to implement and conceptually simple. Copositivity generalizes to cones other than the nonnegative orthant. If K is a proper cone, then the linear operator L is copositive on K if $$\left\langle {L \left( {x}\right) },{x}\right\rangle \ge 0$$ for all x in K. Little is known about these operators in general. We extend Gaddum’s test to self-dual and symmetric cones, thereby deducing criteria for copositivity in those settings.},

We show under a suitable condition that “perturbation property” of the robust best approximation to any $$x\in {\mathbb {R}}^n$$ from the set $$\tilde{K}:={{\bar{C}}} \cap D$$ is characterized by the strong conical hull intersection property (strong CHIP) of $${\bar{C}}$$ and D. The set C is an open convex subset of $${\mathbb {R}}^n$$ and the set D is represented by $$D:={x\in {\mathbb {R}}^n: g_{j}(x,v_j)\le 0, \; \forall \; v_j\in V_j, \; j=1,2,\ldots ,m},$$ where the functions $$g_j:{\mathbb {R}}^n\times V_j\longrightarrow {\mathbb {R}}, \; j=1,2,\ldots ,m,$$ are continuously Fréchet differentiable that are not necessarily convex, and $$v_j$$ is the uncertain parameter which belongs to an uncertainty set $$V_j\subset {\mathbb {R}}^{q_j}, \; j=1,2,\ldots ,m.$$ This is done by first proving a dual cone characterization of the robust constraint set D. Finally, following the robust optimization approach, we establish Lagrange multiplier characterizations of the robust constrained best approximation that is immunized against data uncertainty under the robust nondegeneracy constraint qualification.

  abstract     = {The $$\ell _p$$ regularization problem with $$0&lt; p&lt; 1$$ has been widely studied for finding sparse solutions of linear inverse problems and gained successful applications in various mathematics and applied science fields. The proximal gradient algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms for solving the $$\ell _p$$ regularisation problem. In the present paper, we investigate the linear convergence issue of one inexact descent method and two inexact proximal gradient algorithms (PGA). For this purpose, an optimality condition theorem is explored to provide the equivalences among a local minimum, second-order optimality condition and second-order growth property of the $$\ell _p$$ regularization problem. By virtue of the second-order optimality condition and second-order growth property, we establish the linear convergence properties of the inexact descent method and inexact PGAs under some simple assumptions. Both linear convergence to a local minimal value and linear convergence to a local minimum are provided. Finally, the linear convergence results of these methods are extended to the infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our results cannot be established under the framework of Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz theory.},

The proposed algorithmic and reformulation framework applies to all types of distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization problems subjected to individual as well as joint chance constraints, with random right-hand side and technology vector, and under two types of uncertainties, called uncertain probabilities and continuum of realizations. For the uncertain probabilities (UP) case, we provide new mixed-integer linear programming reformulations for DRCCP problems. For the continuum of realizations case with random right-hand side, we propose an exact mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) reformulation and a linear programming (LP) outer approximation. For the continuum of realizations (CR) case with random technology vector, we propose two MISOCP and LP outer approximations. We show that all proposed relaxations become exact reformulations when the decision variables are binary or bounded general integers. For DRCCP with individual chance constraint and random right-hand side under both the UP and CR cases, we also propose linear programming reformulations which need the ex-ante derivation of the worst-case value-at-risk via the solution of a finite series of linear programs determined via a bisection-type procedure. We evaluate the scalability and tightness of the proposed MISOCP and (MI)LP formulations on a distributionally robust chance-constrained knapsack problem.},

A new efficient method for solving this problem based on the popular RANSAC method using parameters from the DBSCAN method is proposed. Thereby, instead of using classical indexes for recognizing the most appropriate partition, we use parameters from the DBSCAN method which define the necessary conditions proven to be far more efficient. Especially, the method is applied to solving multiple circle detection problem. In this case, we give both the conditions for the existence of the best circle as a representative of the data set and the explicit formulas for the parameters of the best circle. In the illustrative example, we consider the multiple circle detection problem for the data point set $$\mathcal {A}$$ coming from 5 intersected circles not known in advance. The method is tested on numerous artificial data sets and it has shown high efficiency.

To overcome the parameter constraints, we further propose a nonmonotone line search strategy to make the parameter selections more flexible. The subsequential convergence of the proposed method with line search is established. When the line search is monotone, we prove the stronger global convergence and linear convergence rate under Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz framework.

The $$\varDelta $$ -DOGS( $$\varOmega _Z$$ ) algorithm, which we prove to be globally convergent under the appropriate assumptions, combines (a) the essential ideas of our $$\varDelta $$ -DOGS( $$\varOmega $$ ) algorithm, which is designed to efficiently optimize a nonconvex objective function f(x) within a nonconvex feasible domain $$\varOmega $$ defined by a number of constraint functions $$c_\kappa (x)$$ , with (b) our $$\varDelta $$ -DOGS(Z) algorithm, which reduces the number of function evaluations on the boundary of the search domain via the restriction that all function evaluations lie on a Cartesian grid, which is successively refined as the iterations proceed. The optimization of the parameters of low-storage IMEXRK schemes involves a complicated set of nonconvex constraints, which leads to a challenging disconnected feasible domain, and a highly nonconvex objective function; our simulations indicate significantly faster convergence using $$\varDelta $$ -DOGS( $$\varOmega _Z$$ ) as compared with the original $$\varDelta $$ -DOGS( $$\varOmega $$ ) optimization algorithm on the problem of tuning the parameters of such schemes. A low-storage third-order IMEXRK scheme with remarkably good stability and accuracy properties is ultimately identified using this approach, and is briefly tested on Burgers’ equation.},

  abstract     = {Introduced in 1993, the DIRECT global optimization algorithm provided a fresh approach to minimizing a black-box function subject to lower and upper bounds on the variables. In contrast to the plethora of nature-inspired heuristics, DIRECT was deterministic and had only one hyperparameter (the desired accuracy). Moreover, the algorithm was simple, easy to implement, and usually performed well on low-dimensional problems (up to six variables). Most importantly, DIRECT balanced local and global search (exploitation vs. exploration) in a unique way: in each iteration, several points were sampled, some for global and some for local search. This approach eliminated the need for “tuning parameters” that set the balance between local and global search. However, the very same features that made DIRECT simple and conceptually attractive also created weaknesses. For example, it was commonly observed that, while DIRECT is often fast to find the basin of the global optimum, it can be slow to fine-tune the solution to high accuracy. In this paper, we identify several such weaknesses and survey the work of various researchers to extend DIRECT so that it performs better. All of the extensions show substantial improvement over DIRECT on various test functions. An outstanding challenge is to improve performance robustly across problems of different degrees of difficulty, ranging from simple (unimodal, few variables) to very hard (multimodal, sharply peaked, many variables). Opportunities for further improvement may lie in combining the best features of the different extensions.},

Thus, this problem involves assigning each production operation to one of the alternative machines, finding the sequence of operations for each machine, assigning each transport task to one of the vehicles, and finding the sequence of transport tasks for each vehicle, simultaneously. Transportation is usually neglected in the literature and when considered, an unlimited number of vehicles is, typically, assumed. Here, we propose the first mixed integer linear programming model for this problem and show its efficiency at solving small-sized instances to optimality.

The method performs an inner linearization of the nonlinear constraints by using a Taylor form.

For testing the approach, AbsTaylor was introduced as an upper bounding method in a state-of-the-art global branch &amp; bound optimizer. Furthermore, we implemented a local search method which extracts feasible inner polytopes for iteratively finding better solutions inside them. In the studied instances, the new method finds in average four times more inner regions and significantly improves the optimizer performance.},

Although many single objective optimization algorithms have been extended to multiple objectives, completely deterministic algorithms for nonlinear problems with guarantees of convergence to global Pareto optimality are still missing. For instance, deterministic algorithms usually make use of some form of scalarization, which may lead to incomplete representations of the Pareto optimal set. Thus, all global Pareto optima may not be obtained, especially in nonconvex cases. On the other hand, algorithms attempting to produce representations of the globally Pareto optimal set are usually based on heuristics. We analyze the concept of global convergence for multiobjective optimization algorithms and propose a convergence criterion based on the Hausdorff distance in the decision space. Under this light, we consider the well-known global optimization algorithm direct, analyze the available algorithms in the literature that extend direct to multiple objectives and discuss possible alternatives. In particular, we propose a novel definition for the notion of potential Pareto optimality extending the notion of potential optimality defined in direct. We also discuss its advantages and disadvantages when compared with algorithms existing in the literature.},

In particular, we assume that efficient solutions are collected sequentially such that the collected solution at each iteration maximizes the hypervolume indicator, and that the non-dominated set can be well approximated by a quadrant of a superellipse. We validate our model against an “optimal” model that has complete knowledge of the non-dominated set. The empirical results suggest that our theoretical model approximates the behavior of this optimal model quite well. We also analyze the anytime behavior of an $$\varepsilon $$ -constraint algorithm, and show that our model can be used to guide the algorithm and improve its anytime behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a sequential model based optimization framework for optimizing a black-box, multi-extremal and expensive objective function, which is also partially defined, that is it is undefined outside the feasible region. Furthermore, the constraints defining the feasible region within the search space are unknown. The approach proposed in this paper, namely SVM-CBO, is organized in two consecutive phases, the first uses a Support Vector Machine classifier to approximate the boundary of the unknown feasible region, the second uses Bayesian Optimization to find a globally optimal solution within the feasible region. In the first phase the next point to evaluate is chosen by dealing with the trade-off between improving the current estimate of the feasible region and discovering possible disconnected feasible sub-regions. In the second phase, the next point to evaluate is selected as the minimizer of the Lower Confidence Bound acquisition function but constrained to the current estimate of the feasible region. The main of the paper is a comparison with a Bayesian Optimization process which uses a fixed penalty value for infeasible function evaluations, under a limited budget (i.e., maximum number of function evaluations). Results are related to five 2D test functions from literature and 80 test functions, with increasing dimensionality and complexity, generated through the Emmental-type GKLS software. SVM-CBO proved to be significantly more effective as well as computationally efficient.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of finding zeros of monotone inclusions of three operators in real Hilbert spaces, where the first operator’s inverse is strongly monotone and the third is linearly composed, and we suggest an extended splitting method. This method allows relative errors and is capable of decoupling the third operator from linear composition operator well. At each iteration, the first operator can be processed with just a single forward step, and the other two need individual computations of the resolvents. If the first operator vanishes and linear composition operator is the identity one, then it coincides with a known method. Under the weakest possible conditions, we prove its weak convergence of the generated primal sequence of the iterates by developing a more self-contained and less convoluted techniques. Our suggested method contains one parameter. When it is taken to be either zero or two, our suggested method has interesting relations to existing methods. Furthermore, we did numerical experiments to confirm its efficiency and robustness, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

By this approach, nondominated and minimal solutions are characterized in terms of solutions of scalar optimization problems whose objective functions are the post-composition of the original objective with scalar functions satisfying suitable properties. The obtained results generalize some recent ones stated in quasi ordered sets and real topological linear spaces. Besides, they are applied both to characterize by scalarization approximate solutions of set optimization problems with set ordering and to generalize some recent conditions on robust solutions of optimization problems. For this aim, a new robustness concept in optimization under uncertainty is introduced which is interesting in itself.},

  abstract     = {In the research of optimization problems, optimality conditions play an important role. By using some derivatives, various types of necessary and/or sufficient optimality conditions have been introduced by many researchers. Especially, in convex programming, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions in terms of the subdifferential have been studied extensively. Recently, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for quasiconvex programming have been investigated by the authors. However, there are not so many results concerned with Karush–Kuhn–Tucker type optimality conditions for non-differentiable quasiconvex programming. In this paper, we study a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker type optimality condition for quasiconvex programming in terms of Greenberg–Pierskalla subdifferential. We show some closedness properties for Greenberg–Pierskalla subdifferential. Under the Slater constraint qualification, we show a necessary and sufficient optimality condition for essentially quasiconvex programming in terms of Greenberg–Pierskalla subdifferential. Additionally, we introduce a necessary and sufficient constraint qualification of the optimality condition. As a corollary, we show a necessary and sufficient optimality condition for convex programming in terms of the subdifferential.},

  abstract     = {Learning rates in stochastic neural network training are currently determined a priori to training, using expensive manual or automated iterative tuning. Attempts to resolve learning rates adaptively, using line searches, have proven computationally demanding. Reducing the computational cost by considering mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) introduces challenges due to significant variance in information between batches that may present as discontinuities in the loss function, depending on the MBSS approach. This study proposes a robust approach to adaptively resolve learning rates in dynamic MBSS loss functions. This is achieved by finding sign changes from negative to positive along directional derivatives, which ultimately converge to a stochastic non-negative associated gradient projection point. Through a number of investigative studies, we demonstrate that gradient-only line searches (GOLS) resolve learning rates adaptively, improving convergence performance over minimization line searches, ignoring certain local minima and eliminating an otherwise expensive hyperparameter. We also show that poor search directions may benefit computationally from overstepping optima along a descent direction, which can be resolved by considering improved search directions. Having shown that GOLS is a reliable line search allows for comparative investigations between static and dynamic MBSS.},

  abstract     = {A common approach to global optimization is to combine local optimization methods with random restarts. Restarts have been used as a performance boosting approach. They can be a means to avoid “slow progress” by exploiting a potentially good solution, and restarts can enable the potential discovery of multiple local solutions, thus improving the overall quality of the returned solution. A multi-start method is a way to integrate local and global approaches; where the global search itself can be used to restart a local search. Bayesian optimization methods aim to find global optima of functions that can only be point-wise evaluated by means of a possibly expensive oracle. We propose the stochastic optimization with adaptive restart (SOAR) framework, that uses the predictive capability of Gaussian process models as a means to adaptively restart local search and intelligently select restart locations with current information. This approach attempts to balance exploitation with exploration of the solution space. We study the asymptotic convergence of SOAR to a global optimum, and empirically evaluate SOAR performance through a specific implementation that uses the Trust Region method as the local search component. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methodologies over a suite of test problems of varying problem dimension with a finite budget of function evaluations.},

Specifically, we focus on multiparametric optimization problems with a convex quadratic objective function, quadratic inequality and linear equality constraints, described by constant matrices. The proposed approach is founded on the expansion of the Basic Sensitivity Theorem to a second-order Taylor approximation, which enables the derivation of the exact parametric solution of mpQCQPs. We utilize an active set strategy to implicitly explore the parameter space, based on which (i) the complete map of parametric solutions for convex mpQCQPs is constructed, and (ii) the determination of the optimal parametric solution for every feasible parameter realization reduces to a nonlinear function evaluation. Based on the presented results, we utilize the second-order approximation to the Basic Sensitivity Theorem to expand to the case of nonconvex quadratic constraints, by employing the Fritz John necessary conditions. Example problems are provided to illustrate the algorithmic steps of the proposed approach.},

Additional sample points are preferentially placed near previous good sample points to improve the rate of convergence. Connections with partitioning strategies are explored for oscars and the new method, showing these methods have a reduced risk of sample point redundancy. Numerical testing shows that the method is viable in practice, and is substantially faster than oscars in 4 or more dimensions.
