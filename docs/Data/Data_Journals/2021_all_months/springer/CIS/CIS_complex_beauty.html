The main task in Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems is to develop feature descriptors that could effectively classify the facial expressions into various categories. In this work, towards extracting distinctive features, Radial Cross Pattern (RCP), Chess Symmetric Pattern (CSP) and Radial Cross Symmetric Pattern (RCSP) feature descriptors have been proposed and are implemented in a 5 $$\times $$ 5 overlapping neighborhood to overcome some of the limitations of the existing methods such as Chess Pattern (CP), Local Gradient Coding (LGC) and its variants. In a 5 $$\times $$ 5 neighborhood, the 24 pixels surrounding the center pixel are arranged into two groups, namely Radial Cross Pattern (RCP), which extracts two feature values by comparing 16 pixels with the center pixel and Chess Symmetric Pattern (CSP) extracts one feature value from the remaining 8 pixels. The experiments are conducted using RCP and CSP independently and also with their fusion RCSP using different weights, on a variety of facial expression datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. The results obtained from the experimental analysis demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.},

However, the issues of privacy-preserving and performance improvement hinder the applications of the FL in the industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs). In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving momentum FL approach, named PMFL, which uses the momentum term to accelerate the model convergence rate during the training process. Furthermore, a fully homomorphic encryption scheme CKKS is adopted to encrypt the gradient parameters of the industrial agents’ models for preserving their local privacy information. In particular, the cloud server calculates the global encrypted momentum term by utilizing the encrypted gradients based on the momentum gradient descent optimization algorithm (MGD). The performance of the proposed PMFL is evaluated on two common deep learning datasets, i.e., MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. Theoretical analysis and experiment results confirm that the proposed approach can improve the convergence rate while preserving the privacy information of the industrial agents.},

Motifs, patterns of the higher order organization compared with nodes and edges, are recently found to be the novel fundamental unit structures of complex networks. In this work, we proposed a novel motif h-backbone (Motif-h) method to extract functional cores of directed networks based on both motif strength and h-bridge. Compared with the state-of-the-art method Motif-DF and Entropy, our method solves two main issues which are often found in existing methods: the Motif-h reconsiders weak ties into our candidate set, and those weak ties often have critical functions of bridges in networks; moreover, our method provides a trade-off between the motif size and the edge strength, which quantifies the core edges accordingly. In the simulations, we compare our method with Motif-DF in four real-world networks and found that Motif-h can streamline the extraction of crucial structures compared with the others with limited edges.},

The big data platform of Douban.com is selected as the data source, and the online case “NeiYuanWaiFang” is applied as the real target, for our modeling and simulations to match. We run 10,000 simulations to find possible optimal solutions, and we run 10,000 times again to check the robustness and adaptability. The optimal solution simulations can reflect the whole life cycle process. In terms of different levels and indicators, the fitting or matching degrees achieve the highest levels. At the micro-level, the distributions of individual behaviors under real case and simulations are similar to each other, and they all follow normal distributions; at the middle-level, both discrete and continuous distributions of supportive and oppositive online comments are matched between real case and simulations; at the macro-level, the life cycle process (outbreak, rising, peak, and vanish) and durations can be well matched. Therefore, our model has properly seized the core mechanism of individual behaviors, and precisely simulated the evolutionary dynamics of online cases in reality.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, data are the most valuable content in the world. In the age of big data, we are generating quintillions of data daily in the form of text, image, video, etc. Among them, images are highly used in daily communications. Various types of images, e.g., medical images, military images, etc. are highly confidential. But, due to data vulnerabilities, transmitting such images in a secured way is a great challenge. For this reason, researchers proposed different image cryptography algorithms. Recently, biological deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based concepts are getting popular for ensuring image security as well as encryption as they show good performance. However, these DNA-based methods have some limitations, e.g., these are not dynamic and their performance results are far from ideal values. Further, these encryption methods usually involve two steps, confusion and diffusion. Confusion increases huge time complexity and needs to send one or more additional map tables with a cipher to decrypt the message. In this research, we propose a novel and efficient DNA-based key scrambling technique for image encryption that addresses the above limitations. We evaluate our proposed method using 15 different datasets and achieved superior performance scores of entropy, keyspace, cipher pixel correlations, variance of histogram, time complexity and PSNR. The experimental results show that our method can be used for image encryption with a high level of confidentiality.},

  abstract     = {Although a single-valued neutrosophic multi-valued set (SVNMVS) can reasonably and perfectly express group evaluation information and make up for the flaw of multi-valued/hesitant neutrosophic sets in group decision-making problems, its information expression and group decision-making methods still lack the ability to express and process single- and interval-valued hybrid neutrosophic multi-valued information. To overcome the drawbacks, this study needs to propose single- and interval-valued hybrid neutrosophic multi-valued sets (SIVHNMVSs), correlation coefficients of consistency interval-valued neutrosophic sets (CIVNSs), and their multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method in the setting of SIVHNMVSs. First, we propose SIVHNMVSs and a transformation method for converting SIVHNMVSs into CIVNSs based on the mean and consistency degree (the complement of standard deviation) of truth, falsity and indeterminacy sequences. Then, we present two correlation coefficients between CIVNSs based on the multiplication of both the correlation coefficient of interval-valued neutrosophic sets and the correlation coefficient of neutrosophic consistency sets and two weighted correlation coefficients of CIVNSs. Next, a MAGDM method is developed based on the proposed two weighted correlation coefficients of CIVNSs for performing MAGDM problems under the environment of SIVHNMVSs. At last, a selection case of landslide treatment schemes demonstrates the application of the proposed MAGDM method under the environment of SIVHNMVSs. By comparative analysis, our new method not only overcomes the drawbacks of the existing method, but also is more extensive and more useful than the existing method when tackling MAGDM problems in the setting of SIVHNMVSs.},

Textual datasets, especially which contain a large number of documents are sparse and have high dimensionality. Hence, traditional clustering techniques such as K-means, Agglomerative clustering, and DBSCAN cannot perform well. In this paper, a clustering technique especially suitable to large text datasets is proposed that overcome these limitations. The proposed technique is based on word embeddings derived from a recent deep learning model named “Bidirectional Encoders Representations using Transformers”. The proposed technique is named as WEClustering. The proposed technique deals with the problem of high dimensionality in an effective manner, hence, more accurate clusters are formed. The technique is validated on several datasets of varying sizes and its performance is compared with other widely used and state of the art clustering techniques. The experimental comparison shows that the proposed clustering technique gives a significant improvement over other techniques as measured by metrics such Purity and Adjusted Rand Index.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global alarm. With the advances in artificial intelligence, the COVID-19 testing capabilities have been greatly expanded, and hospital resources are significantly alleviated. Over the past years, computer vision researches have focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can significantly improve image analysis ability. However, CNN architectures are usually manually designed with rich expertise that is scarce in practice. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can automatically search for the proper CNN architectures and voluntarily optimize the related hyperparameters. The networks searched by EAs can be used to effectively process COVID-19 computed tomography images without expert knowledge and manual setup. In this paper, we propose a novel EA-based algorithm with a dynamic searching space to design the optimal CNN architectures for diagnosing COVID-19 before the pathogenic test. The experiments are performed on the COVID-CT data set against a series of state-of-the-art CNN models. The experiments demonstrate that the architecture searched by the proposed EA-based algorithm achieves the best performance yet without any preprocessing operations. Furthermore, we found through experimentation that the intensive use of batch normalization may deteriorate the performance. This contrasts with the common sense approach of manually designing CNN architectures and will help the related experts in handcrafting CNN models to achieve the best performance without any preprocessing operations},

  abstract     = {As one of the hot research directions in natural language processing, sentiment analysis has received continuous and extensive attention. Different from explicit sentiment words indicating sentiment polarity, implicit sentiment analysis is a more challenging problem due to the lack of sentiment words, which makes it inadequate to use traditional sentiment analysis method to judge the polarity of implicit sentiment. This paper takes sentiment analysis as a special sign link prediction problem, which is different from traditional text-based method. In particular, by performing the word graph-based text level information embedding and heterogeneous social network information embedding (i.e. user social relationship network embedding, and user-entity sentiment network embedding), the proposed scheme learns the highly nonlinear representations of network nodes, explores early fusion method to combine the strength of these two types of embedding modeling, optimizes all parameters simultaneously and creates enhanced context representations, leading to better capture of implicit sentiment polarity. The proposed method has been examined on real-world dataset, for implicit sentiment link prediction task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art schemes, including LINE, node2vec, and SDNE, by 20.2%, 19.8%, and 14.0%, respectively, on accuracy, and achieves at least 14% gains on AUROC. For sentiment analysis accuracy, the proposed method achieves AUROC of 80.6% and accuracy of 78.3%, which is at least 31% better than other models. This work can provide useful guidance on the implicit sentiment analysis.},

We propose the LDA-ARMA deep neural network for dynamic presentation and fine-grained categorization of a public opinion events. This was applied to a huge quantity of online public opinion texts in a complicated setting and integrated the proposed sentiment measurement algorithm. To begin, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to extract information about the topic of comments. The autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) was then utilized to perform multidimensional sentiment analysis and evolution prediction on large-scale textual data related to COVID-19 published by netizens from Wuhan and other countries on Sina Weibo. The results show that Wuhan netizens paid more attention to the development of the situation, treatment measures, and policies related to COVID-19 than other issues, and were under greater emotional pressure, whereas netizens in the rest of the country paid more attention to the overall COVID-19 prevention and control, and were more positive and optimistic with the assistance of the government and NGOs. The average error in predicting public opinion sentiment was less than 5.64%, demonstrating that this approach may be effectively applied to the analysis of large-scale online public sentiment evolution.},

This study proposes a hyper-heuristic approach that employs GP to automatically design different mutation operators for EP. At each generation, the EP algorithm can adaptively explore the search space according to historical information. The experimental results demonstrate that the EP with adaptive mutation operators, designed by the proposed hyper-heuristics, exhibits improved performance over other EP versions (both manually and automatically designed). Many researchers in evolutionary computation advocate adaptive search operators (which do adapt over time) over non-adaptive operators (which do not alter over time). The core motive of this study is that we can automatically design adaptive mutation operators that outperform automatically designed non-adaptive mutation operators.},

  abstract     = {Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is an approach to building and developing software systems based on software components. In component-based software systems, there are various software components, including Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and in-house components. Software developers can build their desired software component as in-house or COTS. The problem of deciding optimally between COTS and in-house components is one of the major challenges of software developers, which is known as the component selection problem. This can be resolved by evaluating the criteria for optimality in component selection and then solving the component selection problem by optimization techniques. In this paper, an attempt was made to optimize the component selection problem through the multi-objective optimization by maximizing the Fuzzy-Intra Coupling Density (Fuzzy-ICD) and functionality as objective functions, and also taking into account budget, delivery time, reliability, and Fuzzy-ICD as constraints of multi-objective problems. Fuzzy ICD is a more accurate criterion to calculate the relationship between Cohesion and Coupling of components, which is obtained through the fuzzy computing of each of them, based on the Meyers classification. Thus, after a two-criterion optimization model formulation, this optimization problem was solved by fuzzy multi objectives approach. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated by performing the case study of financial-accounting system. Comparison of the results showed that the proposed method could select optimal components with maximum functionality and Fuzzy-ICD and fewer rates of time and Budget (0.29, 0.43, 1.1 s, and 88$ were the improved rates of functionality, Fuzzy-ICD, time, and budget, respectively).},

Most existing algorithms assume that the data used for optimization are always available on a central server for construction of surrogates. This assumption, however, may fail to hold when the data must be collected in a distributed way and are subject to privacy restrictions. This paper aims to propose a federated data-driven evolutionary multi-/many-objective optimization algorithm. To this end, we leverage federated learning for surrogate construction so that multiple clients collaboratively train a radial-basis-function-network as the global surrogate. Then a new federated acquisition function is proposed for the central server to approximate the objective values using the global surrogate and estimate the uncertainty level of the approximated objective values based on the local models. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified on a series of multi-/many-objective benchmark problems by comparing it with two state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

However, most of MADM methods not only neglect the characteristics of competitors’ behaviors but also just obtain a simple strategy ranking result cannot reflect the feasibility of each strategy. To overcome these drawbacks, a two-person non-cooperative matrix game method based on a hybrid dynamic expert weight determination model is proposed for coping with intricate competitive strategy group decision-making problems within q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment. At the beginning, a novel dynamic expert weight calculation model, considering objective individual and subjective evaluation information simultaneously, is devised by integrating the superiorities of a credibility analysis scale and a Hausdorff distance measure for q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs). The expert weights obtained by the above model can vary with subjective evaluation information provided by experts, which are closer to the actual practices. Subsequently, a two-person non-cooperative fuzzy matrix game is formulated to determine the optimal mixed strategies for competitors, which can present the specific feasibility and divergence degree of each competitive strategy and be less impacted by the number of strategies. Finally, an illustrative example, several comparative analyses and sensitivity analyses are conducted to validate the reasonability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach as a CSGDM method with high efficiency, low computation complexity and little calculation burden.},

An indeterminate state of an experiment generally generates the data in interval form. The indeterminacy property of interval-valued data makes it a neutrosophic form data. This research proposed some modified forms of entropy measures for an important lifetime distribution called Weibull distribution by considering the neutrosophic form of the data. The performance of the proposed methods is assessed via a simulation study and three real-life data applications. The simulation and real-life data examples suggested that the proposed methodologies of entropies for the Weibull distribution are more suitable when the random variable of the distribution is in an interval form and has indeterminacy or vagueness in it.},

First, the definitions of order consistency and multiplicative consistency of PDHFPRs are given. Then, for the problem that decision makers (DMs) cannot provide the reasonable associated probabilities of probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy elements (PDHFEs), the calculation method of the associated probability is given by using an optimal programming model. Furthermore, the consistency level for PDHFPRs is tested according to the weighted consistency index defined by the risk attitude of DMs. In addition, a convergent iterative algorithm is proposed to enhance the unacceptable consistent PDHFPRs’ consistency level. Finally, a GDM approach with incomplete PDHFPRs is established to obtain the ranking of the alternatives. The availability and rationality of the proposed decision making approach are demonstrated by analyzing the impact factors of haze weather.},

Such estimates often are biased. The goal is to find the best estimates for the unknown value of the population mean with minimum mean square error (MSE). The neutrosophic statistics, generalization of classical statistics tackles vague, indeterminate, uncertain information. Thus, for the first time under neutrosophic statistics, to overcome the issues of estimation of the population mean of neutrosophic data, we have developed the neutrosophic ratio-type estimators for estimating the mean of the finite population utilizing auxiliary information. The neutrosophic observation is of the form $${Z}_{N}={Z}_{L}+{Z}_{U}{I}_{N}\, {\rm where}\, {I}_{N}\in \left[{I}_{L}, {I}_{U}\right], {Z}_{N}\in [{Z}_{l}, {Z}_{u}]$$ . The proposed estimators are very helpful to compute results when dealing with ambiguous, vague, and neutrosophic-type data. The results of these estimators are not single-valued but provide an interval form in which our population parameter may have more chance to lie. It increases the efficiency of the estimators, since we have an estimated interval that contains the unknown value of the population mean provided a minimum MSE. The efficiency of the proposed neutrosophic ratio-type estimators is also discussed using neutrosophic data of temperature and also by using simulation. A comparison is also conducted to illustrate the usefulness of Neutrosophic Ratio-type estimators over the classical estimators.},

  abstract     = {By remarkably reducing real fitness evaluations, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs), especially hierarchical SAEAs, have been shown to be effective in solving computationally expensive optimization problems. The success of hierarchical SAEAs mainly profits from the potential benefit of their global surrogate models known as “blessing of uncertainty” and the high accuracy of local models. However, their performance leaves room for improvement on high-dimensional problems since now it is still challenging to build accurate enough local models due to the huge solution space. Directing against this issue, this study proposes a new hierarchical SAEA by training local surrogate models with the help of the random projection technique. Instead of executing training in the original high-dimensional solution space, the new algorithm first randomly projects training samples onto a set of low-dimensional subspaces, then trains a surrogate model in each subspace, and finally achieves evaluations of candidate solutions by averaging the resulting models. Experimental results on seven benchmark functions of 100 and 200 dimensions demonstrate that random projection can significantly improve the accuracy of local surrogate models and the new proposed hierarchical SAEA possesses an obvious edge over state-of-the-art SAEAs.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a feasible and reliable technique for the modeling of multi-parametric datasets. In real applications, there are different relationships with various complexities between sets of inputs and their corresponding outputs. As a result, various models have been developed with different levels of complexity in the input–output relationships. The group method of data handling (GMDH) employs a family of inductive algorithms for computer-based mathematical modeling grounded on a combination of quadratic and higher neurons in a certain number of variable layers. In this method, a vector of input features is mapped to the expected response by creating a multistage nonlinear pattern. Usually, each neuron of the GMDH is considered a quadratic partial function. In this paper, the basic structure of the GMDH technique is adapted by changing the partial functions to enhance the complexity modeling ability. To accomplish this, popular ML models that have shown reasonable function approximation performance, such as support vector regression and random forest, are used, and the basic polynomial functions in the GMDH are replaced by these ML models. The regression feasibility and validity of the ML-based GMDH models are confirmed by computer simulation.},

  abstract     = {Air pollution is a major issue resulting from the excessive use of conventional energy sources in developing countries and worldwide. Particulate Matter less than 2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) is the most dangerous air pollutant invading the human respiratory system and causing lung and heart diseases. Therefore, innovative air pollution forecasting methods and systems are required to reduce such risk. To that end, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled system for monitoring and predicting PM2.5 concentration on both edge devices and the cloud. This system employs a hybrid prediction architecture using several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms hosted by Nonlinear AutoRegression with eXogenous input (NARX). It uses the past 24 h of PM2.5, cumulated wind speed and cumulated rain hours to predict the next hour of PM2.5. This system was tested on a PC to evaluate cloud prediction and a Raspberry Pi to evaluate edge devices’ prediction. Such a system is essential, responding quickly to air pollution in remote areas with low bandwidth or no internet connection. The performance of our system was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IA), and duration in seconds. The obtained results highlighted that NARX/LSTM achieved the highest R2 and IA and the least RMSE and NRMSE, outperforming other previously proposed deep learning hybrid algorithms. In contrast, NARX/XGBRF achieved the best balance between accuracy and speed on the Raspberry Pi.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, chaos-guided artificial neural learning-based session key coordination for industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) to enhance the security of critical energy infrastructures (CEI) is proposed. An intruder might pose several security problems since the data are transferred across a public network. Although there have been substantial efforts to solve security problems in the IIoT, the majority of them have relied on traditional methods. A wide range of privacy issues (secrecy, authenticity, and access control) must be addressed to protect IIoT systems against attack. Owing to the unique characteristics of IIoT nodes, existing solutions do not properly address the entire security range of IIoT networks. To deal with this, a chaos-based triple layer vector-valued neural network (TLVVNN) is proposed in this paper. A chaos-based exchange of common seed value for the generation of the identical input vector at both transmitter and receiver is also proposed. This technique has several advantages, including (1) it protects IIoT devices by utilizing TLVVNN synchronization to improve CEI security. (2) Here, artificial neural coordination is utilized for the exchange of neural keys between two IIoT nodes. (3) Using this suggested methodology, chaotic synchronization can be achieved, enabling the chaos-based PRNG seed exchange. (4) Vector-valued inputs and weights are taken into consideration for TLVVNN networks. (5) The deep internal architecture is made up of three hidden layers of the neural network and a vector value as input. As a result, the attacker would have great difficulty interpreting the internal structure. Experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique are conducted, and the findings demonstrate that the proposed technique has greater performance benefits than the existing related techniques.},

  abstract     = {Transportation problem (TP) is a popular branch of Linear Programming Problem in the field of Transportation engineering. Over the years, attempts have been made in finding improved approaches to solve the TPs. Recently, in Quddoos et al. (Int J Comput Sci Eng (IJCSE) 4(7): 1271–1274, 2012), an efficient approach, namely ASM, is proposed for solving crisp TPs. However, it is found that ASM fails to provide better optimal solution in some cases. Therefore, a new and efficient ASM appoach is proposed in this paper to enhance the inherent mechanism of the existing ASM method to solve both crisp TPs and Triangular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transportation Problems (TIFTPs). A least-looping stepping-stone method has been employed as one of the key factors to improve the solution quality, which is an improved version of the existing stepping-stone method (Roy and Hossain in, Operation research Titus Publication, 2015). Unlike stepping stone method, least-looping stepping-stone method only deals with few selected non-basic cells under some prescribed conditions and hence minimizes the computational burden. Therefore, the framework of the proposed method (namely LS-ASM) is a combination of ASM (Quddoos et al. 2012) and least-looping stepping-stone approach. To validate the performance of LS-ASM, a set of six case studies and a real-world problem (those include both crisp TPs and TIFTPs) have been solved. The statistical results obtained by LS-ASM have been well compared with the existing popular modified distribution (MODI) method and the original ASM method, as well. The statistical results confirm the superiority of the LS-ASM over other compared algorithms with a less computationl effort.},

Special local search strategies can prevent the algorithm from being caught in the optimal solution. In addition, considering the time costs of the TSA, an adapted mutation strategy is proposed to operate the TSA mutation according to the scale of Pareto solutions. Random mutations may be applied to other conditions. Then, a robust evaluation is adopted to choose an appropriate solution from the obtained Pareto solutions set. NNITSA is used to solve the problems of static partitioning optimization and dynamic cross-regional co-operative scheduling of agricultural machinery. The simulation results show that NNITSA outperforms the other two algorithms, NNIA and NSGA-II.

  abstract     = {Quantifying predictive uncertainty in deep neural networks is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Existing quantification approaches can be categorized into two lines. Bayesian methods provide a complete uncertainty quantification theory but are often not scalable to large-scale models. Along another line, non-Bayesian methods have good scalability and can quantify uncertainty with high quality. The most remarkable idea in this line is Deep Ensemble, but it is limited in practice due to its expensive computational cost. Thus, we propose HatchEnsemble to improve the efficiency and practicality of Deep Ensemble. The main idea is to use function-preserving transformations, ensuring HatchNets to inherit the knowledge learned by a single model called SeedNet. This process is called hatching, and HatchNet can be obtained by continuously widening the SeedNet. Based on our method, two different hatches are proposed, respectively, for ensembling the same and different architecture networks. To ensure the diversity of models, we also add random noises to parameters during hatching. Experiments on both clean and corrupted datasets show that HatchEnsemble can give a competitive prediction performance and better-calibrated uncertainty quantification in a shorter time compared with baselines.},

  abstract     = {Different with the plain flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), the FJSP with routing flexibility is more complex and it can be deemed as the integrated process planning and (job shop) scheduling (IPPS) problem, where the process planning and the job shop scheduling two important functions are considered as a whole and optimized simultaneously to utilize the flexibility in a flexible manufacturing system. Although, many novel meta-heuristics have been introduced to address this problem and corresponding fruitful results have been observed; the dilemma in real-life applications of resultant scheduling schemes stems from the uncertainty or the nondeterminacy in processing times, since the uncertainty in processing times will disturb the predefined scheduling scheme by influencing unfinished operations. As a result, the performance of the manufacturing system will also be deteriorated. Nevertheless, research on such issue has seldom been considered before. This research focuses on the modeling and optimization method of the IPPS problem with uncertain processing times. The neutrosophic set is first introduced to model uncertain processing times. Due to the complexity in the math model, we developed an improved teaching-learning-based optimization(TLBO) algorithm to capture more robust scheduling schemes. In the proposed optimization method, the score values of the uncertain completion times on each machine are compared and optimized to obtain the most promising solution. Distinct levels of fluctuations or uncertainties on processing times are defined in testing the well-known Kim’s benchmark instances. The performance of computational results is analyzed and competitive solutions with smaller score values are obtained. Computational results show that more robust scheduling schemes with corresponding neutrosophic Gantt charts can be obtained; in general, the results of the improved TLBO algorithm suggested in this research are better than those of other algorithms with smaller score function values. The proposed method in this research gives ideas or clues for scheduling problems with uncertain processing times.},

In the past decades, emergency decision-making (EDM) has become a research hotspot and a lot of studies have been conducted for better managing emergency events under tight time constraint. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the literature on this topic. The objective of this paper is to provide academic community with a complete bibliometric analysis of the EDM researches to generate a global picture of developments, focus areas, and trends in the field. A total of 303 journal publications published between 2010 and 2020 were identified and analyzed using the VOSviewer in regard to cooperation network, co-citation network, and keyword co-occurrence network. The findings indicate that the annual publications in this research field have increased rapidly since 2014. Based on the cooperation network and co-citation network analyses, the most productive and influential countries, institutions, researchers, and their cooperation networks were identified. Using the co-citation network analysis, the landmark articles and the core journals in the EDM area are found out. With the help of the keyword co-occurrence network analysis, research hotspots and development of the EDM domain are determined. According to current trends and blind spots in the literature, possible directions for further investigation are finally suggested for EDM. The literature review results provide valuable information and new insights for both scholars and practitioners to grasp the current situation, hotspots and future research agenda of the EDM field.},

  abstract     = {Mangrove forests are considered to be the most productive ecosystem yet vanishing rapidly over the world. They are mostly found in the intertidal zone and sheltered by the seacoast. Mangroves have potential socio-economic benefits such as protecting the shoreline from storm and soil erosion, flood and flow control, acting as a carbon sink, provides a fertile breeding ground for marine species and fauna. It also acts as a source of income by providing various forest products. Restoration and conservation of mangrove forests remain a big challenge due to the large and inaccessible areas covered by mangroves forests which makes field assessment difficult and time-consuming. Remote sensing along with various digital image classification approaches seem to be promising in providing better and accurate results in mapping and monitoring the mangroves ecosystem. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the work undertaken, and addresses various remote sensing techniques applied for mapping and monitoring of the mangrove ecosystem, and summarize their potential and limitation. For that various digital image classification techniques are analyzed and compared based on the type of image used with its spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and other related image features along with the accuracy of the classification to derive specific class information related to mangroves. The digital image classification techniques used for mangrove mapping and monitoring in various studies can be classified into pixel-based, object-based, and knowledge-based classifiers. The various satellite image data analyzed are ranged from light detection and ranging (LiDAR), hyperspectral and multispectral optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and aerial imagery. Supervised state of the art machine learning/deep machine learning algorithms which use both pixel-based and object-based approaches and can be combined with the knowledge-based approach are widely used for classification purpose, due to the recent development and evolution in these techniques. There is a huge future scope to study the performance of these classification techniques in combination with various high spatial and spectral resolution optical imageries, SAR and LiDAR, and also with multi-sensor, multiresolution, and temporal data.},

  abstract     = {Query weight optimization, which aims to find an optimal combination of the weights of query terms for sorting relevant documents, is an important topic in the information retrieval system. Due to the huge search space, the query optimization problem is intractable, and evolutionary algorithms have become one popular approach. But as the size of the database grows, traditional retrieval approaches may return a lot of results, which leads to low efficiency and poor practicality. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage information retrieval system based on an interactive multimodal genetic algorithm (IMGA) for a query weight optimization system. The proposed IMGA has two stages: quantity control and quality optimization. In the quantity control stage, a multimodal genetic algorithm with the aid of the niching method selects multiple promising combinations of query terms simultaneously by which the numbers of retrieved documents are controlled in an appropriate range. In the quality optimization stage, an interactive genetic algorithm is designed to find the optimal query weights so that the most user-friendly document retrieval sequence can be yielded. Users’ feedback information will accelerate the optimization process, and a genetic algorithm (GA) performs interactively with the action of relevance feedback mechanism. Replacing user evaluation, a mathematical model is built to evaluate the fitness values of individuals. In the proposed two-stage method, not only the number of returned results can be controlled, but also the quality and accuracy of retrieval can be improved. The proposed method is run on the database which with more than 2000 documents. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art query weight optimization approaches in terms of the precision rate and the recall rate.},

The scheme fulfills the most fundamental aspect of encryption that is diffusion and confusion. For confusion highly non-linear, pre-defined S-boxes are used. The proposed scheme has been tested using state-of-the-art key performance indicators including differential analysis, statistical analysis. Information entropy analysis, mean square error, and NIST-based randomness analysis. The encrypted images have the highest practically achievable entropy of 7.999 and the time analysis shows that the proposed system is suitable for real-time implementation. The rest of the results indicates that the proposed cryptosystem possesses high immunity toward various attacks. The security analysis compared with the existing scheme shows the strength of the suggested scheme.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer is widely adopted in accelerating multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). To accelerate the learning speed of MARL for learning-from scratch agents, in this paper, we propose a Stationary and Scalable knowledge transfer approach based on Experience Sharing (S $$^{2}$$ ES). The mainframe of our approach is structured into three components: what kind of experience, how to learn, and when to transfer. Specifically, we first design an augmented form of experience. By sharing (i.e., transmitting) the experience from one agent to its peers, the learning speed can be effectively enhanced with guaranteed scalability. A synchronized learning pattern is then adopted, which reduces the nonstationarity brought by experience replay, and at the same time retains data efficiency. Moreover, to avoid redundant transfer when the agents’ policies have converged, we further design two trigger conditions, one is modified Q value-based and another is normalized Shannon entropy-based, to determine when to conduct experience sharing. Empirical studies indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the other knowledge transfer methods in efficacy, efficiency, and scalability. We also provide ablation experiments to demonstrate the necessity of the key ingredients.},

In this paper, a novel adaptive MOPSO (ANMPSO) algorithm based on R2 contribution and adaptive method is developed to improve the performance of MOPSO. First, a new global best solutions selection mechanism with R2 contribution is introduced to select leaders with better diversity and convergence. Second, to obtain a uniform distribution of particles, an adaptive method is used to guide the flight of particles. Third, a re-initialization strategy is proposed to prevent particles from trapping into local optima. Empirical studies on a large number (64 in total) of problem instances have demonstrated that ANMPSO performs well in terms of inverted generational distance and hyper-volume metrics. Experimental studies on the practical application have also revealed that ANMPSO could effectively solve problems in the real world.},

  abstract     = {The importance of risk assessment in the context of occupational health and safety by manufacturing operators strengthens their hands in solving the problems they may encounter in business processes related to health and safety. One of the most important phases of conducting an exhaustive occupational risk assessment is to analyze potential hazards and associated risks quantitatively. Since manufacturing is one of the industries that require workers to be highly exposed to work, creating a safer environment to reduce occupational injuries is an important task. This study proposes a novel fuzzy risk assessment approach developed by integrating Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method for ranking potential hazards in manufacturing. FFSs are a new version of fuzzy set theory that covers the intuitionistic fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. This version of the fuzzy set is crucial in the decision-making process to handle uncertain information more easily and reflect uncertainty better. A linguistic scale under Fermatean fuzzy documentation has also been developed for experts/decision makers to disclose their judgments easily. Occupational risk analysts can benefit from this approach since FFSs are used for the first time in occupational risk assessment, and the approach is presented in integration with TOPSIS. The proposed approach is applied in the aluminum plate-manufacturing process risk assessment. In the conclusion of the implementation, risks arising in the production are prioritized. In addition, this study made comparisons with other fuzzy methods to demonstrate the proposed approach’s difference and practicality. This study’s results can support practitioners and risk analysts in formulating the improvement measures to increase the safety of the work environment further.},

Second, several decision-making models are developed in view of the proposed additive/multiplicatively consistent HFBWPRs. The main characteristic of the constructed models is that they consider all the values included in the HFBWPRs and consider the same and different compromise limit constraints. Third, an absolute programming model is developed to obtain the decision-makers’ objective weights utilizing the information of optimal priority weight vectors and provides the calculation of decision-makers’ comprehensive weights. Finally, a framework of the MCDM procedure based on hesitant fuzzy BWM is introduced, and an illustrative example in conjunction with comparative analysis is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed models.},

It should be handled carefully towards making the solutions for proficient healthcare. Reducing the impact of air pollution on human health is possible only if the data is correctly classified. In numerous classification problems, we are facing the class imbalance issue. Learning from imbalanced data is always a challenging task for researchers, and from time to time, possible solutions have been developed by researchers. In this paper, we are focused on dealing with the imbalanced class distribution in a way that the classification algorithm will not compromise its performance. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of the adjusting kernel scaling (AKS) method to deal with the multi-class imbalanced dataset. The kernel function&#39;s selection has been evaluated with the help of weighting criteria and the chi-square test. All the experimental evaluation has been performed on sensor-based Indian Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) dataset. The proposed algorithm with the highest accuracy of 99.66% wins the race among all the classification algorithms i.e. Adaboost (59.72%), Multi-Layer Perceptron (95.71%), GaussianNB (80.87%), and SVM (96.92). The results of the proposed algorithm are also better than the existing literature methods. It is also clear from these results that our proposed algorithm is efficient for dealing with class imbalance problems along with enhanced performance. Thus, accurate classification of air quality through our proposed algorithm will be useful for improving the existing preventive policies and will also help in enhancing the capabilities of effective emergency response in the worst pollution situation.},

In this paper, data analysis and text mining techniques, technology opportunity analysis (TOA) and technology-service evolution analysis (TSEA) have been applied to analyze and observe IoT technologies’ and services’ evolution. Academic journals, market reports, and patents have been collected and reviewed on the topic of IoT in the logistics field in this paper. Moreover, by using TOA, technology opportunities have been analyzed to explore IoT-related logistics services. The results of TOA, for example, show that cloud technology is essential to develop smart logistics services, and communication RFID technologies are key to developing information logistics services. Finally, TSEA enables the observation of IoT technology and logistics service evolution by combining unstructured and semi-structured data from text documents. Observing the results of TSEA, the evolution of IoT in logistics is identified, and the results of TSEA also confirm those of TOA using unstructured or semi-structured text data from documents only. The results of this paper are discussed and compared with those of some previous review studies.

  abstract     = {Under the current volatile business environment, the requirement of flexible production is becoming increasingly urgent. As an innovative production mode, seru-system with reconfigurability can overcome the lack of flexibility in traditional flow lines. Compared with pure seru-system, the hybrid seru-system composed of both serus and production lines is more practical for adapting to many production processes. This paper addresses a specific hybrid seru-system scheduling optimization problem (HSSOP), which includes three strongly coupled sub-problems, i.e., hybrid seru formation, seru scheduling and flow line scheduling. To minimize the makespan of the whole hybrid seru-system, we propose an efficient cooperative coevolution algorithm (CCA). To tackle three sub-problems, specific sub-algorithms are designed based on the characteristic of each sub-problem, i.e., a sub-space exploitation algorithm for hybrid seru formation, an estimation of distribution algorithm for seru scheduling, and a first-arrive-first-process heuristic for flow line scheduling. Since three sub-problems are coupled, a cooperation coevolution mechanism is proposed for the integrated algorithm by information sharing. Moreover, a batch reassign rule is designed to overcome the mismatch of partial solutions during cooperative coevolution. To enhance the exploitation ability, problem-specific local search methods are designed and embedded in the CCA. In addition to the investigation about the effect of parameter setting, extensive computational tests and comparisons are carried out which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the CCA in solving the HSSOP.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem (LSDVRP) is exhibiting extensive application prospect with the rapid growth of online logistics, whereas a few approaches have been developed to address LSDVRPs. The difficulty in solving LSDVRPs lies in that it requires quick response and high adaptability to numerous newly appeared customers in LSDVRPs. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we propose a responsive ant colony optimization algorithm, termed as RACO, for efficiently addressing LSDVRPs. In the proposed RACO, a pheromone diversity enhancing method is suggested to generate diverse pheromone matrices for quickly responding to newly appeared customer requests in solving LSDVRPs. A pheromone ensemble technique is further designed to produce a high-quality initial population that well adapts to the new customer requests by making use of diverse pheromone matrices. Empirical results on a set of 12 LSDVRP test instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested pheromone diversity enhancing method in quickly responding to newly appeared customer requests for solving LSDVRPs. Moreover, we investigate the computational cost and the traveling cost obtained by the proposed RACO to evaluate responsiveness and adaptability of the proposed RACO, respectively. Comparison with four state-of-the-art approaches to DVRPs validates the superiority of the proposed RACO in addressing LSDVRPs in terms of responsiveness and adaptability.},

In this system, a user from a remote area and a server located at the hospital can establish a connection to share the necessary information between them. But, it is very clear that all the information is always being transmitted over a public channel. Chaotic map possesses a dynamic structure and it plays a very important role in the construction of a secure and efficient authentication protocols, but they are generally found vulnerable to identity-guess, password-guess, impersonation, and stolen smart-card. We have analyzed (Li et al. in Fut Gen Comput Syst 840:149–159, 2018; Madhusudhan and Nayak Chaitanya in A robust authentication scheme for telecare medical information systems, 2008; Zhang et al in Privacy protection for telecare medicine information systems using a chaotic map-based three-factor authenticated key agreement scheme, 2017; Dharminder and Gupta in Pratik security analysis and application of Chebyshev Chaotic map in the authentication protocols, 2019) and found that Bergamo’s attack (IEEE Trans Circ Syst 52(7):1382–1393, 2005) cannot be resisted by the protocol. Although few of the protocols ensures efficient computations but they cannot ensure an anonymous and secure communication. Therefore, we have proposed a secure and efficient chaotic map based authentication protocol that can be used in telecare medicine information system. This protocol supports verified session keys with only two messages of exchange. Moreover, we have analysed the performance of proposed protocol with relevant protocols and it is being implemented in “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications” respectively.},

  abstract     = {One of the most powerful tools to operate imprecision is bipolar complex fuzzy sets (BCFSs), which is an enlargement of bipolar fuzzy sets (BFSs) as well as complex fuzzy sets (CFSs). This paper deals with an integrated MULTIMOORA (multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis plus full multiplicative form) framework as a generalization of fuzzy MULTIMOORA procedure to assess the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems with BCFSs. We develop BCF-Archimedean power weighted (ordered weighted) arithmetic and geometric aggregation operators (AOs) and discuss their properties from this point of view. The proposed Archimedean power-weighted AOs can eliminate the influence of extreme evaluating criteria values from some biased experts with different preference attitudes under the BCF setting. Afterward, we put forward an integrated MULTIMOORA algorithm based on the proposed AOs, where criteria weights are estimated using the CRITIC (criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation) method, which is a well-known objective weighting method based on aggregated score values of options, intensity contrast of every criteria and conflict among attributes. In the proposed methodology, criteria values are aggregated based on the MULTIMOORA method that involves three sub-methods: the ‘ratio system’, the ‘reference point’ and the ‘full multiplicative form’ and thus takes less computational time, minimum mathematical evaluations and bears good stability. In the following, third-party reverse logistics providers&#39; (3PRLP) selection problem is brought into consideration to manifest the sufficiency of the developed methodology. At the end of this study, we draw attention to a comparison between the proposed decision-making approach with the corresponding BCF-CRITIC-TOPSIS and BCF-CRITIC-WASPAS methods.},

As a result, millions of reviews are generated daily, making it difficult to make a good decision about whether a consumer should buy a product. Analyzing these enormous concepts is difficult and time-consuming for product manufacturers. Deep learning is the current research interest in Natural language processing. In the proposed model, Skip-gram architecture is used for better feature extraction of semantic and contextual information of words. LSTM (long short-term memory) is used in the proposed model for understanding complex patterns in textual data. To improve the performance of the LSTM, weight parameters are optimized by the adaptive particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets proved that our proposed APSO-LSTM model secured higher accuracy over the classical methods such as traditional LSTM, ANN, and SVM.

  abstract     = {Medical services inevitably generate healthcare waste (HCW) that may become hazardous to healthcare staffs, patients, the population, and the atmosphere. In most of the developing countries, HCW disposal management has become one of the fastest-growing challenges for urban municipalities and healthcare providers. Determining the location for HCW disposal centers is a relatively complex process due to the involvement of various alternatives, criteria, and strict government guidelines about the disposal of HCW. The objective of the paper is to introduce the WASPAS (weighted aggregated sum product assessment) method with Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) for the HCW disposal location selection problem. This method combines the score function, entropy measure, and classical WASPAS approach within FFSs context. Next, a combined procedure using entropy and score function is proposed to estimate the criteria weights. To do this, a novel score function with its desirable properties and some entropy measures are introduced under the FFSs context. Further, an illustrative case study of the HCW disposal location selection problem on FFSs is established, which evidences the practicality and efficacy of the developed approach. Comparative discussion and sensitivity analysis are made to monitor the permanence of the introduced framework. The final results approve that the proposed methodology can effectively handle the ambiguity and inaccuracy in the decision-making procedure of HCW disposal location selection.},

As a vital data form of sensor data, time series has three main types of anomaly: point anomaly, pattern anomaly, and sequence anomaly. In production environments, the analysis of pattern anomaly is the most rewarding one. However, the traditional processing model cloud computing is crippled in front of large amount of widely distributed data. This paper presents an edge-cloud collaboration architecture for pattern anomaly detection of time series. A task migration algorithm is developed to alleviate the problem of backlogged detection tasks at edge node. Besides, the detection tasks related to long-term correlation and short-term correlation in time series are allocated to cloud and edge node, respectively. A multi-dimensional feature representation scheme is devised to conduct efficient dimension reduction. Two key components of the feature representation trend identification and feature point extraction are elaborated. Based on the result of feature representation, pattern anomaly detection is performed with an improved kernel density estimation method. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted with synthetic data sets and real-world data sets.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) models are highly research-oriented field in image compressive sensing in the recent studies. In compressive sensing theory, a signal is efficiently reconstructed from very small and limited number of measurements. Block-based compressive sensing is most promising and lenient compressive sensing (CS) approach mostly used to process large-sized videos and images: exploit low computational complexity and requires less memory. In block-based compressive sensing, a number of deep models are needed to train with each corresponding to different sampling rate. Compressive sensing performance is highly degraded through allocating low sampling rates to various blocks within same image or video frames. In this work, we proposed multi-rate method using deep neural networks for block-based compressive sensing of magnetic resonance images with performance that greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach is capable in smart allocation of exclusive sampling rate for each block within image, based on the image information and removing blocking artifacts in reconstructed MRI images. Each image block is separately sampled and reconstructed with different sampling rate and reassembled into a single image based on inter-correlation between blocks, to remove blocking artifacts. The proposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-arts in terms of reconstruction speed, reconstruction error, low computational complexity, and certain evaluation metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), feature similarity (FSIM), and relative l2-norm error (RLNE).},

The primary idea is to divide the population into different clusters, and offspring are generated within a cluster or between two clusters. However, the problems of inefficient clustering strategy and insufficient exploration exist in BSO. In this paper, a novel and efficient BSO is proposed, called BSO20 (proposed in 2020). BSO20 pays attention to both the clustering strategy and the mutation strategy. First, we propose a hybrid clustering strategy, which combines two clustering strategies, i.e., nearest-better clustering and random grouping strategy. The size of the subpopulation clustered by two strategies is dynamically adjusted as the population evolves. Second, a modified mutation strategy is used in BSO20 to share information within a cluster or among multiple clusters to enhance the ability of exploration. BSO20 is tested on the problems of the 2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation competition on real parameter numerical optimization. BSO20 is compared with several variants of BSO and two variants of particle swarm optimization, and the experimental results show that BSO20 is competitive.},

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person’s life. Autism is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Lack of social interaction, communication problems, and a limited range of behaviors and interests are possible characteristics of autism in children, alongside other symptoms. Electroencephalograms provide useful information about changes in brain activity and hence are efficaciously used for diagnosis of neurological disease. Eighteen nonlinear features were extracted from EEG signals of 40 children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and 37 children with no diagnosis of neuro developmental disorder children. Feature selection was performed using Student’s t test, and Marginal Fisher Analysis was employed for data reduction. The features were ranked according to Student’s t test. The three most significant features were used to develop the autism index, while the ranked feature set was input to SVM polynomials 1, 2, and 3 for classification. The SVM polynomial 2 yielded the highest classification accuracy of 98.70% with 20 features. The developed classification system is likely to aid healthcare professionals as a diagnostic tool to detect autism. With more data, in our future work, we intend to employ deep learning models and to explore a cloud-based detection system for the detection of autism. Our study is novel, as we have analyzed all nonlinear features, and we are one of the first groups to have uniquely developed an autism (ASD) index using the extracted features.},

  abstract     = {It is beneficial to automate the process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpora since a manual construction of concept hierarchies is typically a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. As such, the overall process of learning concept hierarchies from corpora encompasses a set of steps: parsing the text into sentences, splitting the sentences and then tokenising it. After the lemmatisation step, the pairs are extracted using formal context analysis (FCA). However, there might be some uninteresting and erroneous pairs in the formal context. Generating formal context may lead to a time-consuming process, so formal context size reduction is require to remove uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less time to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In this premise, this study aims to propose two frameworks: (1) A framework to review the current process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpus utilising formal concept analysis (FCA); (2) A framework to decrease the formal context’s ambiguity of the first framework using an adaptive version of evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECA*). Experiments are conducted by applying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the reducing size of formal context, which leads to yield concept lattice and concept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context is evaluated to the standard one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic between the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies by 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits the structural relation of the standard one. The adaptive ECA* is examined against its four counterpart baseline algorithms (Fuzzy K-means, JBOS approach, AddIntent algorithm, and FastAddExtent) to measure the execution time on random datasets with different densities (fill ratios). The results show that adaptive ECA* performs concept lattice faster than other mentioned competitive techniques in different fill ratios.},

Although many competitive surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have been proposed, it remains a challenging issue to develop an effective model management strategy to address problems with different landscape features under a limited computational budget. This paper adopts a coarse-to-fine evaluation scheme basing on two surrogate models, i.e., a coarse Gaussian process and a fine radial basis function, for assisting a differential evolution algorithm to solve computationally expensive optimization problems. The coarse Gaussian process model is meant to capture the general contour of the fitness landscape to estimate the fitness and its degree of uncertainty. A surrogate-assisted environmental selection strategy is then developed according to the non-dominance relationship between approximated fitness and estimated uncertainty. Meanwhile, the fine radial basis function model aims to learn the details of the local fitness landscape to refine the approximation quality of the new parent population and find the local optima for real-evaluations. The performance and scalability of the proposed method are extensively evaluated on two sets of widely used benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the proposed method can outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms within a limited computational budget.},

GACO model is a blend of two well known meta-heuristic optimization algorithms known as Simple Ant Colony and Global Ant Colony Optimization algorithms. Basically, the work talks about the solution of NURBS-fitting based reconstruction process. Therefore, GACO model is used to optimize the NURBS parameters (control points and weights) by minimizing the weighted least-square errors between the data points and the fitted NURBS curve. The algorithm is applied by first assuming some pre-fixed values of NURBS parameters. The experiments clearly show that the optimization procedure is a better option in a case where good initial locations of parameters are selected. A detailed experimental analysis is given in support of our algorithm. The implemented error analysis shows that the proposed methodology perform better as compared to the conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Most existing methods for forecasting the productivity of a factory cannot estimate the range of productivity reliably, especially when future conditions are distinct from those in the past. To address this issue, a fuzzified feedforward neural network (FFNN) approach is proposed in this study. The FFNN approach improves the forecasting precision after generating accurate fuzzy productivity forecasts. In addition, the acceptable range of a fuzzy productivity forecast is specified, based on which the sum of the memberships of actual values is maximized. In this way, the range of productivity can be precisely estimated. After applying the FFNN approach to a real case, the experimental results revealed the superiority of the FFNN approach by improving the forecasting precision, in terms of the hit rate, by 25%. Such an improvement also contributed to a better forecasting accuracy. The superiority of the FFNN approach is in the context that the accuracy of forecasting productivity is optimized only after the range of productivity has been precisely estimated. In contrast, most state-of-the-art methods focus on optimizing the forecasting accuracy, but may be ineffective without information about the range of productivity when future conditions are distinct from the past.},

  abstract     = {Face image features represent significant user privacy concerns. Face images cannot be privately transferred under existing privacy protection methods, and data across various social networks are unevenly distributed. This paper proposes a method for face image privacy protection based on federated learning and ensemble models. A federated learning model based on distributed data sets was established by means of federated learning. On the client side, a local facial recognition model was obtained by local face data training and used as the input of PcadvGAN to train PcadvGAN for several rounds. On the server side, a parameter aggregator based on a differential evolutionary algorithm was established as the discriminator of PcadvGAN server, and a client facial recognition model was ensembled simultaneously. The discriminator of the PcadvGAN server experienced mutation, crossover, and interaction with the ensemble model to reveal the optimal global weight of the PcadvGAN model. Finally, the global optimal aggregation parameter matrix of PcadvGAN was obtained by calculation. The server and the client shared the global optimal aggregation parameter matrix, enabling each client to generate private face images with high transferability and practicality. Targeted attack and non-targeted attack experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can generate high-quality, transferable, robust, private face images with only minor perturbations more effectively than other existing methods.},

Motivated by these features of PHFI, an approach is presented to solve the decision problem with partial known information about the attribute and expert weights. In addition, an algorithm for finding some missing values in the preference information is presented and stated their properties. Afterward, the Hamy mean operator has been used to aggregate the different collective information into a single one. Also, we presented a COPRAS method to the PHFI for ranking the given alternatives. The presented algorithm has been demonstrated through a case study of cloud vendor selection and its validity has been revealed by comparing the approach results with the several existing algorithm results.},

In this manuscript, the novel concept of CFN-SS is explored and their fundamental laws are discussed. CFN-SS contains the grade of truth in the form of a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are limited to the unit interval. Besides, we examine some algebraic properties for CFN-SS like union, intersections and justify these properties with the help of some numerical examples. To examine the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the special cases of the investigated approaches are also discussed. A decision-making procedure is developed by using the investigated ideas based on CFN-SSs. Further, some numerical examples are also illustrated with the help of explored ideas to find the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, the comparative analysis of the investigated ideas with some existing ideas is also demonstrated to prove the quality of the proposed works.

Zero-day attack(s) targeting unknown vulnerabilities of a software or system opens up further research direction in the field of cyber-attacks. Existing approaches either uses ML/DNN or anomaly-based approach to protect against these attacks. Detecting zero-day attacks through these techniques miss several parameters like frequency of particular byte streams in network traffic and their correlation. Covering attacks that produce lower traffic is difficult through neural network models because it requires higher traffic for correct prediction. This paper proposes a novel robust and intelligent cyber-attack detection model to cover the issues mentioned above using the concept of heavy-hitter and graph technique to detect zero-day attacks. The proposed work consists of two phases (a) Signature generation and (b) Evaluation phase. This model evaluates the performance using generated signatures at the training phase. The result analysis of the proposed zero-day attack detection shows higher performance for accuracy of 91.33% for the binary classification and accuracy of 90.35% for multi-class classification on real-time attack data. The performance against benchmark data set CICIDS18 shows a promising result of 91.62% for binary-class classification on this model. Thus, the proposed approach shows an encouraging result to detect zero-day attacks.},

First, an elite network is constructed by selecting elite particles and recording their successful search behavior. Then the network is trained and evaluated to effectively predict the particle velocity. In the periodic wastewater treatment process, the RLPSO runs repeatedly according to the optimized cycle. Finally, RLPSO was tested based on Benchmark Simulation Model 1 (BSM1) of sewage treatment, and the simulation results showed that it could effectively reduce the energy consumption on the premise of ensuring qualified water quality. Furthermore, the performance of RLPSO was analyzed using the benchmarks with higher dimension, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm and provides the possibility for RLPSO to be applied to a wider range of problems.},

The pivotal reason behind this phenomenon happens to be the ability of OSNs to provide a platform for users to connect with their family, friends, and colleagues. The information shared in social network and media spreads very fast, almost instantaneously which makes it attractive for attackers to gain information. Secrecy and surety of OSNs need to be inquired from various positions. There are numerous security and privacy issues related to the user’s shared information especially when a user uploads personal content such as photos, videos, and audios. The attacker can maliciously use shared information for illegitimate purposes. The risks are even higher if children are targeted. To address these issues, this paper presents a thorough review of different security and privacy threats and existing solutions that can provide security to social network users. We have also discussed OSN attacks on various OSN web applications by citing some statistics reports. In addition to this, we have discussed numerous defensive approaches to OSN security.

  abstract     = {Determining the methods for fulfilling the continuously increasing customer expectations and maintaining competitiveness in the market while limiting controllable expenses is challenging. Our study thus identifies inefficiencies in the supply chain network (SCN). The initial goal is to obtain the best allocation order for products from various sources with different destinations in an optimal manner. This study considers two types of decision-makers (DMs) operating at two separate groups of SCN, that is, a bi-level decision-making process. The first-level DM moves first and determines the amounts of the quantity transported to distributors, and the second-level DM then rationally chooses their amounts. First-level decision-makers (FLDMs) aimed at minimizing the total costs of transportation, while second-level decision-makers (SLDM) attempt to simultaneously minimize the total delivery time of the SCN and balance the allocation order between various sources and destinations. This investigation implements fuzzy goal programming (FGP) to solve the multi-objective of SCN in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The FGP concept was used to define the fuzzy goals, build linear and nonlinear membership functions, and achieve the compromise solution. A real-life case study was used to illustrate the proposed work. The obtained result shows the optimal quantities transported from the various sources to the various destinations that could enable managers to detect the optimum quantity of the product when hierarchical decision-making involving two levels. A case study then illustrates the application of the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {Heart sound segmentation (HSS) aims to detect the four stages (first sound, systole, second heart sound and diastole) from a heart cycle in a phonocardiogram (PCG), which is an essential step in automatic auscultation analysis. Traditional HSS methods need to manually extract the features before dealing with HSS tasks. These artificial features highly rely on extraction algorithms, which often result in poor performance due to the different operating environments. In addition, the high-dimension and frequency characteristics of audio also challenge the traditional methods in effectively addressing HSS tasks. This paper presents a novel end-to-end method based on convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM), which directly uses audio recording as input to address HSS tasks. Particularly, the convolutional layers are designed to extract the meaningful features and perform the downsampling, and the LSTM layers are developed to conduct the sequence recognition. Both components collectively improve the robustness and adaptability in processing the HSS tasks. Furthermore, the proposed CLSTM algorithm is easily extended to other complex heart sound annotation tasks, as it does not need to extract the characteristics of corresponding tasks in advance. In addition, the proposed algorithm can also be regarded as a powerful feature extraction tool, which can be integrated into the existing models for HSS.

  abstract     = {Many real-life datasets are imbalanced in nature, which implies that the number of samples present in one class (minority class) is exceptionally less compared to the number of samples found in the other class (majority class). Hence, if we directly fit these datasets to a standard classifier for training, then it often overlooks the minority class samples while estimating class separating hyperplane(s) and as a result of that it missclassifies the minority class samples. To solve this problem, over the years, many researchers have followed different approaches. However the selection of the true representative samples from the majority class is still considered as an open research problem. A better solution for this problem would be helpful in many applications like fraud detection, disease prediction and text classification. Also, the recent studies show that it needs not only analyzing disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties rooted in the nature of different data and thereby it needs more flexible, self-adaptable, computationally efficient and real-time method for selection of majority class samples without loosing much of important data from it. Keeping this fact in mind, we have proposed a hybrid model constituting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a popular swarm intelligence-based meta-heuristic algorithm, and Ring Theory (RT)-based Evolutionary Algorithm (RTEA), a recently proposed physics-based meta-heuristic algorithm. We have named the algorithm as RT-based PSO or in short RTPSO. RTPSO can select the most representative samples from the majority class as it takes advantage of the efficient exploration and the exploitation phases of its parent algorithms for strengthening the search process. We have used AdaBoost classifier to observe the final classification results of our model. The effectiveness of our proposed method has been evaluated on 15 standard real-life datasets having low to extreme imbalance ratio. The performance of the RTPSO has been compared with PSO, RTEA and other standard undersampling methods. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of RTPSO over state-of-the-art class imbalance problem-solvers considered here for comparison.

For this purpose, a DSS has been developed by the combination of the data-driven Bayesian network (BN) and the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). First, all of the data are utilized to extract the evidence-based paired (EBP) relationships between symptoms and symptoms’ impact probability. Then, the results are evaluated in both independent and combined scenarios. After categorizing data in the triple severity levels by self-organizing map, the EBP relationships between symptoms are extracted by BN, and their significance is achieved and ranked by FCM. The results show that the most common symptoms necessarily do not have the key role in distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19, and extracting the EBP relationships could have better insight into the severity of the disease.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumor is a group of anomalous cells. The brain is enclosed in a more rigid skull. The abnormal cell grows and initiates a tumor. Detection of tumor is a complicated task due to irregular tumor shape. The proposed technique contains four phases, which are lesion enhancement, feature extraction and selection for classification, localization, and segmentation. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are noisy due to certain factors, such as image acquisition, and fluctuation in magnetic field coil. Therefore, a homomorphic wavelet filer is used for noise reduction. Later, extracted features from inceptionv3 pre-trained model and informative features are selected using a non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm (NSGA). The optimized features are forwarded for classification after which tumor slices are passed to YOLOv2-inceptionv3 model designed for the localization of tumor region such that features are extracted from depth-concatenation (mixed-4) layer of inceptionv3 model and supplied to YOLOv2. The localized images are passed to McCulloch&#39;s Kapur entropy method to segment actual tumor region. Finally, the proposed technique is validated on three benchmark databases BRATS 2018, BRATS 2019, and BRATS 2020 for tumor detection. The proposed method achieved greater than 0.90 prediction scores in localization, segmentation and classification of brain lesions. Moreover, classification and segmentation outcomes are superior as compared to existing methods.},

These simulations allow to reduce time and cost compared to wind tunnel experiments or flight tests. However, for complex configurations, CFD simulations may still take several hours using high-performance computers to deliver results. For this reason, surrogate models are currently starting to be considered as a substitute of the CFD tool with a reasonable prediction. This paper presents a review on surrogate regression models for aerodynamic coefficient prediction, in particular for the prediction of lift and drag coefficients. To compare the behaviour of the regression models, three different aeronautical configurations have been used, a NACA0012 airfoil, a RAE2822 airfoil and 3D DPW wing. These databases are also freely provided to the scientific community to allow other researchers to make further comparison with other methods.},

  abstract     = {Neural synchronization is a technique for establishing the cryptographic key exchange protocol over a public channel. Two neural networks receive common inputs and exchange their outputs. In some steps, it leads to full synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the specific rule of learning. This synchronized weight is used as a common secret session key. But there are seldom research is done to investigate the synchronization of a cluster of neural networks. In this paper, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based synchronization of a cluster of neural networks with three hidden layers is proposed for the development of the public-key exchange protocol. This paper highlights a variety of interesting improvements to traditional GAN architecture. Here GAN is used for Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG) for neural synchronization. Each neural network is considered as a node of a binary tree framework. When both i-th and j-th nodes of the binary tree are synchronized then one of these two nodes is elected as a leader. Now, this leader node will synchronize with the leader of the other branch. After completion of this process synchronized weight becomes the session key for the whole cluster. This proposed technique has several advantages like (1) There is no need to synchronize one neural network to every other in the cluster instead of that entire cluster can be able to share the same secret key by synchronizing between the elected leader nodes with only logarithmic synchronization steps. (2) This proposed technology provides GAN-based PRNG which is very sensitive to the initial seed value. (3) Three hidden layers leads to the complex internal architecture of the Tree Parity Machine (TPM). So, it will be difficult for the attacker to guess the internal architecture. (4) An increase in the weight range of the neural network increases the complexity of a successful attack exponentially but the effort to build the neural key decreases over the polynomial time. (5) The proposed technique also offers synchronization and authentication steps in parallel. It is difficult for the attacker to distinguish between synchronization and authentication steps. This proposed technique has been passed through different parametric tests. Simulations of the process show effectiveness in terms of cited results in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition system from speech signal is a widely researched topic in the design of the Human–Computer Interface (HCI) models, since it provides insights into the mental states of human beings. Often, it is required to identify the emotional condition of the humans as cognitive feedback in the HCI. In this paper, an attempt to recognize seven emotional states from speech signals, known as sad, angry, disgust, happy, surprise, pleasant, and neutral sentiment, is investigated. The proposed method employs a non-linear signal quantifying method based on randomness measure, known as the entropy feature, for the detection of emotions. Initially, the speech signals are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF), where the IMF signals are divided into dominant frequency bands such as the high frequency, mid-frequency , and base frequency. The entropy measures are computed directly from the high-frequency band in the IMF domain. However, for the mid- and base-band frequencies, the IMFs are averaged and their entropy measures are computed. A feature vector is formed from the computed entropy measures incorporating the randomness feature for all the emotional signals. Then, the feature vector is used to train a few state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine. A tenfold cross-validation, performed on a publicly available Toronto Emotional Speech dataset, illustrates that the LDA classifier presents a peak balanced accuracy of 93.3%, F1 score of 87.9%, and an area under the curve value of 0.995 in the recognition of emotions from speech signals of native English speakers.},

  abstract     = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a kind of valuable bioelectric signal and very potential in the field of human–machine interaction. Ideal interactions require sEMG based patterns recognition not only with high accuracy but also with good rapidity. However, too much real-time feature-related computation will greatly slow down the interaction, especially for multichannel sEMG. To decrease the feature-related time consumption, the paper formulates the feature reduction as an optimization problem, and develops a double-phases particle swarm optimization (PSO) with hybrid coding to solve the problem. In the research, the initial feature data set with 31 kinds of feature is built firstly based on eight subjects’ 16 channels forearm sEMG signals, then PSO is introduced to conduct the feature reduction of 31 × 16 dimensions through the feature and channel optimization in double phases. During the optimization, two improved k-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods such as weighted representation based KNN (WRKNN) and weighted local mean representation based KNN (WLMRKNN) are introduced to classify the gestures, and the classification accuracy is used to evaluate the particles of PSO. Experimental results and comparison analysis show that PSO based feature reduction methods outperform genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) and principal component analysis (PCA) based feature reduction methods. With the optimized feature data subset by PSO, WRKNN and WLMRKNN are superior to KNN, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and naive bayes (NB) greatly. The proposed method can be applied in the pattern recognition of high dimensional sEMG with multichannel or high-density channels for the purpose of rapidity and without a decline of accuracy in real-time control. Further, it can be used to reduce the economic cost of the personalized customization equipment through the optimal channels for any subjects in the future.},

  abstract     = {Due to apparent flexibility of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) concepts in dealing with the imprecision or uncertainty, these are proving to be quite useful in many application areas for a more human consistent reasoning under imperfectly defined facts and imprecise knowledge. In this paper, we apply notions of entropy and intuitionistic fuzzy sets to present a new fuzzy decision-making approach called intuitionistic fuzzy entropy measure for selection and ranking the suppliers with respect to the attributes. An entropy-based model is formulated and applied to a real case study aiming to examine the rankings of suppliers. Furthermore, the weights for each alternative, with respect to the criteria, are calculated using intuitionistic fuzzy entropy measure. The supplier with the highest weight is selected as the best alternative. This proposed model helps the decision-makers in better understanding of the weight of each criterion without relying on the mere expertise.},

The studies in HCI emphasize on system use, creation of new techniques that support user activities, access to information, and ensures seamless communication. The use of artificial intelligence and deep learning-based models has been extensive across various domains yielding state-of-the-art results. In the present study, a crow search-based convolution neural networks model has been implemented in gesture recognition pertaining to the HCI domain. The hand gesture dataset used in the study is a publicly available one, downloaded from Kaggle. In this work, a one-hot encoding technique is used to convert the categorical data values to binary form. This is followed by the implementation of a crow search algorithm (CSA) for selecting optimal hyper-parameters for training of dataset using the convolution neural networks. The irrelevant parameters are eliminated from consideration, which contributes towards enhancement of accuracy in classifying the hand gestures. The model generates 100 percent training and testing accuracy that justifies the superiority of the model against traditional state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Receiving an accurate emotional response from robots has been a challenging task for researchers for the past few years. With the advancements in technology, robots like service robots interact with users of different cultural and lingual backgrounds. The traditional approach towards speech emotion recognition cannot be utilized to enable the robot and give an efficient and emotional response. The conventional approach towards speech emotion recognition uses the same corpus for both training and testing of classifiers to detect accurate emotions, but this approach cannot be generalized for multi-lingual environments, which is a requirement for robots used by people all across the globe. In this paper, a series of experiments are conducted to highlight an ensemble learning effect using a majority voting technique for cross-corpus, multi-lingual speech emotion recognition system. A comparison of the performance of an ensemble learning approach against traditional machine learning algorithms is performed. This study tests a classifier’s performance trained on one corpus with data from another corpus to evaluate its efficiency for multi-lingual emotion detection. According to experimental analysis, different classifiers give the highest accuracy for different corpora. Using an ensemble learning approach gives the benefit of combining all classifiers’ effect instead of choosing one classifier and compromising certain language corpus’s accuracy. Experiments show an increased accuracy of 13% for Urdu corpus, 8% for German corpus, 11% for Italian corpus, and 5% for English corpus from with-in corpus testing. For cross-corpus experiments, an improvement of 2% when training on Urdu data and testing on German data and 15% when training on Urdu data and testing on Italian data is achieved. An increase of 7% in accuracy is obtained when testing on Urdu data and training on German data, 3% when testing on Urdu data and training on Italian data, and 5% when testing on Urdu data and training on English data. Experiments prove that the ensemble learning approach gives promising results against other state-of-the-art techniques.},

The phenomenon of premature appeared with the increase of the number of iterations, and the globally optimal solution was not found. The IPSO algorithm was more efficient in exploring the globally optimal solution, and the phenomenon of premature did not appear. As the number of tasks increased, the operation time of both algorithms increased, but the IPSO algorithm increased more slowly. The IPSO algorithm had more advantages when there were a large amount of tasks.

However, the theoretical guarantee for the recovery of nonlinear movement information lacks in the two-dimensional matrix computation model developed for linear information. To overcome this drawback, this study proposes MM-TDMC for human motion and dance recovery.

  abstract     = {The existing approaches of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) process might yield unreliable and questionable results. The notable challenges of MCDM approaches are rank reversal paradox and uncertainty. The prime inspiration for researchers is the MCDM for hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs). In some scenarios, the decision-makers could not choose one from numerous values while expressing their preferences. HFS which is the extension of fuzzy sets (FS) is found to be helpful in solving such decision-making (DM) problems. The DM process is revolutionized with the commencement of powerful and efficient tools of data representation for expressing vagueness and uncertainty in data sets as FSs (both generalized and hesitant ones). This paper copes with one such novel approach that involves entropy-based attribute weighting, followed by an evaluation of approximate sets in the fuzzy rough framework. Correlation of the input alternatives in respect of evaluation criteria and the output class is evaluated. With the fuzzy technique for ordered preference by similarity to ideal solutions (FTOPSIS), the generated correlation matrix is utilized for calculating the degree of closeness ( $$ \delta $$ ) of the output classes to the input alternatives. This paper made a novel contribution of performance indicator centered on FTOPSIS for the hesitant fuzzy rough domain. The proposed method’s efficiency is established through comprehensive and systematic experimentation on datasets utilized by researchers globally. The proposed algorithms prove its ability to handle datasets that involve human-like hesitant thinking in the MCDM system by contrasting with the existing ones.},

Sekai-ichi apple is being a definite number of diseases induce, but it is to the highest degree of wastage involving in the Post-Harvest process. Especially sekai-ichi apple count loss is an unsafe many time because it not critically post-harvest. Regardless of consideration, the existing hierarchical model specified post-harvest losses prevention research has deficiencies to precise and quick detection of wastage for ensuring healthy separation of agriculture surroundings. This paper suggests a “Hierarchical Model within Ontology Enabled IoT” for distinguishable healthy separation of sekai-ichi apple by using Boosted Continuous Non-spatial whole Attribute Extraction (BCNAE). Sekai-ichi apple count loss is always safe on critically post-harvest. Proposed Post-Harvest hierarchical model specified post-harvest losses prevention and deficiencies to precise and quick detection of wastage for ensuring healthy separation of agriculture surroundings. In these suggestions, the separation cognitive operation takes the three levels of processing schemes such as lower level, middle level, and higher level. Firstly, the lower level is express agreements with the dynamic functioning for maintaining the definite number of manual induces. This lower level showing an absorption with the activity of manual separation by the human reliability determination. Secondly, the middle level is an express arrangement with the dynamic functioning for reducing the overfitting and accommodate to fitting the right shape deliberation.

To deal with the issue of slow network training and recognition speed for speaker recognition systems on resource-constrained devices, based on a traditional SOM neural network, an adaptive clustering self-organizing feature map SOM (AC-SOM) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm automatically adjusts the number of neurons in the competition layer based on the number of speakers to be recognized until the number of clusters matches the number of speakers. A 100-speaker database of characteristic spectrogram samples was built and applied to the proposed AC-SOM model, yielding a maximum training time of only 304 s, with a maximum sample recognition time of less than 28 ms. Comparing to other approaches, the proposed method offers greatly improved training and recognition speed without sacrificing too much recognition accuracy. The promising results suggest that the proposed method satisfies real-time data processing and execution requirements for edge intelligence systems better than other speaker recognition methods.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing is an eminent technology for providing a data storage facility with efficient storage, maintenance, management and remote backups. Hence, user data are shifted from customary storage to cloud storage. In this transfer, the sensitive attributes are also shifted to cloud storage with high-end security. Current security techniques are processed with high encryption time and provide identical security of entire data with single key dependent. These processes are taking high computational time and leaks entire information if the key is hacked. The proposed Group Key Based Attribute Encryption using Modified Random Fibonacci Cryptographic (MRFC) technique rectifies these issues. Instead of machine learning technique, data owner preference-based attributes segregation is used to divide an input dataset into sensitive and non-sensitive attribute groups. Based on inter-organization usage and data owner’s willingness, sensitive attribute is divided into ‘n + 1′ subgroups and each subgroup is encrypted by ‘n + 1’ group keys. The encrypted sensitive subgroups are merged with non-sensitive attributes and uploaded into a private cloud. The novelties of this paper are, (1) data owner preferred sensitive attribute classification instead of machine learning algorithms, (2) sensitive attribute encryption instead of entire attributes, (3) To reduce encryption time without compromising data owner privacy, (4) To decrypt and access the required subgroup instead of the entire attribute. Our experimental results show that, the proposed method takes minimal processing time, better classification accuracy and minimal memory space with high security to selected attributes as compared to existing classification and security techniques. Hence, sensitive data security and privacy is achieved with minimal processing cost.},

The design of FIoT focuses in achieving reliable service and response to the growing user demands through different interoperability features. In this manuscript, concurrent service access and management framework is introduced to improve the swiftness in user concentric request processing. Based on the availability of the services and the density of the users, the concurrency in information access is provided to the users in a reliable manner. The framework incorporates convolution neural learning process in linear and differential manner for improving the access and service usage rates of the requesting users. The access sessions are differentiated for the accessible and offloaded requests to the available service providers based on the learning instances. The proposed framework is assessed using the metrics access rate, service usage rate, access delay, time lag, and failure ratio.},

  abstract     = {Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is a meta-heuristic and reinforcement learning algorithm, which has been widely applied to solve various optimization problems. The key to improving the performance of ACO is to effectively resolve the exploration/exploitation dilemma. Epsilon greedy is an important and widely applied policy-based exploration method in reinforcement learning and has also been employed to improve ACO algorithms as the pseudo-stochastic mechanism. Levy flight is based on Levy distribution and helps to balance searching space and speed for global optimization. Taking advantage of both epsilon greedy and Levy flight, a greedy–Levy ACO incorporating these two approaches is proposed to solve complicated combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, it is implemented on the top of max–min ACO to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) problems. According to the computational experiments using standard TSPLIB instances, greedy–Levy ACO outperforms max–min ACO and other latest TSP solvers, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

It breaks the seasonal hurdle of the formulation and it is also suitable for the conflictive climate conditions. Controlling and directing internal parameters of the polyhouse play an essential role in the growth of the plant. Among those, humidity is an important element when one deals with the growth of the plant in polyhouse.

Also, humidity control is analyzed using interval type-2 fuzzy controller (IT2FC) with the use of derived aggregation operator which is the aim of the paper.

First, the definition, operational rules, comparison method and distance measure of CLPFSs are investigated. The CLPFSs fully adsorb the advantages of LPFSs and cubic fuzzy sets and hence they are suitable and flexible to depict attribute values in fuzzy and complicated decision-making environments. Second, based on the extension of power Hamy mean operator in CLPFSs, the cubic linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy power average operator, the cubic linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy power Hamy mean operator as well as their weighted forms were introduced. These aggregation operators can effectively and comprehensively aggregate attribute values in MAGDM problems. Besides, some important properties of these operators were studied. Finally, we presented a new MAGDM method based on CLPFSs and their aggregation operators.

To identify the credibility of the news, various spam detection methods are generally used. In this work, a new stance detection method has been proposed for identifying the stance of fake news. The proposed stance detection method is based on the capabilities of an improved whale optimization algorithm and a multilayer perceptron. In the proposed model, weights and biases of the multilayer perceptron are updated using an improved whale optimization algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed optimized neural network has been tested on five benchmark stance detection datasets. The proposed model shows better results over all the considered datasets. The proposed approach has theoretical implications for further studies to examine the textual data. Besides, the proposed method also has practical implications for developing systems that can result conclusive reviews on any social problems.},

The goal is to maximize the combinational coverage area of drones while giving preference to the area that hasn’t been visited beyond a certain time interval. The influence of shooting resolution and blocking of buildings are considered, and the state information of each grid is defined to record the visit information of the ground area. Considering the characteristic of the established model, the multi-constrained cooperative path planning (MCCPP) algorithm is developed. The grids which have not been visited for a long time are received special attentions, and the drone is led to reducing the flight height to cover the gird which has a special requirement on the shooting resolution. The cooperation mechanism among drones is also set to ensure that all the drones can determine the next path point synchronously. An emergency path planning algorithm with the continuous checking strategy is designed for a drone to fly to the specified area and finish a complete coverage of it.},

In this pursuit, the present study envisaged a novel combined model based on the slide relative position matrix and CNN for time series. The proposed model first adopted the slide relative position for converting the time series data into 2D images during preprocessing, and then employed CNN to classify these images. This made the best of the temporal sequence characteristic of time series data, thereby utilizing the advantages of CNN in image recognition. Finally, 14 UCR time series datasets were chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, whose results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed model was higher than others.},

  abstract     = {Recently, several socio-/bio-inspired algorithms have been proposed for solving a variety of problems. Generally, they perform well when applied for solving unconstrained problems; however, their performance degenerates when applied for solving constrained problems. Several types of penalty function approaches have been proposed so far for handling linear and non-linear constraints. Even though the approach is quite easy to understand, the precise choice of penalty parameter is very much important. It may further necessitate significant number of preliminary trials. To overcome this limitation, a new self-adaptive penalty function (SAPF) approach is proposed and incorporated into socio-inspired Cohort Intelligence (CI) algorithm. This approach is referred to as CI–SAPF. Furthermore, CI–SAPF approach is hybridized with Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) algorithm referred to as CI–SAPF–CBO algorithm. The performance of the CI–SAPF and CI–SAPF–CBO algorithms is validated by solving discrete and mixed variable problems from truss structure domain, design engineering domain, and several problems of linear and nonlinear in nature. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed techniques is validated by solving two real-world applications from manufacturing engineering domain. The results obtained from CI–SAPF and CI–SAPF–CBO are promising and computationally efficient when compared with other nature inspired optimization algorithms. A non-parametric Wilcoxon’s rank sum test is performed on the obtained statistical solutions to examine the significance of CI–SAPF–CBO. In addition, the effect of the penalty parameter on pseudo-objective function, penalty function and constrained violations is analyzed and discussed along with the advantages over other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a risk analysis tool widely used in the manufacturing industry. However, traditional FMEA has limitations such as the inability to deal with uncertain failure data including subjective evaluations of experts, the absence of weight values of risk parameters, and not considering the conditionality between failure events. In this paper, we propose a holistic FMEA to overcome these limitations. The proposed approach uses the fuzzy best–worst (FBWM) method in weighting three risk parameters of FMEA, which are severity (S), occurrence (O), and detection (D), and to find the preference values of the failure modes according to parameters S and D. On the other side, it uses the fuzzy Bayesian network (FBN) to determine occurrence probabilities of the failure modes. Experts use a procedure using linguistic variables whose corresponding values are expressed in trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and determine the preference values of the failure modes according to parameter O in the constructed BN. Thus, the FBN including expert judgments and fuzzy set theory addresses uncertainty in failure data and includes a robust probabilistic risk analysis logic to capture the dependence between failure events. As a demonstration of the approach, a case study was conducted in an industrial kitchen equipment manufacturing facility. The results of the approach have also been compared with existed methods demonstrating its robustness.},

Here, for solving such uncertain SP problems, first a new procedure is extended to approximate the summation of mixed interval-valued fuzzy numbers using alpha cuts. Then, an extended distance function is introduced for comparing the path weights. Finally, we intend to use a modified artificial bee colony (MABC) algorithm to find the interval-valued membership function of SP in such mixed interval-valued fuzzy network. The proposed algorithm is illustrated via two applications of SP problems in wireless sensor networks and then the results are compared with those derived from genetic and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, based on three indexes convergence iteration, convergence time and run time. The obtained results confirm that the MABC algorithm has less convergence iteration, convergence time and implementation time compared to GA and PSO algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This study has been inspired by golf ball movements during the game to improve particle swarm optimization. Because, all movements from the first to the last move of the golf ball are the moves made by the player to win the game. Winning this game is also a result of successful implementation of the desired moves. Therefore, the movements of the golf ball are also an optimization, and this has a meaning in the scientific world. In this sense, the movements of the particles in the PSO algorithm have been associated with the movements of the golf ball in the game. Thus, the velocities of the particles have converted to parabolically descending structure as they approach the target. Based on this feature, this meta-heuristic technique is called RDV (random descending velocity) IW PSO. In this way, the result obtained is improved thousands of times with very small movements. For the application of the proposed new technique, the inverse kinematics calculation of the 7-joint robot arm has been performed and the obtained results have been compared with the traditional PSO, some IW techniques, artificial bee colony, firefly algorithm and quantum PSO.},

  abstract     = {Real-world optimization applications in complex systems always contain multiple factors to be optimized, which can be formulated as multi-objective optimization problems. These problems have been solved by many evolutionary algorithms like MOEA/D, NSGA-III, and KnEA. However, when the numbers of decision variables and objectives increase, the computation costs of those mentioned algorithms will be unaffordable. To reduce such high computation cost on large-scale many-objective optimization problems, we proposed a two-stage framework. The first stage of the proposed algorithm combines with a multi-tasking optimization strategy and a bi-directional search strategy, where the original problem is reformulated as a multi-tasking optimization problem in the decision space to enhance the convergence. To improve the diversity, in the second stage, the proposed algorithm applies multi-tasking optimization to a number of sub-problems based on reference points in the objective space. In this paper, to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we test the algorithm on the DTLZ and LSMOP problems and compare it with existing algorithms, and it outperforms other compared algorithms in most cases and shows disadvantage on both convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {Human endeavours span a wide spectrum of activities which includes solving fascinating problems in the realms of engineering, arts, sciences, medical sciences, social sciences, economics and environment. To solve these problems, classical mathematics methods are insufficient. The real-world problems involve many uncertainties making them difficult to solve by classical means. The researchers world over have established new mathematical theories such as fuzzy set theory and rough set theory in order to model the uncertainties that appear in various fields mentioned above. In the recent days, soft set theory has been developed which offers a novel way of solving real world issues as the issue of setting the membership function does not arise. This comes handy in solving numerous problems and many advancements are being made now-a-days. Jun introduced hybrid structure utilizing the ideas of a fuzzy set and a soft set. It is to be noted that hybrid structures are a speculation of soft set and fuzzy set. In the present work, the notion of hybrid ideals of a near-ring is introduced. Significant work has been carried out to investigate a portion of their significant properties. These notions are characterized and their relations are established furthermore. For a hybrid left (resp., right) ideal, different left (resp., right) ideal structures of near-rings are constructed. Efforts have been undertaken to display the relations between the hybrid product and hybrid intersection. Finally, results based on homomorphic hybrid preimage of a hybrid left (resp., right) ideals are proved.},

  abstract     = {Numerous research papers and several engineering applications have proved that the fuzzy set theory is an intelligent effective tool to represent complex uncertain information. In fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (fuzzy MCDM) methods, intelligent information system and fuzzy control-theoretic models, complex qualitative information are extracted from expert’s knowledge as linguistic variables and are modeled by linear/non-linear fuzzy numbers. In numerical computations and experiments, the information/data are fitted by nonlinear functions for better accuracy which may be little hard for further processing to apply in real-life problems. Hence, the study of non-linear fuzzy numbers through triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is very natural and various researchers have attempted to transform non-linear fuzzy numbers into piecewise linear functions of interval/triangular/trapezoidal in nature by different methods in the past years. But it is noted that the triangular/trapezoidal approximation of nonlinear fuzzy numbers has more loss of information. Therefore, there is a natural need for a better piecewise linear approximation of a given nonlinear fuzzy number without losing much information for better intelligent information modeling. On coincidence, a new notion of Generalized Hexagonal Fuzzy Number has been introduced and its applications on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problem (MCDM) and Generalized Hexagonal Fully Fuzzy Linear System (GHXFFLS) of equations have been studied by Lakshmana et al. in 2020. Therefore, in this paper, approximation of nonlinear fuzzy numbers into the hexagonal fuzzy numbers which includes trapezoidal, triangular and interval fuzzy numbers as special cases of Hexagonal fuzzy numbers with less loss/gain of information than other existing methods is attempted. Since any fuzzy information is satisfied fully by its modal value/core of that concept, any approximation of that concept is expected to be preserved with same modal value/core. Therefore, in this paper, a stepwise procedure for approximating a non-linear fuzzy number into a new Hexagonal Fuzzy Number that preserves the core of the given fuzzy number is proposed using constrained nonlinear programming model and is illustrated numerically by considering a parabolic fuzzy number. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared for its efficiency on accuracy in terms of loss of information. Finally, some properties of the new hexagonal fuzzy approximation are studied and the applicability of the proposed method is illustrated through the Group MCDM problem using an index matrix (IM).},

  abstract     = {A dynamic programming (DP) approach with adaptive state generation and conflicts resolution is developed to address the timetable-rescheduling problem (TRP) at relatively lower computation costs. A multi-stage decision-making model is first developed to represent the timetable-rescheduling procedure in high-speed railways. Then, an adaptive state generation method by reordering the trains at each station is proposed to dynamically create the possible states according to the states of previous stages, such that the infeasible states can be removed and the search space is reduced. Then, conflicts are resolved by retiming the arrival and/or departure times of trains. Furthermore, the state transfer equation is built and Bellman equation is developed to derive the solution to minimize the total delay time (TT). A series of simulation experiments and a real-world case study are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The simulation experiments indicate that the proposed method is able to find the optimal timetable with appropriate overtaking at right stations and reduce the total delay by 62.7% and 41.5% with respect to the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and First-Schedule-First-Serve (FSFS) strategy that are widely used in practice. Comparing to the intelligent scheduling method (e.g., Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization), similar objective performance can be achieved at a much lower cost of computation time, which make the proposed method more applicable to the TRP in daily operation of high-speed railway.},

Compared to the method that only one surrogate model is utilized, the surrogate ensembles have shown more efficiency to get a good optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a bi-stage surrogate-assisted hybrid algorithm to solve the expensive optimization problems. The framework of the proposed method is composed of two stages. In the first stage, a number of global searches will be conducted in sequence to explore different sub-spaces of the decision space, and the solution with the maximum uncertainty in the final generation of each global search will be evaluated using the exact expensive problems to improve the accuracy of the approximation on corresponding sub-space. In the second stage, the local search is added to exploit the sub-space, where the best position found so far locates, to find a better solution for real expensive evaluation. Furthermore, the local and global searches in the second stage take turns to be conducted to balance the trade-off of the exploration and exploitation. Two different meta-heuristic algorithms are, respectively, utilized for the global and local search. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct the experiments on seven benchmark problems, the Lennard–Jones potential problem and a constrained test problem, respectively, and compare with five state-of-the-art methods proposed for solving expensive problems. The experimental results show that our proposed method can obtain better results, especially on high-dimensional problems.},

The nonlinear behaviors of PMDC motors were investigated by time-domain waveform, phase portrait, and Floquet theory. By varying the load torque, a period-doubling bifurcation appeared which in turn led to chaotic behavior in the system. So, a fuzzy logic controller and developing the Floquet theory techniques are applied to eliminate the bifurcation and the chaos effects. The controller is used to enhance the performance of the system by getting a faster response without overshoot or oscillation, moreover, tends to reduce the steady-state error while maintaining its stability. The simulation results emphasize that fuzzy control provides better performance than that obtained from the other controller.},

In addition, the cold start and data sparsity remain major problems for collaborative filtering. To tackle these problems, some scholars have proposed to use deep neural network to extract text information, but did not consider the impact of long-distance dependent information and key information on their models. In this paper, we propose a neural collaborative filtering recommender method that integrates user and item auxiliary information. This method fully integrates user-item rating information, user assistance information and item text assistance information for feature extraction. First, Stacked Denoising Auto Encoder is used to extract user features, and Gated Recurrent Unit with auxiliary information is used to extract items’ latent vectors, respectively. The attention mechanism is used to learn key information when extracting text features. Second, the latent vectors learned by deep learning techniques are used in multi-layer nonlinear networks to learn more abstract and deeper feature representations to predict user preferences. According to the verification results on the MovieLens data set, the proposed model outperforms other traditional approaches and deep learning models making it state of the art.},

This paper addresses integrated inventory-routing of blood in a supply chain network consisting of a single supplier and a group of blood centers. Transshipment among blood centers is allowed to decrease the cost of excess inventory and shortage of goods. A mathematical model is developed that decides on the optimal quantity of supplied blood, delivery plan, inventory level, and quantity of products transshipped between blood centers with the objective of minimizing total costs. In addition, a robust optimization approach is adopted to deal with uncertainty in demand. Since the proposed model is NP-hard, a heuristic solution algorithm is developed that improves solution quality by determining the most efficient change in vehicle routes in each search stage. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is examined in a set of numerical experiments and using data from a real case of supply and distribution management of blood platelets. The results indicated that allowing transshipment reduces the need for supply capacity at the supplier, product shortage, inventory level, and the total cost.},

  abstract     = {Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-cancerous lesion in the ducts of the breast, and early diagnosis is crucial for optimal therapeutic intervention. Thermography imaging is a non-invasive imaging tool that can be utilized for detection of DCIS and although it has high accuracy (~ 88%), it is sensitivity can still be improved. Hence, we aimed to develop an automated artificial intelligence-based system for improved detection of DCIS in thermographs. This study proposed a novel artificial intelligence based system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) termed CNN-BDER on a multisource dataset containing 240 DCIS images and 240 healthy breast images. Based on CNN, batch normalization, dropout, exponential linear unit and rank-based weighted pooling were integrated, along with L-way data augmentation. Ten runs of tenfold cross validation were chosen to report the unbiased performances. Our proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 94.08 ± 1.22%, a specificity of 93.58 ± 1.49 and an accuracy of 93.83 ± 0.96. The proposed method gives superior performance than eight state-of-the-art approaches and manual diagnosis. The trained model could serve as a visual question answering system and improve diagnostic accuracy.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 pandemic is increasing in an exponential rate, with restricted accessibility of rapid test kits. So, the design and implementation of COVID-19 testing kits remain an open research problem. Several findings attained using radio-imaging approaches recommend that the images comprise important data related to coronaviruses. The application of recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, integrated with radiological imaging, is helpful in the precise diagnosis and classification of the disease. In this view, the current research paper presents a novel fusion model hand-crafted with deep learning features called FM-HCF-DLF model for diagnosis and classification of COVID-19. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model comprises three major processes, namely Gaussian filtering-based preprocessing, FM for feature extraction and classification. FM model incorporates the fusion of handcrafted features with the help of local binary patterns (LBP) and deep learning (DL) features and it also utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Inception v3 technique. To further improve the performance of Inception v3 model, the learning rate scheduler using Adam optimizer is applied. At last, multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to carry out the classification process. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model was experimentally validated using chest X-ray dataset. The experimental outcomes inferred that the proposed model yielded superior performance with maximum sensitivity of 93.61%, specificity of 94.56%, precision of 94.85%, accuracy of 94.08%, F score of 93.2% and kappa value of 93.5%.},

These visual inputs are processed using sophisticated techniques for improving the reliability of human–machine interactions (HMIs). The processing of visual inputs requires multi-level data computations for achieving application-specific reliability. Therefore, in this paper, a two-level visual information processing (2LVIP) method is introduced to meet the reliability requirements of HMI applications. The 2LVIP method is used for handling both structured and unstructured data through classification learning to extract the maximum gain from the inputs. The introduced method identifies the gain-related features on its first level and optimizes the features to improve information gain. In the second level, the error is reduced through a regression process to stabilize the precision to meet the HMI application demands. The two levels are interoperable and fully connected to achieve better gain and precision through the reduction in information processing errors. The analysis results show that the proposed method achieves 9.42% higher information gain and a 6.51% smaller error under different classification instances compared with conventional methods.},

Healthcare monitoring systems integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm to perform the remote solutions for the acquiring inputs. In recent years, wearable sensors, and information and communication technologies are assisting for remote monitoring and recommendations in smart healthcare. In this paper, the dependable gesture recognition (DGR) using a series learning method for identifying the action of patient monitoring through remote access is presented. The gesture recognition systems connect to the end-user (remote) and the patient for instantaneous gesture identification. The gesture is recognized by the analysis of the intermediate and structuring features using series learning. The proposed gesture recognition system is capable of monitoring patient activities and differentiating the gestures from the regular actions to improve the convergence. Gesture recognition through remote monitoring is indistinguishable due to the preliminary errors. Further, it is convertible using series learning. Therefore, the misdetections and classifications are promptly identified using the DGR and verified by comparative analysis and experimental study. From the analysis, the proposed DGR approach attains 94.92% high precision for the varying gestures and 89.85% high accuracy for varying mess factor. The proposed DGR reduces recognition time to 4.97 s and 4.93 s for the varying gestures and mess factor, respectively.},

Furthermore, the similarity between different individuals is dynamically measured to detect the diversity of the current population, and a diversity-enhanced learning strategy is proposed to prevent the rapid loss of population diversity. Additionally, a maximum and minimum crowding distance strategy is employed to obtain excellent nondominated solutions.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of e-economy, ordering via online food delivery platforms has become prevalent in recent years. Nevertheless, the platforms are facing lots of challenges such as time-limitation and uncertainty. This paper addresses a complex stochastic online route-planning problem (SORPP) which is mathematically formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model. To meet the immediacy requirement of online fashion, an end-to-end deep learning model is designed which is composed of an encoder and a decoder. To embed different problem-specific features, different network layers are adopted in the encoder; to extract the implicit relationship, the probability mass functions of stochastic food preparation time is processed by a convolution neural network layer; to provide global information, the location map and rider features are handled by the factorization-machine (FM) and deep FM layers, respectively; to screen out valuable information, the order features are embedded by attention layers. In the decoder, the permutation sequence is predicted by long-short term memory cells with attention and masking mechanism. To learn the policy for finding optimal permutation under complex constraints of the SORPP, the model is trained in a supervised learning way with the labels obtained by iterated greedy search algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted based on real-world data sets. The comparative results show that the proposed model is more efficient than meta-heuristics and is able to yield higher quality solutions than heuristics. This work provides an intelligent optimization technique for complex online food delivery system.},

To address this problem in CGP, we propose a Frameshift Mutation Cartesian Genetic Programming (FMCGP), which is inspired by the DNA mutation mechanism in biology and the frameshift mutation caused by insertion or deletion of nodes is introduced to CGP. The individual in FMCGP has variable-length genotype and the proposed frameshift mutation operator helps to generate more diverse offspring individuals by changing the compiling framework of genotype. FMCGP is evaluated on the symbolic regression problems and Even-parity problems. Experimental results show that FMCGP does not exhibit the bloat problem and the use of frameshift mutation improves the search performance of the standard CGP.},

However, existing GPs often ignore the intrinsic structure of the ground truth equation of the symbolic regression problem. To improve the search efficacy of GP on symbolic regression problems by fully exploiting the intrinsic structure information, this paper proposes a genetic programming with separability detection technique (SD-GP). In the proposed SD-GP, a separability detection method is proposed to detect additive separable characteristics of input features from the observed data. Then based on the separability detection results, a chromosome representation is proposed, which utilizes multiple sub chromosomes to represent the final solution. Some sub chromosomes are used to construct separable sub functions by using separate input features, while the other sub chromosomes are used to construct sub functions by using all input features. The final solution is the weighted sum of all sub functions, and the optimal weights of sub functions are obtained by using the least squares method. In this way, the structure information can be learnt and the global search ability of GP can be maintained. Experimental results on synthetic problems with differing characteristics have demonstrated that the proposed SD-GP can perform better than several state-of-the-art GPs in terms of the success rate of finding the optimal solution and the convergence speed.},

With the increase of scheduling scale, the difficulty and computation time of solving the problem will increase exponentially. Adding the knowledge to intelligent algorithms is a good way to solve the complex and difficult scheduling problems in reasonable time. To deal with the complex PFSPs, this paper proposes an improved simulated annealing (SA) algorithm based on residual network (SARes). First, this paper defines the neighborhood of the PFSP and divides its key blocks. Second, the Residual Network (ResNet) is used to extract and train the features of key blocks. And, the trained parameters are stored in the SA algorithm to improve its performance. Afterwards, some key operators, including the initial temperature setting and temperature attenuation function of SA algorithm, are also modified. After every new solution is generated, the parameters trained by the ResNet are used for fast ergodic search until the local optimal solution found in the current neighborhood. Finally, the most famous benchmarks including part of TA benchmark are selected to verify the performance of the proposed SARes algorithm, and the comparisons with the-state-of-art methods are also conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved good results by comparing with other algorithms. This paper also conducts experiments on network structure design, algorithm parameter selection, CPU time and other problems, and verifies the advantages of SARes algorithm from the aspects of stability and efficiency.},

The objective functions of the model consider the computation and storage resource utilization rate, load balancing rate, and actual microservice usage rate in resource service centres. The constraints of the model are the completeness of service, total amount of storage resources, and total number of microservices. In this study, a knowledge-driven evolutionary algorithm (named MGR-NSGA-III) is proposed to solve the problem model and seek the optimal deployment and startup strategy of microservice instances in different resource centres. The proposed model and solution have been evaluated via real data experiments. The results show that our approach is better than the traditional microservice instance deployment and startup strategy.

  abstract     = {Robotic assembly lines are widely used in manufacturing industries. The robotic assembly line balancing (RALB) problem aims to balance the workloads among different workstations and optimize the assembly line efficiency. This paper addresses a particular type of RALB problem, which minimizes the assembly line cycle time by determining the task and robot assignment in each workstation under precedence constraints. To solve the problem, we present an effective hybrid algorithm fusing the estimation of distribution algorithm and branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) based knowledge. A problem-specific probability model is designed to describe the probabilities of each task being assigned to different workstations. Based on the probability model, an incremental learning method is developed and a sampling mechanism with B&amp;B based knowledge is proposed to generate new feasible solutions. The fuse of B&amp;B based knowledge is able to reduce the search space of EDA while focusing the search on the promising area. To enhance the exploitation ability, a problem-specific local search is developed based on the critical workstation to further improve the quality of elite solutions. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed, and the effectiveness of the B&amp;B based knowledge and the problem-specific local search is demonstrated through numerical experiments. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing algorithms on a set of widely-used benchmark instances. Comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

In it, Saaty’s 1/9-9 scale is used to express the imprecise information which is asymmetrical distribution about 1. To achieve it, the present work is divided into three folds. First, a concept of connection number-based intuitionistic multiplicative set (CN-IMS) is formulated by considering three degrees namely “identity”, “contrary”, and “discrepancy” of the set and study their features. Second, to rank the given number, we define a novel possibility degree measure which compute the degree of possibility within the given objects. Finally, several aggregation operators on the pairs of the given numbers are designed and investigated their fundamental inequalities and relations. To explain the presented measures and operators, a group decision-making approach is promoted to solve the problems with uncertain information and illustrated with several examples. The advantages, comparative, as well as perfection analysis of the proposed framework are furnished to confirm the approach.},

  abstract     = {Over the past 2 decades, several multi-objective optimizers (MOOs) have been proposed to address the different aspects of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). Unfortunately, it has been observed that many of MOOs experiences performance degradation when applied over MOPs having a large number of decision variables and objective functions. Specially, the performance of MOOs rapidly decreases when the number of decision variables and objective functions increases by more than a hundred and three, respectively. To address the challenges caused by such special case of MOPs, some large-scale multi-objective optimization optimizers (L-MuOOs) and large-scale many-objective optimization optimizers (L-MaOOs) have been developed in the literature. Even after vast development in the direction of L-MuOOs and L-MaOOs, the supremacy of these optimizers has not been tested on real-world optimization problems containing a large number of decision variables and objectives such as large-scale many-objective software clustering problems (L-MaSCPs). In this study, the performance of nine L-MuOOs and L-MaOOs (i.e., S3-CMA-ES, LMOSCO, LSMOF, LMEA, IDMOPSO, ADC-MaOO, NSGA-III, H-RVEA, and DREA) is evaluated and compared over five L-MaSCPs in terms of IGD, Hypervolume, and MQ metrics. The experimentation results show that the S3-CMA-ES and LMOSCO perform better compared to the LSMOF, LMEA, IDMOPSO, ADC-MaOO, NSGA-III, H-RVEA, and DREA in most of the cases. The LSMOF, LMEA, IDMOPSO, ADC-MaOO, NSGA-III, and DREA, are the average performer, and H-RVEA is the worst performer.},

Because of the uncertainty associated with the component’s operational time, failure, and next mission duration create a new challenge in determining optimal components allocation and evaluating future missions successfully. In this paper, a multi-objective selective maintenance allocation problem is formulated with fuzzy parameters under neutrosophic environment. A new defuzzification technique is introduced based on beta distribution to convert fuzzy parameters into crisp values. The neutrosophic goal programming technique is used to determine the compromise allocation of replaceable and repairable components based on the system reliability optimization. A numerical illustration is used to validate the model and ascertain its effectiveness. The result is compared with two other approaches and found to be better. The method is flexible and straightforward and can be solved using any available commercial packages. The extension of the concept can be useful to other complex system reliability optimization.},

Afterwards, two practical examples are given to show the application of the proposed directional correlation coefficient in the disease diagnosis, and the application of the proposed weighted directional correlation coefficient in the cluster analysis.

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) is used to sense the environment, collect the data, and further transmit it to the base station (BS) for analysis. A synchronized tree-based approach is an efficient approach to aggregate data from various sensor nodes in a WSN environment. However, achieving energy efficiency in such a tree formation is challenging. In this research work, an algorithm named fuzzy attribute-based joint integrated scheduling and tree formation (FAJIT) technique for tree formation and parent node selection using fuzzy logic in a heterogeneous network is proposed. FAJIT mainly focuses on addressing the parent node selection problem in the heterogeneous network for aggregating different types of data packets to improve energy efficiency. The selection of parent nodes is performed based on the candidate nodes with the minimum number of dynamic neighbors. Fuzzy logic is applied in the case of an equal number of dynamic neighbors. In the proposed technique, fuzzy logic is first applied to WSN, and then min–max normalization is used to retrieve normalized weights (membership values) for the given edges of the graph. This membership value is used to denote the degree to which an element belongs to a set. Therefore, the node with the minimum sum of all weights is considered as the parent node. The result of FAJIT is compared with the distributed algorithm for Integrated tree Construction and data Aggregation (DICA) on various parameters: average schedule length, energy consumption data interval, the total number of transmission slots, control overhead, and energy consumption in the control phase. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is better in terms of energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Real-time water quality monitoring is a complex system as it involves many quality parameters to be monitored, the nature of these parameters, and non-linear interdependence between themselves. Intelligent algorithms crucial in building intelligent systems are good candidates for building a reliable and convenient monitoring system. To analyze water quality, we need to understand, model, and monitor the water pollution in real time using different online water quality sensors through an Internet of things framework. However, many water quality parameters cannot be easily measured online due to several reasons such as high-cost sensors, low sampling rate, multiple processing stages by few heterogeneous sensors, the requirement of frequent cleaning and calibration, and spatial and application dependency among different water bodies. A soft sensor is an efficient and convenient alternative approach for water quality monitoring. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based soft sensor model to estimate biological oxygen demand (BOD), a time-consuming and challenging process to measure. We also propose a system architecture for implementing the soft sensor both on the cloud and edge layers, so that the edge device can make adaptive decisions in real time by monitoring the quality of water. A comparative study between the computational performance of edge and cloud nodes in terms of prediction accuracy, learning time, and decision time for different machine learning (ML) algorithms is also presented. This paper establishes that BOD soft sensors are efficient, less costly, and reasonably accurate with an example of a real-life application. Here, the IBK ML technique proves to be the most efficient in predicting BOD. The experimental setup uses 100 test readings of STP water samples to evaluate the performance of the IBK technique, and the statistical measures are reported as correlation coefficient = 0.9273, MAE = 0.082, RMSE = 0.1994, RAE = 17.20%, RRSE = 37.62%, and edge response time = 0.15 s only.},

  abstract     = {Applying risk assessment approaches to improve quality in enterprises is of great importance especially for sectors that are labor-intensive and thus frequently encountered failures. One of the methods frequently used to take precautions against failures caused by high variability in this type of sector is failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). In this study, a hybrid FMEA approach is proposed so as to take measures against failures in the textile sector where there are high-quality differences due to its structure and failures frequently occurred. Since the different combinations of risk parameters’ scores may produce the same risk degree based on the function of the FMEA’s basis, misleading results for the risk analysis in the practical risk management can be occurred. Moreover, the risk priority number (RPN) function has a limitation in the weight determining process, since it assigns the equal weight for each risk parameter in the classical FMEA. To overcome these shortcomings in the RPN calculation for the risks in the FMEA approach, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is applied under the framework of fuzzy logic. Through that, in this study, we aimed to prove an expert system based on the rules that specifically focusing on the risk sources of the woven fabric industry. To create such a rule-based system, inputs are generated using fuzzy AHP and modified fuzzy TOPSIS. A case study is carried out with the method proposed in a textile mill, and it is determined which risks arising from failures are higher. For the validation of the results, a comparative analysis is conducted. Moreover, for the robustness of the decisions, one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis with respect to different scenarios are applied. As a result of the analyses, it is shown that our proposed model can be used as an efficient proactive risk calculator for the managers or researchers to make useful inferences, judgments, and decisions of the production processes for eliminating the shortcomings of the traditional FMEA.},

  abstract     = {Brain stroke is an emergency medical condition which occurs mainly due to insufficient blood flow to the brain. It results in permanent cellular-level damage. There are two main types of brain stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic brain stroke is caused by a lack of blood flow, and the haemorrhagic form is due to internal bleeding. The affected part of brain will not function properly after this attack. Hence, early detection is important for more efficacious treatment. Computer-aided diagnosis is a type of non-invasive diagnostic tool which can help in detecting life-threatening disease in its early stage by utilizing image processing and soft computing techniques. In this paper, we have developed one such model to assess intracerebral haemorrhage by employing non-linear features combined with a probabilistic neural network classifier and computed tomography (CT) images. Our model achieved a maximum accuracy of 97.37% in discerning normal versus haemorrhagic subjects. An intracerebral haemorrhage index is also developed using only three significant features. The clinical and statistical validation of the model confirms its suitability in providing for improved treatment planning and in making strategic decisions.},

  abstract     = {The mains signal is a complex fusion of various electrical equipment load signals in a building. In the non-intrusive load monitoring recognition, our main aim is to be able to extract as much load features as possible from the complex aggregate mains signal in a simpler way through a computer vision-based approach as opposed to the powers series signal approach. Power series methods, which are one dimensional in nature, suffer from poor aggregate and load signal feature localization necessitating a larger training dataset spanning very long time periods and normally require signal formatting and pre-processing. We use Gramian angular summation fields to transform the power series into a reduced image dataset that contains a rich set of localized signal features. A computer vision approach allows us to capture as much information as possible, and then propose an image-based mains load recognition system with high performance. In this paper for the entire recognition system, we use convolutional neural networks that very well adapted to vision recognition. The load signal image disaggregation is achieved through the powerful stacked denoising autoencoder noise extraction network. To test the proposed system, some simulations and comparisons are carried out and the results show that our easier to handle method can achieve acceptable performance.},

The proposed TAPSO method is characterized by a flexible assignment decoding scheme to avoid the generation of unfeasible assignments. The maximum number of successful tasks (survivors) is considered as the fitness evaluation criterion under a scenario where the survivors’ survival time is uncertain. To improve the solution, a global best solution update strategy, which updates the global best solution depends on different phases so as to balance the exploration and exploitation, is proposed. TAPSO is tested on different scenarios and compared with other counterpart algorithms to verify its efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In any multi-script environment, handwritten script classification is an unavoidable pre-requisite before the document images are fed to their respective Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines. Over the years, this complex pattern classification problem has been solved by researchers proposing various feature vectors mostly having large dimensions, thereby increasing the computation complexity of the whole classification model. Feature Selection (FS) can serve as an intermediate step to reduce the size of the feature vectors by restricting them only to the essential and relevant features. In the present work, we have addressed this issue by introducing a new FS algorithm, called Hybrid Swarm and Gravitation-based FS (HSGFS). This algorithm has been applied over three feature vectors introduced in the literature recently—Distance-Hough Transform (DHT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Modified log-Gabor (MLG) filter Transform. Three state-of-the-art classifiers, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used to evaluate the optimal subset of features generated by the proposed FS model. Handwritten datasets at block, text line, and word level, consisting of officially recognized 12 Indic scripts, are prepared for experimentation. An average improvement in the range of 2–5% is achieved in the classification accuracy by utilizing only about 75–80% of the original feature vectors on all three datasets. The proposed method also shows better performance when compared to some popularly used FS models. The codes used for implementing HSGFS can be found in the following Github link: https://github.com/Ritam-Guha/HSGFS .},

For this purpose, the fuzzy fractional two-stage transshipment problem is decomposed into two sub-problems where each of them is tackled individually using various $$\alpha$$ levels to obtain the fuzzy objective function value and its associated membership function. To deal with the nonlinearity of the objective function the Charnes–Cooper transformation method is embedded to the proposed approach.

Meanwhile, HH_EG does not need to tune parameters, and is easy to be integrated with various performance indicators. We test HH_EG on the classical DTLZ test suite, the IMOP test suite, the many-objective MaF test suite, and a test suite of a real-world multi-objective problem.

  abstract     = {Complete area coverage is a crucial factor for a floor cleaning robot. Self-reconfigurable tiling robots have been introduced over robots with a fixed shape for floor cleaning since they improve the area coverage by the flexibility of shape-shifting in cluttered environments. The existing coverage methods of reconfigurable tiling robots follow the tiling theory to cope with the area coverage problem. However, these methods merely consider a limited set of predefined shapes for the reconfiguration of a robot. The consideration of a limited set of predefined shapes for the reconfiguration impedes the ability of coverage to a certain extent in typical floor environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method to improve area coverage of a tiling robot by reconfiguring according to the shape of obstacles. To this end, the required hinge angles for reconfiguring per the shape of an obstacle are determined by a genetic algorithm. The proposed method considers an optimized shape for reconfiguration in lieu of a limited set of predefined shapes. The coverage improvement of the proposed concept has been compared against the existing coverage methods of tiling robots to validate the performance. According to the experimental results, the proposed method surpasses the existing coverage methods of tiling robots from the perspective of area coverage, and the improvement is significant and noteworthy.},

  abstract     = {The shortest path problem (SPP) is a special network structured linear programming problem that appears in a wide range of applications. Classical SPPs consider only one objective in the networks while some or all of the multiple, conflicting and incommensurate objectives such as optimization of cost, profit, time, distance, risk, and quality of service may arise together in real-world applications. These types of SPPs are known as the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSPP) and can be solved with the existing various approaches. This paper develops a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-based approach to solve the MOSPP with fuzzy parameters (FMOSPP) to account for real situations where input–output data include uncertainty of triangular membership form. This approach to make a connection between the MOSPP and DEA is more flexible to deal with real practical applications. To this end, each arc in a FMOSPP is considered as a decision-making unit with multiple fuzzy inputs and outputs. Then two fuzzy efficiency scores are obtained corresponding to each arc. These fuzzy efficiency scores are combined to define a unique fuzzy relative efficiency. Hence, the FMOSPP is converted into a single objective Fuzzy Shortest Path Problem (FSPP) that can be solved using existing FSPP algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) is a well-known model for handling uncertain and indeterminate information. Information measures such as distance measures, similarity measures and entropy measures are very useful tools to be used in many applications such as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), medical diagnosis, pattern recognition and clustering problems. A lot of such information measures have been proposed for the SVNS model. However, many of these measures have inherent problems that prevent them from producing reasonable or consistent results to the decision makers. In this paper, we propose several new distance and similarity measures for the SVNS model. The proposed measures have been verified and proven to comply with the axiomatic definition of the distance and similarity measure for the SVNS model. A detailed and comprehensive comparative analysis between the proposed similarity measures and other well-known existing similarity measures has been done. Based on the comparison results, it is clearly proven that the proposed similarity measures are able to overcome the shortcomings that are inherent in existing similarity measures. Finally, an extensive set of numerical examples, related to pattern recognition and medical diagnosis, is given to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed similarity measures. In all numerical examples, it is proven that the proposed similarity measures are able to produce accurate and reasonable results. To further verify the superiority of the suggested similarity measures, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient test is performed on the ranking results that were obtained from the numerical examples, and it was again proven that the proposed similarity measures produced the most consistent ranking results compared to other existing similarity measures.},

  abstract     = {The YARA rules technique is used in cybersecurity to scan for malware, often in its default form, where rules are created either manually or automatically. Creating YARA rules that enable analysts to label files as suspected malware is a highly technical skill, requiring expertise in cybersecurity. Therefore, in cases where rules are either created manually or automatically, it is desirable to improve both the performance and detection outcomes of the process. In this paper, two methods are proposed utilising the techniques of fuzzy hashing and fuzzy rules, to increase the effectiveness of YARA rules without escalating the complexity and overheads associated with YARA rules. The first proposed method utilises fuzzy hashing referred to as enhanced YARA rules in this paper, where if existing YARA rules fails to detect the inspected file as malware, then it is subjected to fuzzy hashing to assess whether this technique would identify it as malware. The second proposed technique called embedded YARA rules utilises fuzzy hashing and fuzzy rules to improve the outcomes further. Fuzzy rules countenance circumstances where data are imprecise or uncertain, generating a probabilistic outcome indicating the likelihood of whether a file is malware or not. The paper discusses the success of the proposed enhanced YARA rules and embedded YARA rules through several experiments on the collected malware and goodware corpus and their comparative evaluation against YARA rules.},

Then neural architecture search approaches based on reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms and gradient-based are presented. This is followed by a description of federated neural architecture search that has recently been proposed, which is categorized into online and offline implementations, and single- and multi-objective search approaches.

This paper is therefore an attempt to provide a comparative scrutiny of the fundamental algorithms in the field of pattern mining through performance analysis based on several decisive parameters. The paper provides a structural classification of the widely referenced techniques in four pattern mining categories: frequent, maximal frequent, closed frequent and rare. It provides an analytical comparison of these techniques based on computational time and memory consumption using benchmark real and synthetic data sets. The results illustrate that tree based approaches perform exceptionally well over level wise approaches in case of dense data sets for all the categories. However, for sparse data sets, level wise approaches performed better than the former ones. This study has been carried out with an aim to analyze the pros and cons of the well known pattern mining techniques under different categories. Through this empirical study, an endeavor has been made to enable the researchers identify some fruitful and promising research directions in one of the most remarkable area of research, pattern mining.},

SCOR model is one of the best models to describe supply chain activities in operations management for research and practice alike. There are radical changes in the structure of supply chains as well as developing technology in today’s information age. The purpose of this paper is to extend the SCOR model with new metrics related to Industry 4.0 and digitalization to understand and evaluate the performance of supply chains. New metrics added to the SCOR model and a novel SCOR 4.0 model is proposed. The novel performance evaluation model is structured as a three-level hierarchical structure to evaluate the supply chain. This problem is handled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. This study uses the hybrid Best worst method and Pythagorean fuzzy AHP method to determine the weights of metrics. SCOR model is adapted to performance evaluation of the supply chain in the globalizing world. The most important metrics on the supply chain performances are determined and classified. Level 1 metrics are evaluated by Best worst method and their inner levels are evaluated by the Pythagorean fuzzy AHP method and the importance weights of each level 2 and level 3 metrics are obtained. A real application for the oil supply chain is presented to show the applicability of the proposed model. It is aimed to show the SCOR 4.0 model can be used by both public and private sectors to improve their supply chain strategies in globalizing world.},

  abstract     = {Similarity matrix has a significant effect on the performance of the spectral clustering, and how to determine the neighborhood in the similarity matrix effectively is one of its main difficulties. In this paper, a “divide and conquer” strategy is proposed to model the similarity matrix construction task by adopting Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The whole procedure is divided into two phases, phase I aims to determine the nonzero entries of the similarity matrix, and Phase II aims to determine the value of the nonzero entries of the similarity matrix. In phase I, the main contribution is that we model the task as a biobjective dynamic optimization problem, which optimizes the diversity and the similarity at the same time. It makes each individual determine one nonzero entry for each sample, and the encoding length decreases to O(N) in contrast with the non-ensemble multiobjective spectral clustering. In addition, a specific initialization operator and diversity preservation strategy are proposed during this phase. In phase II, three ensemble strategies are designed to determine the value of the nonzero value of the similarity matrix. Furthermore, this Pareto ensemble framework is extended to semi-supervised clustering by transforming the semi-supervised information to constraints. In contrast with the previous multiobjective evolutionary-based spectral clustering algorithms, the proposed Pareto ensemble-based framework makes a balance between time cost and the clustering accuracy, which is demonstrated in the experiments section.},

  abstract     = {A honeypot is a concealed security system that functions as a decoy to entice cyberattackers to reveal their information. Therefore, it is essential to disguise its identity to ensure its successful operation. Nonetheless, cyberattackers frequently attempt to uncover these honeypots; one of the most effective techniques for revealing their identity is a fingerprinting attack. Once identified, a honeypot can be exploited as a zombie by an attacker to attack others. Several effective techniques are available to prevent a fingerprinting attack, however, that would be contrary to the purpose of a honeypot, which is designed to interact with attackers to attempt to discover information relating to them. A technique to discover any attempted fingerprinting attack is highly desirable, for honeypots, while interacting with cyberattackers. Unfortunately, no specific method is available to detect and predict an attempted fingerprinting attack in real-time due to the difficulty of isolating it from other attacks. This paper presents a computational intelligence enabled honeypot that is capable of discovering and predicting an attempted fingerprinting attack by using a Principal components analysis and Fuzzy inference system. This proposed system is successfully tested against the five popular fingerprinting tools Nmap, Xprobe2, NetScanTools Pro, SinFP3 and Nessus.},

  abstract     = {We face many situations in day to day life where multi-polar statistics is offered. The prevailing models like Pythagorean fuzzy sets and m-polar fuzzy sets become inoperable in handling such situation efficiently e.g. if someone wishes to invest his capital in some scheme, he would for sure like to know repeated information about pros and cons of that scheme. Pythagorean m-polar fuzzy sets (PmFSs) serve as the most appropriate model to cope with such situations. The motivation behind this article is to extend the notions of PmFSs coined by Naeem et al. (J Intell Fuzzy Syst 37(6): 8441–8458, 2019) and introduce some new operations and results on PmFSs. Owing to the idea of Pythagorean m-polar fuzzy relation, we render an application in the selection of most appropriate life partner.},

In indeterminacy and inconsistent environment, a neutrosophic set is described by the truth, falsity, and indeterminacy degrees, but they lack measures related to reliability. To describe the hybrid information of combining the truth, falsity and indeterminacy degrees with their corresponding reliability degrees, this paper first proposes the concept of a neutrosophic Z-number (NZN) set, which is a new framework of neutrosophic values combined with the neutrosophic measures of reliability, as the generalization of the Z-number and the neutrosophic set. Then, we define the operations of neutrosophic Z-numbers (NZNs) and a score function for ranking NZNs. Next, we present NZN weighted arithmetic averaging (NZNWAA) and NZN weighted geometric averaging (NZNWGA) operators to aggregate NZN information and investigate their properties. Regarding the NZNWAA and NZNWGA operators and the score function, a multicriteria decision making (MDM) approach is developed in the NZN environment. Finally, an illustrative example about the selection problem of business partners is given to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed MDM approach in NZN setting.},

The convexity of the model is proved by satisfying the constraint equation in a fuzzy environment. An efficient procedure is applied to find the annual fish production quantity and the production in a single period to avoid the faulty measurement in the demand for fish items and the supply to the retailers. In addition, a few sensitivity analyses are carried out for the repair cost and the added value cost to indicate the existence of the total cost in the least possible range.

  abstract     = {Sedimentation in open channels occurs frequently and is relative to system inflow. The long-term retention of sediments on channel beds can increase the possibility of variations in deposits and their eventual consolidation. This study compares three hybrid artificial intelligence methods in estimating sediment transport without sedimentation (STWS). We employed the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods in combination with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to overcome the weakness of ANN training with conventional algorithms. We used the ICA, GA and PSO methods to optimize the weights of the ANN layers. Using dimensional analysis, we placed the effective parameters in predicting sediment transport into five non-dimensional groups. Six models are proposed and run using three hybrid methods (18 models in total). As the comparisons demonstrate, the proposed combined models are more accurate than ANN and existing equations in estimating the densimetric Froude number (Fr). However, we found the ICA–ANN superior to GA–ANN and PSO–ANN, as it produces explicit solutions to the problem. The ICA–ANN has the lowest prediction uncertainty band for Fr of all developed models. Moreover, the variation trend of the Fr for all input variables (except overall friction factor of sediment) is a second-order polynomial.},

  abstract     = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a prominent technique for evaluating relative efficiency of a set of entities called decision making units (DMUs) with homogeneous structures. In order to implement a comprehensive assessment, undesirable factors should be included in the efficiency analysis. The present study endeavors to propose a novel approach for solving DEA model in the presence of undesirable outputs in which all input/output data are represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. To this end, two virtual fuzzy DMUs called fuzzy ideal DMU (FIDMU) and fuzzy anti-ideal DMU (FADMU) are introduced into proposed fuzzy DEA framework. Then, a lexicographic approach is used to find the best and the worst fuzzy efficiencies of FIDMU and FADMU, respectively. Moreover, the resulting fuzzy efficiencies are used to measure the best and worst fuzzy relative efficiencies of DMUs to construct a fuzzy relative closeness index. To address the overall assessment, a new approach is proposed for ranking fuzzy relative closeness indexes based on which the DMUs are ranked. The developed framework greatly reduces the complexity of computation compared with commonly used existing methods in the literature. To validate the proposed methodology and proposed ranking method, a numerical example is illustrated and compared the results with an existing approach.},

For this purpose, ranking of failure causes is performed by taking into account five factors namely chances of occurrence of failure (F0), non-detection probability (Nd), downtime duration (Dd), spare part criticality (Spc) and safety risk (Sr). In this paper, first the primary and secondary weight of decision makers are calculated based on the uncertainty degree and divergence degree, respectively, to determine overall weight using cloud model theory by converting the uncertain linguistic evaluation matrix into interval cloud matrix, and then ranking of the steam handling subunit of paper making unit in a paper mill using extended PROMETHEE.

The main reason is huge economic savings can be achieved when setup times are explicitly included in scheduling decisions in various real-world industrial environments. On the other hand, many real systems commonly face various uncertainties, such as working environment changes, machine breakages, a worker becomes unstable, etc. In such an environment, job-processing times should not be fixed numbers. Motivated by these situations, this article introduces a single-machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times and scenario-dependent processing times where the objective function is the total completion time. The robust version of this problem without setup times has been shown to be NP hard. To tackle this problem, a lower bound and a dominance rule are derived in a branch-and-bound method for finding an optimal solution. As for determining approximate solutions, five neighborhood schemes are proposed and embedded in the cloud theory-based simulated annealing. Finally, the performances of all proposed algorithms are determined and compared.},

  abstract     = {The chaos-based cryptography techniques are used widely to protect digital information from intruders. The chaotic systems have some of special features that make them suitable for the purpose of encryption. These systems are highly unpredictable and are highly sensitive or responsive to the initial conditions, also known as butterfly effect. This sensitive dependence on initial conditions make these systems to exhibit an intricate dynamical behaviour. However, this dynamical behaviour is not much complex in simple one-dimensional chaotic maps. Hence, it becomes easy for an intruder to predict the contents of the message being sent. The proposed work in this paper introduces an improved method for encrypting images, which uses cosine transformation of 3-D Intertwining Logistic Map (ILM). The proposed approach has been split into three major parts. In the first part, Secure Hash Function-256 (SHA-256) is used with cosine transformed ILM (CT-ILM) to generate the chaotic sequence. This chaotic sequence is used by high-efficiency scrambling to reduce the correlations between the adjacent pixels of the image. In the second part, the image is rotated to move all the pixels away from their original position. In the third part, random order substitution is applied to change the value of image pixels. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on a number of standard parameters such as correlation coefficient, Entropy and Unified average change in intensity. The proposed approach has also been tested for decryption parameters like mean square error and peak signal to noise ratio. It can easily be observed from the obtained results that the proposed method of image encryption is more secure and time efficient than some earlier proposed techniques. The approach works for both color and grey scale images.},

To address this issue, a discrete imperialist competitive algorithm (DICA) was proposed to minimize the makespan and energy consumption. In the proposed algorithm, first, each solution was represented by a two-dimensional vector, where one vector represented the scheduling sequence and another one showed the machine assignment. Then, a decoding method considering the resource allocation was designed. Finally, we combined DICA and the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) to improve the performance of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we tested the proposed algorithm based on a randomly generated set of real shop scheduling system instances and compared with the existing heuristic algorithms. The results confirmed that the proposed algorithm can solve the RCHFS with high efficiency.},

The performance validation is measured in terms of mean absolute error, precision and recall, over a different number of clusters. The experimental results assert that the proposed method is a permissive approach for the recommendation over large-scale datasets.},

This has led to the development of several optimization algorithms to solve complex optimization problems. But none of the algorithms can solve all optimization problems equally well. As a result, the researchers focus on either improving exiting meta-heuristic optimization algorithms or introducing new algorithms. The social group optimization (SGO) Algorithm is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm that was proposed in the year 2016 for solving global optimization problems. In the literature, SGO is shown to perform well as compared to other optimization algorithms. This paper attempts to compare the performance of the SGO algorithm with other optimization algorithms proposed between 2017 and 2019. These algorithms are tested through several experiments, including multiple classical benchmark functions, CEC special session functions, and six classical engineering problems etc. Optimization results prove that the SGO algorithm is extremely competitive as compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are considered a powerful tool for physicians to support identification of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) using medical imaging modalities. Therefore, this article proposes a new framework of cascaded deep learning classifiers to enhance the performance of these CAD systems for highly suspected COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases in X-ray images. Our proposed deep learning framework constitutes two major advancements as follows. First, complicated multi-label classification of X-ray images have been simplified using a series of binary classifiers for each tested case of the health status. That mimics the clinical situation to diagnose potential diseases for a patient. Second, the cascaded architecture of COVID-19 and pneumonia classifiers is flexible to use different fine-tuned deep learning models simultaneously, achieving the best performance of confirming infected cases. This study includes eleven pre-trained convolutional neural network models, such as Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG) and Residual Neural Network (ResNet). They have been successfully tested and evaluated on public X-ray image dataset for normal and three diseased cases. The results of proposed cascaded classifiers showed that VGG16, ResNet50V2, and Dense Neural Network (DenseNet169) models achieved the best detection accuracy of COVID-19, viral (Non-COVID-19) pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia images, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of our cascaded deep learning classifiers is superior to other multi-label classification methods of COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases in previous studies. Therefore, the proposed deep learning framework presents a good option to be applied in the clinical routine to assist the diagnostic procedures of COVID-19 infection.},

  abstract     = {The shortest path problem (SPP) is an optimization problem of determining a path between specified source vertex s and destination vertex t in a fuzzy network. Fuzzy logic can handle the uncertainties, associated with the information of any real life problem, where conventional mathematical models may fail to reveal proper result. In classical SPP, real numbers are used to represent the arc length of the network. However, the uncertainties related with the linguistic description of arc length in SPP are not properly represented by real number. We need to address two main matters in SPP with fuzzy arc lengths. The first matter is how to calculate the path length using fuzzy addition operation and the second matter is how to compare the two different path lengths denoted by fuzzy parameter. We use the graded mean integration technique of triangular fuzzy numbers to solve this two problems. A common heuristic algorithm to solve the SPP is the genetic algorithm. In this manuscript, we have introduced an algorithmic method based on genetic algorithm for determining the shortest path between a source vertex s and destination vertex t in a fuzzy graph with fuzzy arc lengths in SPP. A new crossover and mutation is introduced to solve this SPP. We also describe the QoS routing problem in a wireless ad hoc network.},

However, the high-dimensional dataset with high dimensionality, high noise, and high redundancy brings some new challenges for the synchronization-inspired clustering algorithm, resulting in a significant increase in clustering time and a decrease in clustering accuracy. To address these challenges, an enhanced synchronization-inspired clustering algorithm, namely SyncHigh, is developed in this paper to quickly and accurately cluster the high-dimensional datasets. First, a PCA-based (Principal Component Analysis) dimension purification strategy is designed to find the principal components in all attributes. Second, a density-based data merge strategy is constructed to reduce the number of objects participating in the synchronization-inspired clustering algorithm, thereby speeding up clustering time. Third, the Kuramoto Model is enhanced to deal with mass differences between objects caused by the density-based data merge strategy. Finally, extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our SyncHigh algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the multitasking scheduling problems with batch distribution and due date assignment (DDA). Compared with classical scheduling problems with due date-related optimization functions, the job due dates are decision variables rather than given parameters. The jobs completed are distributed in batches, and the sizes of all batches are identical, which may be bounded or unbounded. The jobs in every batch are scheduled one by one. Each batch incurs a fixed cost. Under multitasking environment, it allows the machine to put an uncompleted job on hold and turn to another uncompleted job. The goal is to identify the optimal primary job sequence, the optimal job due dates, and the optimal batch production and distribution strategy so that one of the following two optimization functions is minimised: the total cost composed of the earliness penalty, DDA cost, tardiness penalty and batch distribution cost, and the total cost composed of the earliness penalty, weighted number of late jobs, DDA cost and batch distribution cost. We devise efficient exact algorithms for the problems we consider, and perform numerical experiments to check how multitasking affects the scheduling cost or value, the results of which can assist decision-makers to justify the extent to put to use or refrain from multitasking.},

The ability to forecast mortality rates accurately can allow the insurance company to take preventive measures to introduce new policies with reasonable prices. In this paper, several Lee–Carter (LC) based models are used to forecast the mortality rates in a case study of the Malaysian population. The LC-ARIMA model and also a combination of the LC model with two machine learning (ML) methods, namely the random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods are utilized on the prediction of mortality rates for males and females in Malaysia, whereby the LC-Random Forest (LC-RF) hybrid model is a new model that is introduced in this paper. Seventeen years of mortality data in Malaysia are selected as the dataset for this research. To analyze how the forecasting models perform for other countries, we have determined the model that has the best fit and produced the best forecasted mortality rates for all the other countries that are studied. This research has showed that LC-ANN and LC-ARIMA are the best model in predicting the mortality rates of males and females in Malaysia, respectively. This study has also found that the LC-ARIMA model is the best performing model in forecasting the mortality rates in countries that have longer life expectancy and a good healthcare system such as Sweden, Ireland, Japan, Hong Kong, Norway, Switzerland and Czechia. In contrast, the LC-ANN model is the best performing model in forecasting the mortality rates in countries that have a less efficiency, less accessibility healthcare system, and bad personal behavior such as Malaysia, Canada and Latvia.},

In any neutrosophic decision-making problem, the decision maker uses the comparison of neutrosophic numbers to choose among alternatives solutions. Here, we introduce a ranking method, i.e., De-bipolarization scheme for trapezoidal bipolar neutrosophic number (TrBNN) using removal area technique. We also describe the utility of trapezoidal bipolar neutrosophic number and its appliance in a multi criteria group decision making problem (MCGDM) for distinct users in trapezoidal bipolar arena which is more ethical, precise and reliable in neutrosophic field.},

As compared with the previous ZNN model activated by other commonly used activation functions (AF), the main improvement of the presented RZNN model is the fixed-time convergence even in the presence of noises. In addition, the convergence time of the proposed RZNN model is irrelevant to its initial states, and it can be computed directly. Both the rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulation results are provided for the verification of the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RZNN model.

  abstract     = {Most of the past cloud manufacturing (CMfg) studies investigated the short-term production planning or job scheduling of a CMfg system, while the mid-term or long-term capacity and production planning of a CMfg system has rarely been addressed. In addition, most existing methods are suitable for CMfg systems comprising three-dimensional (3D) printers, computer numerical control (CNC) machines or robots, but ignore the coordination and transportation required for moving jobs across factories. To fill these gaps, a fuzzy mid-term capacity and production planning model for a manufacturer with cloud-based capacity is proposed in this study. The proposed methodology guides a manufacturer in choosing between non-cloud-based capacity and cloud-based capacity. It can be applied to factories utilizing machines with different degrees of automation including highly automatic equipment (such as 3D printers, CNC machines, and robots) and lowly automatic (legacy) machines, while existing methods assume that orders can be easily transferred between machines that are often highly automatic. In the proposed methodology, first, various types of capacity are unequally prioritized. Then, a fuzzy mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is formulated and optimized to make the mid-term or long-term capacity and production plan of a factory. The fuzzy capacity and production planning model is designed for factories with parallel machines. The proposed methodology has been applied to a case to illustrate its applicability. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology successfully reduced total costs by up to 8%. The advantage of the proposed methodology over existing practices in fulfilling customers’ demand was also obvious.},

Machine learning is growing rapidly but models are poorly interpretable and depend on statistics. We propose a method by iteration based on causality which is the real one exists in the system. It is composed of fixed goals and basic rules called DNA rules. These DNA rules can be obtained from the definition and is not statistical rules. The causality in rules promises the process to be precise, because the potential attractor of the system is deterministic, because it is subjected to the rules although the system is complex especially under uncertain interference. Such a model not only works well in the traditional deterministic systems like the stable point and limited circle but also can work in some seemingly random and systems which are considered to be stochastic systems. The model is taken to play a game and it makes the machine learns fast and adaptively, and it is also interpretable with the causality and independent from the amount of data for it is based on causal iteration. It learns and even predicts the seemingly random interference in the game. We found such a model is adaptable, and it works well even in out-of-sample situations. The model is compared with an LSTM network in prediction a seemingly random sequence, the result shows the causality-based model also works well. We think that it may help to solve some problems hard for the traditional statistical method and become an enrichment for the current models.},

  abstract     = {We suggest and evaluate a method for optimal construction of synthetic treatment and control samples for the purpose of drawing causal inference. The balance optimization subset selection problem, which formulates minimization of aggregate imbalance in covariate distributions to reduce bias in data, is a new area of study in operations research. We investigate a novel metric, cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of balance between treatment and control groups. The proposed approach provides direct and automatic balancing of covariate distributions. In addition, the AUC-based approach is able to detect subtler distributional differences than existing measures, such as simple empirical mean/variance and count-based metrics. Thus, optimizing AUCs achieves a greater balance than the existing methods. Using 5 widely used real data sets and 7 synthetic data sets, we show that optimization of samples using existing methods (Chi-square, mean variance differences, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, and Mahalanobis) results in samples containing imbalance that is detectable using machine learning ensembles. We minimize covariate imbalance by minimizing the absolute value of the distance of the maximum cross-validated AUC on $$ M $$ folds from 0.50, using evolutionary optimization. We demonstrate that particle swarm optimization (PSO) outperforms modified cuckoo swarm (MCS) for a gradient-free, non-linear noisy cost function. To compute AUCs, we use supervised binary classification approaches from the machine learning and credit scoring literature. Using superscore ensembles adds to the classifier-based two-sample testing literature. If the mean cross-validated AUC based on machine learning is 0.50, the two groups are indistinguishable and suitable for causal inference.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy transportation problem is a very popular, well-known optimization problem in the area of fuzzy set and system. In most of the cases, researchers use type 1 fuzzy set as the cost of the transportation problem. Type 1 fuzzy number is unable to handle the uncertainty due to the description of human perception. Interval type 2 fuzzy set is an extended version of type 1 fuzzy set which can handle this ambiguity. In this paper, the interval type 2 fuzzy set is used in a fuzzy transportation problem to represent the transportation cost, demand, and supply. We define this transportation problem as interval type 2 fuzzy transportation problems. The utility of this type of fuzzy set as costs in transportation problem and its application in different real-world scenarios are described in this paper. Here, we have modified the classical Vogel’s approximation method for solved this fuzzy transportation problem. To the best of our information, there exists no algorithm based on Vogel’s approximation method in the literature for fuzzy transportation problem with interval type 2 fuzzy set as transportation cost, demand, and supply. We have used two Numerical examples to describe the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Shortest path problem (SPP) is a fundamental and well-known combinatorial optimization problem in the area of graph theory. In real-life scenarios, the arc weighs in a shortest path of a network/graph have the several parameters which are very hard to define exactly (i.e., capacity, cost, demand, traffic frequency, time, etc.). We can incorporate the fuzziness into a graph to handle this type of uncertain situation. In this manuscript, we propose the idea of constrained SPP (CSPP) in fuzzy environment. CSPP has an useful real-life application in online cab booking system. The main motivation of this study is to determine a path with minimal cost where traveling time within two locations does not more than predetermined time. We can not predicate the exact time and cost of the path due to uncertain traffic scenarios and another unexpected reasons; still, the geometrical distance between the locations is fixed. Here, we use trapezoidal fuzzy number to describe the edge weight of a fuzzy network/graph for CSPP. We define this CSPP as fuzzy CSPP (FCSPP). The utility of FCSPP is described in several real-life scenarios. We propose a mathematical formulation for the FCSPP and an algorithm is proposed for solving the FCSPP. We describe an application of our proposed algorithm on an online cab booking system.},

  abstract     = {The balance between the exploration and the exploitation plays a significant role in the meta-heuristic algorithms, especially when they are used to solve large-scale optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a multiple-strategy learning particle swarm optimization algorithm, called MSL-PSO, to solve problems with large-scale variables, in which different learning strategies are utilized in different stages. At the first stage, each individual tries to probe some positions by learning from the demonstrators who have better performance on the fitness value and the mean position of the population. All the best probed positions, each of which has the best fitness among all positions probed by its corresponding individual, will compose a new temporary population. The temporary population will be sorted on the fitness values in a descending order, and will be used for each individual to find its demonstrators, which is based on the rank of the best probed solution in the temporary population and the rank of the individual in the current population, to learn using a new strategy in the second stage. The first stage is used to improve the exploration capability, and the second one is expected to balance the convergence and diversity of the population. To verify the effectiveness of MSL-PSO for solving large-scale optimization problems, some empirical experiments are conducted, which include CEC2008 problems with 100, 500, and 1000 dimensions, and CEC2010 problems with 1000 dimensions. Experimental results show that our proposed MSL-PSO is competitive or has a better performance compared with ten state-of-the-art algorithms.},
