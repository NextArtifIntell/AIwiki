This approach allows one to exploit regularization by noise effects in obtaining convergence rates. In our first application we show convergence (to our knowledge for the first time) of the Euler–Maruyama scheme for SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motions with non-regular drift. When the Hurst parameter is $$H\in (0,1)$$ and the drift is $$\mathcal {C}^\alpha $$ , $$\alpha \in [0,1]$$ and $$\alpha &gt;1-1/(2H)$$ , we show the strong $$L_p$$ and almost sure rates of convergence to be $$((1/2+\alpha H)\wedge 1) -\varepsilon $$ , for any $$\varepsilon &gt;0$$ . Our conditions on the regularity of the drift are optimal in the sense that they coincide with the conditions needed for the strong uniqueness of solutions from Catellier and Gubinelli (Stoch Process Appl 126(8):2323–2366, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spa.2016.02.002 ).

  abstract     = {We consider a natural model of inhomogeneous random graphs that extends the classical Erdős–Rényi graphs and shares a close connection with the multiplicative coalescence, as pointed out by Aldous (Ann Probab 25:812–854, 1997). In this model, the vertices are assigned weights that govern their tendency to form edges. It is by looking at the asymptotic distributions of the masses (sum of the weights) of the connected components of these graphs that Aldous and Limic (Electron J Probab 3:1–59, 1998) have identified the entrance boundary of the multiplicative coalescence, which is intimately related to the excursion lengths of certain Lévy-type processes. We, instead, look at the metric structure of these components and prove their Gromov–Hausdorff–Prokhorov convergence to a class of (random) compact measured metric spaces that have been introduced in a companion paper (Broutin et al. in Limits of multiplicative inhomogeneous random graphs and Lévy trees: the continuum graphs. arXiv:1804.05871 , 2020). Our asymptotic regimes relate directly to the general convergence condition appearing in the work of Aldous and Limic. Our techniques provide a unified approach for this general “critical” regime, and relies upon two key ingredients: an encoding of the graph by some Lévy process as well as an embedding of its connected components into Galton–Watson forests. This embedding transfers asymptotically into an embedding of the limit objects into a forest of Lévy trees, which allows us to give an explicit construction of the limit objects from the excursions of the Lévy-type process. The mains results combined with the ones in the other paper allow us to extend and complement several previous results that had been obtained via model- or regime-specific proofs, for instance: the case of Erdős–Rényi random graphs obtained by Addario-Berry et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 152:367–406, 2012), the asymptotic homogeneous case as studied by Bhamidi et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 169:565–641, 2017), or the power-law case as considered by Bhamidi et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 170:387–474, 2018).},

This setting comprises a broad family of statistical estimation problems, including group synchronization on graphs, community detection, and low-rank matrix estimation. A large body of theoretical work has established sharp thresholds for weak and exact recovery, and sharp characterizations of the optimal reconstruction accuracy in such models, focusing however on the special case of Erdös–Rényi-type random graphs. An important finding of this line of work is the ubiquity of an information-computation gap. Namely, for many models of interest, a large gap is found between the optimal accuracy achievable by any statistical method, and the optimal accuracy achieved by known polynomial-time algorithms. Moreover, it is expected in many situations that this gap is robust to small amounts of additional side information revealed about the $$\theta _i$$ ’s. How does the structure of the graph G affect this picture? Is the information-computation gap a general phenomenon or does it only apply to specific families of graphs? We prove that the picture is dramatically different for graph sequences converging to amenable graphs (including, for instance, d-dimensional grids). We consider a model in which an arbitrarily small fraction of the vertex labels is revealed, and show that a linear-time local algorithm can achieve reconstruction accuracy that is arbitrarily close to the information-theoretic optimum. We contrast this to the case of random graphs. Indeed, focusing on group synchronization on random regular graphs, we prove that local algorithms are unable to have non-trivial performance below the so-called Kesten–Stigum threshold, even when a small amount of side information is revealed.},

The MLE is computationally intractable in general, and in fact, for $$\rho &gt;0$$ sufficiently small, this problem is conjectured to exhibit a statistical-computational gap. To provide rigorous evidence for this, we study the likelihood landscape for this problem, and establish that for some $$\varepsilon &gt;0$$ and $$\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho } \log \frac{1}{\rho } } \ll \lambda \ll \frac{1}{\rho ^{1/2 + \varepsilon }}$$ , the problem exhibits a variant of the Overlap-Gap-Property (OGP). As a direct consequence, we establish that a family of local MCMC based algorithms do not achieve optimal recovery. Finally, we establish that for $$\lambda &gt; 1/\rho $$ , a simple spectral method recovers a constant proportion of the hidden submatrix.},

The results are similar in flavor to the ones from our companion paper dealing with $$\hbox {CLE}_{\kappa }$$ for $$\kappa $$ in (8/3, 4), where the loops of the CLE are disjoint and simple. In particular, we encode the combined structure of the LQG surface and the $$\hbox {CLE}_{\kappa &#39;}$$ in terms of stable growth-fragmentation trees or their variants, which also appear in the asymptotic study of peeling processes on decorated planar maps. This has consequences for questions that do a priori not involve LQG surfaces: In our paper entitled “CLE Percolations” described the law of interfaces obtained when coloring the loops of a $$\hbox {CLE}_{\kappa &#39;}$$ independently into two colors with respective probabilities p and $$1-p$$ . This description was complete up to one missing parameter $$\rho $$ . The results of the present paper about CLE on LQG allow us to determine its value in terms of p and $$\kappa &#39;$$ . It shows in particular that $$\hbox {CLE}_{\kappa &#39;}$$ and $$\hbox {CLE}_{16/\kappa &#39;}$$ are related via a continuum analog of the Edwards-Sokal coupling between $$\hbox {FK}_q$$ percolation and the q-state Potts model (which makes sense even for non-integer q between 1 and 4) if and only if $$q=4\cos ^2(4\pi / \kappa &#39;)$$ . This provides further evidence for the long-standing belief that $$\hbox {CLE}_{\kappa &#39;}$$ and $$\hbox {CLE}_{16/\kappa &#39;}$$ represent the scaling limits of $$\hbox {FK}_q$$ percolation and the q-Potts model when q and $$\kappa &#39;$$ are related in this way. Another consequence of the formula for $$\rho (p,\kappa &#39;)$$ is the value of half-plane arm exponents for such divide-and-color models (a.k.a. fuzzy Potts models) that turn out to take a somewhat different form than the usual critical exponents for two-dimensional models.},

At high temperatures we show that the alternating initial condition is asymptotically the fastest one, and, surprisingly, its mixing time is faster than at infinite temperature, accelerating as the inverse-temperature $$\beta $$ ranges from 0 to $$\beta _0=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm {arctanh}(\frac{1}{3})$$ .

It is a theorem of Noam Berger (Commun. Math. Phys., 2002) that if $$0&lt;\alpha &lt;d$$ then there is no infinite cluster at the critical parameter $$\beta _c$$ . We give a new, quantitative proof of this theorem establishing the power-law upper bound $$\begin{aligned} {\mathbf {P}}_{\beta _c}\bigl (|K|\ge n\bigr ) \le C n^{-(d-\alpha )/(2d+\alpha )} \end{aligned}$$ for every $$n\ge 1$$ , where K is the cluster of the origin. We believe that this is the first rigorous power-law upper bound for a Bernoulli percolation model that is neither planar nor expected to exhibit mean-field critical behaviour. As part of the proof, we establish a universal inequality implying that the maximum size of a cluster in percolation on any finite graph is of the same order as its mean with high probability. We apply this inequality to derive a new rigorous hyperscaling inequality $$(2-\eta )(\delta +1)\le d(\delta -1)$$ relating the cluster-volume exponent $$\delta $$ and two-point function exponent $$\eta $$ .},

Here, we follow the approach in a paper by Etheridge et al. (Electron J Probab 22:1–40, 2017) to show that in a wide variety of examples when the RDE limit has a bistable reaction term and traveling waves have speed 0, one can run time faster and further rescale space to obtain convergence to motion by mean curvature. This opens up the possibility of proving that the sexual reproduction model with fast stirring has a discontinuous phase transition, and that in Region 2 of the phase diagram for the nonlinear voter model studied by Molofsky et al. (Theoret Pop Biol 55(1999):270–282, 1999) there were two nontrivial stationary distributions.},

In order to justify the definition we prove that the measure obtained by an appropriately normalized loop term on n-tuples of paths has a limit. The limit measure can be described as n paths moving by the Loewner equation with a driving term of Dyson Brownian motion. While the limit process has been considered before, this paper shows why it naturally arises as a limit of configurational measures obtained from loop measures.},

More precisely, we prove crossing estimates in quads which are uniform in their boundary conditions and depend only on their extremal lengths. They imply in particular that any fractal boundary is touched by macroscopic clusters, uniformly in its roughness or the configuration on the boundary. Additionally, they imply that any sub-sequential scaling limit of the collection of interfaces between primal and dual clusters is made of loops that are non-simple. We also obtain a number of properties of so-called arm-events: three universal critical exponents (two arms in the half-plane, three arms in the half-plane and five arms in the bulk), quasi-multiplicativity and well-separation properties (even when arms are not alternating between primal and dual), and the fact that the four-arm exponent is strictly smaller than 2. These results were previously known only for Bernoulli percolation ( $$q = 1$$ ) and the FK-Ising model ( $$q = 2$$ ). Finally, we prove new bounds on the one, two and four-arm exponents for $$q\in [1,2]$$ , as well as the one-arm exponent in the half-plane. These improve the previously known bounds, even for Bernoulli percolation.},

Each monomer i contributes an energy $$(\beta \omega _i-h)\varphi (S_i)$$ to the interaction Hamiltonian, where $$S_i \in {\mathbb {Z}}$$ is the height of monomer i with respect to the interface, $$\varphi :\,{\mathbb {Z}}\rightarrow [0,\infty )$$ is the interaction potential, $$\beta \in [0,\infty )$$ is the inverse temperature, and $$h \in {\mathbb {R}}$$ is the charge bias parameter. The configurations of the polymer are weighted according to the Gibbs measure associated with the interaction Hamiltonian, where the reference measure is given by a Markov chain on $${\mathbb {Z}}$$ . We study both the quenched and the annealed free energy per monomer in the limit as $$N\rightarrow \infty $$ . We show that each exhibits a phase transition along a critical curve in the $$(\beta ,h)$$ -plane, separating a localized phase (where the polymer stays close to the interface) from a delocalized phase (where the polymer wanders away from the interface). We derive variational formulas for the critical curves and we obtain upper and lower bounds on the quenched critical curve in terms of the annealed critical curve. In addition, for the special case where the reference measure is given by a Bessel random walk, we derive the scaling limit of the annealed free energy as $$\beta ,h \downarrow 0$$ in three different regimes for the tail exponent of $$\varphi $$ .},

This confirms a numerical prediction in the physics literature by showing that the critical susceptibility in a finite domain of linear size L with free boundary conditions is of order $$L^2$$ as $$L\rightarrow \infty $$ . We also prove that the scaling limit of the near-critical (small external field) Ising magnetization field with free boundary conditions is Gaussian with the same covariance as the critical scaling limit, and thus the correlations do not decay exponentially.

  abstract     = {We introduce a new percolation model on planar lattices. First, impurities (“holes”) are removed independently from the lattice. On the remaining part, we then consider site percolation with some parameter p close to the critical value $$p_c$$ . The mentioned impurities are not only microscopic, but allowed to be mesoscopic (“heavy-tailed”, in some sense). For technical reasons (the proofs of our results use quite precise bounds on critical exponents in Bernoulli percolation), our study focuses on the triangular lattice. We determine explicitly the range of parameters in the distribution of impurities for which the connectivity properties of percolation remain of the same order as without impurities, for distances below a certain characteristic length. This generalizes a celebrated result by Kesten for classical near-critical percolation (which can be viewed as critical percolation with single-site impurities). New challenges arise from the potentially large impurities. This generalization, which is also of independent interest, turns out to be crucial to study models of forest fires (or epidemics). In these models, all vertices are initially vacant, and then become occupied at rate 1. If an occupied vertex is hit by lightning, which occurs at a very small rate $$\zeta $$ , its entire occupied cluster burns immediately, so that all its vertices become vacant. Our results for percolation with impurities are instrumental in analyzing the behavior of these forest fire models near and beyond the critical time (i.e. the time after which, in a forest without fires, an infinite cluster of trees emerges). In particular, we prove (so far, for the case when burnt trees do not recover) the existence of a sequence of “exceptional scales” (functions of $$\zeta $$ ). For forests on boxes with such side lengths, the impact of fires does not vanish in the limit as $$\zeta \searrow 0$$ . This surprising behavior, related to the non-monotonicity of these processes, was not predicted in the physics literature.},

We show that $$N/d_{N}^{2}$$ is indeed the correct second time scale for the most general class of reversible inclusion processes, and thus prove the first conjecture of the foresaid study. Here, N denotes the number of particles, and $$d_{N}$$ denotes the small scale of randomness of the system. The main obstacles of this research arise in calculating the sharp asymptotics for the capacities, and in the fact that the methods employed in the former study are not directly applicable due to the complex geometry of particle configurations. To overcome these problems, we first thoroughly examine the landscape of the transition rates to obtain a proper test function of the equilibrium potential, which provides the upper bound for the capacities. Then, we modify the induced test flow and precisely estimate the equilibrium potential near the metastable valleys to obtain the correct lower bound for the capacities.},

Many examples of such graphs exhibit similar geometric and spectral properties, and it has been conjectured that this is necessary. We present a family of counterexamples. In particular, we show that for every rational $$d &gt; 2$$ , there is a planar graph with uniform polynomial growth of degree d on which the random walk is transient, disproving a conjecture of Benjamini (Coarse Geometry and Randomness, Volume 2100 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics. Springer, Cham, 2011). By a well-known theorem of Benjamini and Schramm, such a graph cannot be a unimodular random graph. We also give examples of unimodular random planar graphs of uniform polynomial growth with unexpected properties. For instance, graphs of (almost sure) uniform polynomial growth of every rational degree $$d &gt; 2$$ for which the speed exponent of the walk is larger than 1/d, and in which the complements of all balls are connected. This resolves negatively two questions of Benjamini and Papasoglou (Proc Am Math Soc 139(11):4105–4111, 2011).},

Starting with a single vertex, at each discrete step $$i\ge 1$$ a new vertex $$v_i$$ enters the system with $$m_i\ge 1$$ edges which it sequentially connects to a pre-existing vertex $$v\in {\mathcal {G}}_{i-1}$$ with probability proportional to $$f(\text{ degree }(v))$$ . We consider the problem of emergence of persistent hubs: existence of a finite (a.s.) time $$n^*$$ such that for all $$n\ge n^*$$ the identity of the maximal degree vertex (or in general the K largest degree vertices for $$K\ge 1$$ ) does not change. We obtain general conditions on f and $$\left\{ m_i:i\ge 1\right\} $$ under which a persistent hub emerges, and also those under which a persistent hub fails to emerge. In the case of lack of persistence, for the specific case of trees ( $$m_i\equiv 1$$ for all i), we derive asymptotics for the maximal degree and the index of the maximal deg ree vertex (time at which the vertex with current maximal degree entered the system) to understand the movement of the maximal degree vertex as the network evolves. A key role in the analysis is played by an inverse rate weighted martingale constructed from a continuous time embedding of the discrete time model. Asymptotics for this martingale, including concentration inequalities and moderate deviations form the technical foundations for the main results.},

Our focus is on the quenched invariance principle (QIP) which we establish by a combination of corrector methods, functional inequalities and heat-kernel technology assuming that the p-th moment of $$\sum _{x\in {\mathbb {Z}}^d}C_{0,x}|x|^2$$ and q-th moment of $$1/C_{0,x}$$ for x neighboring the origin are finite for some $$p,q\ge 1$$ with $$p^{-1}+q^{-1}&lt;2/d$$ . In particular, a QIP thus holds for random walks on long-range percolation graphs with connectivity exponents larger than 2d in all $$d\ge 2$$ , provided all the nearest-neighbor edges are present. Although still limited by moment conditions, our method of proof is novel in that it avoids proving everywhere-sublinearity of the corrector. This is relevant because we show that, for long-range percolation with exponents between $$d+2$$ and 2d, the corrector exists but fails to be sublinear everywhere. Similar examples are constructed also for nearest-neighbor, ergodic conductances in $$d\ge 3$$ under the conditions complementary to those of the recent work of Bella and Schäffner (Ann Probab 48(1):296–316, 2020). These examples elucidate the limitations of elliptic-regularity techniques that underlie much of the recent progress on these problems.},

Given a loss function and a family of candidate probabilities, that we shall call a model, we aim at designing an estimator with values in our model that possesses good estimation properties not only when the distribution of the data belongs to the model but also when it lies close enough to it. The losses we have in mind are the total variation, Hellinger, Wasserstein and $${\mathbb {L}}_{p}$$ -distances to name a few. We show that the risk of our estimator can be bounded by the sum of an approximation term that accounts for the loss between the true distribution and the model and a complexity term that corresponds to the bound we would get if this distribution did belong to the model. Our results hold under mild assumptions on the true distribution of the data and are based on exponential deviation inequalities that are non-asymptotic and involve explicit constants. Interestingly, when the model reduces to two distinct probabilities, our procedure results in a robust test whose errors of first and second kinds only depend on the losses between the true distribution and the two tested probabilities.},

  abstract     = {We introduce multi-type Markov Branching trees, which are simple random population tree models where individuals are characterized by their size and their type and give rise to (size,type)-children in a Galton–Watson fashion, with the rule that the size of any individual is at least the sum of the sizes of its children. Assuming that the macroscopic size-splittings are rare, we describe the scaling limits of multi-type Markov Branching trees in terms of multi-type self-similar fragmentation trees. We observe three different regimes according to whether the probability of type change of a size-biased child is proportional to the probability of macroscopic splitting (the critical regime, in which we get in the limit multi-type fragmentation trees with indeed several types), smaller than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the solo regime, in which the limit trees are monotype as we never see a type change), or larger than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the mixing regime, in which case the types mix in the limit and we get monotype fragmentation trees). This framework allows us to unify models which may a priori seem quite different, a strength which we illustrate with two notable applications. The first one concerns the description of the scaling limits of growing models of random trees built by gluing at each step on the current structure a finite tree picked randomly in a finite alphabet of trees, extending Rémy’s well-known algorithm for the generation of uniform binary trees to a fairly broad framework. We are then either in the critical regime with multi-type fragmentation trees in the scaling limit, or in the solo regime. The second application concerns the scaling limits of large multi-type critical Galton–Watson trees when the offspring distributions all have finite second moments. This topic has already been studied but our approach gives a different proof and we improve on previous results by relaxing some hypotheses. We are then in the mixing regime: the scaling limits are always multiple of the Brownian CRT, a pure monotype fragmentation tree in our framework.},

  abstract     = {The global structure of the minimal spanning tree (MST) is expected to be universal for a large class of underlying random discrete structures. However, very little is known about the intrinsic geometry of MSTs of most standard models, and so far the scaling limit of the MST viewed as a metric measure space has only been identified in the case of the complete graph (Addario-Berry et al. in Ann Probab 45(5):3075–3144, 2017). In this work, we show that the MST constructed by assigning i.i.d. continuous edge weights to either the random (simple) 3-regular graph or the 3-regular configuration model on n vertices, endowed with the tree distance scaled by $$n^{-1/3}$$ and the uniform probability measure on the vertices, converges in distribution with respect to Gromov–Hausdorff–Prokhorov topology to a random compact metric measure space. Further, this limiting space has the same law as the scaling limit of the MST of the complete graph identified in Addario-Berry et al. (2017) up to a scaling factor of $$6^{1/3}$$ . Our proof relies on a novel argument that proceeds via a comparison between a 3-regular configuration model and the largest component in the critical Erdős–Rényi random graph. The techniques of this paper can be used to establish the scaling limit of the MST in the setting of general random graphs with given degree sequences provided two additional technical conditions are verified.},

(Ann Probab 22:566–625, 1994), are random Borel measures that can be formally defined by exponentiating $$\gamma $$ times the square root of the local times of planar Brownian motion. So far, only the subcritical measures where the parameter $$\gamma $$ is less than 2 were studied. This article considers the critical case where $$\gamma =2$$ , using three different approximation procedures which all lead to the same universal measure. On the one hand, we exponentiate the square root of the local times of small circles and show convergence in the Seneta–Heyde normalisation as well as in the derivative martingale normalisation. On the other hand, we construct the critical measure as a limit of subcritical measures. This is the first example of a non-Gaussian critical multiplicative chaos. We are inspired by methods coming from critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos, but there are essential differences, the main one being the lack of Gaussianity which prevents the use of Kahane’s inequality and hence a priori controls. Instead, a continuity lemma is proved which makes it possible to use tools from stochastic calculus as an effective substitute.},

Our results encompass two regimes: a Gaussian regime for small deviations, and a stretched exponential regime for larger deviations. In the latter regime, we show that conditioned on the moderate deviations event, the walk folds a small part of its range in a ball-like subset. Also, we provide new path properties, in dimension three as well. Besides the key role Newtonian capacity plays in this study, we introduce two original ideas, of general interest, which strengthen the approach developed in Asselah and Schapira (Sci Éc Norm Supér 50(4):755–786, 2017).},

  abstract     = {We study the dynamics of symmetric and asymmetric spin-glass models of size N. The analysis is in terms of the double empirical process: this contains both the spins, and the field felt by each spin, at a particular time (without any knowledge of the correlation history). It is demonstrated that in the large N limit, the dynamics of the double empirical process becomes deterministic and autonomous over finite time intervals. This does not contradict the well-known fact that SK spin-glass dynamics is non-Markovian (in the large N limit) because the empirical process has a topology that does not discern correlations in individual spins at different times. In the large N limit, the evolution of the density of the double empirical process approaches a nonlocal autonomous PDE operator $$\Phi _t$$ . Because the emergent dynamics is autonomous, in future work one will be able to apply PDE techniques to analyze bifurcations in $$\Phi _t$$ . Preliminary numerical results for the SK Glauber dynamics suggest that the ‘glassy dynamical phase transition’ occurs when a stable fixed point of the flow operator $$\Phi _t$$ destabilizes.},

For such graphs, we show that if the edge connectivity probability p satisfies $$np\ge \log n+k(n)$$ with $$k(n)\rightarrow \infty $$ as $$n\rightarrow \infty $$ , then the adjacency matrix is invertible with probability approaching one (n is the number of vertices in the two former cases and the same for each part in the latter case). For $$np\le \log n-k(n)$$ these matrices are invertible with probability approaching zero, as $$n\rightarrow \infty $$ . In the intermediate region, when $$np=\log n+k(n)$$ , for a bounded sequence $$k(n)\in \mathbb {R}$$ , the event $$\Omega _0$$ that the adjacency matrix has a zero row or a column and its complement both have a non-vanishing probability. For such choices of p our results show that conditioned on the event $$\Omega _0^c$$ the matrices are again invertible with probability tending to one. This shows that the primary reason for the non-invertibility of such matrices is the existence of a zero row or a column. We further derive a bound on the (modified) condition number of these matrices on $$\Omega _0^c$$ , with a large probability, establishing von Neumann’s prediction about the condition number up to a factor of $$n^{o(1)}$$ .},

These stopping times are hitting times of space-time subsets, so-called Root barriers. Our main result is, besides the existence and optimality, a potential-theoretic characterisation of this Root barrier as a free boundary. If the generator of the Markov process is sufficiently regular, this reduces to an obstacle PDE that has the Root barrier as free boundary and thereby generalises previous results from one-dimensional diffusions to Markov processes. However, our characterisation always applies and allows, at least in principle, to compute the Root barrier by dynamic programming, even when the well-posedness of the informally associated obstacle PDE is not clear. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our method by replacing time by an additive functional in Root’s construction. Already for multi-dimensional Brownian motion this leads to new class of constructive solutions of (SEP).},

In this sense, this extends the well-known result of Talagrand in the Gaussian case. By duality, these transportation-entropy inequalities imply a strong integrability inequality for Bernoulli and exponential processes. As a result, we obtain on the discrete hypercube a dimension-free mean-field approximation of the free energy of a Gibbs measure and a nonlinear large deviation bound with only a logarithmic dependence on the dimension. Applied to the Ising model, we deduce that the mean-field approximation is within $$O(\sqrt{n} ||J||_2)$$ of the free energy, where n is the number of spins and $$||J||_2$$ is the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of the interaction matrix. Finally, we obtain a reverse log-Sobolev inequality on the discrete hypercube similar to the one proved recently in the Gaussian case by Eldan and Ledoux.},

In this work, we show that given just the mm-space structure, one can a.s. recover the LQG sphere. This implies that there is a canonical way to parameterize an instance of TBM by the Euclidean sphere (up to Möbius transformation). In other words, an instance of TBM has a canonical conformal structure. The conclusion is that TBM and the $$\sqrt{8/3}$$ -LQG sphere are equivalent. They ultimately encode the same structure (a topological sphere with a measure, a metric, and a conformal structure) and have the same law. From this point of view, the fact that the conformal structure a.s. determines the metric and vice-versa can be understood as a property of this unified law. The results of this work also imply that the analogous facts hold for Brownian and $$\sqrt{8/3}$$ -LQG surfaces with other topologies.},

  abstract     = {The Brownian map is a model of random geometry on the sphere and as such an important object in probability theory and physics. It has been linked to Liouville Quantum Gravity and much research has been devoted to it. One open question asks for a canonical embedding of the Brownian map into the sphere or other, more abstract, metric spaces. Similarly, Liouville Quantum Gravity has been shown to be “equivalent” to the Brownian map but the exact nature of the correspondence (i.e. embedding) is still unknown. In this article we show that any embedding of the Brownian map or continuum random tree into $${{\,\mathrm{\mathbb {R}}\,}}^d$$ , $${{\,\mathrm{\mathbb {S}}\,}}^d$$ , $${{\,\mathrm{\mathbb {T}}\,}}^d$$ , or more generally any doubling metric space, cannot be quasisymmetric. We achieve this with the aid of dimension theory by identifying a metric structure that is invariant under quasisymmetric mappings (such as isometries) and which implies infinite Assouad dimension. We show, using elementary methods, that this structure is almost surely present in the Brownian continuum random tree and the Brownian map. We further show that snowflaking the metric is not sufficient to find an embedding and discuss continuum trees as a tool to studying “fractal functions”.},

We investigate this random conductance model and prove correlation inequalities, duality properties, and uniqueness of the Gibbs measure in certain regimes. We then show that there is a close relation between Gibbs measures of the random conductance model and gradient Gibbs measures with zero tilt for the potential V. Based on these results we can give a new proof for the non-uniqueness of ergodic zero-tilt gradient Gibbs measures in dimension 2. In contrast to the first proof of this result we rely on planar duality and do not use reflection positivity. Moreover, we show uniqueness of ergodic zero tilt gradient Gibbs measures for almost all values of p and q and, in dimension $$d\ge 4$$ , for q close to one or for $$p(1-p)$$ sufficiently small.},

The k-dimensional Hausdorff measure of their k-skeleton is considered. Explicit formulas for first- and second-order quantities restricted to bounded observation windows are obtained. The central limit problem for the k-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the k-skeleton is approached in two different set-ups: (i) for a fixed window and growing intensities, and (ii) for fixed intensity and growing spherical windows. While in case (i) the central limit theorem is valid for all $$d\ge 2$$ , it is shown that in case (ii) the central limit theorem holds for $$d\in \{2,3\}$$ and fails if $$d\ge 4$$ and $$k=d-1$$ or if $$d\ge 7$$ and for general k. Also rates of convergence are studied and multivariate central limit theorems are obtained. Moreover, the situation in which the intensity and the spherical window are growing simultaneously is discussed. In the background are the Malliavin–Stein method for normal approximation and the combinatorial moment structure of Poisson U-statistics as well as tools from hyperbolic integral geometry.},

  abstract     = {The classical theorem by Pitman states that a Brownian motion minus twice its running infimum enjoys the Markov property. On the one hand, Biane understood that Pitman’s theorem is intimately related to the representation theory of the quantum group $${{\mathcal {U}}}_q\left( {\mathfrak sl}_2 \right) $$ , in the so-called crystal regime $$q \rightarrow 0$$ . On the other hand, Bougerol and Jeulin showed the appearance of exactly the same Pitman transform in the infinite curvature limit $$r \rightarrow \infty $$ of a Brownian motion on the hyperbolic space $${{\mathbb {H}}}^3 = SL _2({{\mathbb {C}}})/ SU _2$$ . This paper aims at understanding this phenomenon by giving a unifying point of view. In order to do so, we exhibit a presentation $${{\mathcal {U}}}_q^\hbar \left( {\mathfrak sl}_2 \right) $$ of the Jimbo–Drinfeld quantum group which isolates the role of curvature r and that of the Planck constant $$\hbar $$ . The simple relationship between parameters is $$q=e^{-r}$$ . The semi-classical limits $$\hbar \rightarrow 0$$ are the Poisson–Lie groups dual to $$ SL _2({{\mathbb {C}}})$$ with varying curvatures $$r \in {{\mathbb {R}}}_+$$ . We also construct classical and quantum random walks, drawing a full picture which includes Biane’s quantum walks and the construction of Bougerol–Jeulin. Taking the curvature parameter r to infinity leads indeed to the crystal regime at the level of representation theory ( $$\hbar &gt;0$$ ) and to the Bougerol–Jeulin construction in the classical world ( $$\hbar =0$$ ). All these results are neatly in accordance with the philosophy of Kirillov’s orbit method.},

We prove that such bridges can be strongly coupled to Brownian bridges of appropriate variance when the jumps are either continuous or integer valued under some mild technical assumptions on the jump distributions. Our arguments follow a similar dyadic scheme to KMT’s original proof, but they require more refined estimates and stronger assumptions necessitated by the endpoint conditioning.

We assume that $$s_{xy}$$ vanishes if $$|x-y|$$ exceeds the band width W, and we are interested in the mesoscopic scale with $$1\ll W\ll N$$ . Define the generalized resolvent of H as $$G(H,Z):=(H - Z)^{-1}$$ , where Z is a deterministic diagonal matrix with entries $$Z_{xx}\in \mathbb {C}_+$$ for all x. Then we establish a precise high-probability bound on certain averages of polynomials of the resolvent entries. As an application of this fluctuation averaging result, we give a self-contained proof for the delocalization of random band matrices in dimensions $$d\ge 2$$ . More precisely, for any fixed $$d\ge 2$$ , we prove that the bulk eigenvectors of H are delocalized in certain averaged sense if $$N\le W^{1+\frac{d}{2}}$$ .

For the first time, we are able to construct martingale solutions which satisfy the equation pointwise and not only in a generalized (distributional or viscosity) sense. Moreover, we study their large-time behavior. Our analysis is based on a viscous approximation and new global bounds, namely, an $$L^{\infty }_{\omega ,x,t}$$ estimate for the gradient and an $$L^{2}_{\omega ,x,t}$$ bound for the Hessian. The proof makes essential use of the delicate interplay between the deterministic mean curvature part and the stochastic perturbation, which permits to show that certain gradient-dependent energies are supermartingales. Our energy bounds in particular imply that solutions become asymptotically spatially homogeneous and approach a Brownian motion perturbed by a random constant.},

First, we construct rooted $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa $$ loop measures in the Riemann sphere $$\widehat{\mathbb {C}}$$ , which satisfy Möbius covariance, conformal Markov property, reversibility, and space-time homogeneity, when the loop is parametrized by its $$(1+\frac{\kappa }{8})$$ -dimensional Minkowski content. Second, by integrating rooted $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa $$ loop measures, we construct the unrooted $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa $$ loop measure in $$\widehat{\mathbb {C}}$$ , which satisfies Möbius invariance and reversibility. Third, we use Brownian loop measures to extend the rooted and unrooted $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa $$ loop measures from $$\widehat{\mathbb {C}}$$ to subdomains of $$\widehat{\mathbb {C}}$$ , which respectively satisfy conformal covariance and conformal invariance, and then further use the conformal invariance to extend unrooted $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa $$ loop measures to some Riemann surfaces. Finally, using a similar approach, we construct $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa $$ bubble measures in simply/multiply connected domains rooted at a boundary point. The space-time homogeneity of rooted $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa $$ loop measures in $$\widehat{\mathbb {C}}$$ confirms a conjecture by Greg Lawler on the existence of such measures.},

The mixing time of this random walk is known to be at most $$1.02 \log _2 q$$ for almost all odd q (Chung, Diaconis, Graham in Ann Probab 15(3):1148–1165, 1987), and at least $$1.004 \log _2 q$$ (Hildebrand in Proc Am Math Soc 137(4):1479–1487, 2009). We identify a constant $$c = 1.01136\dots $$ such that the mixing time is $$(c+o(1))\log _2 q$$ for almost all odd q. In general, the mixing time of the Markov chain $$X_{n+1} = a X_n + b_n$$ modulo q, where a is a fixed positive integer and the steps $$b_n$$ are i.i.d. with some given distribution in $${\mathbf {Z}}$$ , is related to the entropy of a corresponding self-similar Cantor-like measure (such as a Bernoulli convolution). We estimate the mixing time up to a $$1+o(1)$$ factor whenever the entropy exceeds $$(\log a)/2$$ .},

  abstract     = {Let $$X_1, X_2, \ldots $$ be i.i.d. copies of some real random variable X. For any deterministic $$\varepsilon _2, \varepsilon _3, \ldots $$ in $$\{0,1\}$$ , a basic algorithm introduced by H.A. Simon yields a reinforced sequence $$\hat{X}_1, \hat{X}_2 , \ldots $$ as follows. If $$\varepsilon _n=0$$ , then $$ \hat{X}_n$$ is a uniform random sample from $$\hat{X}_1, \ldots , \hat{X}_{n-1}$$ ; otherwise $$ \hat{X}_n$$ is a new independent copy of X. The purpose of this work is to compare the scaling exponent of the usual random walk $$S(n)=X_1+\cdots + X_n$$ with that of its step reinforced version $$\hat{S}(n)=\hat{X}_1+\cdots + \hat{X}_n$$ . Depending on the tail of X and on asymptotic behavior of the sequence $$(\varepsilon _n)$$ , we show that step reinforcement may speed up the walk, or at the contrary slow it down, or also does not affect the scaling exponent at all. Our motivation partly stems from the study of random walks with memory, notably the so-called elephant random walk and its variations.},

We use them to find the precise homeomorphism type of the r-Martin boundary, which describes r-harmonic functions, for every $$r\le R$$ . We also define a notion of spectral degeneracy along parabolic subgroups which is crucial to describe the homeomorphism type of the R-Martin boundary. Finally, we give a criterion for (strong) stability of the Martin boundary in the sense of Picardello and Woess (in: Potential theory, de Gruyter, 1992) in terms of spectral degeneracy. We then prove that this criterion is always satisfied in small rank, so that in particular, the Martin boundary of an admissible symmetric finitely supported probability measure on a geometrically finite Kleinian group of dimension at most 5 is always strongly stable.},

For $$\kappa \in (8/3,4]$$ , the generalized disconnection exponents have a physical interpretation in terms of planar Brownian loop-soups with intensity $$c\in (0,1]$$ , which allows us to obtain the first prediction of the dimension of multiple points on the cluster boundaries of these loop-soups. In particular, according to our prediction, the dimension of double points on the cluster boundaries is strictly positive for $$c\in (0,1)$$ and equal to zero for the critical intensity $$c=1$$ , leading to an interesting open question of whether such points exist for the critical loop-soup. Our definition of the exponents is based on a certain general version of radial restriction measures that we construct and study. As an important tool, we introduce a new family of radial SLEs depending on $$\kappa $$ and two additional parameters $$\mu , \nu $$ , that we call radial hypergeometric SLEs. This is a natural but substantial extension of the family of radial $$\hbox {SLE}_\kappa (\rho )s$$ .},

  abstract     = {Random graph matching refers to recovering the underlying vertex correspondence between two random graphs with correlated edges; a prominent example is when the two random graphs are given by Erdős-Rényi graphs $$G(n,\frac{d}{n})$$ . This can be viewed as an average-case and noisy version of the graph isomorphism problem. Under this model, the maximum likelihood estimator is equivalent to solving the intractable quadratic assignment problem. This work develops an $${\widetilde{O}}(n d^2+n^2)$$ -time algorithm which perfectly recovers the true vertex correspondence with high probability, provided that the average degree is at least $$d = \varOmega (\log ^2 n)$$ and the two graphs differ by at most $$\delta = O( \log ^{-2}(n) )$$ fraction of edges. For dense graphs and sparse graphs, this can be improved to $$\delta = O( \log ^{-2/3}(n) )$$ and $$\delta = O( \log ^{-2}(d) )$$ respectively, both in polynomial time. The methodology is based on appropriately chosen distance statistics of the degree profiles (empirical distribution of the degrees of neighbors). Before this work, the best known result achieves $$\delta =O(1)$$ and $$n^{o(1)} \le d \le n^c$$ for some constant c with an $$n^{O(\log n)}$$ -time algorithm and $$\delta ={{\widetilde{O}}}((d/n)^4)$$ and $$d = {\widetilde{\varOmega }}(n^{4/5})$$ with a polynomial-time algorithm.},
