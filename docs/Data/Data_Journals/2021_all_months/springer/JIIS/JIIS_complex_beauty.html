  abstract     = {People express their opinions and views in different and often ambiguous ways, hence the meaning of their words is often not explicitly stated and frequently depends on the context. Therefore, it is difficult for machines to process and understand the information conveyed in human languages. This work addresses the problem of sentiment analysis (SA). We propose a simple yet comprehensive method which uses contextual embeddings and a self-attention mechanism to detect and classify sentiment. We perform experiments on reviews from different domains, as well as on languages from three different language families, including morphologically rich Polish and German. We show that our approach is on a par with state-of-the-art models or even outperforms them in several cases. Our work also demonstrates the superiority of models leveraging contextual embeddings. In sum, in this paper we make a step towards building a universal, multilingual sentiment classifier.},

  abstract     = {Making design decisions is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, especially in the early phase of the product development process, when little information is known, while the decisions made have an impact on the entire product life cycle. Therefore, the goal of complexity management is to reduce uncertainty in order to minimize or avoid the need for design changes in a late phase of product development or in the use phase. With our approach we model the uncertainties with probabilistic reasoning in a Bayesian decision network explicitly, as the uncertainties are directly attached to parts of the design artifact′s model. By modeling the incomplete information expressed by unobserved variables in the Bayesian network in terms of probabilities, as well as the variation of product properties or parameters, a conclusion about the robustness of the product can be made. The application example of a rotary valve from engineering design shows that the decision network can support the engineer in decision-making under uncertainty. Furthermore, a contribution to knowledge formalization in the development project is made.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a neural network is trained to perform simple arithmetic using images of concatenated handwritten digit pairs. A convolutional neural network was trained with images consisting of two side-by-side handwritten digits, where the image’s label is the summation of the two digits contained in the combined image. Crucially, the network was tested on permutation pairs that were not present during training in an effort to see if the network could learn the task of addition, as opposed to simply mapping images to labels. A dataset was generated for all possible permutation pairs of length 2 for the digits 0–9 using MNIST as a basis for the images, with one thousand samples generated for each permutation pair. For testing the network, samples generated from previously unseen permutation pairs were fed into the trained network, and its predictions measured. Results were encouraging, with the network achieving an accuracy of over 90% on some permutation train/test splits. This suggests that the network learned at first digit recognition, and subsequently the further task of addition based on the two recognised digits. As far as the authors are aware, no previous work has concentrated on learning a mathematical operation in this way. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate that a network can learn more than a direct mapping from image to label, but is learning to analyse two separate regions of an image and combining what was recognised to produce the final output label.},

The usefulness of dividing the data into sequences as well as the point of using recurrent networks to recognize emotions in music, the results of which have even exceeded the SVM algorithm for regression, were demonstrated. The author analyzed the effect of the network structure and the set of used features on the results of the regressors recognizing values on two axes of the emotion model: arousal and valence.

Out of three axioms, he proposed, two (scale invariance and consistency) are concerned with data transformations that should produce the same clustering under the same clustering function. The so-called consistency axiom provides the broadest range of transformations of the data set. Kleinberg claims that one of the most popular clustering algorithms, k-means does not have the property of consistency. We challenge this claim by pointing at invalid assumptions of his proof (infinite dimensionality) and show that in one dimension in Euclidean space the k-means algorithm has the consistency property. We also prove that in higher dimensional space, k-means is, in fact, inconsistent. This result is of practical importance when choosing testbeds for implementation of clustering algorithms while it tells under which circumstances clustering after consistency transformation shall return the same clusters. Two types of remedy are proposed: gravitational consistency property and dataset consistency property which both hold for k-means and hence are suitable when developing the mentioned testbeds.},

In conversational recommendation approaches such as constraint-based and critiquing-based recommendation, user preferences are often represented on the semantic level in terms of item attribute values and critiques. In this article, we provide an overview of preference representations used in different types of recommender systems. In this context, we take into account the fact that preferences aren’t stable but are rather constructed within the scope of a recommendation process. In which way preferences are determined and adapted is influenced by various factors such as personality traits, emotional states, and cognitive biases.

  abstract     = {Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder that negatively affects many people’s lives worldwide. Developing an automated method to find useful diagnostic biomarkers from brain imaging data would help clinicians to detect MDD in its early stages. Depression is known to be a brain connectivity disorder problem. In this paper, we present a brain connectivity-based machine learning (ML) workflow that utilizes similarity/dissimilarity of spatial cubes in brain MRI images as features for depression detection. The proposed workflow provides a unified framework applicable to both structural MRI images and resting-state functional MRI images. Several cube similarity measures have been explored, including Pearson or Spearman correlations, Minimum Distance Covariance, or inverse of Minimum Distance Covariance. Discriminative features from the cube similarity matrix are chosen with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The extracted features are fed into machine learning classifiers to train MDD prediction models. To address the challenge of data imbalance in MDD detection, oversampling is performed to balance the training data. The proposed workflow is evaluated through experiments on three independent public datasets, all imbalanced, of structural MRI and resting-state fMRI images with depression labels. Experimental results show good performance on all three datasets in terms of prediction accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The use of features from both structured MRI and resting state functional MRI is also investigated.},

  abstract     = {Social Media have enabled users to keep inter-personal relationships, but also to voice personal sensations, emotions and feelings. The recent literature reports on the potential of technologies based on emotion detection and analysis. However, the understanding of user generated emotional content is a challenging task because it requires the extraction of textual units of interest and the search for potential knowledge nuggets, such as those on the correlation between emotions conveyed over time. In this paper, we study this array of problems through the discovery of structured information on the emotions, which is more difficult than the mere recognition of individual mentions. We propose a framework to discover forms of implication between emotions through high-utility sequential rules. Apart from being emotion-aware and time-aware, these rules have the ability to handle numeric information concerning the quantities of expressed emotions, contrary to the classical association rules designed only for binary data. The application on micro-blogs concerning politics shows the viability of the framework to real-world scenarios and its potential to capture user-level emotional behaviours.},

  abstract     = {Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, epidemic modeling is now experiencing a constantly growing interest from researchers of heterogeneous study fields. Indeed, due to such an increased attention, several software libraries and scientific tools have been developed to ease the access to epidemic modeling. However, only a handful of such resources were designed with the aim of providing a simple proxy for the study of the potential effects of public interventions (e.g., lockdown, testing, contact tracing). In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that, overcoming such limitations, allows to generate “what if” epidemic scenarios incorporating several public interventions (and their combinations). UTLDR is designed to be easy to use and capable to leverage information provided by stratified populations of agents (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns…). Moreover, the proposed framework is generic and not tailored for a specific epidemic phenomena: it aims to provide a qualitative support to understanding the effects of restrictions, rather than produce forecasts/explanation of specific data-driven phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The details presented in this article revolve around a sophisticated monitoring framework equipped with knowledge representation and computer vision capabilities, that aims to provide innovative solutions and support services in the healthcare sector, with a focus on clinical and non-clinical rehabilitation and care environments for people with mobility problems. In contemporary pervasive systems most modern virtual agents have specific reactions when interacting with humans and usually lack extended dialogue and cognitive competences. The presented tool aims to provide natural human-computer multi-modal interaction via exploitation of state-of-the-art technologies in computer vision, speech recognition and synthesis, knowledge representation, sensor data analysis, and by leveraging prior clinical knowledge and patient history through an intelligent, ontology-driven, dialogue manager with reasoning capabilities, which can also access a web search and retrieval engine module. The framework’s main contribution lies in its versatility to combine different technologies, while its inherent capability to monitor patient behaviour allows doctors and caregivers to spend less time collecting patient-related information and focus on healthcare. Moreover, by capitalising on voice, sensor and camera data, it may bolster patients’ confidence levels and encourage them to naturally interact with the virtual agent, drastically improving their moral during a recuperation process.},

  abstract     = {Traditional recommendation systems only consider the content of users to predict the rating of items in the recommendation process, and ignore the impact of other factors on the recommendation process except for the user-item rating matrix. Recommendation models that are based on item attributes can portray user preferences and item characteristics from item attribute information, which alleviates the sparseness of rating data to a certain extent. However, they do not consider the potential factors of users and items in the rating matrix. The advantage of deep learning methods in feature representation and feature learning is that they can extract the deep sublinear features of users and items contained in the rating matrix and item attributes. To further improve the quality of recommendation, we proposes the genre rate neural network recommendation (GRNNRec) model, which integrates item attributes based on deep learning. This model integrates the user-item rating matrix and item attributes into a deep neural network to characterize the performance of both in low-dimensional space. First, we use static coding to characterize the properties of the items. Second, we use feature mapping and feature concatenation methods to learn the higher-order features of both continuously. Finally, through the periodic learning rate and the decay rate, we achieve rating prediction. The experiments on different recommendation datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the accuracy of rating prediction in recommendation systems.},

  abstract     = {The online question answering (QA) community has been popular in recent years. In this paper, we focus on the online health question answering (HQA) community. The HQA community provides a platform for health consumers to inquire about health information. There are two ways to use this platform. One is to post a question and wait for answers to be provided by authenticated doctors. The other is to search for relevant questions with answers. For the latter, health consumers may prefer an accepted answer marked by the previous health consumer. However, there is a large proportion of questions without an accepted answer and it is inconvenient for people who want to search for relevant questions. To address this issue, we aim to select high-quality answers from the answers without marked accepted answers. We propose a deep learning approach to achieve this goal. To train the model for the prediction of answer quality, we first view the accepted answer as the positive answer and propose a method to label the negative answer. Next, we capture the semantic information on the question and the answer by the deep learning structure. We then combine the information to predict the quality score of the answer. We collect data from one of the biggest Chinese HQA community and divide them into groups by the medical departments for detailed analysis. Finally, we conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of categorization and the labeling method. The results show that our approach outperforms other studies and we further research into the differences among the results of different categories.},

  abstract     = {Food Recommender Systems (FRS) have the potential to support informed and satisfying food choices. However, to realize their full potential, FRS must engage with the complexity of the choices people make around food. For example, while taste and ingredients are important, contextual and practical factors also play a critical role in food choice. Much of the previous literature on FRS has focused on ingredient-based recommendations, often in limited food datasets. Here we describe a broader approach, focusing on the use of Ensemble Topic Modelling (EnsTM) to support personalized recipe recommendations that implicitly capture and account for multi-domain food preferences in any food-corpus. EnsTM has the additional advantage of enabling a reduced data representation format that facilitates efficient user-modelling and recommendation. This article describes the results of two studies. The first investigated EnsTM based recommendation in a cold-start scenario. We investigated three different EnsTM based variations using a large-scale, real-world corpus of 230,876 recipes, and compared them with a conventional content-based approach. In a user study with 48 participants, EnsTM-based recommenders significantly outperformed the content-based approach. Alongside excellent coverage, they enabled an implicit understanding of users’ food preference across multiple food domains. The second study investigated the use of EnsTM in a long-term or regular-use scenario. We implemented multiple variations of feature and/or topic based hybrid recipe recommenders, which updated users’ profiles in real-time and predicted their preferences for new recipes. When compared against the current state of the art EnsTM-based recommenders performed significantly better, providing higher accuracy and coverage.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there is a rapid increase in the number of sensor data generated by a wide variety of sensors and devices. Data semantics facilitate information exchange, adaptability, and interoperability among several sensors and devices. Sensor data and their meaning can be described using ontologies, e.g., the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) Ontology. Notwithstanding, semantically enriched, the size of semantic sensor data is substantially larger than raw sensor data. Moreover, some measurement values can be observed by sensors several times, and a huge number of repeated facts about sensor data can be produced. We propose a compact or factorized representation of semantic sensor data, where repeated measurement values are described only once. Furthermore, these compact representations are able to enhance the storage and processing of semantic sensor data. To scale up to large datasets, factorization based, tabular representations are exploited to store and manage factorized semantic sensor data using Big Data technologies. We empirically study the effectiveness of a semantic sensor’s proposed compact representations and their impact on query processing. Additionally, we evaluate the effects of storing the proposed representations on diverse RDF implementations. Results suggest that the proposed compact representations empower the storage and query processing of sensor data over diverse RDF implementations, and up to two orders of magnitude can reduce query execution time.},

However, little work has been done to provide explanations from the angle of a user’s contextual situations (e.g., companion, season, and destination if the recommendation is a hotel). To fill this research gap, we propose a new context-aware recommendation algorithm based on supervised attention mechanism (CAESAR), which particularly matches latent features to explicit contextual features as mined from user-generated reviews for producing context-aware explanations. Experimental results on two large datasets in hotel and restaurant service domains demonstrate that our model improves recommendation performance against the state-of-the-art methods and furthermore is able to return feature-level explanations that can adapt to the target user’s current contexts.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been an enormous increase in the number of reviews of popular products. Therefore, opinion analysis has become a tedious task for customers when making decisions. As a result, opinion retrieval systems have emerged as an effective tool to analyze and represent customers’ feelings toward offered services. Conventional opinion retrieval systems retrieve and rank products according to both relevance and the overall polarity scores of the opinions. However, customer reviews are usually more detailed, including multiple features with different polarities. Consequently, feature-based opinion retrieval is necessary to extract and analyze each feature separately. Customers’ opinions are usually written with a short and unclear structure and contain many implicit linguistic features that cannot be identified by retrieval systems. As a result, the recall results are negatively affected. Few studies have focused on implicit features, as most examined explicit features. Also, implicit features extraction is a challenging task in some languages like Arabic due to difficulties with morphology. This paper proposes an enhanced retrieval approach based on feature-based opinion mining to enhance retrieval performance. In addition to explicit feature extraction, a metaheuristic optimization method with several similarity measures is utilized to identify implicit features and measure its effect on the retrieval results. The experimental results on Arabic and English datasets revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach, whereby more features were extracted compared to the explicit feature results. Furthermore, the ranking results were improved by identifying both implicit and explicit features compared to the results obtained by the conditional random field method and association rule mining.},

Network embedding technique represents the nodes of the input graph into vector space and preserves their inherent and topological features and can contribute significantly to various applications in network analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel community detection method using network embedding technique. Firstly, nodes of the graph are embedded in feature space of d dimensions, and then low-rank approximation is applied to avoid the results from being affected by noise or outliers. Further, k-means clustering is employed to find the centroids of the clusters in the network and followed by a gravitational search algorithm to improve the results of centroids of clusters. Finally, we compute the effectiveness of detected communities using different performance measures. Our method serves as a universal framework towards applying and bench-marking various embedding techniques in graphs for performing community detection. We perform the test using various evaluation criteria on several real-life and synthetic networks and the obtained result reveals the utility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Enabling information systems to face anomalies in the presence of uncertainty is a compelling and challenging task. In this work the problem of unsupervised outlier detection in large collections of data objects modeled by means of arbitrary multidimensional probability density functions is considered. We present a novel definition of uncertain distance-based outlier under the attribute level uncertainty model, according to which an uncertain object is an object that always exists but its actual value is modeled by a multivariate pdf. According to this definition an uncertain object is declared to be an outlier on the basis of the expected number of its neighbors in the dataset. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that considers the unsupervised outlier detection problem on data objects modeled by means of arbitrarily shaped multidimensional distribution functions. We present the UDBOD algorithm which efficiently detects the outliers in an input uncertain dataset by taking advantages of three optimized phases, that are parameter estimation, candidate selection, and the candidate filtering. An experimental campaign is presented, including a sensitivity analysis, a study of the effectiveness of the technique, a comparison with related algorithms, also in presence of high dimensional data, and a discussion about the behavior of our technique in real case scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Sentimental analysis of social networking data is an economically affordable and effective way to track and evaluate public viewpoints that are critical for decision making in different areas. Predicting the users’ future opinions is crucial for companies and services; if companies understand users’ sentiments in considered time frames, they can do much better by knowing where exactly users are satisfied or unsatisfied. Utilizing an auxiliary dataset, this study uses the opinions of users on the Twitter social network expressed in the form of short text, and presents the Auxiliary Dataset-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (AD-LDA) model to improve the learning of users’ emotions around a specific topic. The proposed model considers the emotions –as predefined sentiments with a wide sentimental outlook– to estimate users’ feelings and sentiments about a particular subject or event. Coherence score evaluation results for the four studied hashtags showed an average 64.15% improvement compared to the conventional LDA model. The average Weighted-F1 criteria for studied hashtags was 79.83% for the accuracy of learning. Experimental and evaluation results show that our proposed model can effectively learn the emotions of words which leads to a better understanding of users’ feelings.},

  abstract     = {Technology can influence the reduction of operational costs, quality control, increase scale or can be a competitive advantage for industry. It influences industry structural changes and could create new industries. On the other hand, without enough investments it can limit the growth of an industrial sector. Therefore, a systemic understanding of the technological scenario is necessary. Several organizations have implemented Technology Surveillance systems (TS) to execute structured processes in order to identify and monitor technologies from formal sources of information, such as scientific articles and patents. However, with the ever smaller cycles of technological innovation and an unprecedented volume of information passing through different digital channels, like portals, specialized databases and social networks, the technological monitoring has become a challenge, especially with the current Big Data scenarios. This work presents a conceptual model and architecture for technology surveillance automated systems from web portals and social networks sources. The model is divided into four key modules (collection, preparation, analysis and diffusion) and two auxiliary ones (parameterization and persistence). To evaluate this approach a case study was carried out in which a computer system prototype was developed and implemented in an organization. The results demonstrated its feasibility and the developed system is still in use today.},

In order to tackle this problem, the first step is to obtain politician profiles which include their interests, and these can be automatically learned from their speeches. As a politician may have various areas of expertise, one alternative is to use a set of subprofiles, each of which covers a different subject. In this study, we propose a novel approach for this task by using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to determine the main underlying topics of each political speech, and to distribute the related terms among the different topic-based subprofiles. With this objective, we propose the use of fifteen distance and similarity measures to automatically determine the optimal number of topics discussed in a document, and to demonstrate that every measure converges into five strategies: Euclidean, Dice, Sorensen, Cosine and Overlap. Our experimental results showed that the scores of the different accuracy metrics of the proposed strategies tended to be higher than those of the baselines for expert recommendation tasks, and that the use of an appropriate number of topics has proved relevant.},

  abstract     = {The emergency department of a hospital plays an extremely important role in the healthcare of patients. To maintain a high quality service, clinical professionals need information on how patient flow will evolve in the immediate future. With accurate emergency department forecasts it is possible to better manage available human resources by allocating clinical staff before peak periods, thus preventing service congestion, or releasing clinical staff at less busy times. This paper describes a solution developed for the presentation of hourly, four-hour, eight-hour and daily number of admissions to a hospital’s emergency department. A 10-year history (2009-2018) of the number of emergency admissions in a Portuguese hospital was used. To create the models several methods were tested, including exponential smoothing, SARIMA, autoregressive and recurrent neural network, XGBoost and ensemble learning. The models that generated the most accurate hourly time predictions were the recurrent neural network with one-layer (sMAPE = 23.26%) and with three layers (sMAPE = 23.12%) and XGBoost (sMAPE = 23.70%). In terms of efficiency, the XGBoost method has by far outperformed all others. The success of the recurrent neuronal network and XGBoost machine learning methods applied to the prediction of the number of emergency department admissions has been demonstrated here, with an accuracy that surpasses the models found in the literature.},

This leads to a plethora of data available online, which is growing by the days. A recommendation engine leverages this massive amount of data by finding patterns of user behavior. Movie recommendation for users is one of the most prevalent implementations. Although it goes way back in the history of recommendation engines, collaborative filtering is still the most predominant method when it comes to the underlying technique implemented in recommendation engines. The main reasons behind that are its simplicity and flexibility. However, collaborative filtering has always suffered from the Cold-Start problem. When a new movie enters the rating platform, we do not have any user interaction for the movie. The foundation of collaborative filtering is based on the user-movie rating. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid filtering to combat this problem using the genre labeled for a new movie. The proposed algorithm utilizes the nonlinear similarities among various movie genres and predicts the rating of a user for the new movie with the associated genres for the movie.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models assume that data is drawn from a stationary distribution. However, in practice, challenges are imposed on models that need to make sense of fast-evolving data streams, where the content of data is changing and evolving over time. This change between the distributions of training data seen so-far and the distribution of newly coming data is called concept drift. It is of utmost importance to detect concept drifts to maintain the accuracy and reliability of online classifiers. Reactive drift detectors monitor the performance of the underlying machine learning model. That is, to detect a drift, feedback on the classifier output has to be given to the drift detector, known as prequential evaluation. In many real-life scenarios, immediate feedback on classifier output is not possible. Thus, drift detection is delayed and gets out of context. Moreover, the drift detector output is in the form of a binary answer if there is a drift or not. However, it is equally important to explain the source of drift. In this paper, we present the Statistical Drift Detection Method (SDDM) which can detect drifts by monitoring the change of data distribution without the need for feedback on classifier output. Moreover, the detection is quantified and the source of drift is identified. We empirically evaluate our method against the state-of-the-art on both synthetic and real life data sets. SDDM outperforms other related approaches by producing a smaller number of false positives and false negatives.},

Topic modeling for sequential documents is the basis of many attractive applications such as emerging topic clustering and novel topic detection. For these tasks, most of the existing models introduce inter-document dependencies between topic distributions. However, in a real situation, adjacent emerging topics are often intertwined and mixed with outliers. These single-dependency based models have difficulties in handling the topic evolution in such multi-topic and outlier mixed sequential documents. To solve this problem, our first method considers three kinds of topic dependencies for each document to handle its probabilities of belonging to a fading topic, an emerging topic, or an independent topic. Secondly, we extend our first method by considering fine-grained dependencies in a given context for more complex topic evolution sequences. Our experiments conducted on six standard datasets on topic modeling show that our proposals outperform state-of-the-art models in terms of the accuracy of topic modeling, the quality of topic clustering, and the effectiveness of outlier detection.},

Post retweeting behaviors and venue check-in events by users are the most representative. While existing studies predict items’ rise and fall, i.e., tweet popularity and venue closure detection, using hand-crafted features, this paper aims at exploring feature representation learning to improve prediction performance. We target at two essential time-series classification tasks on social media, including Shutdown Risk Prediction (SRP) of venues and Tweet Popularity Prediction (TPP) of posts. We study how feature representation learning of items can benefit both SRP and TPP tasks. The main idea is to learn item embedding vectors as features in item-item graphs constructed from time series of check-in events and retweeting behaviors. The learned features are used together with manually-defined features to enlarge the representation capability. In the TPP task, we also propose a pattern-aware self-exciting point process (PSEISMIC) model to generate time-series features. Experiments conducted on Instagram, Foursquare, and Twitter datasets exhibit promising performance of jointly utilizing learned and extracted features in both tasks. PSEISMIC can also further boost TPP accuracy. The major contribution of this work is three-fold. First, we propose to jointly deal with SRP and TPP under the same framework of feature extraction and learning. Second, we show that feature presentation learning of items can benefit these two prediction tasks with time series data. Third, by incorporating time series patterns, the proposed PSEISMIC further improves the performance of popularity prediction.},

Hence, modeling information diffusion has become an important area of research in the field of network analysis. It involves the mathematical modeling of the movement of information and study the information spread pattern. In this paper, we attempt to model information propagation in online social networks using a nature-inspired approach based on a modified forest-fire model. A slight spark can start a wildfire in a forest, and the spread of this fire depends on vegetation, weather, and topography, which may act as fuel. On similar lines, we labeled users who haven’t joined the network yet as Empty, existing users as Tree, and information as Fire. The spread of information across online social networks depends upon users-followers relationships, the significance of the topic, and other such features. We introduce a novel Burnt state to the traditional forest-fire model to represent non-spreaders in the network. We validate our method on six real-world data-sets extracted from Twitter and conclude that the proposed model performs reasonably well in predicting information diffusion.},

  abstract     = {To interpret a natural language text using a machine, we need to convert its semantics into structured information. In the field of Natural Language Processing, multiple tasks have been designed and developed to interpret the semantics of an unstructured text, and change words into meanings. However, there are some challenges in directly using the output of these tasks in subsequent applications such as logical inference. There has been a growing interest in building and enhancing state-of-the-art semantic representation systems in recent years. However, most of these systems involve supervised models that benefit from manually annotated data, which is not accessible for a wide range of languages. This paper presents a new framework for modeling text in order to extract its information, and through an inference system, obtain new information that is not explicitly stated in the text, but could be logically inferred. This framework is based on Open Information Extraction and Semantic Web techniques for machine reading. We translate the text into a machine-readable representation by using Semantic Types Identification and Question-based Semantic Role Labeling, which could be used in low-resource languages. We integrate the extracted information into the background knowledge by using existing Semantic Web standards. The proposed framework could increase generalization of labelling and reduce ambiguities, therefore, it is an appropriate solution for preparing text for reasoning systems.},

  abstract     = {Employee churn (ECn) is a crucial problem for any organization that adversely affects its overall revenue and brand image. Many machine learning (ML) based systems have been developed to solve the ECn problem. However, they miss out on some essential issues such as employee categorization, category-wise churn prediction, and retention policy for effectively addressing the ECn problem. By considering all these issues, we propose, in this paper, a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) based scheme coupled with ML algorithms. The proposed scheme is referred as employee churn prediction and retention (ECPR). We first design an accomplishment-based employee importance model (AEIM) that utilizes a two-stage MADM approach for grouping the employees in various categories. Preliminarily, we formulate an improved version of the entropy weight method (IEWM) for assigning relative weights to the employee accomplishments. Then, we utilize the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for quantifying the importance of the employees to perform their class-based categorization. The CatBoost algorithm is then applied for predicting class-wise employee churn. Finally, we propose a retention policy based on the prediction results and ranking of the features. The proposed ECPR scheme is tested on a benchmark dataset of the human resource information system (HRIS), and the results are compared with other ML algorithms using various performance metrics. We show that the system using the CatBoost algorithm outperforms other ML algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Enterprise IT performance can be improved by providing reactive and predictive monitoring tools that anticipate problem detection. It requires advanced approaches for creating more agile, adaptable, sustainable and intelligent information systems. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been used in significant performance-based approaches by information system practitioners. Organizations are interested in performance-based decision support along the layers of SOA to maintain their sustainability for service reuse. Reusability is a very important aspect of Service-based systems (SBS) to analyze service or process reuse. This helps in achieving business agility to meet changing marketplace needs. However currently, there are many challenges pertaining tothe complexities of service reuse evolution along SBS. These challenges are related to the sustainability of service behavior during its lifecycle and the limitations of existing monitoring tools. There is a need for a consolidated classified knowledge-based performance profile, analytical assessment, prediction and recommendation. Therefore, this paper provides a semantic performance-oriented decision support system (SPODSS) for SOA. SPODSS provides recommendations for suggesting service reuse during its evolution. SPODSS is supported by five building blocks. These blocks are data, semantic, traces, machine learning, and decision. SPODSS classify data, validate (analytical assessment, traces, semantic enrichment) at different time intervals and increased consumption and prediction based on consolidated results. It handles the dynamic evolution of SBS and new or changed user requirements by ontology development. Finally, SPODSS generates recommendations for atomic service, composite service, and resourceallocation provisioning. To motivate this approach, we illustrate the implementation of the proposed algorithms for all the five blocks by a business process use case and public data set repositories of shared services. Sustainability and adaptability of service-based systems areensured by handling new business requirements, dynamicity issues and ensuring performance. Performance criterion includes functional suitability, time behavior, resource utilization, and reliability in terms of availability, maturity, and risk.},

We used the text notes from a CRM system taken by customer representatives of an internet ads consultancy agency between 2009 and 2020. We trained word embeddings by using the corresponding text corpus and showed that these word embeddings could be used directly for data mining and used in RNN architectures, which are deep learning frameworks built with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, for more comprehensive segmentation objectives. The obtained results prove that we can use structured text data populated in a CRM to mine valuable information.

Capturing the temporal dynamics of user preferences is essential to design an efficient personalized recommender system and has recently attracted significant attention. In this paper, we consider user preferences change individually over time. Moreover, based on the intuition that social influence can affect the users’ preferences in a recommender system, we propose a Temporal and Social Collective Matrix Factorization model called TSCMF for recommendation. We jointly factorize the users’ rating information and social trust information in a collective matrix factorization framework by introducing a joint objective function. We model user dynamics into this framework by learning a transition matrix of user preferences between two successive time periods for each individual user. We present an efficient optimization algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent for solving the objective function. The experiments on a real-world dataset illustrate that the proposed model outperforms the competitive methods. Moreover, the complexity analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can be scaled up to large datasets.},

  abstract     = {Sentence modeling is a critical issue for the feature generation of some natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, most works generated the sentence representation by sentence modeling based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) and some attention mechanisms. However, these models have two limitations: (1) they only present sentences for one individual task by fine-tuning network parameters, and (2) sentence modeling only considers the concatenation of words and ignores the function of phrases. In this paper, we propose a Cascading Gated Self-attention and Phrase-attention Network (CGSPN) that generates the sentence embedding by considering contextual words and key phrases in a sentence. Specifically, we first present a word-interaction gating self-attention mechanism to identify some important words and build the relationship between words. Then, we cascade a phrase-attention structure by abstracting the semantic of phrases to generate the sentence representation. Experiments on different NLP tasks show that the proposed CGSPN model achieves the highest accuracy among most sentence encoding methods. It improves the latest best result by 1.76% on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), and shows the best test accuracy on different sentence classification data sets. In the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task, the performance of CGSPN without phrase-attention is better than CGSPN model itself and it obtains competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, which show the different applicability of the proposed model. In other NLP tasks, we also compare our model with popular methods to explore our direction.},

However, most of the methods proposed so far used Euclidean distance to deal with this problem. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is more suitable than Euclidean distance because of its capability in shape-based similarity checking in many practical fields, for example those with multimedia data. In this paper, we propose two efficient anomaly detection methods, EP-Leader-DTW and SEP-Leader-DTW, for static and streaming time series under DTW, respectively. Our methods are based on time series segmentation, subsequence clustering, and anomaly scoring. For segmentation, the major extrema method is used to obtain subsequences. For clustering, we apply Leader algorithm to cluster the subsequences along with a lower bounding technique to accelerate DTW distance computation. Experimental results on several benchmark time series datasets reveal that our method for anomaly detection in static time series under DTW can perform very fast and accurately on large time series datasets. For streaming time series, our method can meet the instantaneous requirement with high accuracy. As a result, our anomaly detection methods are applicable to both static and streaming time series in practice.},

At present, most of the existing trajectory clustering methods focus on some spatial properties of trajectories (such as geographic locations, movement directions), while the spatial-temporal properties (especially the combination of spatial distances and semantic distances) are ignored, and thus some vital information regarding the movement behaviors of nodes is probably lost in the trajectory clustering results. In this paper, we propose a Joint Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Clustering Method (JSTTCM), where some spatial-temporal properties of the trajectories are exploited to cluster the trajectory segments.

  abstract     = {In big data scenarios, matrix factorization (MF) is widely used in recommendation systems as it can offer high accuracy and scalability. However, when using MF to process large-scale implicit feedback data, the following two problems arise. One is that it is difficult to effectively obtain negative feedback information, which causes relatively poor recommendation accuracy. The other is that the limited resources of a single machine make the model training inefficient, and in particular, the acquisition of negative feedback information further increases the time complexity of model training. In order to solve the above two problems, we first propose a user-activity and item-popularity weighted matrix factorization (UIWMF) recommendation algorithm, which assigns every missing data different weight based on user activity and item popularity, gets negative feedback information more realistically, and leads to better recommendation accuracy. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the additional computational overhead caused by the weight strategy, we develop a fast optimization strategy to enhance the efficiency. In order to break the resource constraints of a single machine, we propose a distributed UIWMF (DUIWMF) algorithm based on Spark, which adopts an efficient parallel learning algorithm to train the model and utilizes cached in-block and out-block information to effectively reduce the communication overhead in a distributed environment. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that, comparing with the baseline MF methods, DUIWMF model has comparable performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and model training efficiency.},

With the rapid development of social media, people tend to express their thoughts or emotions on the social platform. Different social platforms have various formats of data presentation, which makes huge and diverse data available for analysis by researchers. In our study, we aim to detect users with depressive tendency on Instagram. We create a depression dictionary for automatically collecting data of depressive and non-depressive users. In terms of the prediction model, we construct a multimodal system, which utilizes image, text and behavior features to predict the aggregated depression score of each post on Instagram. Considering the time interval between posts, we propose a two-stage detection mechanism for detecting depressive users. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve up to 0.835 F1-score for detecting depressive users. It can therefore serve as an early depression detector for a timely treatment before it becomes severe.},

  abstract     = {The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is a popular research topic in the field of text mining. In this paper, Sentiment Word Co-occurrence and Knowledge Pair Feature Extraction based LDA Short Text Clustering Algorithm (SKP-LDA) is proposed. A definition of a word bag based on sentiment word co-occurrence is proposed. The co-occurrence of emotional words takes full account of different short texts. Then, the short texts of a microblog are endowed with emotional polarity. Furthermore, the knowledge pairs of topic special words and topic relation words are extracted and inserted into the LDA model for clustering. Thus, semantic information can be found more accurately. Then, the hidden n topics and Top30 special words set of each topic are extracted from the knowledge pair set. Finally, via LDA topic model primary clustering, a Top30 topic special words set is obtained that is clustered by K-means secondary clustering. The clustering center is optimized iteratively. Comparing with JST, LSM, LTM and ELDA, SKP-LDA performs better in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure. The experimental results show that SKP-LDA reveals better semantic analysis ability and emotional topic clustering effect. It can be applied to the field of micro-blog to improve the accuracy of network public opinion analysis effectively.},
