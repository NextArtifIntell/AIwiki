  abstract     = {The closed fracture reduction is the first step of the minimally invasive treatment for long bone fractures, while it remains a challenging task due to heavy physical burden, excessive radiation exposure and poor accuracy. The robot-assisted fracture reduction (RAFR) shows potential to address these problems, while most existing methods rely on 3D images, optical tracking equipment and invasive robot-bone fixations. Such methods usually have a tedious surgery workflow, complicated hardware requirements, and iatrogenic injury risks, which prevent them from clinical applications. In this paper, we proposed a novel marker-free RAFR method using the image-based visual servoing technique. Firstly, an image feature vector based on 2D intraoperative images are defined for path planning and feedback control, and an online estimated Jacobian matrix is used to map the image variation to robot motion. Secondly, a geometry-based method is developed for Jacobian initialization without exploratory movements. Thirdly, a novel state-dependent weighted least square (SD-WLS) algorithm for online Jacobian estimation is proposed according to the characteristic of fracture reduction tasks. In the proposed RAFR framework, requirements for 3D images, optical markers and rigid robot-bone fixations are avoided. Experiments on fracture models with highly flexible robot-bone fixations are performed. All the tested fracture cases were well reduced within acceptable steps, which shows the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Most motion simulators manufactured today benefit from the use of electric actuators. The common solution to a heavier payload is a larger actuator. However, this results in higher power consumption and expenses. Furthermore, the electric actuators continue to use power in stationary positions as well as low platform speeds. To overcome these drawbacks, a combination of passive pneumatic actuators may be supplemented with the electric actuators to allow the motion simulators to sustain equipment weight. However, it is challenging to design a weight compensation system so that it could be efficient throughout the entire workspace. In this paper, kinematics and dynamics of the six axis FUM Stewart robot with three passive redundant pneumatic actuators are investigated. Six independent trajectories using maximum allowed velocity and accelerations are defined and the trajectory containing maximum actuator force is selected. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the power consumption for the worst-case trajectory. A cost function is defined to minimize the absolute value of average as well as maximum actuator forces by identifying a structural kinematics arrangement of the passive pneumatic actuators. Results indicate that the weight compensation implemented on the FUM Stewart successfully decreased actuator forces in static positions as well as dynamics trajectories by at least 29% and 37.1%, respectively. Furthermore, maximum actuators’ forces during both outstroke and instroke are mostly balanced which helps improve the life expectancy of the mechanical system. The procedures outlined in this paper are general and may be applied to any existing Stewart robot.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a walking pattern generator and a stabilization method for the dynamic walking of a bipedal robot. The capture point (CP) and center of mass (CoM) trajectories were optimized in real-time by using particle swarm optimization, and a desired zero-moment point (ZMP) can be freely generated within a certain area of the support foot by using the proposed method. Unlike a previous method, which optimized only the reference CP trajectory to generate the optimal desired ZMP, the proposed method optimizes the reference CP and the CoM trajectories simultaneously. Consequently, the control input size for tracking the reference CP trajectory is reduced, resulting in reduced CP error. The ZMP error could be reduced as the CoM acceleration was optimally determined to achieve the desired ZMP. In this process, it is possible to ensure that the measured ZMPs can be obtained in the area where a desired ZMP is to be generated, and the robot can walk stably even with reduced feet. The performance of the proposed walking pattern generator and stabilization method based on optimization was verified using a robot simulator, Webots. It was confirmed that in the case of the proposed method, the measured ZMPs are guaranteed to be within the desired area and the control performance of the CP and ZMP is improved.},

However, the complexity of modeling and analyzing UAV cooperation in situations with stochastic elements leads to unique challenges. This paper introduces a framework for one such problem domain, the multi-UAV persistent search and retrieval task with stochastic target appearances (PSR-STA), in which UAVs continuously search an area for stochastically appearing targets to retrieve and deliver them to collector locations. Design decisions are introduced for understanding how to successfully simulate multi-UAV PSR-STA. Common tools for analyzing search algorithm effectiveness through statistical and graphical methods are presented. A case study of multi-UAV park cleanup is implemented to demonstrate the framework, where algorithms for choosing the locations of collectors and charging stations based on stochastic target appearance models are proposed, methods for continuous multi-UAV operation over a long period time are demonstrated, and the differences in effectiveness between four coverage search patterns are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {A deep reinforcement learning approach for solving the quadrotor path following and obstacle avoidance problem is proposed in this paper. The problem is solved with two agents: one for the path following task and another one for the obstacle avoidance task. A novel structure is proposed, where the action computed by the obstacle avoidance agent becomes the state of the path following agent. Compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning approaches, the proposed method allows to interpret the training process outcomes, is faster and can be safely trained on the real quadrotor. Both agents implement the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. The path following agent was developed in a previous work. The obstacle avoidance agent uses the information provided by a low-cost LIDAR to detect obstacles around the vehicle. Since LIDAR has a narrow field-of-view, an approach for providing the agent with a memory of the previously seen obstacles is developed. A detailed description of the process of defining the state vector, the reward function and the action of this agent is given. The agents are programmed in python/tensorflow and are trained and tested in the RotorS/gazebo platform. Simulations results prove the validity of the proposed approach.},

Similar to other RRT-based algorithms, MP-RRT# explores the map constructing an asymptotically optimal graph. In each iteration the graph is extended with a new vertex in the reference state of the UAS. Then, a forward simulation is performed using a Model Predictive Control strategy to evaluate the motion between two adjacent vertices, and a trajectory in the state space is computed. As a result, the MP-RRT# algorithm eventually generates a feasible trajectory for the UAS satisfying dynamic constraints. Simulation results obtained with a simulated drone controlled with the PX4 autopilot corroborate the validity of the MP-RRT# approach.},

This study proposes a novel model for proactive and reactive planning (different scenarios) that allow for a higher degree of realism, thus a higher likelihood for a mission of being executed according to the plan even when weather forecasts are changing. The novelty of this study results from the addition of a function of resistance of UAVs mission to changes in weather conditions. We link the influence of weather conditions on the UAV’s energy consumption. The goal is to ensure the completion of planned deliveries by a fleet of UAVs under changing weather conditions before their batteries discharge and to identify the emergency route for returned if the mission cannot be completed. An approach based on constraint programming is proposed, as it has proven to be effective in various contexts, especially related to the nonlinearity of the system’s characteristics. The proposed approach has been tested on several instances, which have allowed for analyzing how the plan of mission is robust to the changing weather conditions with different parameters, such as the fleet size, battery capacity, and distribution network layout.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel legged locomotion principle for tracking the quadruped-robot base spatial motion which can generate automatically the trotting and walking gaits without flight phases. The principle is based on a new legged locomotion generator using the robot centroidal properties without a massless-leg assumption. Our quadruped robot is newly designed with symmetric legged dynamics properties using parallelogram mechanisms, and the corresponding generalized dynamics model is built. The centroidal momentum and dynamics models are established by combining the centroidal properties of the base and each leg, in which the virtual joint between the base and each leg CoM is used instead of the real joints. The stance legs follow the base motion with respect to contact constraints. The swing legs compensate for the delay influences (to centroidal motion) by the stance legs. By combining the whole-body kinematics model and the kinematics constraints relating to the contact constraints and the parallelogram mechanism, the adaptive swing-leg motion is achieved in the running process without pre-defined trajectories. When two swing legs land at different timings, the walking gait is applied. We also propose a new state machine for switching the locomotion gaits between walking and trotting, which also serves the torque controller which determines the dimension of the legged control states and the contact Jacobian. We apply our hierarchical torque controller to enable the robot with compliant dynamics properties. Therefore, our new locomotion principle integrates the system design, motion generation and whole-body torque control together, so that this one common framework is able to handle several locomotion gaits. To verify the usefulness and validity of our new locomotion principle based legged motion generator, we run several simulations: walking, trotting, turning, recovering from big lateral push force acting on the base.},

Therefore, it is necessary to detect that the robot is falling to be able to warn the robot in sufficient time when it is about to fall and to switch its controller to protect the vulnerable parts of the robot. Modeling and analysis of the biped robot falling problem cannot be fully accurate and many current learning-based methods rely on large quantities of fall data that are difficult to use to train fragile robots. A machine learning-based fall detection method is therefore proposed in this paper. This method requires only a small amount of training data to obtain good fall detection, making the training process on the robot platform much safer. A support vector machine is used to determine the state of the robot and the decision boundary of the stable state is updated during motion to enable the classifier to match the motion capability of the robot.},

  abstract     = {Robotic grasping is still challenging due to limitations in perception and control, especially when the CAD models of objects are unknown. Although some grasp planning approaches using computer vision have been proposed, these methods can be seen as open-loop grasp planning methods and are often not robust enough. In this paper, a novel grasp planning method combining CNN-based quality prediction and closed-loop control (CNNB-CL) is proposed for a vacuum gripper. A large-scale dataset is generated for CNN training, which contains more than 2.3 million synthetic grasps and their grasp qualities evaluated by grasp simulations with 3D models. Unlike other neural networks which predict grasp success by assigning a binary value or grasp quality level by assigning an integer value, the proposed CNN predicts the grasp quality via a linear regression architecture. Additionally, the method adjusts the grasp strategies and detects the optimal grasp based on feedback from a force-torque sensor. Various simulations and physical experiments prove that the CNNB-CL method is robust for random noise disturbance in observation and compatible with different depth cameras and vacuum grippers. The proposed method finds the optimal grasp from 2,000 candidates within 300 ms and achieves a 92.18% average success rate for different vacuum grippers, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding success rate and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous navigation is a key defining feature that allows agricultural robots to perform automated farming tasks. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology is providing autonomous navigation solutions for current commercial robotic platforms that can achieve centimeter-level accuracy when real-time kinematic (RTK) corrections are available. However, GNSS-based solutions are expensive and require a long preparation phase where the field has to be surveyed with a GNSS rover to collect waypoints for the navigation path. An alternative navigation approach can be provided by Local perception sensors, such as LiDAR scanners, by tracking geometric features in the perceived scene. This paper presents a robust LiDAR-based solution for structure tracking along vine rows. The proposed method does not require prior field surveying, and it is insensitive to crop characteristics such as row width and spacing. Moreover, the proposed algorithm identifies and builds an online regression model of the structure. This is done by applying the Hough transform with a parameterization and search method motivated by a practical interpretation of point cloud statistics. The proposed method was tested on a commercial robotic platform in two configurations of vineyards. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves consistent and accurate row tracking, which was validated against a reliable RTK-GNSS ground truth.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on localization and mapping issues for autonomous mobile robots equipped with low-cost 2D lidar in complex environments. Most existing solutions commonly parameterize the robot pose on SE(3) when the robot moves on the rough ground and uses the scan data that may be insufficient or sparse to build the map. In this paper, we first developed the Gaussian Process (GP) to address insufficient scan data for low-precision 2D lidar by enriching the lidar measurements at interest or specific bearing regions. Meanwhile, A new method, based on the graph optimization framework, to solve the non-SE(2) perturbations is proposed, namely SE2-3D constraint, which directly parameterizes the robot pose as SE(2) without ignoring the non-SE(2) perturbations by associating the extended SE(2) pose with map point via lidar measurements. The experimental results indicate that the raw lidar data processed by our method can generate higher quality maps than the original data under the same working conditions. The simulation results verify that the proposed method has higher performance in terms of accuracy than traditional methods. This paper provides a meaningful solution for the broad application of ground mobile robots equipped with low-cost 2D lidar.},

  abstract     = {Automatic recovery is an important step in enabling fully autonomous missions using fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating from ships or other moving platforms. However, automatic recovery in moving arrest systems is only briefly studied in the research literature, and is not yet an option when using low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) autopilots. Acknowledging the reliability and low cost of COTS avionics, this paper adds recovery functionality as a modular extension based on non-intrusive additions to an autopilot with very general assumptions on its interface. This is achieved by line-of-sight guidance, which sends an augmented desired position to the autopilot, to ensure line-following along a virtual runway that guides the UAV into the arrest system. The translation and rotation of this line is determined by the pose of the arrest system, determined using two Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, where one is configured as a Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) base station. The relative position of the UAV and arrest system is also precisely estimated using RTK GNSS. Through extensive field testing, on two different fixed-wing UAVs, the system has shown its performance and reliability; 43 recovery attempts in a stationary net hit 0.01 ± 0.25m to the right and 0.07 ± 0.20m below the target in calm conditions. Further, 15 recoveries in a barge-mounted, ship-towed net hit 0.06 ± 0.53m to the right and 0.98 ± 0.27m below the target in winds up to 4 m/s. The remaining error is largely systematic, caused by communication delays, and could be reduced with more integral effect or through direct compensation.},

  abstract     = {Very small size or micro, aerial vehicles are being recently studied due to the large influence of environmental disturbances. The multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) usually requires control approaches that can guarantee a safe operation. However, limitations with respect to the embedded system (i.e. energy, processing power, memory, etc.) are usually present. In this work, we propose the use of Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which can safely respect input constraints. In contrast, the application of NMPC in embedded systems of Micro-MAV is typically challenging. To solve this issue, we propose a modification on the NMPC called Embedded Fast NMPC that can ensure the implementation of the position controller safely and stably. Micro Multirotor Aerial Vehicles (Micro-MAVs) use low processing power boards. These boards usually rely solely on on-board sensors to perform localization and target detection, which in turn makes this platform suitable for experiments in GNSS-denied environments. We validate our approach with real robot experiments using a Micro-MAV.},

Through surveys, interviews, technology and infrastructure design, and experimentation, we developed a tradespace model of those variables that managers and designers of high-risk settings like public spaces and prisons need to consider in their development or renovation. These include cost considerations, both capital and infrastructure, as well as technology design elements of range and false alarm rates potentially exacerbated by convolutional neural networks (aka, deep learning). Results also highlight that environmental design elements can provide a possible low-tech solution in the design of obstructions that either eliminate or complicate a drone pilot’s line of sight.

First, a hybrid kinematic modeling approach based on Denavit-Hartenberg method and Cosserat rod theory is developed. An efficient control system is also introduced within which the issues related to numerical Jacobian of Cosserat-based approach are addressed. A switching image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control strategy is proposed. The switching controller enables switching between the standard and proposed scaled-and non-dimensional (SND) IBVS sub-control systems. The stability of the proposed system in the sense of Lyapunov is also proved. Extensive simulations verified that SND IBVS is well capable of reducing large error signals at the beginning of the motion. In addition, the performance of the proposed switching approach, standard IBVS, and SND IBVS are compared to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed switching controller. Robustness analysis is also included here to show that even in the presence of imaging and actuation noise, the controlled system smoothly accomplishes the positioning task with an acceptable convergence speed.},

This paper examines regulations which govern procedures for reporting incidents other than accidents or serious incidents related to unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations. The regulations are discussed in the context of available data and the paper included an analysis of them from both a European and national perspective. The goal of the paper is to provide a series of recommendations with regard to the procedures for reporting and analyzing UAS incidents in order to improve the safe integration of unmanned and manned aviation. This article also explores the legal consequences that arise from the midair collision between a UAS and a manned aircraft. Material and methods: The method of study comprises a content analysis of existing legislations. The current doctrine was confronted with existing regulations, documents and materials. Results: The results of the study show that there is a practical problem of objectively identifying operators of a UAS as well as in defining what exactly constitutes an “incident”. It can be reasonably concluded that reporting and analyzing UAS-related incidents allows for the assessment and development of strategies for integrating manned and unmanned aviation. It is worth mentioning that drones and UAS technology requires refinement, especially in technological terms. It is reasonable to take action aimed at raising awareness amongst UAS users of the need to report incidents, as well as engaging UAS users in the investigative process which follows such occurrences.},

The human operator is in charge of steering the payload and he/she can also change online the desired shape of the formation of robots. At the same time, an obstacle avoidance algorithm is in charge of avoiding collisions with the static environment. The signals from the user and from the obstacle avoidance are blended together in the trajectory generation module, by means of a tracking controller and a filter called dynamic input boundary (DIB). The DIB filters out the directions of motions that would bring the system too close to singularities, according to a suitable metric. The loop with the user is finally closed with a force feedback that is informative of the mismatch between the operator’s commands and the trajectory of the payload. This feedback intuitively increases the user’s awareness of obstacles or configurations of the system that are close to singularities. The proposed framework is validated by means of realistic hardware-in-the-loop simulations with a person operating the system via a force-feedback haptic interface.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to develop robust guidance laws for the control motion of an underwater autonomous vehicle (UAV) in a three-dimensional (3D) space. The control design is based on the use of Averaged Sub-Gradient (ASG) version of a class of dynamic integral sliding mode (ISM) method being sequentially applied to the subsystems of the complete model realizing, the so-called backstepping (or cascade) approach. The mathematical form of the UAV model induces a backstepping formulation for solving the tracking trajectory problem sequentially for the position, translation velocity, angular velocity and actuators (thrusters) dynamics. The solution of the trajectory tracking problem at each stage implements the ASG-version of the ISM method. This problem is treated as the optimization of a suitable convex (not obligatory strongly convex) cost functional, depending on the tracking error and reaching its minimal value at the origin of the error tracking space. This study shows that the minimization of the proposed functional leads to the optimal tracking regime under the presence of uncertainties in the mathematical model description. A numerical example proves the effectiveness of the suggested robust dynamic controller. The comparison between the obtained trajectory tracking results and the outcomes produced by a set of standard proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers, is presented. The proposed controller exhibits a better tracking of the reference trajectory compared with the PID version, showing a smaller mean square estimation for the tracking error.},

The purpose of this study is to make the UAV more reactive in the environment and ensure the safety and optimality of the computed trajectory. In this implementation, we begin by selecting a dynamic model of a fixed-arms quadrotor UAV. Then, we define our multi-objective optimization problem, which we convert afterward into a scalar optimization problem (SOP). The SOP is subdivided after that into smaller sub-problems, which will be treated in parallel and in a reasonable time. The DC principle employed in our method allows us to treat non-linearity at the local level. The coordination between the two levels is achieved after that through the Lagrange multipliers. Making use of the DC method, we can compute the optimal trajectory from the UAV’s current position to a final target practically in real-time. In this approach, we suppose that the environment is totally supervised by a Ground Control Unit (GCU). To ensure the safety of the trajectory, we consider a wireless communication network over which the UAV may communicate with the GCU and get the necessary information about environmental changes, allowing for successful collision avoidance during the flight until the intended goal is safely attained. The analysis of the DC algorithm’s stability and convergence, as well as the simulation results, are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our method and validate its potential.},

  abstract     = {This work deals with a unicycle-like mobile platform pushing one and two trailers connected to it, mimicking an application in precision agriculture. The idea is to have a tractor vehicle pushing or pulling passive trailers with materials to be moved accordingly. The first part corresponds to the development of a suitable model for the whole underactuated system, the articulated chain, considering that a point of interest in the last trailer should follow a specified path. Thus, as the trailers are passive subsystems, the way a trailer is connected to the mobile robot or another trailer allows transferring velocities, even when the two bodies have different heading angles. Therefore, the first contribution of the paper is to model these relations, considering a robot pushing one or two trailers. After getting a suitable model for the whole system, two controllers were developed, one based only on inverse kinematics, and the other adding a compensation of the robot dynamics to the kinematic controller, in this case building a cascade or inner-outer loop control structure. The objective behind the design of these two controllers is to compare their performance when guiding the multi-articulated vehicle to accomplish a path-following task, aiming at selecting the best of these two controllers. Finally, experiments run are discussed, whose results validate the proposed model and control system, besides allowing concluding that the best option is to adopt the kinematic controller plus the dynamic compensation, mainly for higher velocities, which is the main contribution of the paper.},

  abstract     = {While vision-based localization techniques have been widely studied for small autonomous unmanned vehicles (SAUVs), sound-source localization capabilities have not been fully enabled for SAUVs. This paper presents two novel approaches for SAUVs to perform three-dimensional (3D) multi-sound-sources localization (MSSL) using only the inter-channel time difference (ICTD) signal generated by a self-rotating bi-microphone array. The proposed two approaches are based on two machine learning techniques viz., Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithms, respectively, whose performances were tested and compared in both simulations and experiments. The results show that both approaches are capable of correctly identifying the number of sound sources along with their 3D orientations in a reverberant environment.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the fifth-generation wireless network, autonomous moving platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in modern smart cities. In some applications, the UAVs need to perform certain monitoring tasks within a specified time. However, due to the energy constraints of UAVs, such tasks require using multiple UAVs to monitor multiple points. To solve this practical problem, this paper proposes a multi-UAV path planning model with the energy constraint (MUPPEC). The MUPPEC considers the energy consumption of a UAV in different states, such as acceleration, cruising speed, deceleration, and hovering, and the main objective of the MUPPEC is to minimize the total monitoring time. Also, a hybrid discrete intelligence algorithm based on the grey wolf optimizer (HDGWO) is proposed to solve the MUPPEC. In the HDGWO, the discrete grey wolf update operators are implemented, and the integer coding and greedy algorithms are used to transform between the grey wolf space and discrete problem space. Furthermore, the central position operation and stagnation compensation grey wolf update operation are introduced to improve the global convergence ability, and a two-opt with azimuth is designed to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the HDGWO can solve the MUPPEC effectively, and compared to the traditional grey wolf optimizer(GWO), the discrete operators and the two-opt local search strategy with azimuth can effectively improve the optimization ability of the GWO.},

The model autonomously aligns them to a common velocity and maintains a relative distance among the agents in a distributed manner by sharing the information among neighbors. This paper introduces the concept of inactiveness to the augmented C-S model for improving the flocking performance. It involves controlling the energy and convergence time required to form a stable flock. Inspired by the natural world where a few lazy (or inactive) workers are helpful to the group performance in social insect colonies. In this study, we analyzed different levels of inactiveness as a degree of control input effectiveness for multiple fixed-wing UAVs in the flocking algorithm. To find the appropriate inactiveness level for each flock member, the particle swarm optimization-based approach is used as the first step, based on the initial condition of the flock. However, as the significant computational burden may cause difficulties in implementing the optimization-based approach in real time, we also propose a heuristic adaptive inactiveness approach, which changes the inactivity level of selected agents adaptively according to their position and heading relative to the flock center. The performance of the proposed approaches using the concept of lazy (or inactive) agents is verified with numerical simulations by comparing them with the conventional flocking algorithm in various scenarios.},

In order to solve the individual trajectory tracking task of each mobile robot while maintaining a desired formation, besides the controller at cluster level, another inner robot controller is implemented. With this, the robustness of formation keeping to perturbations is increased and motions of all mobile robots are synchronized. Based on Lyapunov theory, it is demonstrated that the proposed synchronization strategy guarantees that both the tracking errors and the synchronization errors of all mobile robots asymptotically converge to the origin. Achieving this, the cluster errors asymptotically converge to zero as well. Furthermore, the robots orientation errors exponentially converge to the origin. The control laws are experimentally validated, using a set of TurtleBot3 mobile robots; these results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

Interactions were also examined to determine the factors that led to the success or failure of the dialogue based on the trajectory of the mobile SARs and observations of the participants’ behaviour with the mobile SARs. The results showed that nine of 15 participants (60 %) engaged in dialogue with mobile SARs, which was twice as effective as stationary SARs. Conversely, some participants could not engage in dialogue when using a mobile SAR. In addition, these participants’ The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were low. These participants’ successful dialogues were influenced by the angle at which the mobile SAR approached the participant and the length of time the mobile SAR and the participant were face to face. In this study, it was shown that the introduction of mobile SARs in a nursing home could facilitate communication between SARs and residents and further contribute to the quality of life of residents.},

A sample of drone-related literature is analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis is a method that systematizes and characterizes the main themes and main factors included in texts. As a result, the article proposes a systemization of drone-related research and an overview of the main factors considered within the identified categories. Beyond the literature systemization, the article evaluates which of the themes and factors have and which have not been researched in regard to public perception. Based on this analysis, the article concludes that, even though they have been researched in other contexts, two essential aspects are missing in the research of public opinion regarding drone use: 1) a systemic reflection and theorization of privacy, 2) measurements of the perception of the actual technological capabilities of drones. Therefore, these topics should be addressed in future surveys and interviews. Moreover, the analysis shows the prevalence of American public samples in existing surveys and points out a possible bias in conclusions made based on these works.

  abstract     = {Object detection based on visual images provides significant technical support to realize autonomous environment perception of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), yet difficulties exist for object detection on the sea surface, such as the constantly-changing weather conditions, considerable changes in the scale of objects, and severe object shaking. In this paper, an USV object detection algorithm is proposed based on an optimized feature fusion network. YOLOv4 was selected as the baseline, which is currently one of the object detection models with the best trade-offs between speed and accuracy. In the proposed weighted Cross Stage Partial Path Aggregation Network (wCSPPAN) structure, the concept of the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) was applied to the feature fusion network, so as to significantly reduce the amount of computation. In addition, weights that can be learned were introduced to learn input features of different resolutions in a more reasonable way. Finally, to obtain cross-space and cross-scale feature interactions, attempts were made to integrate the universal visual component of the Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT) with the transformer mechanism in the YOLOv4 model. The FPT was used to transform the feature pyramid into another feature pyramid of the same size with richer contextual information for each level of feature map. We compare the performance with other advanced object detection algorithms. The experiments conducted on the dataset of sea surface buoys, which was collected and produced independently for the present study, and the open source Singapore Maritime Dataset verify that the proposed method achieved good results in the detection of sea objects of different scales under various weather conditions. In particular, the detection of long-distance small objects under foggy conditions with low visibility and extreme conditions was improved, and real-time sea surface object detection was achieved with an inference speed of up to 36FPS on a single RTX 2080Ti. Further, the detection results on the COCO dataset and KITTI dataset verify the excellent generalization ability of our proposed object detection model.},

However, Global Positioning System (GPS) may lose effectiveness or become unavailable due to the potential signal block or interference in that operational environment. Under such circumstances, an imperative requirement on new positioning technology for UAV has emerged. With the rapid development of Radio Frequency (RF) based localisation technologies, leveraging small wireless sensor nodes for low-cost, low latency, low energy consumption and accurate localisation on UAV has received significant attention. However, no up-to-date review has been conducted in this area so far. Therefore, this paper aims to give a comprehensive survey on the RF based localisation systems with different radio communication technologies and localisation mechanisms on UAV positioning. Toward this end, an exhaustive evaluation framework is first established to evaluate the performance of each system on UAV positioning from different perspectives. Particularly, the Ultra-wideband (UWB) based system with time-based mechanisms is highlighted for UAV positioning under the consideration of the proposed evaluation framework. Finally, an intensive analysis is conducted about the current challenges and the potential research issues in this area in order to identify the promising directions for future research.},

The pilot study was conducted by guiding a robotic platform in different poses in order to experiment with a wide range of working conditions.

Firstly, an improved rapidly-exploring random trees planner is utilized to initialize the path in the joint space. To prevent excessive trimming, a heuristic method based on geometric path descriptors is proposed for finding and removing redundant nodes. Secondly, a hybrid scheme combining local path rewiring and redundancy-based node self-motion is used to identify and replan the part of the pre-planned path affected by dynamic obstacles. Lastly, an adaptive online trajectory generator is designed to adjust the trajectory in real time and generate smooth motion primitives for actuators. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for whole-arm obstacle avoidance in dynamic scenarios. Compared to other methods, our approach has a 35% higher success rate and a 47.2% reduction in replanning time.},

A traditional way of force computing models the interaction using a spring-damper system, which suffers from stability issues when the desired stiffness is high. Instead of computing a force, this paper continues to explore shifting the focus to rendering an interaction with no penetration, which can be accomplished by using a position controller in the joint space using the encoders as feedback directly. In order to make this approach easily adaptable to any device, an alternative way to model the dynamics of the device is also presented, which is to linearize a detailed simulation model. As a family of linearized models is used to approximate the full dynamic model of the system, it is important to have a smooth transition between multiple sets of controller gains generated based on these models. Gain scheduling is introduced to improve the performance in certain areas and a comparison among three controllers is conducted in a simulation setup.},

  abstract     = {Belt Conveyors are essential for transporting dry bulk material in different industries. Such structures require permanent inspections, traditionally executed by human operators based on cognition. To improve working conditions and process standardization, we propose a novel procedure to inspect conveyor structures with a ground robot composed by a mobile platform, a robotic arm, and a sensor-set. Based on field experience, we introduce ROSI, a new robotic device designed for long-term operations in harsh outdoor environments. The mobile robot has a hybrid locomotion system, using wheels to reduce energy consumption while covering long distances, and also flippers with tracks to improve mobility during obstacle negotiation. A mechanical passive switch allows decoupling tracks’ traction, reducing components wear and energy consumption without raising mechanical complexity. Aiming the robot-assisted operation, control strategies help to (i) command both the mobile platform and a robotic manipulator considering the system whole-body model, (ii) adjust the contact force for touching the conveyor structure during vibration inspection, and (iii) climb stairs while automatically adjusting the flippers. Machine Learning algorithms detect conveyors’ dirt build-ups, roller failures, and bearing faults by processing visual, thermal and sound data as inspection functionalities. The algorithms training and validation use a dataset collected from running conveyors at Vale, presenting detection accuracy superior to 90%. Field test results in a mining site demonstrate the robot capabilities to stand for the harsh operating conditions while executing all the required inspection tasks, stating ROSI as a disruptive solution for Belt Conveyor inspections and other general industrial operations.},

  abstract     = {First order Sliding Mode Control (SMC1) is used to control robotic manipulators deployed in industrial applications. However, the tracking performance of SMC1 is affected by modelling uncertainties, disturbance, and noisy measurement signals. In addition, SMC1 introduces an undesirable chattering effect that causes vibrations and reduces the manipulator positioning accuracy. This work investigates deployment of a Quasi-Continuous second order Sliding Mode Control (QCSMC) and its stability, over a nonlinear multilink Revolute-Revolute (RR) manipulator, to enhance the manipulator tracking performance, and reduce the chattering effect under the presence of modelling uncertainties, disturbance, and noisy state measurement. This investigation work introduces the manipulator’s dynamics modelling, forward and inverse kinematic solutions. The study then shows the desired joint space trajectory solution, whereby modelling uncertainties are considered. The work presents an online uncertainty quantification analysis to investigate the controller performance and stability with parameter change. SMC1 and QCSMC are then deployed to follow extracted trajectories under the effect of model-parameter-change, noisy measurement, and disturbance signals. Simulation results show that performance of QCSMC, overcomes the performance of SMC1, under the considered simulation conditions. Simulation results were further endorsed through experimentation methods by an NXT-based RR manipulator prototype. Simulation results demonstrate that applying QCSMC have reduced the associated joint-space trajectory root mean square errors (RMSE) when compared to SMC1 associated RMSE results. The enhancement reached an average of (84% to 97%) with infused model change and (64% to 79%) enhancement with infused disturbance. However, QCSMC shows a 2% RMSE value enhancement for the case of infused measurement noise when compared to SMC1. Experimental results demonstrate that the associated RMSE have also reduced by applying QCSMC when compared to SMC1. The experimental scenario nature includes a combined effect of modelling uncertainties, disturbances and measurement noise all applied together. Experimental scenario 1 shows that applying QCSMC have reduced the tracking RMSE for the first revolute joint angular position by 10%, and for the second joint angular position by 5% when compared to SMC 1 associated tracking RMSE values. Experimental scenario 2 shows a similar trend with 3% RMSE tracking enhancement for the second joint angular position when QCSMC is applied. Simulation and Experimental results agree, QCSMC introduces a better performance than SMC1, implying an enhanced performance, with less tracking errors, reduced chattering effect and higher robustness with reduced vibrations. In addition, the provided results signify robustness of both controllers against uncertainties and noise with better performance for QCSMC over SMC1.},

  abstract     = {The hexapod robots equipped with six legs have higher stability and adaptability to challenging terrains than other legged robots with fewer legs. The ability of hexapods to traverse challenging terrains largely depends on practical planning approaches on their footstep sequence. However, suppose the stability of the robotic system is insufficiently considered with the footstep planning method, it cannot track the planning results in some extremely complex terrains, e.g., foot slippage or robot overturn. In this work, we develop a quasi-static equilibrium footstep planning method for hexapod robots to traverse challenging terrains. The core of this planning method is the proposed 3D quasi-static equilibrium support region (3D QESR), which can be employed as a constraint for the planning method to ensure the quasi-static stability of the hexapod robots. A new graph search algorithm for footstep sequence planning is also presented. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed 3D QESR method has superior performance in bypassing unstable irregular regions compared with the widely used support polygon method.},

In this work, we implement a neural network (NN) capable to estimate such nonlinearities. Once they are estimated, one can propose a control scheme where these forces can correctly feed-forwarded. Our NN implementation has been programmed in C++ within the PX4 Autopilot, an open-source autopilot for drones. To ensure that this implementation does not considerably affect the autopilot’s performance, the coded NN must imply light computational load. To test our approach, we have carried out a series of realistic simulations in the Software in The Loop (SITL) using the PX4 Autopilot firmware. These experiments demonstrate that the implemented NN can be used to estimate the tail-sitter aerodynamic forces to improve the control algorithms during all the flight phases of the tail-sitter aircraft: hover, cruise flight, and transition.},

  abstract     = {An ever-increasing number of autonomous vehicles use bandwidth-greedy sensors such as cameras and LiDARs to sense and act to the world around us. Unfortunately, signal transmission in vehicles is vulnerable to passive and active cyber-physical attacks that may result in loss of intellectual property, or worse yet, the loss of control of a vehicle, potentially causing great harm. Therefore, it is important to investigate efficient cryptographic methods to secure signal transmission in such vehicles against outside threats. This study is motivated by the observation that previous publications have suggested legacy algorithms, which are either inefficient or insecure for vision-based signals. We show how stream ciphers and authenticated encryption can be applied to transfer sensor data securely and efficiently between computing devices suitable for distributed guidance, navigation, and control systems. We provide an efficient and flexible pipeline of cryptographic operations on image and point cloud data in the Robot Operating System (ROS). We also demonstrate how image data can be compressed to reduce the amount of data to be encrypted, transmitted, and decrypted. Experiments on embedded computers verify that modern software cryptographic algorithms perform very well on large sensor data. Hence, the introduction of such algorithms should enhance security without significantly compromising the overall performance.},

As the usage areas of the air vehicles become widespread, the development of controller structures which allows the quadrotor to track a specified trajectory precisely is a new research area of interest for researchers. In this work, the nonlinear mathematical model of a four-rotor UAV is obtained by using Newton-Euler method. In the trajectory tracking system of this quadrotor, a new controller structure which is called Robust Adaptive Backstepping Global Fast Dynamic Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (RABGFDTSMC) is designed. In this controller structure, the control process is divided into two subsystems in order to provide position and attitude control. RABGFDTSMC is applied to the fully actuated and underactuated subsystems individually. Coefficients of the controller is obtained by using pre-defined characteristic equation. Besides, overall system stability is proved with the Lyapunov function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, simulation experiments are conducted in MATLAB/ Simulink environment. The simulation results of the proposed controller are compared with the global fast dynamic terminal sliding mode controller by means of trajectory tracking performance in steady-state and transient phases. As a result, the proposed controller RABGFDTSMC method proved its robustness according to the smaller steady state error with less oscillations and more precise flight performance in trajectory tracking.},

  abstract     = {This article concerns the problem of a dense mapping system for a robot exploring a new environment. In this scenario, a robot equipped with an RGB-D camera uses RGB and range data to build a consistent model of the environment. Firstly, dense mapping requires the selection of the data representation. Secondly, the dense mapping system has to deal with localization drift which can be corrected when loop closure is detected. In this article, we deal with both of these problems, and we make several technical contributions. We define local maps which use the Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) stored in the 2D structures to represent the local scene with varying 3D resolution. This method directly utilizes the uncertainty model of the range sensor and provides information about the accuracy of the data in the map. We also propose an architecture that utilizes pose and covisibility graphs to correct a global model of the environment after loop closure detection. We show how to integrate the dense local mapping with the pose graph and keyframes management system in the ORB-SLAM2 localization. Finally, we show the advantages of the view-dependent model over the methods that uniformly divide the space to represent objects in the environment.},

  abstract     = {We study distributed planning for multi-robot systems to provide optimal service to cooperative tasks that are distributed over space and time. Each task requires service by sufficiently many robots at the specified location within the specified time window. Tasks arrive over episodes and the robots try to maximize the total value of service in each episode by planning their own trajectories based on the specifications of incoming tasks. Robots are required to start and end each episode at their assigned stations in the environment. We present a game theoretic solution to this problem by mapping it to a game, where the action of each robot is its trajectory in an episode, and using a suitable learning algorithm to obtain optimal joint plans in a distributed manner. We present a systematic way to design minimal action sets (subsets of feasible trajectories) for robots based on the specifications of incoming tasks to facilitate fast learning. We then provide the performance guarantees for the cases where all the robots follow a best response or noisy best response algorithm to iteratively plan their trajectories. While the best response algorithm leads to a Nash equilibrium, the noisy best response algorithm leads to globally optimal joint plans with high probability. We show that the proposed game can in general have arbitrarily poor Nash equilibria, which makes the noisy best response algorithm preferable unless the task specifications are known to have some special structure. We also describe a family of special cases where all the equilibria are guaranteed to have bounded suboptimality.

Furthermore, the transmission of parameters to the ground for real-time analysis and display of the RFI location is important as it provides insight into the performance advantages of the aerial location method. The main contributions of the article are four points: the first is the introduction of the angle of arrival (AOA) algorithm to civil aviation RFI location, and the integration of algorithm characteristics with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations proposing an aerial monitoring method for civil aviation RFI. Simulation results show that the two-point cross-location method obtains effective information on the location parameters of the RFI. The second is to build a UAV monitoring platform, which is as light as possible to make sure the direction finding and digital transmission devices meet the airworthiness requirements, so that the UAV can complete the data acquisition task within a safety margin. Thirdly, a ground analysis system was designed to receive information on the UAV’s parameters, enabling software manipulation to ensure safe operation under non-visual conditions. In addition to this, the monitoring data is processed in real time and algorithms are used to resolve the location of interference sources and display them on a map. The fourth one is to verify the implementation of the aerial positioning method by setting up different test scenarios. Compared with portable direction-finding equipment and ground monitoring, the test results show that the UAV-based RFI monitoring method performances better in monitoring radius and positioning accuracy with a small direction-finding error, and the advantages of the ground analysis system are highly integrated and intuitive display.},

Firstly, the RGB-D camera mounted on the drone obtains the point cloud of the environment, and the foreign object will be localized by the detection and localization algorithm. Then, a new visual servo error is proposed to decouple linear speed and angular speed, allowing the aerial manipulator to grasp accurately in the dangerous environment.

  abstract     = {In this study, we develop a telephoto pan-tilt drone search and track system for multicopters flying in a wide area spanning hundreds of meters, situated at a distance of hundreds of meters. It can detect periodic brightness changes around the drone propellers, which rotate at a high speed, in a high-frame-rate (HFR) video. The temporal frequency responses of the brightness signals in the HFR video are computed by performing pixel-level short-time Fourier transforms (STFTs) of the signals. By detecting the peak frequencies, the drone propellers are localized as vibration sources, and their rotation speed is estimated to monitor the flight status of the drone. For real-time localization and flight monitoring, the proposed system can perform pixel-level STFTs in a 500 fps video of 720×540 pixels using video processing accelerated by graphic processing units. This allows a multicopter to be tracked in real time at the center of the camera view by a galvanomirror pan-tilt active vision system with visual feedback.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an exploration strategy in unknown environments for a team of quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Based on the frontier information, the proposed strategy builds a roadmap of the explored area in form of a Sensor-based Selective Graph (SSG) using simple data trees of the frontier and the hub node only. In particular, the frontier data tree is utilized to consider the adjacent frontier sectors as one frontier sector, and the next target node is generated maximizing the coverage of frontiers at each movement of quadrotors. In addition, to expand the proposed strategy to the three dimensional (3D) workspace with quadrotors, a Multiple Flight Levels (MFL) approach is proposed to increase the efficiency of the exploration. Moreover, when a quadrotor reaches a dead end where no frontier exists, the efficient backtracking algorithm chooses the best path to backtrack efficiently with a graph map provided by the SSG. With these contributions, we successfully develop the frontier-based exploration strategy for multiple quadrotors, and performance of the overall approach is validated by numerical simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Measurement of performance metrics namely repeatability and directional accuracy of an under-actuated cable-driven robot using a monocular camera is proposed. Experiments were conducted on a cable-driven robot used for construction and the results are compared with that from a laser tracker. Least value of about 18 mm was observed at the middle of the workspace and it agreed with the measurement from laser tracker. Using the proposed method it was also possible to measure orientation repeatability considering the end-effector coordinate system as the reference, which is an advantage over using a laser tracker. Since the robot workspace is very large and there are restrictions on feasible measurement volume while using a camera, a method to determine suitable locations of the camera to enable measurement in all of the workspace is also proposed. Results of this analysis show that the camera may be positioned at four feasible regions during measurement over the whole workspace. Finally, a method for measurement of cable profile is also proposed. The position and slope of the cable at two locations were measured using a camera. This was utilized to fit a catenary model such that profile of the cable between these points can be determined. Experiments conducted to determine the cable profile in different regions of workspace showed that there is comparatively greater sagging at the periphery of the workspace which explains the higher positioning errors in the same region.},

  abstract     = {Visual object recognition plays an important role in the fields of computer vision and robotics. Static analysis of an image from a single viewpoint may not contain enough information to recognize an object unambiguously. Active object recognition (AOR) is aimed at collecting additional information to reduce ambiguity by purposefully adjusting the viewpoint of an observer. Existing AOR methods are oriented to a single task whose goal is to recognize an object by the minimum number of viewpoints. This paper presents a novel framework to deal with multiple AOR tasks based on feature decision tree (FDT). In the framework, in the light of the distribution of predetermined features on each object in a model base, a prior feature distribution table is firstly created as a kind of prior knowledge. Then it is utilized for the construction of FDT which describes the transition process of recognition states when different viewpoints are selected. Finally, in order to determine the next best viewpoints for the tasks with different goals, a unified optimization problem is established and solved by tree dynamic programming algorithm. In addition, the existing evaluation method of viewpoint planning (VP) efficiency is improved. According to whether the prior probability of the appearance of each object is known, the VP efficiency of different tasks is evaluated respectively. Experiments on the simulation and real environment show that the proposed framework obtains rather promising results in different AOR tasks.},

  abstract     = {In most real world applications, noisy and incomplete information about the robot proximity is inevitable due to imperfections coupled with the onboard sensors. The perception and control problems go hand in hand in order to efficiently plan safe robot maneuvers. This paper proposes a method to generate robot actions directly from a sequence of depth images. The notion of Artificial Potential Field (APF) approach is used where a robot action is obtained by combining the attractive and repulsive actions generated by the goal and the obstacles respectively. This article assumes environment perception uncertainty that relates to the estimation of an obstacle’s location relative to the robot. The repulsive action generation is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). A Particle Filter (PF) approach is used to estimate and track valid scene points in the robot sensing horizon from an imperfect depth image stream. The most probable candidates for an occupied region are used to generate a velocity action that minimizes the repulsive potential at each time instant. Approximately optimal solutions to the POMDP are obtained using the QMDP technique which enables us to perform computationally expensive operations prior to a robot run. Consequently, suitable repulsive actions are generated onboard the robot, each time an image is received, in a computationally feasible way. An attractive action, obtained by solving for the negative gradient of the attractive potential is finally added to the repulsive action to generate a final robot action at every time step. Lastly, the robustness and reliability of this approach is demonstrated close-loop on a quadrotor UAV equipped with a depth camera. The experiments also demonstrate that the method is very computationally efficient and can be run on a variety of platforms that have limited resources on-board.},

The distributed leaderless and leader-following practical bipartite consensus control laws are proposed in cooperation-competition networks with uncertain parameters, effectively extending the theoretical framework in cooperation networks for NLSs. In the leaderless case, the symmetric regions are newly established to facilitate the final convergence analysis. By employing the structurally balanced networked topologies, a novel symmetric positive definite matrix is exploited to derive the gain selection criteria in the leader-following case. Finally, numerical simulations of a network of revolute joint manipulators are illustrated to verify the theoretical results under positive-negative and all-negative topologies.},

Based on this model, the longitudinal and later-directional orbit stability of the vehicle at uncontrolled condition are proved to be steady via Floquet Theory combined with the untethered flight experiment. However, both simulation and experiment show that the vehicle presents a periodical motion state which is similar to spiral flight at uncontrolled condition. At this spiral-like flight state, the yaw angle of the vehicle varies constantly, which makes it difficult to meet the requirements of the general flight mission. In this case, two independent PID controllers are designed to stabilize the vehicle attitude based on the approximate linear model in the vicinity of the equilibrium flight condition. And the controlled flight of the vehicle prototype is also proved to be stable through numerical calculation and physical experiment.},

  abstract     = {In the paper, a family of novel real-time tuning methods for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) altitude controller in in-flight conditions. The methods allow the controller’s gains to be adapted only on the basis of measurements from a basic sensory equipment and by constructing the optimization cost function in an on-line fashion with virtually no impeding computational complexity; in the case of the altitude controller as in this paper for a hexacopter, altitude measurements were used only. The methods are not dependent on the measurement level, and present the approach in a generally applicable form to tuning arbitrary controllers with low number of parameters. Real-world experimental flights, preceded by simulation tests, have shown which method should behave best in a noisy environment when e.g. wind disturbances act on a UAV while it is in autonomous flight. As the methods can potentially be extended to other control loops or controller types, making this a versatile, rapid-tuning tool. It has been shown that a well-tuned controller using the proposed AL-TUNE scheme outperforms controllers that are tuned just to stabilize the system. AL-TUNE provides a new way of using UAVs in terms of adaptivity to changing their dynamic properties and can be deployed rapidly. This enables new applications and extends the usability of fully autonomous UAVs, unlike other tuning methods, which basically require the availability of a UAV model. The core difference with respect to other research from the field is that other authors either use a model of a UAV to optimize the gains analytically or use machine learning techniques, what increases time consumption, whereas the presented methods offer a rapid way to tune controllers, in a reliable way, with deterministic time requirements.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a pipeline where the detector is based on a real-time Deep Learning network and the decoder is a conventional method, i.e. the implementation in libdmtx. To do so, several types of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for object detection were studied, trained, compared, and assessed. The architectures range from region proposals (Faster R-CNN) to single-shot methods (SSD and YOLO). This study focused on performance and processing time to select the best Deep Learning (DL) model to carry out the detection of the visual markers. Additionally, a specific data set was created to evaluate those networks. This test set includes demanding situations, such as high illumination gradients in the same scene and Data Matrix markers positioned in skewed planes. The proposed approach outperformed the best known and most used Data Matrix decoder available in libraries like libdmtx.},

Therefore, it is important that governments around the world maintain an active interest in getting women to continue in STEM careers. In this context, this work was divided into three main phases, the first was to conduct a search through a related works that were published involving the development of projects aimed at the engagement of girls students or female teachers/professionals within the context of STEM or Robotics, between the years 2018 and 2020. In this case, seven works were found within these criteria, including one Brazilian project. Subsequently, analyzes were carried out of the 85 projects that are being financed by the federal government of Brazil within STEM. The last analysis was a case study to evaluate the engagement of female teachers and students in a medium-sized city in the interior of the southeastern region of Brazil. In this case, we carried out the analysis with the teachers and students, as well as with an external audience. We carry out our analyzes through statistics and analysis of feelings and opinions, in addition to data visualizations. In the end, we conducted through data mining of unsupervised machine learning, analyzes of the groups of people we are interested in engaging, which are groups of young people, especially girls who are interested in STEM, but with little knowledge in Robotics. This strategy was put on the schedule, because we will aim to increase the knowledge of these girls in STEM, especially in robotics, which is the focus of our study and research group. Finally, results have shown that this project has improved a major social and encouraging role for these girls in the field of exact sciences, computing and engineering.},

However, the resulting map may lack important semantic information, such as the objects (and their locations) present in the location. Since the same objects may be detected several times during the mapping phase, data association becomes a critical issue: objects viewed from different angles and in different time instants must be fused together into a single instance on the map. In this paper, we propose Spatio-temporal Data Association (STDA) for object-augmented mapping. It is based on expected similarities between consecutive frames (temporal association) and similar non-consecutive frames (spatial association). The experiments suggest that our system is capable of correctly fusing together multiple views of several objects, resulting in only one false positive association in more than 130 detected objects across several datasets. The results are competitive with the state-of-the-art. We also generated object location ground truth annotations for 3 simulated environments to foster further comparison. Finally, the annotated map was used for an object fetching task.},

  abstract     = {Naturally, the ever-growing number of drone operations conducted worldwide carries with it an increase in the number of safety-related incidents and occurrences. The reporting and subsequent investigation of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) accidents and serious incidents seems like a proven solution towards improving operational safety. Such procedures also stem from the fact that UAS are of recognized as aircraft – and aircraft accidents and serious incidents are subject to obligatory investigation. From a technical perspective, a key issue concerns discrepancies in the investigation process as there are significant differences between manned and unmanned aviation operations. From a regulatory perspective, one key question is to what extent should it be obligatory to conduct independent technical investigation of occurrences involving UAS? Such occurrences are not only accidents and serious incidents that involve both UAS and manned aircraft, where “traditional” rules of conducting a full and independent technical investigation apply – the majority occurrences involve only UAS that were either destroyed, damaged or acted as a hazard to third parties. The method of study comprised of content analysis of existing legislation. Current doctrines were confronted with existing regulations, documents, materials, safety reports and statistics. Results of the study shows that the extension of regulations created for manned aviation accident reporting and investigation may not be enough, and certain improvements are necessary, e.g. to standardize the reporting of occurrences and the criteria to conduct a formal accidents and serious incidents investigation. It is also reasonable to take actions aimed at raising awareness among UAS users of the need to report accidents and serious incidents, as well as engage them in the investigative process. The lack of standardization in this field has resulted in the lack of data that is “good enough” to indicate the main causes and factors that contribute to UAS accidents.},

Precise navigation between obstacles and time-efficient searching of 3D structures and buildings are essential for locating survivors and people in need in emergency response missions. In this work we address this challenging problem by proposing a unified search planning framework that automates the process of UAV-based search planning in 3D environments. Specifically, we propose a novel search planning framework which enables automated planning and execution of collision-free search trajectories in 3D by taking into account low-level mission constrains (e.g., the UAV dynamical and sensing model), mission objectives (e.g., the mission execution time and the UAV energy efficiency) and user-defined mission specifications (e.g., the 3D structures to be searched and minimum detection probability constraints). The capabilities and performance of the proposed approach are demonstrated through extensive simulated 3D search scenarios.},

For standard multirotor UAV, it is difficult to track arbitrary trajectories because of strong coupling feature between translational motion and rotation motion (e.g., it can hover on the spot only when horizontal). However, this novel fully-actuated octocopter UAV can realize translational motion and rotation motion independently, and realize arbitrary trajectory tracking. This capability can make multirotor UAV having better operation and control performances, and expand application scope, for example, the operation performance of manipulator can have better operation performance if this novel octocopter is utilized as the moving base, for this octocopter can realize more smooth movement performance than standard multirotor UAV. To deal with influence of parametric uncertainties and external disturbance, a robust adaptive control scheme is developed for this novel octocopter UAV. Finally, numerical simulations are utilized to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {How to improve the behavioral decision-making ability and adaptability to unknown environments is of great importance for an agent. The traditional decision-making methods usually suffer from long training time, due to the large amount of training samples, or low adaptability to the unknown environments, or lack of the continuous learning capacities, etc. In response to these problems, this work proposes a novel motivated developmental network (MDN) to improve the decision-making ability of the agent. During the environment exploration, if the agent encounters an unknown environment, new layers and neurons are dynamically inserted to the MDN, according to the task requirements. Through the interaction between internal neurons and the inserted new neurons, the agent can autonomously develop and learn in the unknown environments without training data, but the behavioral decision-making at this stage is random. To further improve the agent’s decision-making ability, in the off-task process, through the gated self-organization mechanism, the agent can selectively recall the specific knowledge in its “brain”, and the MDN will transfer and generate a large amount of new data, according to the recalled knowledge, then the new layers and neurons will be inserted to memorize the new knowledge. Hence the knowledge base of the MDN becomes more and more complete, thereby improving its decision-making ability and adaptability to the new environment. To demonstrate the performance of the MDN model, a mobile robot navigation in different environments are executed. The experimental results illustrate that the agent can not only autonomously learn in static environments, but also has better decision-making ability in unknown dynamic environment, i.e., better adaptability to the new environment. Comparison with other algorithms further demonstrate the potential of the proposed MDN model.},

The dynamic state feedback includes two disturbance observers which estimate external force and torque disturbances. The effect of rotor drag is compensated in the proposed force disturbance observer and the backstepping motion controller. The closed-loop dynamics is proven to be exponentially stable in the presence of constant disturbances.

Maneuverability can be defined as the ability to turn in a confined area and it is measured as the turning radius trajectory in terms of the body length (R/BL, where R is defined as the turning radius and BL defined as the total body length). This paper aims to develop a swimming robot of labriform swimming mode with good steering performance. The steering process is achieved by one degree of freedom (1-DOF) represented by two concave-shaped pectoral fins. The steering mechanism adopted in this work is based on the differential drive principle. This principle is carried out by varying the right/left fins velocities. Different radii have been observed with four different cases of velocities. Diving underwater, is another aspect that has been taking into account during this work. The designed robot uses a mass sliding mechanism to change its center of gravity, and consequently, controlling the pitch angle and hence the depth of the robot. The designed glider robot is able to achieve about 40° of pitch angle and swims for a depth of approximately 30 cm underwater. The results of these experiments showed the success of the proposed robot to steer and dive efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Rotation estimation is important for localization, mapping and navigation in robotic applications. A novel rotation estimation method for geometric vision of omni-directional cameras is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we formulate the rotation estimation as a sinusoid fitting problem on the basis of column-wise and row-wise shifts in omni-directional images. Then the method is implemented in two steps: motion vector extraction and sinusoid fitting. We are extracting motion vectors by finding pixel deviations in row- and column-directions as well as image rotation for each sub-image by Fourier-Mellin transform (FMT) or by optical flow. Then we fit these column-wise motion vectors to two sinusoid functions. Due to sharing the optimization variables, column-wise shifts and image rotation of each motion vector can be optimized jointly. Afterwards, the 3D rotation between two frames is obtained from the offsets, amplitudes and phase-shifts of the two sinusoid functions. Finally, we perform experiments for 3D rotation, which show that our algorithm outperforms the geometry-based methods in accuracy, robustness and speed. Compared to our early version, this paper makes several improvements: 1) modeling both pixel shifts and sub-regions’ rotation to the sinusoid fitting problem, instead of only pixel shifts; 2) exploiting optical flow to extract motion vectors in addition to FMT; 3) comparing with a geometry-based method for pure rotation as well as five-point algorithms.},

Therefore, how to handle blurred images is a main problem in visual SLAM. In order to decrease the influence of blurred images on localization accuracy, this paper proposes an improved visual SLAM, which is based on Haar wavelet transform and has the ability of eliminating blurred images. Besides, a correlation-weighted pose optimization is also developed in this paper. This weighted optimization integrates the correlation between matching features as weighting coefficients into the reprojection errors. In this weighted method, pose optimization algorithm can reduce the influence of the matching features with low correlation, which are more likely to be mismatched. As a result, the accuracy of the estimated pose will be improved. The improved system optimized by our method is evaluated on the TUM RGB-D dataset and real environment. It is also compared with other optimization systems, which were based on blurred image elimination and uncertainty-weighted optimization respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the system optimized by our method could achieve the highest accuracy and robustness in pose estimation.},

  abstract     = {Service robots are appearing more and more in our daily life. The development of service robots combines multiple fields of research, from object perception to object manipulation. The state-of-the-art continues to improve to make a proper coupling between object perception and manipulation. This coupling is necessary for service robots not only to perform various tasks in a reasonable amount of time but also to continually adapt to new environments and safely interact with non-expert human users. Nowadays, robots are able to recognize various objects, and quickly plan a collision-free trajectory to grasp a target object in predefined settings. Besides, in most of the cases, there is a reliance on large amounts of training data. Therefore, the knowledge of such robots is fixed after the training phase, and any changes in the environment require complicated, time-consuming, and expensive robot re-programming by human experts. Therefore, these approaches are still too rigid for real-life applications in unstructured environments, where a significant portion of the environment is unknown and cannot be directly sensed or controlled. In such environments, no matter how extensive the training data used for batch learning, a robot will always face new objects. Therefore, apart from batch learning, the robot should be able to continually learn about new object categories and grasp affordances from very few training examples on-site. Moreover, apart from robot self-learning, non-expert users could interactively guide the process of experience acquisition by teaching new concepts, or by correcting insufficient or erroneous concepts. In this way, the robot will constantly learn how to help humans in everyday tasks by gaining more and more experiences without the need for re-programming. In this paper, we review a set of previously published works and discuss advances in service robots from object perception to complex object manipulation and shed light on the current challenges and bottlenecks.},

This study reviews the maturity levels, or “market-readiness”, of public safety applications for UAS. As individual assessments of all applications suggested in the literature are infeasible due to their sheer number, we propose a novel set of application categories: Remote Sensing, Mapping, Monitoring, Human-drone Interaction, Flying Ad-hoc Networks, Transportation, and Counter UAV Systems. Each category’s maturity is assessed through a literature review of contained applications, using the metric of Application Readiness Levels (ARLs). Relevant aspects such as the environmental complexity and available mission time of addressed scenarios are taken into account. Following the analysis, we infer that improvements in autonomy and software reliability are the most promising research areas for increasing the usefulness and acceptance of UAS in the public safety domain.},

During the development of DO, a state estimator is also constructed to avoid the situation of lack of states availability. Hence, invoking state estimator in estimation criteria followed by combining it with control scheme through an auxiliary gain yields the desired CDOBC based on ABSSMC.

  abstract     = {This study proposes an image-based action generation method using a controller that is trained with experiences autonomously collected by a robot. Operating a robot using its state or point in coordinate space is not always easy for human operators to control. This is because humans do not interpret the world as a coordinate space. Depending on the task, inputs such as voice-input or image-input are easier for human operators to use when managing a robot. Accordingly, we studied an image-based control method of robotic agents. Designing an image-based controller by hand for different tasks and input images is highly complex. Therefore, a controller which can be automatically trained from experiences collected by a robot is strongly preferred. In addition, when considering the operation of a robot in a real environment, the controller should guarantee the safety of a robot’s behavior in a way that is configurable and understandable by the human operator. However, most previous approaches trained the controller end-to-end, which does not guarantee the safety of the behavior learned by the controller. Instead of training the controller end-to-end, we train state prediction and cost estimation functions to solve the action generation as a path planning problem. By doing so, we can explicitly design and specify the undesired state of a robot in the configuration space. The results show that the proposed method can be used to provide safe navigation to different goal positions in a realistic living room-like environment with an hour of training data.},

Once a topological map is built, it can be used for various purposes, such as path planning or intruder capture. Multiple agents generate a Voronoi graph as a topological map of the environment, while dropping indexed markers at Voronoi vertices. Each agent has range sensors to detect nearby obstacles, thus can move along a Voronoi edge. Also, each agent stores the boundary for the explored region thus far, and unite its boundary with the boundary of another agent if some conditions are met. In this way, multiple agents can explore the entire workspace in a time efficient manner. The proposed exploration strategy doesn’t require localization of an agent or a marker in global coordinate systems. To the best of our knowledge, this article is unique in addressing a multi-agent exploration and map building strategy, such that each agent drops indexed markers for generating a topological map of the environment.

  abstract     = {Autonomous robots that execute plans in real-world environments may easily get failed due to unexpected environment dynamics. For robust plan execution, a great number of plan execution monitoring works has been proposed to estimate plan execution effects and make recovery plans for any detected plan failures. However, most works have assumed the full observability of environment states and accessibility of complete information about environment dynamics, which shows limitations when executing plans under environment dynamics and partial observability. To efficiently and effectively monitor robot plans in dynamic and partially observable environments, this paper first proposes an accompanying action policy that specifies an interaction pattern between information-gathering plan and the task plan to estimate and monitor task plan execution. To provide a concrete implementation of the above pattern, we first identify the task achievement and execution monitoring as two separated goals in a robot task, and then propose a hybrid planning approach that integrates two planners to solve the goals. For a task-achievement goal, we utilize a classical planning framework ROSPlan to efficiently compute the global task plan. While executing each action of the plan, we cast the execution monitoring problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which plans the information-gathering plans for monitors the action execution effects and recover failures when necessary. We further implement a typical robotic service task to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. By comparing with both the baseline plan-invariant execution monitoring approach and a full POMDP planning approach, the hybrid planning approach is efficient in task planning and execution monitoring and effectively recovering plan failures in unknown environments.},

  abstract     = {As an effort of automating the bridge inspection process, this paper presents a new development of an adaptable tank-like robot, which can climb on steel structures to collect data and perform inspection. While most current steel climbing mobile robots are designed to work on flat steel surface, our proposed tank-like robot design is capable of climbing on different steel structural shapes (e.g., cylinder, cube) by using reciprocating mechanism and magnetic roller-chains. The developed robot can pass through the joints and transition from one surface to the other (e.g., from flat to curving surfaces). A prototype robot integrating multiple sensors (hall-effects, IR, IMU, Eddy current and cameras), has been developed by coping with variety of strict concerns including tight dimension, effective adhesive and climbing adaptation. Rigorous analysis of robot kinematics, adhesive force, sliding and turn-over failure and motor power has been conducted to certify the stability of the proposed design. The theory calculations can serve as an useful framework for designing future steel climbing robots. The cameras and Eddy current sensor is integrated on Robot for visual and in-depth fatigue crack inspection of steel structures. Experimental results and field deployments on more than twenty steel bridges confirm the adhesive, climbing, inspection capability of the robot.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the conventional and learning-based control approaches for multi-rotor platforms, with and without the presence of an actuated “tail” appendage. A comprehensive experimental comparison between the proven control-theoretic approaches and more recent learning-based ones is one of the contributions. Furthermore, an actuated tail appendage is considered as a deviation from the typical multi-rotor morphology, complicating the control problem but promising some useful applications. Our study also explores, as another contribution, the impact of such an actuated tail on the overall position control for both the conventional as well as learning-based controllers. For the conventional control part, we used a multi-loop architecture where the inner loop regulates the attitude while the outer loop controls the position of the platform. For the learning controller, a multi-layer neural network architecture is used to learn a nonlinear state-feedback controller. To improve the learning and generalization performance of this controller, we adopted a curricular learning approach which gradually increases the difficulty of training samples. For the experiments, a planar bi-rotor platform is modeled in a 2D simulation environment. The planar model avoids mathematical complications while preserving the main attributes of the problem making the results more useful. We observe that both types of controllers achieve reasonable control performance and can solve the position control task. However, neither one shows a clear advantage over the other. The learning-based controller is not intuitive and the system suffers from long training times. The architecture of the multi-loop controller is handcrafted (not required for the learning-based controller) but provides a guaranteed stable behavior.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles require high-level semantic maps, which contain the activities of pedestrians and cars, to ensure safe navigation. High-level semantics can be obtained from mobile probe sensor data. Analyzing pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data is an effective approach to avoid collisions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Such analyses of pedestrian trajectories can generate new information such as pedestrian behaviors in violation of traffic regulations. However, pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data significantly sparse and noisy, making it challenging to analyze pedestrian activity. To address this issue, we propose multiple daily data and graph-based approaches to treat sparse and noisy data for estimating the flow of pedestrians based on mobile probe data. To improve the sparseness of the data, multiple daily data are fused. After that, a pedestrian graph is created to enhance the region’s coverage by connecting the sparse data indicating the flow of pedestrians. This proposed approach successfully obtained pedestrian trajectory data from the sparse and noisy data. Moreover, it was possible to identify the potential locations where pedestrians tend to cross the street by analyzing the pedestrian flow. The results indicate that 83% of well-known regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street corresponded with those extracted using the proposed approach. Furthermore, a high-level semantic map of the regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street along a 1-km road is presented. The trajectory information obtained using the proposed approach is expected to be essential for understanding different scenarios of the interactions between individuals and autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Gait disabilities empowered intensive research on the field of human-robot interaction to promote effective gait rehabilitation. Assist-as-needed strategies are becoming prominent, appealing to the users’ participation in their rehabilitation therapy. This study proposes and assesses the biomechanical effects of an adaptive impedance control strategy that innovatively allows adaptability in interaction-based stiffness and gait trajectory towards a fully assist-as-needed therapy. By modulating the interaction-based stiffness per gait phase, we hypothesize that the strategy appeals to a symbiotic human-orthotic cooperation, augmenting the user’s muscular activity. The interaction stiffness was estimated by modelling the human-orthosis interaction torque vs angle curve with a linear regression model. The strategy also allows for real-time trajectory adaptations at different gait phases to fulfil the users’ needs. The biomechanical assessment of the impedance-controlled ankle orthosis involved eight healthy volunteers walking at 1.0 and 1.6 km/h. The results revealed a stronger muscular activation regarding the non-assisted leg for the gastrocnemius lateralis (increment ratio ≥ 1.0 for both gait speeds) and for the tibialis anterior muscle (increment ratio ≥ 1.0 for 1.6 km/h). The strategy guided users successfully on a healthy gait pattern while allowing deviations (median error &lt; 5.0°) given the users’ intention weighted by interaction stiffness. Findings showed the relevance for adapting gait trajectory as users prefer higher trajectories as the speed increases. No significant temporal variations or neither knee angular compensations were observed (p value ≥0.11). Overall results support that this strategy may be applied for intensity-adapted gait training, allowing different human-robot compliant levels.},

By utilizing the image-based visual servoing, the control law can be directly designed in the image plane, thereby avoiding errors caused by the 3D position calculation. Based on that, we design a control framework to integrate the control of the UAV and the pan-tilt, which enables the UAV to track the target while maintaining the feature point near the image center. Furthermore, considering that the low-cost pan-tilt camera we use has restricted characteristics, we present a deterministic finite automata model to transit the states of tracking when the pan-tilt attitude reaches saturation, thereby improving the tracking ability of the UAV for the moving target. The stability proof of the controller is given, and extensive experiments of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and real flights are provided. The results show that the proposed method can achieve continuous robust tracking of the ground moving target.},

An adaptive backstepping position controller is designed to ensure the stability of the ultrasound robot in the presence of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. A proportional-integral-derivative force controller is proposed to maintain a constant interaction force during the scan process. Rather than periodic time-triggered implementation, the Lyapunov-based triggering condition is derived to update the control inputs in an aperiodic manner, reduce the communication burden, and preserve the stability of the robotic system during the task. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is investigated based on a comparison study with different time-triggered adaptive control schemes. Moreover, the proposed event-triggered mechanism is compared with the most common triggering conditions in literature, i.e., fixed and relative thresholds. These schemes are devoted to carry out the transversal ultrasound scan in the simulation environment. Additional validation of the proposed control scheme is performed in the virtual robot experimentation platform (V-REP). From the results of simulation and experimental runs, the proposed event-triggered control scheme is found to be more promising and efficient in robot-assisted ultrasound imaging.},

Therefore, the main emphasis of this paper is to investigate current manufacturing trends and component selection criteria for developing a complete VBTS system. Further, the motivation behind this review is to identify the shortcomings in the current VBTS development technology and to furnish viable solutions to overcome such challenges. First, three different modalities of VBTSs are discussed: i) Waveguide-type designs, ii) marker-tracking based designs, and ii) reflective membrane designs. Next, a detailed discussion on various design aspects, like manufacturing, selection, and arrangements of the various sensor components, of the VBTSs is included. Then, a discussion on the validation/testing of various VBTSs is presented. Finally, based on the review, several challenges related to the development of VBTS are presented and the future research directions to overcome such challenges are recommended.

  abstract     = {This article concerns tracking of floating objects using fixed-wing UAVs with a monocular thermal camera. Target tracking from an agile aerial vehicle is challenging because uncertainty in the UAV pose negatively affects the accuracy of the measurements obtained through thermal images. Consequently, the accuracy of the tracking estimates is degraded if navigation uncertainty is neglected. This is especially relevant for the estimated target covariance since inconsistency is a likely consequence. A tracking system based on the Schmidt-Kalman filter is proposed to mitigate navigation uncertainty. Images gathered with an uncertain UAV pose are weighted less than images captured with a reliable pose. The UAV pose is estimated independently in a multiplicative extended Kalman filter where the estimated covariance matrix is a measure of the uncertainty. The method is compared experimentally with two traditional alternatives based on the extended Kalman filter. The results show that the proposed method performs better with respect to consistency and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Aerial physical interaction is a promising field for unmanned aerial vehicles in future applications. This paper presents a novel paradigm for automatic aerial contact-based sliding interaction (inspection/cleaning) tasks in aerial robotics allowing a 3D force with a constant norm to be applied on generic surfaces with unknown geometry. The interaction task is achieved by a fully-actuated hexarotor equipped with a rigidly attached end-effector under a passivity-based geometric impedance controller and a new sliding-mode extended state observer to estimate the interaction wrench. In order to increase the observer performance and reduce the estimation chattering phenomenon, the observer is innovatively incorporated with a super-twisting algorithm and a sigmoid function with a switching gain being adaptively updated by a fuzzy logic system. A detailed stability analysis for the observer is presented based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed control approach is validated in several simulations in which we try to accomplish the aerial physical sliding interaction task with different types of objects under various sliding speeds.},

To address the problems of search node divergence and long calculation time in the A* routing algorithm in the large scenario, this paper presents a novel center constraint weighted A* algorithm (CCWA*). The heuristic function is modified to give different dynamic weights to nodes in different positions, and the node weights are changed in the specified direction during the expansion process, thereby reducing the number of search nodes. An adaptive threshold is further added to the heuristic function to enhance the adaptiveness of the algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the CCWA* algorithm, simulations are performed on 2-dimensional grid maps of different sizes. The results show that the proposed algorithm speeds up the search process and reduces the planning time in the process of path planning in a multi-obstacle environment compared with the conventional A* algorithm and weighted A* algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based visual localization has become prospective over the past decades. Since ground truth pose labels are difficult to obtain, recent methods try to learn pose estimation networks using pixel-perfect synthetic data. However, this also introduces the problem of domain bias. In this paper, we first build a Tuebingen Buildings dataset of RGB images collected by a drone in urban scenes and create a 3D model for each scene. A large number of synthetic images are generated based on these 3D models. We take advantage of image style transfer and cycle-consistent adversarial training to predict the relative camera poses of image pairs based on training over synthetic environment data. We propose a relative camera pose estimation approach to solve the continuous localization problem for autonomous navigation of unmanned systems. Unlike those existing learning-based camera pose estimation methods that train and test in a single scene, our approach successfully estimates the relative camera poses of multiple city locations with a single trained model. We use the Tuebingen Buildings and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach in a single scene and across-scenes. For each dataset, we compare the performance between real images and synthetic images trained models. We also test our model in the indoor dataset 7Scenes to demonstrate its generalization ability.},

It aims to supervise the health state of the robot actuators after a first detection of faults, and to study the faults impact on the robot behavior. As faults are considered the loss of actuators efficiency due to wear linked to the robot high solicitation. The main contribution is on the one hand the diagnosis of simultaneous actuator faults and on the other hand the impact study of these faults on the robot behavior to determine degradation limits which guarantee that the robot is still close to the desired performance. The objective is to provide to the user a decision-making support regarding whether (or not) the robot is still able to continue functioning with respect to security instructions imposed by its environment. Two main cases are dealt: 1) All the four-actuators lose from 0% (no fault) to 95% of their efficiency. 2) One actuator is completely defective (it loses 100 % of its efficiency), while the three-others lose from 0% to 95% of their efficiency. Different scenarios are tested to analyze the impact of the robot missions and the working conditions on its behavior under degradation.},

To do so, the Dueling Double DQN algorithm is used: it receives the images from the robot’s camera and decides on which discrete action should be performed, such as walk forward, turn to the left or kick the ball. The first experiments were performed in a robotic simulator in which the robot could learn, with DRL, three different tasks: to walk towards the ball, to act like a penalty taker and to act like a goalkeeper. In the second experiment, the learning obtained in the task to walk towards the ball was transferred to a real humanoid robot and a similar behavior could be observed, even though the environment was not exactly the same when the domain was changed. Results showed that it is possible to use DRL to learn tasks related to the role of a humanoid robot-soccer player, such as goalkeeper and penalty taker.},

In our approach, the state vector used as the neural network’s input consists of raw sensor measurements or quantities which could be obtained through sensor fusion, while the actions are the joint positions, which are sent to joint controllers. Our running behavior outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of sprint speed by approximately 50%. We present results regarding the training procedure and also evaluate the controllers in terms of speed, reliability, and human similarity. Since the running policies with top speed display asymmetric motions, we also investigate a technique to encourage symmetry in the sagittal plane. Finally, we discuss key factors that lead us to surpass previous results in the literature and share some ideas for future research.},

An interconnected hybrid model of a helicopter is considered consisting of fuselage and rotor which are modeled as a single rigid body and a disc, respectively. For designing a globally defined controller, we consider that attitude dynamics evolves on non-Euclidean space. We assume that the rotor is subjected to unknown disturbances and exact information of the helicopter parameters are unavailable due to parametric uncertainty. A attitude tracking controller using Super Twisting Algorithm based on Second-Order sliding mode technique is proposed to ensure robustness in the presence of both unknown disturbance and parameter variation. A family of strong Lyapunov functions is used to show that the proposed controller drives the closed loop system to the sliding manifold in finite time. For the suitable choice of gain matrices, the reduced order error dynamics becomes almost globally asymptotically stable. We further show that the reduced order error dynamics is almost semi-globally exponentially stable if its trajectories starts from a specific subset. The rate of convergence can be adjusted as required by tuning the controller gains. Numerical simulations are carried out by comparing the proposed controller with the state-of-the art controllers available in the literature.},

Model-based software engineering is a suitable means for agile task programming and reconfiguration. We propose a model-based design-to-deployment toolchain that simplifies the routine of updating or modifying tasks. This toolchain relies on (i) UML profiles for quick model design, (ii) formal verification for exhaustive search for unsafe situations (caused by intended or unintended human behavior) within the model, and (iii) trans-coding tools for automating the development process.

Image memory is constructed from a set of reference images that are acquired during a prior mapping phase and arranged topologically. A* search is used to find the optimal path between the current location and the destination. The images from the robot’s RGB camera are used to localize within the topological graph, and an Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) control scheme drives the robot to the next node in the graph. Depth images update a local egocentric occupancy grid, and another IBVS controller navigates local free-space. The output of the two IBVS controllers is fused to form the final control command for the robot. We demonstrate real-time navigation for the Pepper robot in an indoor open-plan office environment without the need for accurate mapping and localization. Our core navigation module can run completely onboard the robot (which has quite limited computing capabilities) at 5 Hz without requiring any external computing resources. We have successfully performed navigation trials over 15 days, visiting more than 50 destinations and traveling more than 1200m with a success rate of over 80%.

Considering the leader following consensus tracking problem, an observer-based protocol is designed to obtain desirable output synchronization. The protocol design consists of a local observer for the leader drone and a distributed observer for the follower drones. Observer gains are optimized through a multi-step algorithm based on linear quadratic regulator controller and linear matrix inequalities. Most of the existing literature on cooperative control considers full state information for the controller as well as observer design. However, the protocol for the controller and observer design for consensus tracking of multi-unmanned aerial vehicles presented in this paper considers that only the relative partial states information from the corresponding neighboring drones are utilized. The designed algorithm is robust and guarantees that all the states of follower drones track the states of the leader drone and the consensus is achieved asymptotically even in the presence of external disturbances. Finally, considering the ideal and perturbed system, the efficacy of the analytical results are illustrated by comparative analysis using numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Benchmarking is a common practice employed to quantify the performance of various approaches toward the same task. By maintaining a consistent test environment, the inherent behaviours between methods may be distinguished—which is key to progressing a research field. In robotic manipulation research there is a current lack of standardisation, making it challenging to fairly assess and compare various approaches throughout literature. This paper proposes new criteria in conjunction with a benchmarking platform to measure the effectiveness of a grasping pipeline. The proposed benchmarking template offers a testing platform for 2-fingered, vision-based grasp synthesis methodologies. A prototype system was constructed. The prototype was shown to serve as a suitable benchmarking platform for the deployment of various grasp synthesis methodologies. 4000 trials were conducted to evaluate the differing approaches. Results showed that the proposed metrics provide useful insights into the quality of grasp poses produced by a grasp synthesis methodology. Moreover, such metrics provide more comprehensive insights into grasp outcome than traditional methods used to quantify performance of a methodology and present a fair baseline for comparison between different approaches.},

In this arrangement, every motor has its own independent tilting command angle. By using this novel approach, the aircraft enhances its yawing capability and increases one more actuation domain: forward/backward velocity. However, this approach generates a control allocation matrix with non-unique solutions, breaking the effectiveness matrix into two parts. The first one is created considering the yawing torque and forward/backward velocity, and the second one considers all aircraft dynamics, running iteratively until the convergence criteria are reached. The results showed a well designed UAV where the FCA convergence and robustness was visible, allowing reliable and safe flight conditions with low computational effort control boards.},

This paper is focused on conflict management for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles in the context of the U-space under 4D trajectory based operations (4D-TBO). A novel method for multi-UAV conflict management at tactical level for large-scale scenarios is presented. The integration of 4D-TBO in this context has been implemented with a four dimensional trajectory follower based on the carrot chasing algorithm. This method minimizes, through the whole flight, the mean normal distance to the defined trajectory and the mean difference with respect to the defined arrival times. Finally, the integrated system has been implemented in a software in the loop environment with a commercial autopilot. The simulation results show better performance with respect to other classical approaches.},

Almost all of the solutions about excavator automation have used the electric valve controller and pressure sensor through the mechanical modifications since they are essential. However, some problems might occur because of unpredictable cost and time consumption in modifying the hydraulic drive and mechanical system. In contrast, this paper proposes a completely novel approach for regulation control of any typical hydraulic excavator by excluding those devices which is related to hydraulic drive system. This method controls the lever displacements physically by using the detachable devices and embedded system for avoiding an any modifications and complex computation. Applying the time delay control (TDC) method, this paper demonstrates the globally stable of regulation control of an excavator in the joint space even though states about the hydraulic systems and body dynamics are not observed. It is expected that this method could help the user to safe respond to requirements in emergencies through the rapid robotization without modifications.},

Moreover, the current local terrain is identified by the visual perception system. Then the wheel-legged hybrid gait types and parameters are selected according to the terrain detection. The gait topology matrix and gait planning matrix are generated for each leg controller to realize the wheel-legged hybrid obstacle-avoidance. In addition, a feedback controller combined with the posture sensor and foot-end force sensor is utilized to maintain the robot body.

  abstract     = {Ground reaction force (GRF) plays an integral role in legged robots to control interaction with the ground. However, most techniques in whole-body controller for quadrupedal robots do not explicitly take into account actual torque or force in their control loops and instead use feed-forward force to generate joint torque at every time step. In this paper, we present a closed-loop whole-body controller using the actual joint torque feedback, which regulates angular momentum of the center of mass (CoM) for quadrupedal locomotion. Using the torque measured from each torque sensor and the torque by solving the inverse dynamics, we can compute the external joint torque induced by the contact with the ground. To fully use the computed joint torque, we discuss a feasible approach and whole-body control criterion for quadrupedal robots that have constrained support polygons because of their point-feet and certain gaits using two or less legs in contact. Based on the approach, we generate a centroidal moment pivot trajectory considering the leg dynamics, linear translation, and angular rotation of the CoM, which can stabilize the robot‘s balance by using the actual angular momentum rate change transformed from the measured joint torque. In addition, a push recovery strategy based on capture point dynamics derived from linear momentum and a foothold generation method are integrated into the controller. The proposed controller is tested on a quadrupedal robot, called AiDIN-VI, that has a torque sensor at each joint. The proposed whole-body controller enables the robot to demonstrate several gait types such as trotting, pacing, jumping, and walking on various environments, and locomotive abilities under external pushes are verified.},

The resulting Vortex Actuation (VA) system is estimated through a switching Autoregressive-Moving-Average with eXternal input (ARMAX) identification, for accurately capturing the throttle to adhesion force relationship throughout its operating range. For safe attachment of the robot on a surface, the critical adhesion is modeled based on the geometrical properties of the robotic platform for providing the required reference forces. Within this work, an explicit controller via the use of a Constraint Finite Time Optimal Control (CFTOC) approach is designed in an offline manner, which results in a lookup table realization that ensures overall system stability in all state transitions. In an effort to further improve the tracking response for arbitrary setup orientations, the adhesion control scheme is extended through a switching EMPC framework. The resulting frameworks are tested through both dynamic simulation and experimental sequences involving: a) adhesion control on a rotating test curved surface and, b) adhesion and locomotion sequences on a water pipe.},

  abstract     = {Visual scene recognition is an indispensable part of automatic localization and navigation. In the same scene, the appearance and viewpoint may be changed greatly, which is the largest challenge for some advanced unmanned systems,e.g. robot,vehicle and UAV,etc., to identify scenes where they have visited. Traditional methods have been subjected to hand-made feature-based paradigms for a long time, mainly relying on the prior knowledge of the designer, and are not sufficiently robust to extreme changing scenes. In this paper, we cope with scene recognition with automatically learning the representation of features from big image samples. Firstly, we propose a novel approach for scene recognition via training a slight-weight convolutional neural network (CNN) that overall has less complex and more efficient network architecture, and is trainable in the manner of end-to-end. The proposed approach uses the deep-leaning features of self-selection combining with light CNN process to perform high semantic understanding of visual scenes. Secondly, we propose to employ a salient region-based technology to extract the local feature representation of a specific scene region directly from the convolution layer based on self-selection mechanism, and each layer performs a linear operation with end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we also utilize probability statistics to calculate the total similarity of several regions in one scene to other regions, and finally rank the similarity scores to select the correct scene. We have conducted a lot of experiments to evaluate the results of performance by comparing four methods (namely, our proposed and other three well known and advanced methods). Experimental results show that the proposed method is more robust and accurate than other three well-known methods in extremely harsh environments (e. g. weak light and strong blur).},

  abstract     = {Transformable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are increasingly attracting attention in recent years due to their maneuverability, agility and morphological capacities. They have overcame many limitations such as, multi-tasks problem, structural adaptation in flight, energy consumption, fault tolerant control, and maneuverability. Nevertheless, their variable geometries as well as the great number of actuators make them highly nonlinear and over-actuated systems, which are characterized by a slow transformation mechanism, variable mathematical models, and complex design and control architectures. In this article, we propose a simple and lightweight design of a transformable quadrotor, which allows to increase the geometric adaptability in flight, maneuverability, and speed of the transformation process by exploiting fast and performant servomotors. Since the Center of Gravity (CoG) of the quadrotor varies according to the desired shape, it results in a variation of the inertia and the control matrix instantly. These parameters play a crucial role in the system control and its stability, which is substantially a key difference compared to the classic quadrotor. Thus, a new generic model will be developed, which takes into account all these variations together and the asymmetry of the configurations. To validate the developed model, ensure the stability of our quadrotor, and improve the performance of the linear control strategies applied to these new drones, an optimal gain scheduling backstepping controller based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm will be designed and tested. The realized prototype will be presented at the end of this work.},

In order to make a robot to arrive at a target in an environment, both networks have 10 laser range findings, the previous linear and angular velocity, and relative position and angle of the mobile robot to the target are used as the network inputs. As outputs, the networks have the linear and angular velocity of the mobile robot. The reward function created was designed in a way to only give a positive reward to the agent when it gets to the target and a negative reward when colliding with any object. The proposed architecture was applied successfully in two simulated environments, and a comparison between the two referred techniques was made using the results obtained as a basis and it was demonstrated that the SAC algorithm has a superior performance for the navigation of mobile robots than the DDPG algorithm (Code available at https://github.com/dranaju/project ).},

  abstract     = {Incidents of hydraulic or oil spills in the oceans/seas or ports occur with some regularity during the exploitation, production and transportation of petroleum products. Immediate, safe, effective and environmentally friendly measures must be adopted to reduce the impact of the oil spill on marine life. Due to the difficulty to detect and clean these areas, semi-autonomous vehicles can make a significant contribution by implementing a cooperative and coordinated response. The paper proposes a concept study of Hybrid Monitoring Detection and Cleaning System (HMDCS-UV) for a maritime region using semi-autonomous unmanned vehicles. This system is based on a cooperative decision architecture for an unmanned aerial vehicle to monitor and detect dirty zones (i.e., hydraulic spills), and clean them up using a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles. The proposed solutions were implemented in a real cloud and were evaluated using different simulation scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed HMDCS-UV can detect and reduce the level of hydraulic pollution in maritime regions with a significant gain in terms of energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Drivable area detection is one of the essential functions of autonomous vehicles. However, due to the complexity and diversity of unknown environments, it remains a challenge specifically on rough roads. In this paper, we propose a systematical framework for drivable area detection, including ground segmentation and road labelling. For each scan, the point cloud is projected onto two different planes simultaneously, generating an elevation map and a range map. Different from the existing methods based on mathematical models, we accomplish the ground segmentation using image processing methods. Subsequently, road points will be filtered out from ground points and used to generate the road area with the assistance of a range map. Meanwhile, a two-step search method is utilized to create the reachable area from an elevation map. For the robustness of drivable area detection, Bayesian decision theory is introduced in the final step to fuse the road area and the reachable area. Since we explicitly avoid complex three-dimensional computation, our method, from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, has a high real-time capability, and experimental results also show it has promising detection performance in various traffic situations.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few decades, the appearance of robot applications has been continuously increasing in rehabilitation treatment due to the increasing numbers of stroke patients. In this paper, a novel fractional-order active fault-tolerant controller (FOAFTC) based on an adaptive nonlinear observer is proposed to detect, estimate, and compensate faults of a knee joint orthosis. The controlling term is derived based on the fractional-order sliding mode control (FOSMC) approach, while the switching term of this controller is designed by the fractional-order interval type-2 fuzzy logic control (IT2FLC) technique. In this regard, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is combined with this controller to estimate the muscular torque inserted by the patient, while increasing the accuracy and speed of the system performance. Adopting the Lagrange equations, a unique model is presented for the orthosis and the human lower-limb. The proposed strategy reduces modeling difficulties and the chattering phenomenon of the SMC technique. Additionally, the number of rules in the fuzzy controller is decreased as well. Following on, the closed-loop system stability is proved theoretically. Finally, the system performance based on the suggested controller is evaluated and compared with the results of two other different controllers including the conventional SMC and the fractional-order terminal sliding mode controller. Implying the proposed controller to the system leads to the smaller frequency and magnitude of the chattering effects, which provides more convenience for patients. Moreover, the efficiency of the suggested controller is illustrated in the presence of both actuator and sensor faults.},

  abstract     = {Robotic soccer simulation is a challenging area, where the development of new techniques is paramount to remain competitive. Robotic skill evolution has accelerated with recent developments in deep learning algorithms, leading to improvements in behavior number and complexity. Shooting a ball towards a defined target is one of the most basic yet indispensable skills in soccer. However, fast and accurate kicks pose several challenges. In order to reach that target, the skill is highly dependent on the ability of the agent to self-locate and self-orient, in order to better position itself before the kick. To tackle these issues, a 6D localization technique was devised. To optimize the kick behavior, two scenarios were proposed. In the first, the robot walks to the ball, stops, and then kicks. In the second, it kicks the ball while moving. We used state-of-the-art algorithms — Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor Critic — to solve these complex problems and show their applicability in the context of RoboCup. Obtained results have shown very significant improvements over previously used behaviors by FC Portugal 3D team. The new kick in motion executes 5 times faster than the previous kick, and the new 6D pose estimator has an average error of just 6.3mm, a reduction of more than 97%.},

  abstract     = {The hexapod robot is one of the important classes in legged robots due to its great potential to operate in complex settings with high stability and flexibility. However, few researches have investigated the navigation and autonomous locomotion of this type of robot. This paper concerns with the behavior-based control and navigation of an autonomous hexapod robot utilizing a hybrid automaton. Switching between the distinct behaviors is based on the sensory data, and no representation of the environment is included. Since these systems are likely to rise chattering phenomenon, a sliding mode including clockwise and counter-clockwise boundary following behaviors are considered between the goal attraction and obstacle avoidance modes to modify the automaton. The hybrid automaton undertakes the path planning of a reference point instead of the robot. Thus, in order to be able to implement the navigation algorithm, the hexapod robot is converted to a point mass robot within two transformations. A parameter study is also performed to investigate the effects of the controllers’ design parameters on the performance of the navigation algorithm and robot. The results show that enhancing the smoothness of the robot’s motion would deteriorate the precision in tracking the reference point and the reaction speed and vice versa. Moreover, simulation tests confirm the effectiveness of the navigation algorithm in generating the optimal path by perfectly switching between distinct modes as well as the capability of the robot to follow the reference point with an arbitrary gait. Furthermore, comparing the performance of the presented navigation strategy to that of similar algorithms, such as Bug and Potential field, yields a satisfying result.},

The proposed STADAA is developed by modifying an algorithm (i.e., the Task Oriented Distributed Assignment Algorithm (TODAA)) we previously developed based on the Hungarian algorithm. The STADAA employs a conflict-resolution mechanism that utilizes a slack variable, sequentially adding new admissible tasks to an admissible task list when there exists conflict in an assignment. The STADAA aims to minimize the resulting cost of the task assignments. We compare the STADAA with the Consensus-Based Auction Algorithm (CBAA), the Distributed Hungarian Based Algorithm (DHBA), and the TODAA in terms of the computational time, optimality, the number of steps to converge, and algorithmic complexity. The results show that the STADAA outperforms the CBAA and the TODAA in optimality and outperforms the DHBA in computational time.},

  abstract     = {Behavior Trees (BTs) have received increasing popularity in the robotics community, serving as an efficient way of modeling robot behavior and structuring behavior interactions. Utilizing automated planning with BT task-level robot control has been proven efficiently reactive to environment dynamics, allowing iterative expansion of BT action nodes while executing the tree. However, existing BT-based planning approaches plan the new actions under the assumption of a fully observable environment model, which shows limitations when the robot has only partial observations on the environment states. In a partially observable domain, an expected robotic plan is an interleaved and adjoint sequence of robot acting and sensing actions. Each acting action is decided upon new observations received by a sensing action. It remains a challenge to efficiently obtain the partially observable states by interacting between robot sensing and acting actions. This paper first proposes a novel Adjoint Sensing and Acting (ASA) model that explicitly abstracts robot actions and specifies an adjoint interaction scheme between them to tackle this challenge. Then, we extend the classical formulation of BTs to represent and realize the ASA model, which proposes a new atomic ASA-BT structure for representing the partially observable environment states and modeling ASA action components. Finally, we cast the problem of planning adjoint acting and sensing actions as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which plans out an efficient ASA-based plan. By comparing with the classical BT approach, we experimentally demonstrate that plans from ASA-BT based planning approach can efficiently obtain the partially observable states with fewer time costs.},

Despite being a well-studied problem, very few works deal with the increased complexity when a very large number of robots is used, as is the case in robotic swarms. In this paper, we propose a methodology to perform cooperative localization in robotic swarms while they navigate through the environment. A collective motion strategy maintains the group’s cohesion, which allows each robot to perform the localization using information from its immediate neighbors. The method is based on the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm, which is employed to perform the localization in a decentralized way. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios show the feasibility of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it overcomes and has a reduced space usage and time complexity compared to a traditional centralized EKF-based method. We also investigate how the methodology can be used by a robotic swarm to build occupancy grid maps, a task that generally requires more sophisticated robots and is heavily dependent on good localization estimates.},

This refers to issues in the area of cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. UASs, under the international, regional, and national regime of aviation law, are considered aircraft. Since there is no existing cybersecurity framework specific to the UASs, the civil aviation cybersecurity framework should apply to their operations. This paper will focus on the potential cyber threats against UASs, providing examples of cyber-attacks from the past. Further, the aviation cybersecurity framework’s overview will follow to determine the current status of maturity at the international, regional (the European Union), and national (the Republic of Poland) levels.

In this fashion, robotics is an important resource that can be used towards helping to solve these issues, empowering our students in order to push their learning up.

Actually, these paradigms define the way that Educational Robotics is implemented in schools. Most of the approaches have implemented it as the main focus, which is teaching Robotics. Nevertheless, there are quite a few works that implement robotics as a secondary focus, which is currently assisting the learning process in several disciplines. The main contribution of this work is a complete three steps methodology for Robotics in Education to guide projects in order to either use it alone or to teach robotics with others topics. Our experiments show the importance of devising a study plan and evaluation method because the process is iterative and could improve the final results. As a novelty, here we have joined and extended our previous works by proposing a new set of methods with guidelines and strategies for applying the educational robotics standard curriculum for kids, named EDUROSC-Kids. We propose several tools that have been developed to organize the learning topics of Robotics for children, including the desired outcomes during the learning process. As said our current approach is divided in three steps (or phases): setting up the environment, defining the project, and performing evaluation. The proposed curriculum organizes robotics contents into five disciplines: Robotics and Society, Mechanics, Electronics, Programming, and Control Theory. Also, it considers a set of topics for each discipline and defines the level of knowledge that is recommended to achieve each group of children based on Bloom’s Nomenclature. The contribution on this paper is a crucial step towards linking the general learning process with Educational Robotics approaches. Our methodology is validated by presenting practical experiences with application of EDUROSC-kids and the proposed method with a rubric guidelines into groups of children.},

  abstract     = {The parallel robots exhibit some outstanding properties on the repeatability, stiffness and force-to-weight ratio compared with serial robots. 6-DOF parallel robots have been utilized in various applications and the research on control design has attracted the attentions of researchers. However, the current Cartesian space path tracking performance of the parallel robots cannot meet the growing requirements from industry. In this paper, a dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC) scheme combined with the position-based visual servoing (PBVS) method is proposed to improve the tracking performance of the 6-Revolute-Spherical-Spherical (6-RSS) parallel robot based on the measurements from the optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) sensor. By employing the CMM sensor, the pose of the parallel robot in Cartesian space can be estimated and incorporated in a closed-loop visual servoing control scheme in real time. The stability of the proposed DSMC has been proved by using Lyapunov theorem. The real-time experiment tests on a 6-RSS parallel robot demonstrate that the complex 6-dimension trajectory tracking can be achieved with high-accuracy. Compared with the classical kinematic level controllers, the proposed DSMC exhibits the superiority in terms of tracking performance and robustness.},

Conventional sensors such as optical microscopes and fluorometers often require complex sample preparation, are restricted to small sample volumes, and are unable to simultaneously capture all pertinent details of a sample such as particle size, shape, concentration, and three-dimensional motion. This paper proposes a novel and cost-effective robotic system for mobile microscopic analysis of particles in situ at various depths which are fully controlled by the robot system itself.

For the sake of the communication delays, a synchronization / signal reconstruction algorithm, imposing constant delays, is applied and the design goal is satisfied by introducing a stepwise safe switching procedure for time delay dynamic controllers. The proposed controllers are designed to satisfy I/O decoupling, stability and atmospheric disturbance attenuation. The controllers are determined via a mixed analytic and metaheuristic design procedure. To increase the range of the external commands, the stepwise safe switching algorithm is based on the approximate minimization of a composite criterion including the infinity norm and the H2 norm of the variations around trim points under hard constraints for the steady state performance and the overshoot of the performance variables. The satisfactory performance of the proposed control scheme is illustrated through simulations for a climbing maneuver passing through different target operating areas.},

Moreover, a heuristic compensation is enhanced to the step location for quadruped trotting locomotion, increasing the anti-disturbance ability of legged locomotion.

This flexibility is even more important in human-robot collaboration since unforeseen events can occur anytime. Such ability can be described as mobility, which is composed of two characteristics. First, the ability to manipulate, and second, the distance to joint limits. This mobility needs to be optimized while generating collision-free motions so that there is always the flexibility of the robot to evade dynamic obstacles in the future execution of generated paths. For this purpose, we present a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), which applies additional costs and sampling methods to increase mobility. Additionally, we present two methods for the optimization of a generated path. Our first approach utilizes the built-in capabilities of the RRT*. The second method optimize the path with the stochastic trajectory optimization for motion planning (STOMP) approach with Gaussian Mixture Models. Moreover, we evaluate the algorithms in complex simulation and real environments and demonstrate an enhancement of mobility.},

To do this, a word to teach in sign language, repetition, speed, and emotional valence were chosen to be adaptive using a fuzzy logic mechanism. Then, two groups of participants were recruited. For the first group, the robot teaches without the adaptive architecture, while for the second group, the teaching is done with the adaptive architecture. The assessment phase was conducted with 8 users in person and 48 users virtually. A standard UTAUT questionnaire was selected to assess the effectiveness of this methodology by comparing different items from the two groups of users. Statistical analysis of the T-test and Cohen’s d effect size found that the second group felt the robot’s adaptability significantly more than the first group, indicating that the methodology used in this study was effective and that the robot’s ability to adapt was felt by users. In addition, the results of the two groups were significantly different in several other items, revealing the effects of the adaptive architecture.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an event-Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the task allocation problem in a Robotic Sensor Network (RSN). A fleet of two types of vehicles is considered, giving, as a result, a heterogeneous configuration of the network, since each type of vehicle has a nominal velocity and a set of allowed paths to go. The algorithm can be applied to the distributed estimation of the solar irradiance on a parabolic trough thermosolar power plant which can be used to increase the global efficiency of the plant. A simulation environment has been built to test the proposed algorithm, taking into account the behavior of the vehicles and the structure of the solar plant. The algorithm has been compared with traditional methods such as the Optimal Assignment Problem (OAP) using a set of indexes that have been defined to this purpose.},

  abstract     = {In the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), quadrotors are receiving considerable attention because of their potential application to industries such as transportation, inspection, and search and rescue. One of the key challenges is to robustly control the position and attitude of a UAV amid the mass and inertia uncertainties, as well as the external disturbances, that exist in the real environment. To meet these demands, this paper proposes a non-cascade adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) strategy for quadrotor trajectory tracking control. To represent real flight conditions, system dynamics are developed with unknown mass and moment of inertia while external disturbances are taken into account. Numerical simulation and indoor flight experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive SMC strategy. In the indoor experiments, to illustrate robustness several experiments are carried out to compare the proposed design with the conventional cascade structure controller: (1) inherent inertia uncertainty, (2) mass uncertainties plus (1), and (3) external disturbance plus (2).},

Improper functioning of this organ due to neurological disorders or surgeries can greatly affect the daily activities performed by patients. This paper aims to comprehensively review soft and rigid wearable robotic devices provided for rehabilitation and assistance focusing on the shoulder joint. In the last two decades, many devices have been proposed in this regard, however, there have been a few groups whose devices have had effective therapeutic capability with acceptable clinical evidence. Also, there were not many portable, lightweight and user-friendly devices. Therefore, this comprehensive study could pave the way for achieving optimal future devices, given the growing need for these devices. According to the results, the most commonly used plan was Exoskeleton, the most commonly used actuators were electrical, and most devices were considered to be stationary and rigid. By doing these studies, the advantages and disadvantages of each method are also presented. The presented devices each have a new idea and attitude in a specific field to solve the problems of movement disorders and rehabilitation, which were in the form of prototypes, initial clinical studies and sometimes comprehensive clinical and commercial studies. These plans need more comprehensive clinical trials to become a complete and efficient plan. This article could be used by researchers to identify and evaluate the important features and strengths and weaknesses of the plans to lead to the presentation of more optimal plans in the future.},

The proposed model has no explicit communication between the robots but it is verified that local measurements received from the payload’s motion data can be used as implicit information to drive the robot. A leader robot (manually controlled) guides the follower robot (fully autonomous) with load clamped on both robots. The follower robot computes a coordinated obstacle-avoidance motion based on the input variables received from its sensors. Due to the defined need to navigate narrow pathways quickly and easily, the current study approach advocates the deployment of Mecanum-Wheeled Robots (MewBots). The kinematic simulations clearly depict their capability to translate in any direction without changing their orientation. Using this information, an experimental model is prepared by deploying a strategy devised to perform a collaborative manipulation in four environmental cases.},

Based on the newly developed intelligent underground heavy-load robot which is still a gap to fill in current coal mine machinery, this paper proposes a new dynamic cooperative optimization control algorithm. Firstly, the complex and strongly coupled Multi-disciplinary Design Optimization system of the robot is decoupled into horizontal/vertical motion space with the idea of hierarchical target transmission, in order to weaken the strong coupling relationship between each hydraulic loop. Then, the spatial posture coefficient is introduced into main/auxiliary feedback control loop in horizontal/vertical motion space, to realize optimal collaborative control of each hydraulic loop under the premise of weak coupling between each control loop, so as to obtain the precise dynamic control signals of each hydraulic loop, and finally realize the optimal control of overall system for the robot. Lastly, the experiment and simulation verify that the DCO control algorithm presented in this paper can obtain better control results: The executive efficiency of the overall system is improved by 14.2%; The control flow is saved by 9.98%, and the executive precision meets the engineering and technical requirements. This paper provides a new efficient method and idea for the control system of intelligent underground heavy-load robots. Furthermore, the algorithm has reference value on development and design of high precise control system for the same kind of complex intelligent engineering machinery products.},

  abstract     = {Enabling fully autonomous robots capable of navigating and exploring large-scale, unknown and complex environments has been at the core of robotics research for several decades. A key requirement in autonomous exploration is building accurate and consistent maps that can be used for reliable navigation. In this paper, we present a degeneracy-aware and drift-resilient loop closing method to improve place recognition and resolve 3D location ambiguities for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in large-scale GPS-denied and perceptually-degraded environments such as lava tubes, caves, and mines, where current methods have inadequate performance. The first contribution of this paper is a degeneracy-aware lidar-based SLAM front-end to determine the level of geometric degeneracy in an unknown environment. Using this crucial capability, unobservable areas in the environment are determined and excluded from the search for loop closures to avoid spurious loop closures that can lead to distortions of the map. The second contribution of this paper is a drift-resilient loop closing pipeline that exploits the salient 2D and 3D features extracted from lidar point cloud data to enable a robust multi-stage loop closing capability. A key advantage of proposed method is that it is pose-invariant, and thus, it is unaffected by drift and accumulation of errors in the estimated robot trajectory. We present extensive evaluation and analysis of performance and robustness, and provide comparison of localization and mapping results with the state-of-the-art methods in a variety of extreme and perceptually-degraded underground mines across the United States.},

  abstract     = {The use of multirotor drones for industrial applications is accelerating, and fuel cell based propulsion systems are highlighted as a promising approach to improve endurance – one of the current main limitations. Due to multirotor drones’ unique requirements, careful system design is needed to maximize the performance advantage. In this work a sensitivity analysis that quantifies the impact of central system parameters for an X8 multirotor drone with a 2 kW fuel cell hybrid system is presented and discussed. Thrust stand measurements identified a 20–30% efficiency loss from the coaxial configuration, and a ‘single’ configuration can reduce power consumption by 700 W at 25 kg take-off mass. Thus, a smaller fuel cell system can be used, giving an additional 1 kg mass saving and 75–140 W power reduction. Peak endurance is found at a 0.67 energy system weight fraction, and if batteries are improved from 180 Wh/kg to 350 Wh/kg, the energy system mass threshold from where fuel cells are superior rises from 7.4 kg to 8.5 kg. At 700 bar, a 3 L hydrogen cylinder can replace a 6 L at 300 bar, provide a 72-min endurance, and is the preferred option to reach minimum system volume. This work provides guidance in early conceptual stages and insights on how fuel cell based powerplants for multirotors can be improved and optimized to increase their value proposition. Further research can expand the work to cover other system variations and do experimental testing of system performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a learning framework for Educational Robotics named sBotics, which includes a complete environment for teaching and programming skills acquisition designed for both teachers and K-12 students. Our framework has been developed using a gamified approach with the system and simulated environment developed in the Unity game engine. The main novelty of this platform is its ease-of-use combined with the flexibility to create a variety of scenarios with endless learning potential, in contrast to our evaluations where no alternatives with such characteristics were found for the K-12 range that we are targeting. Also as a contribution of our proposal, robot programs are treated as games that are affected by a disturbance model, which acts in the robotic system and environment variables. This model is introduced in order to approximate what happens in a real robot programming platform. Besides, it is possible for the user, throughout its use, to code in three levels of abstraction: its overly intuitive native programming language called R-Educ, BlockEduc (R-Educ version of Blockly), and C#. Programs can be compiled and interpreted by virtual robots executing any given command. As for teachers, the framework API offers tools that can be employed in the assembly and customization of the learning setup. The whole platform has been built as a tool dedicated to spreading the worlds of Robotics and Programming among youngsters, as well as making them more affordable to everyone. It has been validated by our experiments and is currently being used during the novel Coronavirus pandemic by the official RoboCupJunior Rescue trials in Brazil, currently with more than a thousand competing teams (about 5 thousands students).},

The operator is able to switch among tasks at any time without compromising the stability of the system. To enforce the passivity of the communication channel as well as to dissipate the energy generated by the null-space projectors used to enforce the hierarchy among the tasks, the Time-Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) is applied.

Because solving the optimization model is computationally challenging, a Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristic algorithm is developed to reduce the computational time. The proposed SA features a fast initial solution generation based on the Petal algorithm, a binary integer programming model for path selection, and a local neigh- borhood search algorithm to find better solutions. Numerical results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the well-known Makespan problem in reducing the ELOD by 23.6% on a test case. Several case studies are conducted to illustrate the impact of the failure distribution function on the optimal flight schedules. Furthermore, the proposed approach was able to obtain the exact solutions for the test cases studied in this paper. Numerical results also showed the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in reducing the computational time by 44.35%, on average, compared with the exact algorithm.},

This work presents a novel model predictive path-following control formulation for nonlinear systems with constraints, extended with an obstacle avoidance strategy. The method proposed in this work simultaneously provides an optimizing solution for both, path-following and obstacle avoidance tasks in a single optimization problem, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The main idea consists in extending the existing NMPC controllers by the introduction of an additional auxiliary trajectory that maintains the feasibility of the successive optimization problems even when the reference curve is unfeasible, possibly discontinuous, relaxing assumptions required in previous works. The obstacle avoidance is fulfilled by introducing additional terms in the value functional, rather than imposing state space constraints, with the aim of maintaining the convexity of the state and output spaces. Simulations results considering an autonomous vehicle subject to input and state constraints are carried out to illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.},

Many research studies have addressed the energy issue, developed energy-aware motion control or integrated energy in mission objectives. However, few studies have comprehensively assessed the impact of software and hardware choices on power consumption of robots. Based on experimental analysis and according to the selected control scheme and hardware configuration, this paper proposes energy consumption models for the Pioneer 3DX. The proposed models highlight the existence of an optimal velocity that minimizes motion energy. These models are experimentally evaluated and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Place recognition is an essential task in many robotics applications. Recognizing if the robot is crossing an already visited place may be used to improve its localization and map estimation. A place recognition strategy must be as accurate as possible, despite the challenges related to environment dynamicity. It should avoid generating false positives since even a few erroneous matches may be enough to cause the degradation of the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) process. We propose a novel approach for place recognition inspired by interval analysis theory. Our approach models the known world as a set of intervals based on the robot’s observations. The search to determine whether the current robot location is new or known begins as the robot explores its surroundings. Our approach has three main steps. First, it selects a set of nearest neighbors based on the similarity between the current robot observation and the intervals composing the known world. In the second step, our approach uses temporal constraints to select one element of the set. And finally, the third step is to sweep the selected interval looking for the query best match. We evaluate our proposal by dealing with visual place recognition using only image information and demonstrate its effectiveness using some challenging public datasets.},

Although this work considers the use of common low-cost sensors and the use of markers with simple geometry, the results show excellent performance of the developed filter, being able to estimate the pose and orientation with an error below 8.14 mm and 0.63o̱, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the approach has also been evaluated, showing that the filter is able to converge quickly when the markers are retrieved after a loss of camera data for a short period of time.},

To do so, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture is developed to perform crowd detection and counting using fewer computer resources without a significant loss on accuracy. The architecture was trained using the Bayes loss function to improve its accuracy and then pruned to further reduce the computational resources used. The proposed architecture was tested over the USF-QNRF dataset, achieving good accuracy while maintaining a competitive number of parameters, around 0.067 Million, which is suitable for real-time embedded applications. The developed lightweight model is then used to obtain the density map of the crowd in real-time, which is employed to determine the largest circular region without persons by means of the polylabel algorithm. Real-time experiments validate the proposed strategy implemented in a low-cost mobile phone application and a commercial drone.},

We propose a unique multi-frame localization paradigm for estimating the states of a UAV in various frames of reference using multiple sensors simultaneously. The system enables complex missions in GNSS and GNSS-denied environments, including outdoor-indoor transitions and the execution of redundant estimators for backing up unreliable localization sources. Two feedback control designs are presented: one for precise and aggressive maneuvers, and the other for stable and smooth flight with a noisy state estimate. The proposed control and estimation pipeline are constructed without using the Euler/Tait-Bryan angle representation of orientation in 3D. Instead, we rely on rotation matrices and a novel heading-based convention to represent the one free rotational degree-of-freedom in 3D of a standard multirotor helicopter. We provide an actively maintained and well-documented open-source implementation, including realistic simulation of UAV, sensors, and localization systems. The proposed system is the product of years of applied research on multi-robot systems, aerial swarms, aerial manipulation, motion planning, and remote sensing. All our results have been supported by real-world system deployment that subsequently shaped the system into the form presented here. In addition, the system was utilized during the participation of our team from the Czech Technical University in Prague in the prestigious MBZIRC 2017 and 2020 robotics competitions, and also in the DARPA Subterranean challenge. Each time, our team was able to secure top places among the best competitors from all over the world.},

Each UAV only uses its neighbors’ destination arc distances for coordination, which as a result saves communication bandwidth. The UAVs’ velocity constraints are also satisfied, with the linear velocity converging to the cruise speed under the proposed control law, which is helpful to prolong the flight time.

However, there are only a few studies for a more extensive use in manufacturing processes. In this paper, we contribute to this by automating a complex manufacturing-like process using simulation-based Deep Reinforcement Learning. The setup and workflow presented here are designed to mimic the characteristics of real manufacturing processes and proves that Deep Reinforcement Learning can be applied to physical systems built from industrial drive and control components by transferring policies learned in simulation to the real machine. Aided by domain randomization, training in a virtual environment is crucial due to the benefit of accelerated training speed and the desire for safe Reinforcement Learning. Our key contribution is to demonstrate the applicability of simulation-based Deep Reinforcement Learning in industrial automation technology. We introduce an industrial drive and control system, based on the classic pub game Foosball, from both an engineering and a simulation perspective, describing the strategies applied to increase transfer robustness. Our approach allowed us to train a self-learning agent to independently learn successful control policies for demanding Foosball tasks based on sparse reward signals. The promising results prove that state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms are able to produce models trained in simulation, which can successfully control industrial use cases without using the actual system for training beforehand.},

Air temperature and altitudes directly affect thrust and power coefficients of small scale propeller for UAS applications. Reynolds numbers are usually within the range 10,000 to 100,000 and important aerodynamic effects, such as the laminar separation bubbles, occur with a negative impact on propulsion performance. The development of autonomous UAS platforms to reduce pilot work-load and allow Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations requires experimental data to validate capabilities of these innovative vehicles. High quality data are needed for a deep understanding of limitations and opportunities of UAS under unconventional flight conditions. The primary objective of this article is to present the characterization of a propeller and a quadrotor capabilities in a pressure-climate-controlled chamber. Mechanical and electrical data are measured with a dedicated test setup over a wide range of temperatures and altitudes. Test results are presented in terms of thrust and power coefficient trends. The experimental data shows low Reynolds numbers are responsible for degraded thrust performance. Moreover, details on brushless motor capabilities are also discussed considering different temperature and pressure conditions. The experimental data collected in the test campaign will be leveraged to improve UAS design, propulsion system modelling as well as to provide guidelines for safe UAS operations in extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle map estimation based on efficient semantic segmentation networks is promising for improving the environmental awareness of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). However, existing networks perform poorly in challenging scenes with small obstacles, scenery reflections, boat wakes, and visual ambiguities caused by unfavorable weather conditions. In this paper, we address the small obstacle segmentation problem by learning representations of obstacles at multiple scales. An efficient multistage feature aggregation (MFA) module is proposed, which utilizes fully separable convolutions of different sizes to capture and fuse multiscale context information from different stages of a backbone network. In addition, a novel feature separation (FS) loss function based on Gaussian mixture model is presented, which encourages the MFA module to enforce separation among different semantic features, thereby providing a robust and discriminative representation in various challenging scenes. Building upon the MFA module and the FS loss function, we present a fast multistage feature aggregation and semantic feature separation network (FASNet) for obstacle map estimation of USVs. An extensive evaluation was conducted on a challenging public dataset (MaSTr1325). We validated that various lightweight semantic segmentation models achieved consistent performance improvement when our MFA module and FS loss function were adopted. The evaluation results showed that the proposed FASNet outperformed state-of-the-art lightweight models and achieved 96.71% mIoU and &gt; 1.5% higher obstacle-class IoU than the second-best network, while running over 58 fps.},

This paper proposes the real-time implementation of a Robust Discontinuous Controller Algorithm to achieve trajectory tracking for a 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) robotic manipulator in a fast and accurate form with low chattering on the joint motors even under uncertainty and disturbance conditions. The trajectory design is developed by a fifth-order polynomial which ensures that robotic manipulator reaches the final desired position in a smooth way and enables to specify the endpoint positions, speeds and accelerations for each joint. A Lyapunov analysis is performed to guarantee system stability with the proposed controller algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller algorithm some simulations in Simulink ${}^{{\circledR }}$ environment are presented in comparison with a PD controller which is widely used for control of industrial robotic manipulators. Real time experimental results in a robotic manipulator CRS Catalyst-5 by Thermo Electron ®; are presented to support the simulation results and prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Robust localization is critical for the navigation and control of mobile robots. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) offer different methods for achieving this goal. In some cases however, these methods may not be available or provide high enough accuracy. In such cases, these methods may be augmented or replaced with fiducial marker pose estimation. Fiducial markers can increase the accuracy and robustness of a localization system by providing an easily recognizable feature with embedded fault detection. This paper presents an overview of fiducial markers developed in the recent years and an experimental comparison of the four markers (ARTag, AprilTag, ArUco, and STag) that represent the state-of-the-art and most widely used packages. These markers are evaluated on their accuracy, detection rate and computational cost in several scenarios that include simulated noise from shadows and motion blur. Different marker configurations, including single markers, planar and non-planar bundles and multi-sized marker bundles are also considered in this work.},

  abstract     = {Intuitive interaction is the cornerstone of accurate and effective performance in remote robotic teleoperation. It requires high-fidelity in control actions as well as perception (vision, haptic, and other sensory feedback) of the remote environment. This paper presents Vicarios, a Virtual Reality (VR) based interface with the aim of facilitating intuitive real-time remote teleoperation, while utilizing the inherent benefits of VR, including immersive visualization, freedom of user viewpoint selection, and fluidity of interaction through natural action interfaces. Vicarios aims to enhance the situational awareness, using the concept of viewpoint-independent mapping between the operator and the remote scene, thereby giving the operator better control in the perception-action loop. The article describes the overall system of Vicarios, with its software, hardware, and communication framework. A comparative user study quantifies the impact of the interface and its features, including immersion and instantaneous user viewpoint changes, termed “teleporting”, on users’ performance. The results show that users’ performance with the VR-based interface was either similar to or better than the baseline condition of traditional stereo video feedback, approving the realistic nature of the Vicarios interface. Furthermore, including the teleporting feature in VR significantly improved participants’ performance and their appreciation for it, which was evident in the post-questionnaire results. Vicarios capitalizes on the intuitiveness and flexibility of VR to improve accuracy in remote teleoperation.},

  abstract     = {Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) has attracted a lot of attention lately from the robotics communities due to its vast applications and importance. This paper addresses the problem of V-SLAM with points and lines in particular scenes where there are many lines on an approximately planar ground. All the lines in these particular scenes are treated as 3D lines with four degree-of-freedom (DoF) in most V-SLAM systems with lines. However, lines on ground only have two DoF. The redundant parameters will increase the estimation uncertainty of lines on ground. In order to restrict the lines on ground to the correct solution space, we propose two parameterization methods for it. The first method still treats lines on ground as 3D lines, and then we propose a planar constraint for the representation of 3D lines to loosely constrain the lines to the ground plane. Further, to strictly constrain the lines on ground to the ground plane, the second method treats these lines as 2D lines in a plane, and then we propose the corresponding parameterization method and geometric computation method from initialization to bundle adjustment. After that, to better exploit lines on ground during localization and mapping by using the proposed parameterization methods, we propose the graph optimization-based monocular V-SLAM system with points and lines to deal with lines on ground differently from general 3D lines. Assisted by wheel encoders, the proposed system generates a structural map. We perform experiments on both simulated data and real-world data to demonstrate that the proposed two parameterization methods can better exploit lines on ground than 3D line parameterization method that is used to represent the lines on ground in the state-of-the-art V-SLAM works with lines.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous mobile devices operating in confined environments, such as pipes, underground tunnel systems, and cave networks, face multiple open challenges from the robotics perspective. Those challenges, such as mobility, localization, and mapping in GPS denied scenarios, are receiving particular attention from the academy and industry. One example is the Brazilian mining company Vale S.A., which is employing a robot – EspeleoRobô (SpeleoRobot) – to access restricted and dangerous areas for human workers. The EspeleoRobô is a robot initially designed for natural cave inspection during teleoperated missions. It is now being used to monitor other types of confined environments, such as dam galleries and other restrained or dangerous areas. This paper describes the platform in its current version and the pipeline used for semi-autonomous inspection in confined environments. The pipeline includes photorealistic mapping techniques, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with LiDAR, path planning based on mobility optimization, and navigation control using vector fields to reduce operator dependency of the robot operation. The proposed concept was validated in simulations with a realistic underground tunnel system and in representative real-world scenarios. The results endorse the viability of using the proposed concept for real deployments.},

High accuracy odometry plays a significant role in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and automatic navigation mission. This paper proposes an odometry method based on Camera-Lidar-IMU information fusion and Factor-Graph optimization. It solves the problem of observation of speed and pose transformation in high speed racing scenes with sparse features. Firstly, a YoloV3-tiny object detector is used to identify cone objects captured through camera sensor, which is used to segment the object points from the Lidar pointcloud. Then, the object points are registered by utilizing the inertial measurement unit (IMU) pre-integration result as rough estimation, to obtain increment of pose transformation in horizontal plane. And a Ground Normal Vector Registration method is developed using ground points to solve increment of vertical pose transformation. These two transformation results are coupled to get a real-time odometry. At last, the odometry results and observations are optimized at the back-end with the Factor-Graph algorithm. Experiments show that the method presented in this paper performs well in real environment, and achieves high accuracy and provides a good reference for vehicle SLAM and navigation.},

  abstract     = {Path planning and formation control are two of the most significant concepts which can be considered in multi-vehicle systems and particularly in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The cooperative implementation of complicated commands would lead to desirable results and increase the probability of success in the missions. Due to the nonlinear dynamics and environmental conditions, the cooperative control of AUVs is a challenging topic. The developments in AUV applications demonstrate the significance of research and development in path planning and formation control. Unlike ground or aerial autonomous vehicles, this field of study has not attracted considerable attention and further exploration is required as a result. The present paper reviews the different structures of formation control in AUVs and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Besides formation control, the cooperative path planning of AUVs along with the limitations specific to the cooperative structure is taken into consideration in the present study. Moreover, avoiding any obstacle collision and preventing any encounter between group members are considered as critical issues in the formation control and cooperative path planning. Some areas are still open to investigation as implied by the technological suggestions, which will facilitate future research. At the end of the article, a simulated sample is given of the triangular formation path planning for AUVs.},

  abstract     = {In the aftermath of radiation or chemical accidents, responders must rapidly map out regions of contamination as quickly and accurately as possible. One important and relevant statistical method for this kind of disaster response is spatial kriging, which makes predictions based on incomplete knowledge of spatially referenced observations. Given an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) equipped with radiation sensors, we develop a spatial statistics-based approach to optimally map out a contamination field over a geographic region. In this article, we evaluate three approaches to UAS mapping: a Variance Driven Sampling (VDS) approach that minimizes kriging variance, a more computationally intensive Hybrid Entropy Search (HES), and a baseline Levy Flight search. Considering limited UAS range, we also implement a restricted version of these approaches that only considers nearby points. We find that HES is optimal for small numbers of sampled points with the restricted versions of HES and VDS becoming optimal for larger samples. Ultimately, the best method is dependent on the number of samples to be taken, with each method providing clear benefits over a random search in terms of both mean squared error and path length. We demonstrate the advantages of our methodology using actual radiation field test data from the Idaho National Lab.},

The approximate IK solution is calculated analytically using offset angle method by means of approximation. Secondly, the approximate solution is taken as the initial value of the iterative algorithm and by updating the joint angles through the damped least-square method with augmented Jacobian matrix, the final exact solution is obtained after a few iterations. Three simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm not only has high computational efficiency and accuracy, but also can obtain multiple solutions and show the self-motion characteristics of the 7-DOF robot.

To reduce the time-varying wind disturbance, an improved adaptive path-following guidance law is developed. In this method, the arctangent function is extended to a general form, and the convergence rate is improved by replacing the function. Stability and convergence of the guidance law are shown in the sense of Lyapunov. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed homing strategy reduces the energy consumption when the initial altitude is too high, and the tracking errors convergence faster. Numerical simulation is further conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

A soft device was developed to be tested as a robot’s leg to evaluate the proposed application. A logic controller for this device was designed using the SMER technique. Image processing techniques were used to assess the functionality of the proposed strategy, which demands limited resources. The vision tracking system is composed of a set of infrared-reflective patches, an infrared illuminator, and a pair of cameras with no infrared filters. Results revealed that it is possible to use SMER techniques to activate soft robotics systems and that the methods employed to develop and test the device were appropriate.},

A multi-sensor fusion approach based on the Kalman filter and the covariance intersection algorithm is proposed. Moreover, centralized and distributed architectures are presented and discussed—the breakdown of calculation burdens on each system component is determined. The purpose is to help in the choice of the best fusion architecture for a system composed of several collaborative subsystems, especially systems with a large number of sensors. Finally, the approach is experimentally illustrated in the context of collaborative mobile robotics. A numerical study is provided to illustrate the efficiency of each proposed architecture. Compared to the centralized architecture, the partially distributed architecture showed good stability and low requirements on the communication capacity and computing speed of the system.},

  abstract     = {The main goal in task planning is to build a sequence of actions that takes an agent from an initial state to a goal state. In robotics, this is particularly difficult because actions usually have several possible results, and sensors are prone to produce measurements with error. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are commonly employed, thanks to their ability to model the uncertainty of actions that modify and monitor the state of a system. However, since solving a POMDP is computationally expensive, their usage becomes prohibitive for most robotic applications. In this article, we propose a task planning architecture for service robotics. In the context of service robot design, we present a scheme to encode knowledge about the robot and its environment, that promotes the modularity and reuse of information. Also, we introduce a new recursive definition of a POMDP that enables our architecture to autonomously build a hierarchy of POMDPs, so that it can be used to generate and execute plans that solve the task at hand. Experimental results show that, in comparison to baseline methods, by following a recursive hierarchical approach the architecture is able to significantly reduce the planning time, while maintaining (or even improving) the robustness under several scenarios that vary in uncertainty and size.},

  abstract     = {Conventionally, the arm and the hand are considered separately for robotic manipulation and grasp. The hand configuration and the wrist pose are obtained during grasp planning and afterwards, the arm configuration is found to accommodate the wrist pose. However, without considering the arm during grasp planning, this approach can become very inefficient as significant time and computation power are spent on evaluating and planning grasps that are simply unreachable. This paper presents an efficient method for obtaining a desired configuration of the arm and the hand simultaneously for precision grasping. Our method assumes that contact points and contact normals are given for the desired grasp. Inspired by the human grasp strategy, our approach implements a thumb-first strategy to narrow down the search space and increase the success rate. To precisely fulfill all fingers’ requirements, the inverse kinematics (IK) solution for the position and orientation of each finger are regarded as independent tasks. These tasks are organized in a well-designed hierarchy and the resulting joint movements from each level are combined through nullspace projection with a nullspace enlargement method to ensure the correctness of the results. Comprehensive simulation results will demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of classic IK algorithms.},

  abstract     = {To transition from control theory to real applications, it is important to study missions such as Swarm Search and Service (SSS) where vehicles are not only required to search an area, but also service all jobs that they find. In SSS missions, each type of job requires a group of vehicles to break off from the swarm for a given amount of time to service it. The required number of vehicles and the service rate are unique to each job type. Once a job has been completed, the vehicles are able to return to the swarm for use elsewhere. If not enough vehicles are present in the swarm at the time that the job is identified, that job is dropped without being serviced. In SSS missions that occur in open environments, the arrival rate of jobs varies dynamically as vehicles move in and out of the swarm to service jobs. Human operators are tasked with effectively planning and managing these complex missions. This paper presents a user study that seeks to test the efficacy and ease-of-use of a prediction model known as the Hybrid Model as an aid in planning and monitoring tasks. Results show that the novel computational model aid allows operators to more effectively choose the necessary swarm size to handle expected mission workload, as well as, maintain sufficient situation awareness to evaluate the performance of the swarm during missions.},

Very few works deal with the problem of moving parts in industrial assembly applications. However, having autonomous robots that are able to execute assembly tasks in dynamic environments could lead to more flexible facilities with reduced implementation efforts for individual products. In this paper, we present a general approach towards autonomous robotic assembly that combines visual and intrinsic tactile sensing to continuously track parts within a single Bayesian framework. Based on this, it is possible to implement object-centric assembly skills that are guided by the estimated poses of the parts, including cases where occlusions block the vision system. In particular, we investigate the application of this approach for peg-in-hole assembly. A tilt-and-align strategy is implemented using a Cartesian impedance controller, and combined with an adaptive path executor. Experimental results with multiple part combinations are provided and analyzed in detail.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the problem of mapping terrain features based on inertial and LiDAR measurements to estimate navigation cost, for an autonomous ground robot. The navigation cost quantifies the degree of how easy or difficult it is to navigate through different areas. Unlike most indoor applications, where surfaces are usually human-made, flat, and structured, external environments may be unpredictable as to the types and conditions of the travel surfaces, such as traction characteristics and inclination. Attaining full autonomy in outdoor environments requires a mobile ground robot to perform the fundamental localization and mapping tasks in unfamiliar environments, but with the added challenge of unknown terrain conditions. Autonomous motion in uneven terrain has been widely explored by the research community focusing on one or more of the several factors involved aiming at both safety and efficient displacement. A fuller representation of the environment is fundamental to increase confidence and to reduce navigation costs. To this end we propose a methodology composed of five main steps: (i) speed-invariant inertial transformation; (ii) roughness level classification; (iii) navigation cost estimation; (iv) sensor fusion through Deep Learning; and (v) estimation of navigation costs for untraveled regions. To validate the methodology, we carried out experiments using ground robots in different outdoor environments with different terrain characteristics. Results show that the inertial data transformation reduces the dispersion of signal magnitude for different speeds and scenarios. Meanwhile, the roughness level classification achieved a mean accuracy of 95.4%, for the speed of 0.6 m/s. Finally, the obtained terrain maps are a faithful representation of outdoor environments allowing accurate and reliable path planning.},

In this context, this work proposes a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy formulated on the Special Euclidean group SE(3) for quadrotor trajectory tracking within cluttered environments with unknown obstacles. The approach considers constraints in the states and inputs, with constant disturbance rejection and capable of executing aggressive maneuvers. The UAV attitude is considered as an optimization variable within the control problem thanks to an algebraic ellipsoidal set approach. As a consequence, the collision check takes the UAV attitude into account, allowing aggressive maneuvers. Numerical experiments under realistic conditions allow evaluating the performance of the proposed approach for the UAV. The tested maneuvers are throwing a narrow gap, passing by a nonconvex obstacle gap, avoiding a convex obstacle, and doing slalom movements. In all cases, uncertainties are considered. The achieved results indicate the advantages of executing aggressive maneuvers.},

  abstract     = {The visual-inertial navigation system using a single camera and IMU requires an accurate initialization without increasing the processing cost and complexity for real-time deployment. The processing cost in the existing solutions can be traced to the gyroscopic bias estimation using 1) Closed-form solutions (Martinelli, Int. J. Comput. Vis. 106(2), 138–152, 2014; Kaiser et al., IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett. 2(1), 18–25, 2017 and 2) Loosely coupled schemes using visual-inertial alignment (Mur-Artal and Tardós IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett. 2(2), 796–803 2017); Qin, IEEE Trans. Robot. 34(4), 1004–1020 2018). The complexity arises because of the non-linear nature of the system to estimate the gyro bias, which is solved either by directly solving the non-linear, non-convex problem or by decoupling the vision and IMU measurements using linear models. The termination conditions are based on condition number or covariance of the estimated variables, which varies from one experiment to another. The present paper seeks to improve the closed-form solution with higher accuracy and less processing cost per frame. The proposed method separates the gyroscope bias estimation from the closed-form solution using tightly coupled but linear models with reduced number of variables in the closed-form solution. This paper also addresses the problem inherent to the closed-form solutions, which requires sufficient motion in the initialization window with a minimum number of common features. Towards this, a novel method of propagating the past information into the present initialization window is presented. This reduces the total processing cost per frame by limiting the initialization window to 10 frames ≈ 1s without compromising the motion inside the window. We also present a common and intuitive termination criteria which is independent from the experiment scenario. This helps to increase the robustness in the initialization by removing erroneous solutions. The proposed method is evaluated with EuRoC Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) dataset (Burri et al. 2016) sequences. We compare the proposed method with a recently proposed loosely coupled method, which shows the improved accuracy, processing cost and robustness in the initialization.},

To adapt to these characteristics, in the present study, an active and passive control system for a variable-stiffness knee exoskeleton based on a shape memory alloy (SMA) is developed. To enhance the mobility of the knee exoskeleton, the stiffness adjustment function is realized by SMA wires. To adapt to the long periodicity of application scenarios, the passive control mode is constructed, during which the exoskeleton drives human legs. Moreover, to address the uncertainty of the application scenarios, the active control mode is constructed, during which the exoskeleton follows the human leg movement when the wearer is in an irregular movement state. A gait recognition system is used to switch between the active and the passive control modes. Based on the prototype, a comprehensive experimental verification of the control system was carried out. The experimental results show that the constructed control system can realize the active and passive control function. In addition, the variable-stiffness function of the knee exoskeleton has the effect of reducing the driving error in scenarios with high mobility requirements.},

To estimate the lumped disturbances induced by the external disturbances and actuator faults, sliding-mode disturbance observers are developed by introducing reference systems and sliding-mode differentiators. It is proved that all fixed-wing UAVs can be steered to elliptically monitor the forest fire and the cooperative tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded.

  abstract     = {Twin-rotor two-input two-output (TITO) aerodynamical system (TRAS) is a highly non-linear system with a cross-coupling effect. The objective of the controller design in TRAS is to track the trajectory of azimuth and pitch angles, reach the desired azimuth and pitch angle positions, and stabilize TRAS in the presence of significant cross-coupling. The coupling effect between the main rotor and tail rotor is a severe issue for the controller design. So, this paper proposes a proportional integral derivative double derivative (PIDD2) controller design for TRAS, first time. Further, the tuning of PIDD2 controller is carried out via a modified grey wolf optimizer (MGWO). Besides, the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) implementation of the PIDD2 controller with the TRAS laboratory prototype setup is carried out, first-time. Moreover, It is tested under external disturbances for robustness and effectiveness analyses. In addition, this paper performs both simulations as well as hardware results analyses. These analyses reveal that the experimental results are found to match closely with simulation results. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control design approach is presented by comparing it with the recently published controldesign schemes.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a novel sampling-based path planning approach, simultaneously achieving uncertainty reduction of localization and avoidance of dynamic obstacles. The proposed path planner can generate a set of path primitives and the path selection takes into account the localization uncertainty, the collision-risk, and the cost-to-go to the target area. The weights of these quantities for selecting an optimal path are tuned adaptively by using the entropy weight method. In the process of path primitive generation, we propose an adaptive planning horizon scheme that can generate a longer path with lower localization uncertainty. Particularly, to further reduce the localization uncertainty of the path primitive, we propose a sampling strategy that is capable of biasing the sampling points to the information-rich areas. To reduce the collision-risk, we propose to calculate the probability of collision by taking the uncertainty of both the robot and the dynamic objects into consideration. The proposed approach and its key components are verified in extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. The proposed method is demonstrated to be capable of efficiently guiding the robot to the designated location with lower localization uncertainty and higher success rate in obstacle avoidance.},

Contrarily, aerial images are easier to interpret, but require Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors. Due to absorption phenomena, GPS sensors are unavailable in underwater environments. Thus, we propose a method to translate sonar images acquired underwater to an aerial counterpart. This process is called sonar-to-satellite translation. To perform the conversion, a U-Net based neural network is proposed, enhanced with state-of-the-art techniques, such as dilated convolutions and guided filters. Afterwards, our approach is validated on two datasets containing sonar images and their satellite analogue. Qualitative experimental results indicate that the proposed method can transfer features from acoustic images to aerial images, generating satellite images that are easier to interpret and visualize.},

The algorithms were compared under two different perspectives. In the first analysis, the algorithms were evaluated according to its computational time, path length and path safety in a static environment. Afterwards, they were evaluated regarding the accumulated computational time, number of recalculated paths, total navigation time and number of collisions in a dynamic environment. The static environment results have shown that the DVG+A* has a better overall performance than RRT, except for the path safety, however, some ideas on how to improve this were discussed. In the dynamic environment the algorithms performed similarly and with a high number of collisions during the experiments. Thus, showing the importance of using an obstacle avoidance algorithm combined with the path planner. In conclusion, the results obtained showed that both algorithms aren’t suitable for highly dynamic and cluttered environments, however, due how sparse the obstacles are in the SSL, they can still be used with some care. Regarding static environments, the DVG+A* has shown the best results.},

  abstract     = {A significant ongoing issue in realistic humanoid robotics (RHRs) is inaccurate speech to mouth synchronisation. Even the most advanced robotic systems cannot authentically emulate the natural movements of the human jaw, lips and tongue during verbal communication. These visual and functional irregularities have the potential to propagate the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE) and reduce speech understanding in human-robot interaction (HRI). This paper outlines the development and testing of a novel Computer Aided Design (CAD) robotic mouth prototype with buccinator actuators for emulating the fluidic movements of the human mouth. The robotic mouth system incorporates a custom Machine Learning (ML) application that measures the acoustic qualities of speech synthesis (SS) and translates this data into servomotor triangulation for triggering jaw, lip and tongue positions. The objective of this study is to improve current robotic mouth design and provide engineers with a framework for increasing the authenticity, accuracy and communication capabilities of RHRs for HRI. The primary contributions of this study are the engineering of a robotic mouth prototype and the programming of a speech processing application that achieved a 79.4% syllable accuracy, 86.7% lip synchronisation accuracy and 0.1s speech to mouth articulation differential.},

On the other hand, there is a large decrease in precision and accuracy in extreme misexposure, impulse noise, or signal-dependent noise. Using the proposed framework, we obtain a detailed evaluation of a variety of traditional image distortions, typically found in robotics and automated systems pipelines, provides insights and guidance for further development. We propose a pipeline-based approach to mitigate the adverse effects of image distortions by including an image pre-processing step which intends to estimate the proper exposure and reduce noise artifacts.

  abstract     = {We present a design method for the admittance control of a class of omnidirectional mobile platforms. Holonomic behavior of the platform is accomplished by a steering system that is itself subject to nonholonomic constraints. The proposed application of this type of platform, henceforth the “walker”, is as an assistive device for human gait rehabilitation. Therefore, the control design objectives are to guarantee the stability of the coupled system formed by the robotic platform and the human body, and to maximize mobility for the user by reducing the robot’s apparent inertia. First, we show how feedback linearization of a reduced-order model of the system, combined with a smooth trajectory-tracking control, achieves global asymptotic stability of the tracking error. Then we show how compliance in the robot limits the amount of inertia reduction that can be achieved before instability occurs. We address this problem with a control design method that maximizes the amplitude of the system’s admittance over a useful range of frequencies. Using root locus analysis and sensitivity transfer functions, we find an optimal value for the virtual mass in the admittance model, representing the best tradeoff between two oscillatory modes. The walker’s admittance vs. frequency function is then corrected via a complementary sensor input, namely, the user’s torque on the sagittal plane. A second layer of control provides the walker’s therapeutic action, consisting of a variable horizontal force that aids propulsion of the user’s body. The level of assistive force is modulated with the patient’s gait speed and turning rate to ensure easy adaptation. The control design was validated through an experiment involving human users walking in a prototype of the mobile platform.},

Motivated by the need to create a near real-time object detection system for a soccer team of mobile robots operating with x86 CPU-only embedded computers, this work analyses the average precision and inference time of multiple object detection systems in a constrained hardware setting. We train open implementations of MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models with different underlying architectures, achieved by changing their input and width multipliers, as well as YOLOv3, TinyYOLOv3, YOLOv4 and TinyYOLOv4 in an annotated image dataset captured using a mobile robot. We emphasize the speed/accuracy trade-off in the models by reporting their average precision on a test data set and their inference time in videos at different resolutions, under constrained and unconstrained hardware configurations. Results show that MobileNetV3 models have a good trade-off between average precision and inference time in constrained scenarios only, while MobileNetV2 with high width multipliers are appropriate for server-side inference.

Aerosonde missions are featured by predetermined operating conditions, allowing the design of ad-hoc controllers for each control task by using the future knowledge of the reference signals driving the aircraft during operations. To develop the controller, the nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle has been described by a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model identified from the plant data by using a subspace identification technique. The LPV model is used to design a MPC to drive the UAV. Two different Linear Parameter-Varying MPC (MPCLPV) algorithms have been proposed by introducing the previewing technique in the controller due to the a priori knowledge of full reference signals. In the design of the inner Attitude Controller (AC), a future LPV scheduling parameters estimation policy has been introduced (PF −MPCLPV) for improving the control results of the standard Previewing MPCLPV (P-MPCLPV). Furthermore, an anticipative switching approach (PS −MPCS) has been considered for the altitude External Controller (EC) to improve the control performances of the standard previewing switching MPC (P-MPCS).

The proposed architecture is hybrid in the sense of combining two control policies found in guidance systems: the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) policy and the well-known PID controller. The Dec-POMDP policy part enables every UAV to avoid collision with any other UAV from the formation. The PID part is activated for regions far from the collision risk zone and is implemented in such a way that each UAV is completely controlled by only its own data, independent of its neighbors. The major novelty of the proposed system, compared to other hybrid approaches, is its decentralized nature which favors overcoming the usual problems that come with centralization such as the high dependence on a central decision node, a leader, or a ground station. Inherited from both parts, the overall system performance is robust in noisy and uncertain environments. Simulations were extensively performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed guidance system in distinct scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The full-wing solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) adopts a large aspect ratio wing, a lightweight structural design, and a differential throttle control scheme to maximize flight endurance. Large structural deformation often occurs when the wing is heavily loaded, which affects its flight stability, trajectory tracking accuracy, and flight performance. The traditional rigid-body flight dynamics cannot accurately describe the actual dynamic behavior when the wing is deformed. To fully consider the coupling effect of the structural deformation and the flight motion, we derive a UAV combo model consisting of a flexible wing and rigid fuselage. In the model, we also include strain formulation (s-beam) for structural modeling, finite-state induced flow theory for aerodynamic modeling, static and dynamic combined experiments for engine modeling, and the rigid-body flight dynamic equation. Besides, a model modification method based on flight data is applied to improve the accuracy of the structural parameters. Simulation results show that the wingtip deformation and motion characteristics of the rigid- and combo-system are quite different: the combo model exhibits a certain lag in comparison with the rigid-body, with the amplitude of the motion parameters reduced by 50%, frequency 15%, system kinetic energy 11.8%, and the elevator control efficiency more than 40%.},

  abstract     = {The flight dynamics of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which cannot be ignored in simulation or analysis. In this study, a full nonlinear simulation of the flight dynamics characteristics of a fixed-wing MAV is performed. To strengthen the developed nonlinear mathematical modeling, the MAV’s mass properties and propulsion characteristics are experimentally investigated. Moreover, the aerodynamic characteristics of the designed fixed-wing MAV are experimentally measured in a wind tunnel. The experimental aerodynamics investigation includes the propeller wash effect and the same flight conditions of the MAV. These measured data are fed to the nonlinear flight dynamics model to improve its accuracy and ensure the nonlinear aerodynamics effect on the flight dynamics. The enhanced model is then validated against response experimental measurements of the MAV in the wind tunnel that is free to pitch at different control inputs and initial conditions. Furthermore, it is compared to the response of the system identification model. The nonlinear simulation and dynamic testing investigations indicate many nonlinear phenomena, such as the appearance of the limit cycle in the longitudinal flight. This paper shows that the aerodynamic center of MAV with a low aspect ratio in the low Reynolds number regime of flow can move as a response to flap deflection. The validated nonlinear mathematical model was used to evaluate the MAV’s dynamics, design and evaluate a PID controller in flight conditions similar to the MAV’s actual flying mission. Moreover, the presented model can be used for flapping-wing MAVs using time-dependent experimental measurements.},

  abstract     = {Whenrobots physically interact with the environment, compliant behaviors should be imposed to prevent damages to all entities involved in the interaction. Moreover, during physical interactions, appropriate pose controllers are usually based on the robot dynamics, in which the ill-conditioning of the joint-space inertia matrix may lead to poor performance or even instability. When the control is not precise, large interaction forces may appear due to disturbed end-effector poses, resulting in unsafe interactions. To overcome these problems, we propose a task-space admittance controller in which the inertia matrix conditioning is adapted online. To this end, the control architecture consists of an admittance controller in the outer loop, which changes the reference trajectory to the robot end-effector to achieve a desired compliant behavior; and an adaptive inertia matrix conditioning controller in the inner loop to track this trajectory and improve the closed-loop performance. We evaluated the proposed architecture on a KUKA LWR4+ robot and compared it, via rigorous statistical analyses, to an architecture in which the proposed inner motion controller was replaced by two widely used ones. The admittance controller with adaptive inertia conditioning presents better performance than with a controller based on the inverse dynamics with feedback linearization, and similar results when compared to the PID controller with gravity compensation in the inner loop.},

A two layer solution is devised. In detail, at the top layer an arbitrary virtual dynamics is considered for the object with the virtual input chosen as the solution of an optimal Linear Quadratic Tracking (LQT) problem. In this formulation, both the human and robots’ intentions are taken into account, being the former online estimated by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) technique. The output of this layer is a desired trajectory of the object which is the input of the bottom layer and from which desired trajectories for the robot end effectors are computed based on the closed-chain constraints. Each robot, then, implements a time-varying gain adaptive control law so as to take into account model uncertainty and internal wrenches that inevitably raise due to synchronization errors and dynamic and kinematic uncertainties. Remarkably, the overall solution is devised in a distributed setting by resorting to a leader-follower approach and distributed observers. Simulations with three 6-DOFs serial chain manipulators mounted on mobile platforms corroborate the theoretical findings.},

We propose the capture time and statistical metrics to quantify the swarm performance. The results of experimental implementations are consistent with computational simulations based on the robot kinematics and dynamics.

The control architecture is based on a hierarchical modular structure, consisting of several neural layers and modules. The first layer contains three sensory preprocessing modules which filter sensory noise and generate appropriate descending commands to activate corresponding behaviors through the second and third layers. The second and third layers contain a central pattern generator (CPG) module and CPG postprocessing modules, respectively. The CPG module generates basic rhythmic locomotion patterns, shaped by the CPG postprocessing modules to achieve different gaits (i.e., wave, intermediate, and trot) as well as different climbing directions (i.e., forward and sideways). We use a body inclination sensor to adapt the robot gait while climbing on different slope angles, with infrared sensors to detect an obstacle on its climbing path and activate obstacle avoidance behavior. We successfully tested our control approach on a real tailless gecko robot. As a result, the robot can efficiently climb forward on different slope angles (including 90∘) and automatically adapt its climbing gait accordingly, to maximize climbing speed and ensure stability. It can also avoid an obstacle by changing its climbing direction from forward to sideways.},

  abstract     = {Calibration is a strategy to compensate for the systematic errors of a mobile robot hence, to increase the accuracy of the robot localization. So far, various methodologies have been proposed for the calibration of wheeled robots, but the majority have focused on non-holonomic mobile robots, e.g., differential type, and holonomic ones have been less studied from this point of view. This paper presents an innovative approach for the calibration of a holonomic robot by introducing “Effective Kinematic Parameters” (EKPs). To estimate the EKPs of a holonomic mobile robot, some tests are proposed, and the variables of the inverse Jacobian equations are modified by defining and minimizing an appropriate cost function. In the following, a virtual holonomic robot is modeled with some unknown intentional errors in its parameters, which cause some error in its path tracking. Then, the methodology is applied to estimate its EKPs, and the simulation is fulfilled again. The results show incredible improvement in path tracking. The methodology is applied to a 3-wheeled Omni-directional mobile robot, and some experiments are performed in a laboratory environment to experimentally evaluate the approach. The outcomes approved the algorithm and showed great enhancement in the calibration of the robot compared to the previous researches. The methodology can be employed to calibrate other robotic systems as well.},

Although much works rely on searching for objects based on their colour or 3D context, we argue that text information is a useful and functional visual cue to guide the search. In this paper, we study the problem of active visual search (AVS) in large unknown environments. In this paper, we present an AVS system that relies on semantic information inferred from texts found in the environment, which allows the robot to reduce the search costs by avoiding not promising regions for the target object. Our semantic planner reasons over the numbers detected from door signs to decide either perform a goal-directed exploration towards unknown parts of the environment or carefully search in the already known parts. We compared the performance of our semantic AVS system with two other search systems in four simulated environments. First, we developed a greedy search system that does not consider any semantic information, and second, we invited human participants to teleoperate the robot while performing the search. Our results from simulation and real-world experiments show that text is a promising source of information that provides different semantic cues for AVS systems.},

Flight-testing methods and results are presented demonstrating the capabilities of these algorithms, with results from a unique test-case involving an unintended fault during the record flight. In addition to the vehicle performance assessment, Friis-based models are introduced to provide a pseudo real-time communications link range assessment. The predictive communications range models were refined using specific antenna and system characterization data measured in a compact range facility resulting in a detailed link budget useful for addressing BVLOS command and control requirements. The combination of aircraft and radio-frequency performance prediction models with supporting flight-testing techniques applied to small unmanned aerial systems provides critical insight into the design of future vehicles, and validation of existing systems tasked with performing BVLOS missions.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses a novel approach to evaluate the real-time performance of computing platforms embedded in robotic systems. The motivation behind this work is the need for the robotic systems to meet their timing constraints, thus requiring time predictable real-time systems. We proposed a benchmark, named the Robotstone, which is an adaptation of a traditional real-time performance benchmark widely known in the real-time systems community. Thus, the presented work makes it easier for a robotic engineer to apply the benchmark in the modern robotics context by filtering out issues that do not matter on the robotics applications and adapting the benchmark’s relevant portions. The Robotstone has a set of experiments related to time-constrained application scenarios usually found in robotic systems. Each experiment defines an application-specific parameter that increases at every iteration until the system overloads. The real-time performance is then evaluated through the breakdown point, i.e., the system configuration in the application scenario when any functional or timing constraint is not met. The proposed toolset has been evaluated on two distinct platforms representing a class of embedded computing systems usually employed in robotic systems. Obtained results demonstrate the applicability of the Robotstone benchmark for a quick assessment of computing systems’ real-time performance often required on initial development stages of a robotic system.},

  abstract     = {Visual scene understanding and place recognition are the most challenging problems that mobile robots must solve for to achieve autonomous navigation. To reduce the high computational complexity of many global optimal search strategies, a new two-stage loop closure detection (LCD) strategy is developed in this paper. The front-end sequence node level matching (FSNLM) algorithm is based on the local continuity constraint of the motion process, which avoids the blind search for the global optimal match, and matches the image nodes via a sliding window to accurately find the local optimal matching candidate nodesets. In addition, the back-end image level matching (BILM) algorithm combined with an improved semantic model, DeepLab_AE, uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature detector to extract visual descriptors. It replaces traditional feature detectors that are manually designed by researchers in the computer vision field and cannot be applied to all environments. Finally, the performance of the two-stage LCD algorithm is evaluated on five public datasets, and is compared with the performance of other state-of-the-art algorithms. The evaluation results prove that the proposed method compares favorably with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel contour tracking scheme based on a well-posed kinematic representation of differential-driven nonholonomic mobile robots. Firstly, a fuzzy aggregation of spatial sets in cluttered environments allows designing a velocity field to encode the desired velocity vector pointing to the target (the contour). Thus, the resultant smooth trajectory avoids obstacles by combining spatially distributed velocity fields that enable the robot navigation. Finally, the universal approximation property of fuzzy systems facilitates the design of an adaptive PI-like controller, whose closed-loop stability leads to the precise tracking of the velocity field. The results of the performed numerical simulations illustrate the reliability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Crowd navigation with autonomous systems is a topic which has seen a rapid increase in interest recently. While it appears natural to humans, being able to reach a target can prove difficult or impossible to a mobile robot because of the safety issues related to collisions with people. In this work we propose an approach to control a robot in a crowded environment; the method employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that is trained with the NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) method. Models for the kinematics, perception, and cognition of the robot are presented. In particular, perception is based on a raycasting model which is tailored on the ANN. An in-depth analysis of a number of parameters of the environment and the robot is performed and a comparative analysis is presented; finally, results of the performance of the controller trained with NEAT are compared to those of a human driver who takes over the controller itself. Results show that the intelligent controller is able to perform on par with the human, within the simulated environment.},

This paper focuses on path planning and path tracking of an autonomous shuttle which are its most fundamental autonomous driving functions. Path planning is based on improving efficiency of computation and smoothness of path. Velocity planning is based on obeying speed limits, limiting longitudinal acceleration along straight segments and lateral acceleration during curved segments for improved ride comfort of the passengers. Path tracking control focuses on robust implementation that keeps accuracy of path following in the presence of uncertainties and variations in speed. A realistic, 3D virtual simulation environment of the actual geo-fenced urban area used here is built for evaluating and developing the path planning and path tracking functions of this paper. The same environment can also be used for developing and evaluating other autonomous driving functions with the capability of generating complicated traffic scenarios. The path tacking control results are compared with those of the pure pursuit path tracking algorithm of the open source and publicly available Autoware autonomous driving interface for the Robot Operating System.},

Closed loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) algorithm are employed to transform the tip trajectory control problem to joint space control problem. In this work, two kinds of reconfiguration schemes are proposed, one using the redundancy in the manipulator only and another using the redundancy available with complete mobile manipulator system. Both types of the reconfiguration schemes use CLIK algorithm to calculate mobile base position and manipulator joint configurations so that the tip follows the reference trajectory in spite of locked joint failure of manipulator. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed fault tolerant schemes.},

To handle such arbitrary environments, we first represent them as a weighted directed graph. Then, a new partitioning algorithm is given that is capable of capturing the heterogeneity of robots in terms of the speed and onboard power. It is shown that the proposed partitioning method assigns a larger subgraph to a robot that has more resources or better capabilities compared to its neighbors. Next, a distributed deployment strategy is proposed to optimally distribute robots on the graph with the aim of monitoring specified regions of interest in the environment. It will be proved that the proposed combined partitioning and deployment strategy is an optimal solution in the sense that any other arbitrary partition than the proposed one results in a larger coverage cost, and that our deployment strategy also minimizes the considered cost. Moreover, the application of the proposed methodology for monitoring an agricultural field is studied, where a series of simulations and experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield an optimal partitioning and deployment and offer promise to be used in practice.},

  abstract     = {To be able to recover a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a small space like a boat deck or a glade in the forest, a steep and precise descent is needed. One way to reduce the speed of the UAV during landing is by performing a deep-stall landing manoeuvre, where the lift of the UAV is decreased until it is unable to keep the UAV level, at the same time as the drag is increased to minimize the speed of the UAV. However, this manoeuvre is highly nonlinear and non-trivial to perform with high precision. To solve this, an on-line nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is implemented to guide the UAV in the landing phase, receiving inputs from the autopilot and guiding the UAV using pitch and throttle references. The UAV is guided along a custom path to a predefined deep-stall landing start point and performs a guided deep-stall. The simulation results show that the NMPC guides the UAV in a deep-stall landing with good precision and low speed, and that the results depend on a correct prediction model for the controller.},

  abstract     = {Kinematic calibration of robots is an effective way to guarantee and promote their performance characteristics. There are many mature researches on kinematic calibration, and methods based on MDH model are the most common ones. However, when employing these calibration methods, it occasionally happens that the objective function cannot converge during iterations. Through analyzing robotic forward kinematics, we found out that the Cartesian coordinates of the end-point are affine to length-related MDH parameters, where linear and nonlinear parameters can be separated. Thanks to the distinctive characteristic of the MDH model, the kinematic calibration problem can be converted into a separable nonlinear least squares problem, which can further be partitioned into two subproblems: a linear least squares problem and a reduced problem involving only nonlinear parameters. Eventually, the optimal structural parameters can be identified by solving this problem iteratively. The results of numerical and experimental validations show that: 1) the robustness during identification procedure is enhanced by eliminating the partial linear structural parameters, the convergence rate is promoted from 68.98% to 100% with different deviation vector pairs; 2) the initial values to be pre-set for kinematic calibration problem are fewer and 3) fewer parameters are to be identified by nonlinear least squares regression, resulting in fewer iterations and faster convergence, where average runtime is reduced from 33.931s to 1.874s.},

New artificial potential functions are defined to preserve the connectivity of neighbour spacecraft while avoiding their inter-collision as well as collision with obstacles. An adaptive sliding-mode controller is designed for reaching and maintaining the predetermined formation configuration while satisfying the safety assurance requirements, including inter-collision avoidance, obstacle dodging, and connectivity preservation. The stability of the controller is proven through the Lyapunov analysis, in the presence of gravitational, solar radiation pressure, and atmosphere drag perturbations and dynamic uncertainties.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to calculate the roadmap that is robust against noisy environmental contours and the movement of the robot. In order to obtain full visibility to space, we design a direct space partitioning approach to produce the roadmap. It uses readings from rangefinders to establish sequential polygons in time, and as the robot moves, intersections among polygons are iteratively obtained. After iterations of updates, we obtain a number of polygons with stable forms. Based on the connections among the polygons, we obtain a roadmap and propose a routing algorithm to calculate paths between points in space.

  abstract     = {Visual object tracking remains a challenging computer vision problem with numerous real-world applications. Discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based methods are a recent state-of-the-art approach for dealing with this problem. The learning rate when applying a DCF is typically fixed, regardless of the situation. However, this rate is important for robust tracking, insofar as real-world video sequences include a variety of dynamical changes, such as occlusions, motion blur, and deformations. In this study, we propose Meta-Q-learning Correlation Filter (MQCF), a method for dynamically determining the learning rate of a baseline DCF-based tracker based on hand-crafted features of Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), by means of reinforcement learning. The incorporation of reinforcement learning enables us to train a function for an image patch that outputs a situation-dependent learning rate of the baseline tracker in an autonomous fashion. We evaluated this method using two open benchmarks, namely, OTB-2015 and VOT-2105, and found our MQCF tracker outperformed a baseline state-of-the-art tracker by 1.8% in Area Under Curve on OTB-2015, and 8.4% relative gain in Expected Average Overlap in the VOT-2015 challenge. Our results demonstrate the advantages of the so-called meta-learning with DCF-based visual object tracking.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we aim to develop a fast trajectory replanning methodology enabling highly agile aerial vehicles to navigate in cluttered environments. By focusing on reducing complexity and accelerating the replanning problem under strict dynamical constraints, we employ the b-spline theory with local support property for defining the high dimensional agile flight trajectories. We utilize the differential flatness model of an aerial vehicle, allowing us to directly map the desired output trajectory into input states to track a high dimensional trajectory. Dynamically feasible replanning problem is addressed through regenerating the local b-splines with control point reallocation. As the geometric form of the trajectory based on the location of the control points and the knot intervals, the control point reallocation for fast replanning with dynamical constraints is turned into a constrained optimization problem and solved through deep reinforcement learning. The proposed methodology enables generating dynamically feasible local trajectory segments, which are continuous to the existing, hence provides fast local replanning for collision avoidance. The DRL agent is trained with different environmental complexities, and through the batch simulations, it is shown that the proposed methodology allows to solve fast trajectory replanning problem under given or hard dynamical constraints and provide real-time applicability for such collision avoidance applications in agile unmanned aerial vehicles. Hardware implementation tests of the algorithm with the agile trajectory tracker to a small UAV can bee seen in the following video link: https://youtu.be/8IiLQFQ3V0E .},

In this paper, a novel visual system is proposed to detect and extract useful lane line parameters and to use them in a NMPC-based Visual Path Following Control Scheme. To cope with the above-mentioned problems, the visual path is approximated by a quadratic function and to robustness improve, this novel algorithm was modified to use RANSAC as a model estimation approach instead of using the classical Least Square Method. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system with respect to two others, in environments with visual disturbance, faulty paths, noise and bad lighting conditions.},

To this end, an operational framework for this cleaning robot that leverages on customized deep convolution neural network (DCNN) and the RGBD camera to locate staircases in the 3D prebuilt map and then to plan trajectories by maximizing area coverage for both floor and staircase in the multi-storey environments is proposed. While building a 3D map, the staircase location is identified at the 3D point close to the center of the staircase first step using a contour detection algorithm from the boundary of the detected staircase by DCNN. The robot follows the planned trajectory to clear the floor then approaching the staircase location accurately to execute the climbing mode while cleaning the staircase to reach the next floor. The proposed methods archive the high accuracy in identifying the presence of the different staircase types, and the first step locations. Moreover, the multi-storey building evaluations have demonstrated the efficiency of the sTetro in terms of the area coverage both staircase and floor free space.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely utilized in precision agriculture, such as tree plantations. Due to limited intelligence, these UAVs can only operate at high altitudes, leading to the use of expensive and heavy sensors for obtaining important health information of the plants. To fly at low altitudes, these UAVs must possess the capability of obstacle avoidance to prevent crashes. However, most current obstacle avoidance systems with active sensors are not applicable to small aerial vehicles due to the cost, weight, and power consumption constraints. To this end, this paper presents a novel approach to the autonomous navigation of a small UAV in tree plantations only using a single camera. As the monocular vision does not provide depth information, a machine learning model, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), was trained for the tree trunk detection. A control strategy was implemented to avoid the collision with trees. The detection model uses image heights of detected trees to indicate their distances from the UAV and image widths between trees to find the widest obstacle-free space. The control strategy allows the UAV to navigate until any approaching obstacle is detected and to turn to the safest area before continuing its flight. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the proposed algorithms by carrying out 11 flight tests in real tree plantation environments at two different locations, one of which is a new place. All the successful results indicate that the proposed method is accurate and robust for autonomous navigation in tree plantations.},

Instead of performing traditional stereo matching to compute disparities, the module directly takes the 2D proposals from both the left and the right views as input. Based on the epipolar constraints recovered from the well-calibrated stereo cameras, we propose four matching algorithms to search for the best match for each proposal between the stereo image pairs. Each matching pair proposes a segmentation of the scene which is then fed into a 3D bounding box regression network.

In an environment where there are multiple prioritized tasks to be completed by a school of AMRs, the overall planning problem can be broken down into three sequential steps: task allocation for the school of AMRs, task scheduling for each AMR, and trajectory planning for each individual AMR. This paper focuses on the trajectory generation procedure for each AMR. Unlike traditional approaches that only consider the location an AMR has to travel to during path planning, here, energy efficiency of the AMR is also considered. We present the physics-based model of the AMR as well as an optimal control formulation for energy-conscientious trajectory generation for the AMR. Methods to numerically solve this problem are discussed, and results are presented for each proposed algorithm on approximately 100 test cases, comparing both performance and computational efficiency.

First, some mental indicators are obtained based on Electroencephalogram during teleoperations. The relationship between the SoT and mental indicators is then established by a neural network. The online SoT identification is further implemented on a mobile telerobotic system. Second, a SoT based shared control framework is proposed in telerobotic system. The SoT is designed to dynamically adjust the control weight of the shared controller.

  abstract     = {Underwater tank cleaning using robotic method is very crucial due to the concern on the diver’s safety in undisrupted water supply operation. A Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROV) used in the tank cleaning operation however, suffers from a high operational cost due to the lack of systematic operator guidance in robot maneuvering. This paper presents a multi-objective approach in designing a Decision Support System (DSS) for underwater cleaning robot. To explore all feasible path, the path alternatives for every cleaning point in the tank is found using Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM). Then, an optimized sequential route are identified using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm using Reference Point Based (NSGA-III). Several objectives such as path length and routing angle are considered to be optimized, while ensuring constraints such as similar deployment point, maximum daily time limit and cable entanglement. To measure the quality of the proposed solution, comparisons have been done based on performance of NSGA-III with Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) by considering the C-Metric value, execution time and estimated cleaning duration. In addition, comparisons with conventional path by human operator is also conducted to validate the significance of DSS application in underwater tank cleaning. Results have shown that NSGA-III has superiorities with an improvement of 11.11% in cleaning time as compared to NSGA-II and 5.12% improvement compared to MOPSO.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles have the potential to change the urban transport scenario. However, to be able to safely navigate autonomously they need to deal with faults that its components are subject to. Therefore, Health Monitoring System is a essential component of the autonomous system, since allows Fault Detection and Diagnosis. In addition, Prognosis System is also important, since it allows predictive maintenance and safer decisions during vehicle navigation. This paper presents a Hierarchical Component-based Health Monitoring System with Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Prognosis using Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) with residue generation, a combination of knowledge-based and model-based detection, diagnosis and prognosis approaches. We evaluate the proposed Dynamic Bayesian Network using different machine learning metrics and a dataset with sensor readings gathered using the CaRINA II autonomous vehicle platform, and the CARLA simulator. Both simulated and experimental results demonstrated a positive performance of the DBNs even with high rate of missing data for some of the model’s variables.},

  abstract     = {We present an algorithmic approach to task deconfliction for teams of autonomous agents in communication-limited environments when the teams produce schedules with strong cross-schedule dependencies without the knowledge of the existence of other teams attempting to prosecute the same task set. Once agents discover others are attempting to prosecute the same task, they deconflict the task by trading assigned tasks. The method to determine the agents and tasks to trade in an efficient manner we term the Generous Agent Algorithm (GAA). Through formal analysis and simulation we show that teams utilizing the GAA can observe significant reductions in schedule end times and mission fuel requirements. We compare the GAA’s performance with a greedy deconfliction algorithm and a centralized scheduling algorithm to show that the GAA improves performance in situations when the number of agents is large within limited-communication environments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the problem of multiple quadcopter control, where the quadcopters maneuver in close proximity resulting in interference due to air-drafts. We use sparse experimental data to estimate the interference area between palm sized quadcopters and to derive physics-infused models that describe how the air-draft generated by two quadcopters (flying one above the other) affect each other. The observed significant altitude deviations due to airdraft interactions, mainly in the lower quadcopter, is adequately captured by our physics infused machine learning model. We use two strategies to mitigate these effects. First, we propose non-invasive, online and offline trajectory re-planning strategies that allow avoiding the interference zone while reducing the deviations from desired minimum snap trajectories. Second, we propose invasive strategies that re-design control algorithms by incorporating the interference model. We demonstrate how to modify the standard quadcopter PID controller, and how to formulate a model predictive control approach when considering the interference model. Both invasive and non-invasive strategies show significant reduction in tracking error and control signal energy as compared to the case where the interference area is ignored.},

  abstract     = {A novel monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm built on the semi-direct method is proposed to deal with some problems in complex environments, such as low-texture, moving objects and perceptual aliasing. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of direct and feature-based methods. On one hand, a direct method is used to track the camera poses and solve the feature alignment. On the other hand, ORB features in keyframes are extracted and matched for optimization and loop closure. To improve the localization accuracy in dynamic environments, a motion detection module that is robust to illumination change is adopted. In addition, for the sake of resolving the loop closure detection problem in perceptual aliasing scenes, this paper fuses the spatial information between two visual words into the bag of visual words (BoVW) model and employs an improved pyramid term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring match scheme. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm behaves better performance than ORB-SLAM with regard to overall accuracy and speed in complex environments.},
