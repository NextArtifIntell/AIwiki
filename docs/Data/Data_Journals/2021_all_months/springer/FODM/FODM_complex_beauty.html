  abstract     = {Uncertain differential game models conflicts and interests among players in the context of an uncertain dynamic system. However, cooperative behavior in uncertain differential game is an unexplored terrain. This paper proposes a spectrum of a cooperative uncertain differential game with transferrable payoffs. First, group rationality is achieved by maximizing the coalitional payoff through an uncertain optimal control method. Second, the concept of imputation is introduced as a solution, and a stability condition called subgame consistency condition for an imputation is proposed as well. Furthermore, the derivation of payoff distribution procedure for subgame consistent imputation is discussed. In addition, two optimal principles, i.e., Nash bargaining solution and Shapley value, are extended to this kind of model and are proved to be subgame consistent imputations, and their payoff distribution procedures are derived analytically. Finally, a two-person resource extraction game is studied for illustrating purpose.},

As an extension of existing tools, it takes advantage of the fact that Z-number can represent both information and corresponding credibility. At the same time, we discuss the normalization, operational rules, ranking method and distance measure for ZPLTSs. Then, we propose a new weight calculation method, an aggregation-based method and an extended TOPSIS method, and apply them to multi-attribute group decision making in Z probabilistic linguistic environment.

It is applicable to any additive decision criterion under fuzziness (e.g., expected value, value at risk, and conditional value at risk), for generalized cases that the link weights may be represented by arbitrary types of fuzzy variables. It also applies to the entropy criterion while the link weights are continuous fuzzy variables. Following the optimality conditions of the fuzzy MST under different decision criteria proved first in this paper, it is shown that the MST problem and its variants on a fuzzy network can be converted into equivalent deterministic counterparts on their corresponding crisp networks. Consequently, these problems can be effectively solved via their deterministic counterparts without fuzzy simulation, and meanwhile, the performance of the trees under a specified criterion is precisely measured. The accuracy and efficiency are both significantly improved compared with other fuzzy simulation-based approaches. Numerical examples illustrate the superiority of the proposed solution framework. Furthermore, some new theoretical conclusions on the MST problem under fuzziness are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy association rules (FARs) are a recognized model to study existing relations among data, commonly stored in data repositories. In real-world applications, transactions are continuously processed with upcoming new data, rendering the discovered rules information inexact or obsolete in a short time. Incremental mining methods arise to avoid re-runs of those algorithms from scratch by re-using information that is systematically maintained. These methods are useful for extracting knowledge in dynamic environments. However, executing the algorithms only to maintain previously discovered information creates inefficiencies in real-time decision support systems. In this paper, two active algorithms are proposed for incremental maintenance of previously discovered FARs, inspired by efficient methods for change computation. The application of a generic form of measures in these algorithms allows the maintenance of a wide number of metrics simultaneously. We also propose to compute data operations in real-time, in order to create a reduced relevant instance set. The algorithms presented do not discover new knowledge; they are just created to efficiently maintain valuable information previously extracted, ready for decision making. Experimental results on education data and repository data sets show that our methods achieve a good performance. In fact, they can significantly improve traditional mining, incremental mining, and a naïve approach.},

To address the challenge of the complicated decision-making environment and decision makers’ expression habits for the selection of financial products, this paper develops the incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation to depict decision makers’ preferences. Considering that, when decision makers express their opinions using probabilistic linguistic preference relation, it is possible that the sum of the value of the probability information is more than 1, this paper also extends the concepts of probabilistic linguistic term set, additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation and incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation to improve and ensure their practicability. Moreover, an “inverse prospect theory-based” algorithm is proposed to choose proper financial products. The algorithm processes the original incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation by using the inverse functions of the prospect theory at first. Then, a priority weights deriving model is established based on the extended concepts. Finally, the numerical case and analysis is presented as the evidences to the conclusion that the proposed algorithm is practical and robust.},

Determining the relative importance ratings (RIRs) of customer requirements (CRs) is actually a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem, which is regarded as an essential step in QFD application. Although many decision making approaches have been developed to rate the CRs, few of them refer to derive the weights of evaluators, and there is paucity of literature which combines the probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) with QFD methodology. Therefore, PLTSs are introduced in our study, to simultaneously reflect the hesitancy and preference degrees of evaluators. A novel MADM technique based on probabilistic linguistic preference (PLP) is explored to calculate the RIRs among CRs under the PLP environment. Concretely, some operators, such as the normalization formulas, the probabilistic linguistic expected value (PLEV) operator as well as the standard formula, are applied to weight the decision makers; a modified grey relational analysis-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (GRA-TOPSIS) method called probabilistic linguistic-based GRA-TOPSIS is also proposed to rate the relative importance over CRs. Finally, application of product improvement of a turbine engine is given to see the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

However, the users usually do not know the exact number of clusters in advance, particularly in practical engineering. To relax this requirement, this paper proposes an Evidential Evolving C-Means (E2CM) clustering method in the framework of evolutionary computation: cluster centers are encoded in a population of variable strings (or particles) to search the optimal number and locations of clusters simultaneously. To perform such joint optimization problem well, an artificial bee colony algorithm with variable strings and interactive evaluation mode is proposed. It will be shown that the E2CM can automatically create appropriate credal partitions by just requiring an upper bound of the cluster number rather than the exact one. More interestingly, there are no restrictions on this upper bound from the theoretic point of view. Some numerical experiments and a practical application in thermal power engineering validate our conclusions.},

  abstract     = {As a type of coronavirus, COVID-19 has quickly spread around the majority of countries worldwide, and seriously threatens human health and security. This paper aims to depict cumulative numbers of COVID-19 infections in China using the growth model chosen by cross validation. The residual plot does not look like a null plot, so we can not find a distribution function for the disturbance term that is close enough to the true frequency. Therefore, the disturbance term can not be characterized as random variables, and stochastic regression analysis is invalid in this case. To better describe this pandemic automatically, this paper first employs uncertain growth models with the help of uncertain hypothesis tests to detect and modify outliers in data. The forecast value and confidence interval for the cumulative number of COVID-19 infections in China are provided.},

Compared with the results of the classical time series model, the uncertain time series model could better describe the COVID-19 epidemic by using an uncertain hypothesis test to filter out outliers. This improvement is reflected in the two observations. One is that the estimated variance of the disturbance term in the uncertain time series model is more appropriate and acceptable than that in the classical time series model, and the other is that the disturbance term of the classical time series model cannot be regarded as a random variable but as an uncertain variable.},

  abstract     = {A behavioral multi-attribute decision making (BMADM) problem with probabilistic-based expressions is studied by considering decision-maker’s (DM) risk attitude and pre-evaluation. With consideration of information expressions for uncertainty, probabilistic interval numbers (PINs) and probabilistic linguistic terms (PLTs) are utilized to depict pre-evaluation information with respect to quantitative and qualitative attributes, respectively. Then surrounding the two kinds of probabilistic-based expressions, we propose a BMADM method with DM’s risk attitude being included based on regret theory. First, through taking into account characteristics of risk, we develop a basic utility function and a regret–rejoice function by considering risk-averse, risk-neutral and risk-seeking preference coefficients. Second, risk-based utility functions are examined for measuring PINs and PLTs. The third element is the establishment of optimization models for handling probability incompleteness to fully utilize the information. In the fourth step, a weighted comprehensive risk-based utility measurement is presented as a basis for making a selection. The final phase of the research is the application of the proposed method to one case, along with sensitivity and comparative analyses, as a means of illustrating the applicability and feasibility of the new method.},

  abstract     = {The challenge of complex multi-attribute large group decision-making (CMALGDM) is reflected from three perspectives: interrelated attributes, large group decision makers (DMs) and dynamic decision environments. However, there are few decision techniques that can address the three perspectives simultaneously. This paper proposes a random intuitionistic fuzzy factor analysis model, aiming to address the challenge of CMALGDM from the three perspectives. The proposed method effectively reduces the dimensionality of the original data and takes into account the underlying random environmental factors which may affect the performances of alternatives. The development of this method follows three steps. First, the random intuitionistic fuzzy variables are developed to deal with a hybrid uncertain situation where fuzziness and randomness co-exist. Second, a novel factor analysis model for random intuitionistic fuzzy variables is proposed. This model uses specific mappings or functions to define the way in which evaluations are affected by the dynamic environment vector through data learning or prior distributions. Third, multiple correlated attribute variables and DM variables are transformed into fewer independent factors by a two-step procedure using the proposed model. In addition, the objective classifications and weights for attributes and DMs are obtained from the results of orthogonal rotated factor loading. An illustrative case and detailed comparisons of decision results in different environmental conditions are demonstrated to test the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

Preference relation is one of the most widely used preference representation structures in GDM. Considering that the self-confidence degree is an important part to express preference information, and double hierarchy linguistic preference relation (DHLPR) is a cognitive complex linguistic information representation tool to express complex linguistic information, this paper presents a novel preference relation named as self-confident DHLPR. In addition, a weight-determining method is developed, which considers three kinds of information including the subjective weights and two kinds of objective weights. Furthermore, a consensus model is set up to manage the GDM problems with self-confident DHLPRs based on the priority ordering theory. The effectiveness of the proposed consensus model is illustrated by a case study concerning the selection of optimal hospitals in the field of Telemedicine. Finally, a simulation experiment is devised to testify the proposed consensus model and then some comparisons with other consensus reaching models are provided from three different angles including the number of iterations, the consensus success ratio and the distance between the original and adjusted preferences.},
