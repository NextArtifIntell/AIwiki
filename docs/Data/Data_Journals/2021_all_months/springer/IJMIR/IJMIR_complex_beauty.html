  abstract     = {In recent years video-based crowd counting and density estimation (CCDE) have become essential for crowd analysis. Current approaches rarely exploit spatial–temporal features for CCDE, and they also usually do not consider measures to minimize the frame&#39;s background influence for obtaining crowd density maps, which has resulted in lower performance in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Again, attention to individual feature set&#39;s response toward crowd counting is also neglected. To this end, we are motivated to design an end-to-end trainable attentive multi-stream convolutional neural network (AMS-CNN) for crowd counting. At first, a multi-stream CNN (MS-CNN) is designed to obtain crowd density maps. The MS-CNN comprises three streams to fuse deep spatial, temporal, and spatial foreground features from different cues of the crowd video dataset, like frames, the volume of frames, and foregrounds of frames. To improve the accuracy, we designed three stream-wise attention modules to generate attentive crowd density maps, and their relative average is obtained using a relative averaged attentive density-map (RAAD) layer. The relative averaged density map is concatenated with the MS-CNN output, followed by two-stage CNN blocks to get the final density map. The experiments are demonstrated on three publicly available crowd density video datasets: Mall, UCSD, and Venice. We obtained promising and better results in terms of MAE and RMSE as compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Image classification systems have been found vulnerable to adversarial attack, which is imperceptible to human but can easily fool deep neural networks. Recent researches indicate that regularizing the network by introducing randomness could greatly improve the model’s robustness against adversarial attack, but the randomness module would normally involve complex calculations and numerous additional parameters and seriously affect the model performance on clean data. In this paper, we propose a feature matching module to regularize the network. Specifically, our model learns a feature vector for each category and imposes additional restrictions on image features. Then, the similarity between image features and category features is used as the basis for classification. Our method does not introduce any additional network parameters than undefended model and can be easily integrated into any neural network. Experiments on the CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets highlight that our proposed module can effectively improve both clean data and perturbed data accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art defense methods and outperform the L2P method by 6.3 $$\%$$ , 24 $$\%$$ on clean and perturbed data, respectively, using ResNet-V2(18) architecture.},

Various methods have been developed to tackle either offline or early action recognition, including deep learning approaches. In a family of deep learning methods, video frames or optical flow images are processed sequentially by the network. In this paper, we present a learning framework that can be applied to such methods to make them more appropriate for early recognition. We propose encouraging the learner to learn from earlier parts of the video and stop learning from some point on. By focusing on the earlier parts, we can expect the model to take full advantage of the information lying in these early parts. To this end, it is necessary to find a stopping point up to which enough information has been observed. We measure the amount of information with the help of the loss function. We applied our framework to Temporal Segment Networks and experimented on UCF11 and HMDB51 datasets. The results show that our method improves on Temporal Segment Networks and outperforms other baseline methods.},

In AD, brain cells that are responsible for forming memories and cognitive decisions, get affected which causes overall gray matter shrinkage in the human brain. Since AD patients are growing exponentially in the world, researchers are trying to develop an accurate mechanism for diagnosing the disease using brain images. In this paper, several research articles on AD classification are analyzed along with detailed observations. We have summarized as well as compared the research articles based on their classification performance. Although all the reviewed articles have the potential to classify AD, still there lies major future challenges. Among all the reviewed papers, it is found that the recent deep neural network-based classification techniques can produce the most promising results with an average performance rate of 93%.},

  abstract     = {The cold-start problem is a grand challenge in music recommender systems aiming to provide users with a better and continuous music listening experience. When a new user creates a playlist, the recommender system remains in a cold-start state until enough information is collected to identify the user’s musical taste. In such cases, playlist metadata, such as title or description, have been successfully employed to create intent recommendation models. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage retrieval system utilizing user-generated titles to alleviate the cold-start problem in automatic playlist continuation. Initially, playlists are clustered to form a music documents collection. Then, the system applies latent semantic indexing to the collection to discover hidden patterns between tracks and playlist titles. For similarity calculation, singular value decomposition is performed on a track-cluster matrix. When the system is given a new playlist as a cold-start instance, it first retrieves neighboring clusters and then produces a ranked list of recommendations by weighting candidate tracks in these clusters. We scrutinize the performance of the proposed system on a large, real-world music playlists dataset supplied by the Spotify platform. Our empirical results show that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and improves recommendation accuracy significantly in three primary evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {One of the most fundamental challenges in computer vision is pedestrian detection since it involves both the classification and localization of pedestrians at a location. To achieve real-time pedestrian detection without having any loss in detection accuracy, an Optimized MobileNet + SSD network is proposed. There are four important components in pedestrian detection: feature extraction, deformation, occlusion handling and classification. The existing methods design these components either independently or in a sequential format, and the interaction among these components has not been explored yet. The proposed network lets the components work in coordination in such a manner that their strengths are improved and the number of parameters is decreased compared to recent detection architectures. We propose a concatenation feature fusion module for adding contextual information in the Optimized MobileNet + SSD network to improve the detection accuracy of pedestrians. The proposed model achieved 80.4% average precision with a detection speed of 34.01 frames per second (fps) when tested on the Jetson Nano board, which is much faster compared to standard video speed (30 fps). Experimental results have shown that the proposed network has a better detection effect during low light conditions and for darker pictures. Therefore, the proposed network is well suited for low-end edge devices.},

  abstract     = {In recent days&#39; research, deep learning methods have shown promising performance in various fields of computer vision, including content-based image retrieval (CBIR). In this paper, an improved version of Darknet-53, called GroupNormalized-Inception-Darknet-53 (GN-Inception-Darknet-53), is proposed to extract features for the CBIR model. To extract the more detailed features of an image, we augmented one inception layer which includes 1 × 1, 3 × 3, and 5 × 5 kernels in place of an existing 3 × 3 kernel. The output of this newly added inception layer is the concatenated results of these three kernels. To make the normalization process of the proposed model less dependent on batch size, group normalization (GN) layer is used instead of batch normalization. A total of five such inception layers are used in the proposed GN-Inception-Darknet-53, and the output of all these inception layers is depth concatenated to extract more detailed features of the image. To train the proposed model transfer learning mechanism is used. Five standard performance measures: average precision rate, average recall rate, F-measure, average normalized modified retrieval rank, and total minimum retrieval epoch, are calculated to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed method. To assess the performance of the proposed method, seven challenging image datasets: three natural datasets (Corel-1K, Corel-5K &amp; Corel-10K), three subsets of ImageNet dataset, and UKbench dataset are used. For all these datasets, the proposed method shows better results than the nineteen methods used to compare that contain traditional and CNN methods for CBIR.},

Using neural-based data augmentation techniques for data generation and deep convolutional models for classification would enhance the performance of the applications mentioned above. Recently, GANs (generative adversarial networks) showed significant improvements in generating images. In this paper, a model that uses a conditioned deep convolutional GAN and an auxiliary classifier are proposed to tackle the aforementioned issues. The conditioned GAN is used for data generation of minority classes images and noisy images. Another auxiliary deep convolutional model is employed for the classification of images on data augmented dataset. Also, a multi-hinge loss is employed in both the data augmentation and classification tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated on the quality of generated images and classification metrics using four publicly available popular datasets: MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN. The proposed model has shown significant improvements over the other often used models of data augmentation and multi-class imbalance image classification in terms of generated samples and classification accuracy.},

The quantification of the cross-modal consistency of entity representations can assist human assessors’ evaluation of the overall multimodal message. In some cases such measures might give hints to detect fake news, which is an increasingly important topic in today’s society. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach to quantify the entity coherence between image and text in real-world news. Named entity linking is applied to extract persons, locations, and events from news texts. Several measures are suggested to calculate the cross-modal similarity of the entities in text and photograph by exploiting state-of-the-art computer vision approaches. In contrast to previous work, our system automatically acquires example data from the Web and is applicable to real-world news. Moreover, an approach that quantifies contextual image-text relations is introduced. The feasibility is demonstrated on two datasets that cover different languages, topics, and domains.},

Over the past few years, different researchers have come with various learning techniques for improving performance in chest image analysis. However, the scarcity of labeled datasets and less computational processing power was a reason for the negligible performance improvement. Nevertheless, with the advancement in Deep Learning (DL) techniques, researchers succeeded in achieving state-of-the-art results and created a new research paradigm. Among the different DL techniques, Convolutional Neural Network comes with a revolution for identifying abnormality in chest images. This survey aims to highlight the importance of deep learning techniques in chest disease diagnosis. In this paper, our primary objective is to broadly analyze different DL techniques and recognize some of the important research challenges that mostly affect deep neural networks for investigating various chest diseases. Specifically, we focus on several chest diseases, symptoms, preliminary treatments, and state-of-the-art detection techniques. We also introduce several chest image analysis tools, techniques, and datasets for analyzing chest diseases. Further, we have presented several open research challenges and future research directions in the field of chest image analysis.},

The most important CAD application is to detect and classify pneumonia diseases using X-ray images, especially, in a critical period as pandemic of covid-19 that is kind of pneumonia. In this work, we aim to evaluate the performance of single and ensemble learning models for the pneumonia disease classification. The ensembles used are mainly based on fined-tuned versions of (InceptionResNet_V2, ResNet50 and MobileNet_V2). We collected a new dataset containing 6087 chest X-ray images in which we conduct comprehensive experiments. As a result, for a single model, we found out that InceptionResNet_V2 gives 93.52% of F1 score. In addition, ensemble of 3 models (ResNet50 with MobileNet_V2 with InceptionResNet_V2) shows more accurate than other ensembles constructed (94.84% of F1 score).},

The music similarity system, which is the basis of the recommendation system, can automatically generate a user&#39;s playlist according to the similar features of each piece of music. In this paper, we designed a desirable music genre classification using convolutional neural network for extracting high-level features from intermediate networks layers. For similarity measurement, we considered cosine similarity and Euclidean distances between feature vectors. We applied this automatic recommendation system on three databases with different genres and showed that the recommender achieves significant accuracy in 10-Best results.},

This paper analyzes several feature types in audio from different points of view: time series, sound engineering, etc. In particular, the description of audio as a set of time series is not very common in the literature, and it is one of the aspects studied in this paper. Particularly, this paper proposes an automated method for feature engineering in audios, to extract, analyze and select the best features in a given context. Specifically, this paper develops a hybrid scheme of extraction of audio descriptors based on different principles and defines an automatic approach for the analysis and selection of these descriptors in a given audio context. Finally, our approach was tested on grouping tasks and compared to previous works on audio classification problems, with encouraging results.},

  abstract     = {Increasingly, music recommendations are influencing user listening behavior, which naturally impacts the music industry, as well as the cultural and social aspects of our society. This has opened up a research area, namely the identification of biases introduced by recommender systems in the music context. Recent research, which focused on users of the Last.fm platform found that state-of-the-art music recommendation systems frequently tend to favor already popular items. To this end, we propose a new method for predicting music recommendations, which relies on a cluster-based quotas system. By assuming the distribution of the popularity of artists to have a latent variable that is estimated with a Gaussian Mixture, we find the underlying popularity clusters and use them to make the predictions by quotas that relate to each cluster mixing proportion, in a way that the resulting popularity distribution in the recommendations is closer to the popularity distribution seen in the data. In our experiments with the Last.fm data, our final predictions increased the recommendation frequencies of less popular artists, while preserving the specific characteristics of each algorithm. The GAP(g) $$_r$$ and mean average error (MAE) metrics are improved, showing that our recommendations are more accurate and approximate to the expected popularity of the artists in each user profile.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have attained great success in handling high dimensional data, especially images. However, generating naturalistic images containing ginormous subjects for different tasks like image classification, segmentation, object detection, reconstruction, etc., is continued to be a difficult task. Generative modelling has the potential to learn any kind of data distribution in an unsupervised manner. Variational autoencoder (VAE), autoregressive models, and generative adversarial network (GAN) are the popular generative modelling approaches that generate data distributions. Among these, GANs have gained much attention from the research community in recent years in terms of generating quality images and data augmentation. In this context, we collected research articles that employed GANs for solving various tasks from popular databases and summarized them based on their application. The main objective of this article is to present the nuts and bolts of GANs, state-of-the-art related work and its applications, evaluation metrics, challenges involved in training GANs, and benchmark datasets that would benefit naive and enthusiastic researchers who are interested in working on GANs.},
