  abstract     = {Using methods in the spirit of deterministic homogenisation theory we obtain convergence of the Steklov eigenvalues of a sequence of domains in a Riemannian manifold to weighted Laplace eigenvalues of that manifold. The domains are obtained by removing small geodesic balls that are asymptotically densely uniformly distributed as their radius tends to zero. We use this relationship to construct manifolds that have large Steklov eigenvalues. In dimension two, and with constant weight equal to 1, we prove that Kokarev’s upper bound of $$8\pi $$ for the first nonzero normalised Steklov eigenvalue on orientable surfaces of genus 0 is saturated. For other topological types and eigenvalue indices, we also obtain lower bounds on the best upper bound for the eigenvalue in terms of Laplace maximisers. For the first two eigenvalues, these lower bounds become equalities. A surprising consequence is the existence of free boundary minimal surfaces immersed in the unit ball by first Steklov eigenfunctions and with area strictly larger than $$2\pi $$ . This was previously thought to be impossible. We provide numerical evidence that some of the already known examples of free boundary minimal surfaces have these properties and also exhibit simulations of new free boundary minimal surfaces of genus zero in the unit ball with even larger area. We prove that the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of all these examples is equal to 1, as a consequence of their symmetries and topology, so that they are consistent with a general conjecture by Fraser and Li. In dimension three and larger, we prove that the isoperimetric inequality of Colbois–El Soufi–Girouard is sharp and implies an upper bound for weighted Laplace eigenvalues. We also show that in any manifold with a fixed metric, one can construct by varying the weight a domain with connected boundary whose first nonzero normalised Steklov eigenvalue is arbitrarily large.},

Our proofs proceed through a combinatorial analysis of the recursive relations (Virasoro constraints) that uniquely determine these correlators, together with a comparison between the coefficients in these relations with the jump probabilities of a certain asymmetric simple random walk. As an application of this result, we provide the large genus limits for Masur–Veech volumes and area Siegel–Veech constants associated with principal strata in the moduli space of quadratic differentials.

  abstract     = {The Lott–Sturm–Villani Curvature-Dimension condition provides a synthetic notion for a metric-measure space to have Ricci-curvature bounded from below and dimension bounded from above. We prove that it is enough to verify this condition locally: an essentially non-branching metric-measure space $$(X,\mathsf {d},{\mathfrak {m}})$$ (so that $$(\text {supp}({\mathfrak {m}}),\mathsf {d})$$ is a length-space and $${\mathfrak {m}}(X) &lt; \infty $$ ) verifying the local Curvature-Dimension condition $${\mathsf {CD}}_{loc}(K,N)$$ with parameters $$K \in {\mathbb {R}}$$ and $$N \in (1,\infty )$$ , also verifies the global Curvature-Dimension condition $${\mathsf {CD}}(K,N)$$ . In other words, the Curvature-Dimension condition enjoys the globalization (or local-to-global) property, answering a question which had remained open since the beginning of the theory. For the proof, we establish an equivalence between $$L^1$$ - and $$L^2$$ -optimal-transport–based interpolation. The challenge is not merely a technical one, and several new conceptual ingredients which are of independent interest are developed: an explicit change-of-variables formula for densities of Wasserstein geodesics depending on a second-order temporal derivative of associated Kantorovich potentials; a surprising third-order theory for the latter Kantorovich potentials, which holds in complete generality on any proper geodesic space; and a certain rigidity property of the change-of-variables formula, allowing us to bootstrap the a-priori available regularity. As a consequence, numerous variants of the Curvature-Dimension condition proposed by various authors throughout the years are shown to, in fact, all be equivalent in the above setting, thereby unifying the theory.},

A classical result of Cattani, Deligne and Kaplan states that the Hodge locus for $${{\mathbb {V}}}^\otimes $$ is a countable union of closed irreducible algebraic subvarieties of S, called the special subvarieties of S for $${{\mathbb {V}}}$$ . Under the assumption that the adjoint group of the generic Mumford–Tate group of $${{\mathbb {V}}}$$ is simple we prove that the union of the special subvarieties for $${{\mathbb {V}}}$$ whose image under the period map is not a point is either a closed algebraic subvariety of S or is Zariski-dense in S. This implies for instance the following typical intersection statement: given a Hodge-generic closed irreducible algebraic subvariety S of the moduli space $${{\mathcal {A}}}_g$$ of principally polarized Abelian varieties of dimension g, the union of the positive dimensional irreducible components of the intersection of S with the strict special subvarieties of $${{\mathcal {A}}}_g$$ is either a closed algebraic subvariety of S or is Zariski-dense in S.},

In particular, such groups act geometrically on spaces with a convex geodesic bicombing, equipping them with a nonpositive-curvature-like structure. That structure has many properties of a CAT(0) structure and, additionally, it has a combinatorial flavor implying biautomaticity. As immediate consequences we obtain new results for FC-type Artin groups (in particular braid groups and spherical Artin groups) and weak Garside groups, including e.g. fundamental groups of the complements of complexified finite simplicial arrangements of hyperplanes, braid groups of well-generated complex reflection groups, and one-relator groups with non-trivial center. Among the results are: biautomaticity, existence of EZ and Tits boundaries, the Farrell–Jones conjecture, the coarse Baum–Connes conjecture, and a description of higher order homological and homotopical Dehn functions.

This paper studies homological properties of irreducible smooth representations restricted from $${\mathrm {GL}}_{n+1}(F)$$ to $${\mathrm {GL}}_n(F)$$ . A main result shows that each Bernstein component of an irreducible smooth representation of $${\mathrm {GL}}_{n+1}(F)$$ restricted to $${\mathrm {GL}}_n(F)$$ is indecomposable. We also classify all irreducible representations which are projective when restricting from $${\mathrm {GL}}_{n+1}(F)$$ to $${\mathrm {GL}}_n(F)$$ . A main tool of our study is a notion of left and right derivatives, extending some previous work joint with Gordan Savin. As a by-product, we also determine the branching law in the opposite direction.},

Combining this with the earlier work of Schumacher, Siu and Jost-Yau, we provide a proof of the holomorphic rigidity of Teichmüller space.

When G is locally finite, we prove that type II $$_\infty $$ does arise. For arbitrary countable groups, we assume that the marginal measures stay away from 0 and 1. When G has only one end, we prove that the Krieger type is always I, II $$_1$$ or III $$_1$$ . When G has more than one end, we show that other types always arise. Finally, we solve the conjecture of Vaes and Wahl (Geom Funct Anal 28:518–562, 2018) by proving that a group G admits a Bernoulli action of type III $$_1$$ if and only if G has nontrivial first $$L^2$$ -cohomology.},

This is a long-standing problem, due to Arnol’d, Pham, and Thom. Our proof is based on recent advancements in the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as on several new results and constructions. In particular: we show that all affine noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable; we use these posets to construct finite classifying spaces for dual affine Artin groups; we introduce new CW models for the orbit configuration spaces associated with arbitrary Coxeter groups; we construct finite classifying spaces for the braided crystallographic groups introduced by McCammond and Sulway.},

  abstract     = {We provide a rigorous derivation of nonlinear Gibbs measures in two and three space dimensions, starting from many-body quantum systems in thermal equilibrium. More precisely, we prove that the grand-canonical Gibbs state of a large bosonic quantum system converges to the Gibbs measure of a nonlinear Schrödinger-type classical field theory, in terms of partition functions and reduced density matrices. The Gibbs measure thus describes the behavior of the infinite Bose gas at criticality, that is, close to the phase transition to a Bose–Einstein condensate. The Gibbs measure is concentrated on singular distributions and has to be appropriately renormalized, while the quantum system is well defined without any renormalization. By tuning a single real parameter (the chemical potential), we obtain a counter-term for the diverging repulsive interactions which provides the desired Wick renormalization of the limit classical theory. The proof relies on a new estimate on the entropy relative to quasi-free states and a novel method to control quantum variances.},

The contraction estimate does not depend on the strength of the viscosity. This provides a good control on the inviscid limit process. We prove that, for any initial value, there exist a vanishing viscosity limit to solutions of the Navier–Stokes system. The convergence holds in a weak topology. However, this limit satisfies some stability estimates measured by the relative entropy with respect to an entropy shock.

  abstract     = {We prove the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes as solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations: linearized perturbations of a Kerr metric decay at an inverse polynomial rate to a linearized Kerr metric plus a pure gauge term. We work in a natural wave map/DeTurck gauge and show that the pure gauge term can be taken to lie in a fixed 7-dimensional space with a simple geometric interpretation. Our proof rests on a robust general framework, based on recent advances in microlocal analysis and non-elliptic Fredholm theory, for the analysis of resolvents of operators on asymptotically flat spaces. With the mode stability of the Schwarzschild metric as well as of certain scalar and 1-form wave operators on the Schwarzschild spacetime as an input, we establish the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes using perturbative arguments; in particular, our proof does not make any use of special algebraic properties of the Kerr metric. The heart of the paper is a detailed description of the resolvent of the linearization of a suitable hyperbolic gauge-fixed Einstein operator at low energies. As in previous work by the second and third authors on the nonlinear stability of cosmological black holes, constraint damping plays an important role. Here, it eliminates certain pathological generalized zero energy states; it also ensures that solutions of our hyperbolic formulation of the linearized Einstein equations have the stated asymptotics and decay for general initial data and forcing terms, which is a useful feature in nonlinear and numerical applications.},

More precisely, we consider the action of mapping class groups, by pre- and post-composition, on branched coverings, and encode them algebraically as mapping class bisets. We show how the mapping class biset of maps preserving a multicurve decomposes into mapping class bisets of smaller complexity, called small mapping class bisets. We phrase the decision problem of Thurston equivalence between branched self-coverings of the sphere in terms of the conjugacy and centralizer problems in a mapping class biset. Our decomposition results on mapping class bisets reduce these decision problems to small mapping class bisets; they correspond to rational maps, homeomorphisms and maps double covered by a torus endomorphism, and their conjugacy and centralizer problems are solvable respectively in terms of complex analysis, group theory and linear algebra. Branched coverings themselves are also encoded into bisets, with actions of the fundamental groups. We characterize those bisets that arise from branched coverings between topological spheres, and extend this correspondence to maps between spheres with multicurves, whose algebraic counterparts are sphere trees of bisets. To illustrate the difference between Thurston maps and homeomorphisms, we produce a Thurston map with infinitely generated centralizer—while centralizers of homeomorphisms are always finitely generated.},

  abstract     = {The Chow–Mumford (CM) line bundle is a functorial line bundle on the base of any family of klt Fano varieties. It is conjectured that it yields a polarization on the moduli space of K-poly-stable klt Fano varieties. Proving ampleness of the CM line bundle boils down to showing semi-positivity/positivity statements about the CM-line bundle for families with K-semi-stable/K-polystable fibers. We prove the necessary semi-positivity statements in the K-semi-stable situation, and the necessary positivity statements in the uniform K-stable situation, including in both cases variants assuming K-stability only for general fibers. Our statements work in the most general singular situation (klt singularities), and the proofs are algebraic, except the computation of the limit of a sequence of real numbers via the central limit theorem of probability theory. We also present an application to the classification of Fano varieties. Additionally, our semi-positivity statements work in general for log-Fano pairs.},

The proof is model-theoretic and does not rely on results of classification of unitary representations.

Our main application is to growth rates of periodic orbits for covers of an Anosov flow: we reduce the problem of counting periodic orbits in an amenable cover X to counting in a maximal abelian subcover $$X^{\mathrm {ab}}$$ . In this way, we obtain an equivalence for the Gurevič entropy: $$h(X)=h(X^{\mathrm {ab}})$$ if and only if the covering group is amenable. In addition, when we project the periodic orbits for amenable covers X to the compact factor M, they equidistribute with respect to a natural equilibrium measure — in the case of the geodesic flow, the measure of maximal entropy.},

First, we propose a new approach to isoperimetric eigenvalue inequalities based on energy index. Using this approach we show that for any positive k, the k-th non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the real projective plane endowed with a metric of unit area, is maximized on the sequence of metrics converging to a union of $$(k-1)$$ identical copies of round sphere and a single round projective plane. This extends the results of Li and Yau (Invent Math 69(2):269–291, 1982) for $$k=1$$ ; Nadirashvili and Penskoi (Geom Funct Anal 28(5):1368–1393, 2018) for $$k=2$$ ; and confirms the conjecture made in (KNPP). Second, we improve the known lower bounds for the area index of minimal two-dimensional spheres and minimal projective planes in $${\mathbb {S}}^n$$ . In the course of the proof we establish a twistor correspondence for Jacobi fields, which could be of independent interest for the study of moduli spaces of harmonic maps.},

  abstract     = {We show that for each $$\gamma \in (0,2)$$ , there is a unique metric (i.e., distance function) associated with $$\gamma $$ -Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). More precisely, we show that for the whole-plane Gaussian free field (GFF) h, there is a unique random metric $$D_h$$ associated with the Riemannian metric tensor “ $$e^{\gamma h} (dx^2 + dy^2)$$ ” on $${\mathbb {C}}$$ which is characterized by a certain list of axioms: it is locally determined by h and it transforms appropriately when either adding a continuous function to h or applying a conformal automorphism of $$\mathbb {C}$$ (i.e., a complex affine transformation). Metrics associated with other variants of the GFF can be constructed using local absolute continuity. The $$\gamma $$ -LQG metric can be constructed explicitly as the scaling limit of Liouville first passage percolation (LFPP), the random metric obtained by exponentiating a mollified version of the GFF. Earlier work by Ding et al. (Tightness of Liouville first passage percolation for $$\gamma \in (0,2)$$ , 2019. arXiv:1904.08021 ) showed that LFPP admits non-trivial subsequential limits. This paper shows that the subsequential limit is unique and satisfies our list of axioms. In the case when $$\gamma = \sqrt{8/3}$$ , our metric coincides with the $$\sqrt{8/3}$$ -LQG metric constructed in previous work by Miller and Sheffield, which in turn is equivalent to the Brownian map for a certain variant of the GFF. For general $$\gamma \in (0,2)$$ , we conjecture that our metric is the Gromov–Hausdorff limit of appropriate weighted random planar map models, equipped with their graph distance. We include a substantial list of open problems.},

In this paper, we verify a stronger version of a function field analogue of Furusho’s conjecture in the sense that we are able to deal with all linear relations over an algebraic closure of the given rational function field, not just the rational linear relations. To each tuple of positive integers $${\mathfrak {s}}=(s_1, \ldots , s_r)$$ , we construct a corresponding t-module together with a specific rational point. The fine resolution (via fiber coproduct) of this construction actually allows us to obtain nice logarithmic interpretations for both the $$\infty $$ -adic MZV and v-adic MZV at $${\mathfrak {s}}$$ , completely generalizing the work of Anderson–Thakur (Ann Math (2) 132(1):159–191, 1990) in the case of $$r=1$$ . Furthermore it enables us to apply Yu’s sub-t-module theorem (Yu in Ann Math (2) 145(2):215–233, 1997), connecting any $$\infty $$ -adic linear relation on MZV’s with a sub-t-module of a corresponding giant t-module.

The proof relies on a combinatorial argument and the Goulden–Jackson recurrence relation to obtain tightness, and probabilistic arguments showing the uniqueness of the limit. As a consequence, we obtain asymptotics up to subexponential factors on the number of triangulations when both the size and the genus go to infinity. As a part of our proof, we also obtain the following result of independent interest: if a random triangulation of the plane T is weakly Markovian in the sense that the probability to observe a finite triangulation t around the root only depends on the perimeter and volume of t, then T is a mixture of PSHT.},
