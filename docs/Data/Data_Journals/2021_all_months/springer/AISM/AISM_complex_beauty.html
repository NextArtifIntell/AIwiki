The asymptotic distribution of the maximal deviation between the estimator and the true regression function is derived and an asymptotically accurate simultaneous confidence band is constructed. The estimator for the regression function is shown to be oracally efficient in the sense that it is uniformly indistinguishable from that when the selection probabilities are known. Finite sample performance is examined via simulation studies which support our asymptotic theory. The proposed method is demonstrated via an analysis of a data set from the Canada 2010/2011 Youth Student Survey.},

Also, we estimate the regression function by expanding it in a wavelet basis and applying a hard threshold to the coefficients. Since the observations of the predictor are unequally distant from each other, we work with wavelets warped by the density of the predictor variable. This choice enables us to retain some theoretical and computational properties of wavelets. We propose a unique estimator and show that some of its properties are the same for both model specifications. Specifically, in both cases the coefficients are unbiased and their variances decay at the same rate. Also the risk of the estimator, measured by the mean integrated square error is almost minimax and its maxiset remains unaltered. Simulations and an application illustrate the similarities and differences of the proposed estimator in both situations.},

Improper distributions and diffuse FAPs can be seen as limits of proper distribution sequences for specific convergence modes. In this paper, we compare these two kinds of limits. We show that improper distributions and FAPs represent two distinct features of the limit behavior of a sequence of proper distribution. More specifically, an improper distribution characterizes the behavior of the sequence inside the domain, whereas diffuse FAPs characterizes how the mass concentrates on the boundary of the domain. Therefore, a diffuse FAP cannot be seen as the counterpart of an improper distribution. As an illustration, we consider several approach to define uniform FAP distributions on natural numbers as an equivalent of improper flat prior. We also show that expected logarithmic convergence may depend on the chosen sequence of compact sets.},

For parameter estimation, most existing methods perform satisfactorily only in the limited range of parameters. Furthermore, the interval estimation and hypothesis tests have not been studied well in the literature. In this article, we develop a novel framework for inference for the GPD, which works successfully for all values of shape parameter k. Specifically, we propose a new method of parameter estimation and derive some asymptotic properties. Based on the asymptotic properties, we then develop new confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the GPD.

The second is a moment-based method for the background rate and triggering matrix estimation, which is extended here for the spatiotemporal case. Our method combines them together in an efficient way, and we prove the consistency of this new approach. Extensive numerical experiments, with synthetic data and real-world social network data, show that our method improves the accuracy, scalability and computational efficiency of prevailing estimation approaches. Moreover, it greatly boosts the performance of Hawkes process-based models on social network reconstruction and helps to understand the spatiotemporal triggering dynamics over social media.},

Estimating this conditional variance usually is a hard task, in particular when the underlying process contains jumps. For this reason, several authors have recently discussed methods to automatically estimate the conditional variance, i.e. they build a consistent estimator from the original statistics, but computed at different time scales. Their methods work in several situations, but are essentially restricted to the case of continuous paths always. The aim of this work is to present a new method to consistently estimate the conditional variance which works regardless of whether the underlying process is continuous or has jumps. We will discuss the case of power variations in detail and give insight to the heuristics behind the approach.},

Under the null hypothesis, the new test statistic has an asymptotic Chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom, while the corresponding test is consistent for a wide range of the alternatives. On the other hand, to control the actual Type I error rate when sample sizes are finite, permutation approach is employed for the inference. An extensive simulation study shows that the new test procedure improves upon classical solutions and popular recent developments in the field. An analysis of the real datasets is included.

In the case of stationary random sets, a common practice to estimate the mean density is to take the n-dimensional volume fraction with observation window as large as possible. In the present paper, we provide large and moderate deviation results for these estimators when the random closed set $$\Theta _n$$ belongs to the quite general class of stationary Boolean models with Hausdorff dimension $$n&lt;d$$ . Moreover, we establish a central limit theorem and a Berry–Esseen bound for the family of estimators under study. Our findings allow to recover some well-known results in the literature on Boolean models. Finally, we also provide a guideline for the estimation of the mean density of non-stationary Boolean models characterized by high intensity of the underlying Poisson point process.},

Those, however, are not based on any valid smoothing operation. By contrast, in this paper a kernel density estimator is defined through the Mellin convolution, the natural analogue on $${\mathbb {R}}^+$$ of the usual convolution. From there, a class of asymmetric kernels related to Meijer G-functions is suggested, and asymptotic properties of this ‘Mellin–Meijer kernel density estimator’ are presented. In particular, its pointwise- and $$L_2$$ -consistency (with optimal rate of convergence) are established for a large class of densities, including densities unbounded at 0 and showing power-law decay in their right tail.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem whether two convex (concave) regression functions modelling the relation between a response and covariate in two samples differ by a shift in the horizontal and/or vertical axis. We consider a nonparametric situation assuming only smoothness of the regression functions. A graphical tool based on the derivatives of the regression functions and their inverses is proposed to answer this question and studied in several examples. We also formalize this question in a corresponding hypothesis and develop a statistical test. The asymptotic properties of the corresponding test statistic are investigated under the null hypothesis and local alternatives. In contrast to most of the literature on comparing shape invariant models, which requires independent data the procedure is applicable for dependent and non-stationary data. We also illustrate the finite sample properties of the new test by means of a small simulation study and two real data examples.},

The numerical studies also suggest its advantage over existing scree plot-based method that is not a visualization method and more seriously underestimates the number of pairs than the proposed ones and the AIC and $$C_p$$ criteria that often extremely over-estimate the number, and the BIC criterion that has very serious underestimation problem.

For analyzing data with anomalous responses in the high-dimensional case, in this work, we adopt γ-divergence to conduct variable selection and estimation methods. The proposed method possesses good robustness to anomalous responses, and the proportion of abnormal data does not need to be modeled. It is implemented by an efficient coordinate descent algorithm. In the setting where the dimensionality p can grow exponentially fast with the sample size n, we rigorously establish variable selection consistency and estimation bounds.

The inverse probability weighting is applied to obtain the bias-corrected generalized estimating equations (GEEs), and then we borrow the idea of quadratic inference function and hybrid GEE to construct the empirical likelihood procedures for longitudinal data with nonignorable dropouts, respectively. Two different classes of estimators and their confidence regions are derived. Further, the penalized EL method and algorithm for variable selection are investigated.

These methods, however, are challenged by complex features pertinent to the data collection as well as the nature of data themselves. Typically, biased samples caused by left-truncation (or length-biased sampling) and measurement error often accompany survival analysis. While such data frequently arise in practice, little work has been available to simultaneously address these features. In this paper, we explore valid inference methods for handling left-truncated and right-censored survival data with measurement error under the widely used Cox model. We first exploit a flexible estimator for the survival model parameters which does not require specification of the baseline hazard function. To improve the efficiency, we further develop an augmented nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator. We establish asymptotic results and examine the efficiency and robustness issues for the proposed estimators. The proposed methods enjoy appealing features that the distributions of the covariates and of the truncation times are left unspecified.

  abstract     = {The most common standard estimator of the pair correlation function (PCF) of a point process has a pole at zero, which is in most cases a statistical artifact. However, sometimes it makes sense to assume that a pole really exists. We propose two independent approaches for the proof of existence of a PCF’s pole and for the determination of its order. In the first, we use a summary characteristic F that transforms the PCF’s pole order to the location of F’s pole, while the other one uses a natural estimation method based on Ripley’s K-function. These methods are applied to simulated samples of two classical point process models and two cluster point process models with special geometries. Finally, we use the approach in the statistical analysis of a classical point pattern of pine trees and a highly clustered pattern of nonmetallic inclusions in steel.},

A Haar wavelet multiresolution analysis is formulated which motivates the definition of homogeneity at different scales of resolution, termed J-th level homogeneity. Further to this, the activity in a point process’ first-order behaviour at different scales of resolution is also defined and termed L-th level innovation. Likelihood ratio tests for both these properties are proposed with asymptotic distributions provided, even when only a single realization is observed. The test for L-th level innovation forms the basis for a collection of statistical strategies for thresholding coefficients in a wavelet-based estimator of the intensity function. These thresholding strategies outperform the existing local hard thresholding strategy on a range of simulation scenarios. This methodology is applied to NetFlow data, characterizing multiscale behaviour on computer networks.},

Traditionally, estimation of Gaussian graphical models (GGM) is performed in an i.i.d setting. More recently, such models have been extended to allow for changes in the distribution, but primarily where changepoints are known a priori. In this work, we study the Group-Fused Graphical Lasso (GFGL) which penalises partial correlations with an L1 penalty while simultaneously inducing block-wise smoothness over time to detect multiple changepoints. We present a proof of consistency for the estimator, both in terms of changepoints, and the structure of the graphical models in each segment. We contrast our results, which are based on a global, i.e. graph-wide likelihood, with those previously obtained for performing dynamic graph estimation at a node-wise (or neighbourhood) level.},

In any application, the simulation model will not describe the reality perfectly, and consequently the surrogate model will be imperfect. In this article, we combine observed data from the technical system with simulated data from the imperfect simulation model in order to estimate an improved surrogate model consisting of multilayer feedforward neural networks, and we show that under suitable assumptions, this estimate is able to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. Based on this improved surrogate model, we show a rate of the convergence result for density estimates. The finite sample size performance of the estimates is illustrated by applying them to simulated data. The practical usefulness of the newly proposed estimates is demonstrated by using them to predict the uncertainty of a lateral vibration attenuation system with piezo-elastic supports.},

We examine an issue regarding the goodness-of-fit testability based on a single observation.

The VpV framework induces an extension of the conventional expected p-value (EPV) tool for measuring the performance of a test. Associating the EPV concept with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methodology, a well-established biostatistical approach, we propose a Youden’s index-based optimality to derive critical values of tests. In these terms, the significance level $$ \alpha = 0.05 $$ is suggested. We introduce partial EPV’s to characterize properties of tests including their unbiasedness.

In this paper, we show that a weighted last observation carried forward approach may yield valid estimation. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the weighted partial likelihood estimators and provide a closed form variance estimator for inference. The estimator may be conveniently implemented using standard software. Interestingly, the convergence rate of the estimator is slower than the parametric rate achieved with fully observed covariates but the same as that obtained with all lagged covariate values. Simulation studies provide numerical support for the theoretical findings. Data from an Alzheimer’s study illustrate the practical utility of the methodology.},

  abstract     = {There has been much attention on the de-biased or de-sparsified Lasso. The Lasso is very useful in high-dimensional settings. However, it is well known that the Lasso produces biased estimators. Therefore, several authors proposed the de-biased Lasso to fix this drawback and carry out statistical inferences based on the de-biased Lasso estimators. The de-biased Lasso needs desirable estimators of high-dimensional precision matrices. Thus, the research is almost limited to linear regression models with some restrictive assumptions, generalized linear models with stringent assumptions, and the like. To our knowledge, there are a few papers on linear regression models with group structure, but no result on structured nonparametric regression models such as varying coefficient models. We apply the de-biased group Lasso to varying coefficient models and examine the theoretical properties and the effects of approximation errors involved in nonparametric regression. The results of numerical studies are also presented.},
