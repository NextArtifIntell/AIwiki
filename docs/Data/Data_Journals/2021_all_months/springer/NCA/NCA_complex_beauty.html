  abstract     = {In this paper, an approximate solution based on the variational iteration method is given to solve the fuzzy time-fractional diffusion equations. The time-fractional derivative is taken in the Caputo sense. In the variational iteration method, the solution appears as a convergent series with easily predictable terms. In this approach, the correctional functional is constructed and the Lagrange multiplier is identified optimally via variational theory. Some examples are also given to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed method for the discussed class of fuzzy time-fractional diffusion equations. To demonstrate the efficiency of the variational iteration method, comparisons have been made with the numerical solution obtained by the implicit finite difference scheme that exists in the literature. The proposed iterative algorithm is quite simple to use and does not require any discretization, transformation, or restrictive assumptions. Also, tabulated results show that the proposed algorithm gives better accuracy than the implicit finite difference scheme.},

  abstract     = {Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are small, water-soluble, globular, and ligand-specific proteins found in the sensillar lymph in insects and mucus layer in vertebrates. They function as a carrier for transferring odorants to their respective olfactory receptors. However, the functionality and expression of OBPs are not limited to olfaction mechanism and olfactory organs. OBPs are involved in various other functions like measuring odorant concentration and deactivating odorants. They are found in insect taste organs, venom glands, and sex hormone glands. To gain more insight into the functioning and expression pattern of OBPs, it has become essential to identify OBP sequences. The available OBP prediction methods are primarily based on sequence similarity, which seems inefficient since OBPs share low interspecies and intraspecies sequence similarities. Effective representation of protein sequence-based features is essential for the development of predictive models. Single feature representation like physicochemical properties and secondary structure content (PCSS), amino acid composition (AAC), and sequence graph transform may be insufficient. Therefore, we propose two feature combination schemes: feature fusion and feature concatenation, for OBP prediction. The role of conventional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms have not been explored much for identifying OBP sequences. The performance metrics suggest the feature fusion scheme enhances the overall performance of the OBP prediction classifiers. Deep networks yield better accuracy as compared to traditional Machine learning algorithms. The performance of the deep neural network and one-dimensional convolution neural network was found to be comparative. Among all feature representation schemes, the feature fusion scheme with AAC + PCSS gave the best performance. The accuracy of deep neural network and convolutional neural network-1D for AAC + PCSS representation was found to be 98.6\% and 96.5\%, respectively. We propose OBPred, a deep neural network model with the fused ACC + PCSS feature set, for OBP identification. The current study is the first attempt, to our knowledge, to predict OBPs using deep neural networks.},

  abstract     = {In the last month of 2019, a new virus emerged in China, spreading rapidly and affecting the whole world. This virus, which is called corona, is the most contagious type of virus that humanity has ever encountered. The virus has caused a huge crisis worldwide as it leads to severe infections and eventually death in humans. On March 11, 2020, it was announced by the World Health Organization that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred. Computer-aided digital technologies, which eliminate many problems and provide convenience in people&#39;s lives, did not leave humanity alone in this regard and rushed to provide a solution for this unfortunate event. One of the important aspects in which computer-aided digital technologies can be effective is the diagnosis of the disease. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a standard and precise technique for diagnosing the disease, is an expensive and time-consuming method. Moreover, its availability is not the same all over the world. For this reason, it can be very attractive and important to distinguish the COVID-19 disease from a cold or flu through a cough sound analysis via smartphones which have entered into the lives of many people in recent years. In this study, we proposed a machine learning-based system to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients by analyzing only a single cough sound. Two different data sets were used, one accessible for the public and the other available on request. After combining the data sets, the features were obtained from the cough sounds using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) method, and then, they were classified with seven different machine learning classifiers. To determine the optimum values of hyperparameters for MFCCs and classifiers, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) strategy was implemented. Based on the results, the k-nearest neighbors classifier based on the Euclidean distance (kNN Euclidean) with the accuracy rate, sensitivity of COVID-19, sensitivity of non-COVID-19, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9833, 1.0000, 0.9720, 0.9799, and 0.9860, respectively, is more successful than other classifiers. Finally, the best and most effective features were determined for each classifier using the sequential forward selection (SFS) method. According to the results, the proposed system is excellent compared with similar studies in the literature and can be easily used in smartphones and facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In addition, since the used data set includes reflex and unconscious coughs, the results showed that conscious or unconscious coughing has no effect on the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on the cough sound.},

  abstract     = {Many industrial and metallurgical processes require powders within a specific size range which may not be readily available from conventional processes. Thus, mechanical alloying (MA) has been exploited as an important attrition process for obtaining the desirable particle sizes of powders. However, MA is highly stochastic, depends on several parameters, and often relies on expensive and time-intensive experimentations. Therefore, developing a good model that can accurately predict the process can eliminate these challenges. This study, therefore, proposed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based mathematical equation for predicting the particle size of AZ61 magnesium alloy after MA. Three input parameters comprising rotation speed, charge ratio, and milling time were used to develop the model. Its s for training, validation, and testing datasets was greater than 93\%, an indication of its high prediction ability. Furthermore, the proposed model was compared with a multilinear regression (MLR) model by means of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) analyses. Results showed that the RMSE and MAE of the ANN model were considerably lower than that of the MLR model. This further established the accuracy and high predictability of the ANN model. Additionally, sensitivity analysis revealed that rotation speed was the most significant parameter influencing particle size during MA. The developed model is useful for predicting the particle size of AZ61 powder, optimizing the MA process, and eliminating expensive and time-intensive experimentations.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has caused a pandemic crisis that threatens the world in many areas, especially in public health. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, computed tomography has a prognostic role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 as it provides both rapid and accurate results. This is crucial to assist clinicians in making decisions for rapid isolation and appropriate patient treatment. Therefore, many researchers have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection from chest CT images using various deep learning systems is extremely optimistic. Deep learning networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require substantial training data. One of the biggest problems for researchers is accessing a significant amount of training data. In this work, we combine methods such as segmentation, data augmentation and generative adversarial network (GAN) to increase the effectiveness of deep learning models. We propose a method that generates synthetic chest CT images using the GAN method from a limited number of CT images. We test the performance of experiments (with and without GAN) on internal and external dataset. When the CNN is trained on real images and synthetic images, a slight increase in accuracy and other results are observed in the internal dataset, but between $$3\%$$ and $$9\%$$ in the external dataset. It is promising according to the performance results that the proposed method will accelerate the detection of COVID-19 and lead to more robust systems.},

Despite their crucial role, however, ToS are often neglected by users that frequently accept without even reading what they agree upon, representing a critical issue when there exist potentially unfair clauses. To enhance users’ awareness and uphold legal safeguards, we first propose a definition of ToS unfairness based on a novel unfairness measure computed counting the unfair clauses contained in a ToS, and therefore, weighted according to their direct impact on the customers concrete interests. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning-based approach to classify ToS clauses, represented by using sentence embedding, in different categories classes and fairness levels. Results of a test involving well-known machine learning models show that Support Vector Machine is able to classify clauses into categories with a F1-score of 86\% outperforming state-of-the-art methods, while Random Forest is able to classify clauses into fairness levels with a F1-score of 81\%. With the final goal of making terms of service more readable and understandable, we embedded this approach into ToSware, a prototype of a Google Chrome extension. An evaluation study was performed to measure ToSware effectiveness, efficiency, and the overall users’ satisfaction when interacting with it.},

Transforming each mobile robot system into a chained form, a cooperative learning control scheme based on the adaptive neural network is proposed. Firstly, a virtual control law is designed for the kinematic model of the constrained chain system combined with the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF). Then, radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are exploited to deal with the unknown nonlinear dynamics in the mobile robot system, a robust term is introduced to compensate for the NN approximation errors and the external disturbance, and the Moore–Penrose inverse is adopted to avoid the violation of state constraints. Communication network is used to realize the online sharing of NN weights of each mobile robot individuals, such that locally accurate identification of the unknown nonlinear dynamics with common optimal weights can be obtained. As a result, the learned knowledge can be reused in the cooperative learning control tasks and the trained network model has better generalization capabilities than the normal decentralized learning control. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness of the control scheme.},

  abstract     = {The traffic light cycle optimization problem (TLCOP) is certainly one of the most critical problems in a modern traffic management system because a “good solution” will be able to reduce the total waiting time of vehicles on roads of an entire city. In addition to heuristic algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms provide an alternative way for solving this optimization problem in the sense that they provide a better solution to adjust the traffic lights to mitigate the traffic congestion problem. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement. One of the open issues is that most metaheuristic algorithms will converge to a few regions at the later stage of the convergence process and thus are likely to fall into local optima. The proposed algorithm—a hybrid heuristic algorithm called grey wolf with grasshopper optimization (GWGO)—is developed to leverage the strength of grey wolf and grasshopper optimization algorithms. The underlying idea is to use the grey wolf optimization to avoid falling into local optimum too quickly while using the grasshopper optimization to dynamically adjust the convergence speed of the search algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find out better results than all the other state-of-the-art search algorithms for the TLCOP evaluated in this study in terms of the quality of the end results.},

  abstract     = {The feature selection problem is known as one of the most critical issues with several applications in classification. Certain features of a dataset do not usually contain useful information or play important roles in the data classification. It is possible to reduce the computational burden through the elimination of unnecessary features. This paper was conducted to propose an opposition-based binary competitive optimization algorithm, namely OBCOOA, to solve the wrapper-based feature selection problems. The basic idea of the competitive optimization algorithm (COOA) lies on the natural competition between different species to survive, which is a continuous algorithm inherently. The present study entailed the main contributions as follows: primarily, a time-varying V-shape transfer function was used in the optimization process to present the binary version of the COOA algorithm, which established the right balance between the exploration and exploitation phases; secondly, in the proposed algorithm, the opposition-based learning mechanism was utilized to improve the diversity quality within the population members and to incorporate a suitable initial population. In the feature selection problem, the classification error rate and the number of selected features objective functions are usually adopted, which causes this problem to convert into a multi-objective optimization one. This research presented a single- and multi-objective approach from the proposed algorithm in order to solve the feature selection problem. The proposed algorithm was applied to 27 benchmark datasets, and the evaluation results were compared to the other well-known binary optimization algorithms. The experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm has a better ability to find an optimal subset of features with the least classification error rate and the number of the selected features.},

There are few tries to realize noise-to-state exponentially mean-square stability for switched random nonlinear systems subject to multiple interval time-varying delays allowing various time delay cases. Random differential equations are more common than stochastic differential equations in practice. Thus, the suggested method is more practicable. First, a nonlinear dynamic output feedback fault-tolerant controller is constructed. Next, an augmented closed-loop system can be obtained in the framework of multiple interval time-varying delays. Then piecewise Lyapunov function is utilized to realize stability analysis for the closed-loop system. At last, this feasibility of this approach presented in this study is verified through two examples.},

  abstract     = {A recent research area in unsupervised learning is the combination of representation learning with deep neural networks and data clustering. The success of deep learning for supervised tasks is widely established. However, recent research has demonstrated how neural networks are able to learn representations to improve clustering in their intermediate feature space, using specific regularizations. By considering representation learning and clustering as a joint task, models learn clustering-friendly spaces and outperform two-stage approaches where dimensionality reduction and clustering are performed separately. Recently, this idea has been extended to topology-preserving clustering models, known as self-organizing maps (SOM). This work is a thorough study on the deep embedded self-organizing map (DESOM), a model composed of an autoencoder and a SOM layer, training jointly the code vectors and network weights to learn SOM-friendly representations. In other words, SOM induces a form a regularization to improve the quality of quantization and topology in latent space. After detailing the architecture, loss and training algorithm, we study hyperparameters with a series of experiments. Different SOM-based models are evaluated in terms of clustering, visualization and classification on benchmark datasets. We study benefits and trade-offs of joint representation learning and self-organization. DESOM achieves competitive results, requires no pretraining and produces topologically organized visualizations.},

  abstract     = {Opinion-mining generally refers to analyzing opinions on various topics available in the form of text. It is an essential operation of natural language processing since it enables efficient decision-making and planning for users and businesses. Opinion-mining can be made more comfortable and more effective by initially performing subjectivity detection, i.e., identifying the text as subjective or objective. An opinion-mining model can better identify the opinions present in the remaining subjective statements by removing objective statements. With this reasoning, we present an efficient subjectivity detection model for improved accuracy in Opinion-mining. The model uses a strategic combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). CNN and LSTM are state-of-the-art deep learning models that can efficiently process textual data and identify inherent connections and patterns with varying abstraction levels. The proposed work combines the strengths of both these models in an ensemble model. Effectiveness of the model is enhanced with the incorporation of an attention network. In the present task, the sentences are represented as word embeddings that include sentiment information and part-of-speech. The proposed model is applied on two movie review datasets, and its performance is evaluated compared with state-of-the-art methods. Various performance indexes have validated the superiority of the proposed model in the opinion-mining task.},

In this study, BWM finds its use to evaluate the weightage (or priority value) of criteria, and using AHP, the local weights of alternatives are decided. The proposed technique is utilized to recognize the most significant alternative (or indicator), for the efficiency of a water treatment plant. Observing the result, it can be said that the ‘water quality’ is the most responsible alternative. The consistency ratio value which is found by our proposed method is less, compared to the existing BWM and fuzzy BWM techniques.

  abstract     = {Nonnegative tensor decomposition is a versatile tool for multiway data analysis, by which the extracted components are nonnegative and usually sparse. Nevertheless, the sparsity is only a side effect and cannot be explicitly controlled without additional regularization. In this paper, we investigated the nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (NCP) decomposition with the sparse regularization item using $$l_1$$ -norm (sparse NCP). When high sparsity is imposed, the factor matrices will contain more zero components and will not be of full column rank. Thus, the sparse NCP is prone to rank deficiency, and the algorithms of sparse NCP may not converge. In this paper, we proposed a novel model of sparse NCP with the proximal algorithm. The subproblems in the new model are strongly convex in the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework. Therefore, the new sparse NCP provides a full column rank condition and guarantees to converge to a stationary point. In addition, we proposed an inexact BCD scheme for sparse NCP, where each subproblem is updated multiple times to speed up the computation. In order to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the sparse NCP with the proximal algorithm, we employed two optimization algorithms to solve the model, including inexact alternating nonnegative quadratic programming and inexact hierarchical alternating least squares. We evaluated the proposed sparse NCP methods by experiments on synthetic, real-world, small-scale, and large-scale tensor data. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can efficiently impose sparsity on factor matrices, extract meaningful sparse components, and outperform state-of-the-art methods.},

Furthermore, multiple hidden layers with decreasing dimensionality are employed. A classification accuracy of 61.7\% is achieved using pre-learned embeddings, that are fine-tuned during training to represent the specific context of this task. Multiple filter widths are also implemented to detect different length phrases that are key for classification. Trading simulations are conducted using the presented classification results. Initial investments are more than tripled over an 838-day testing period using the optimal classification configuration and a simple trading strategy. Two novel methods are presented to reduce the risk of the trading simulations. Adjustment of the sigmoid class threshold and re-labelling headlines using multiple classes form the basis of these methods.

  abstract     = {Foamed concrete (FC) shows advantageous applications in civil engineering, such as reduction in dead loads, contribution to energy conservation, or decrease the construction phase labor cost. Compressive Strength is considered the most important factor in terms of FC mechanical properties. In recent years, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one of popular and effective machine learning models, which can be used to accurately predict the FCCS. However, ANN’s structure and parameters are normally chosen by experience. In this study, therefore, the objective is to use particle swarm optimization (PSO) metaheuristic optimization (one of the effective soft computing techniques) to optimize the parameters and structure of a Levenberg–Marquardt-based Artificial Neural Network (LMA-ANN) for accurate and quick prediction of the FCCS. A total of 375 data of experiments on FC gathered from the available literature were used to generate the training and testing datasets. Various validation criteria such as mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient (R) were used for the validation of the models. The results showed that the PSO-LMA-ANN algorithm is a highly efficient predictor of the FCCS, achieving the highest value of R up to 0.959 with the optimized [5-7-6-1] structure. An interpretation of the mixture components and the FCCS using Partial Dependence Plots was also performed to understand the effect of each input on the FCCS. The dry density was the most important parameter for the prediction of FCCS, followed by the water/cement ratio, foam volume, sand/cement ratio, and the testing age. The results of the present work might help in accurate and quick prediction of the FCCS and the design optimization process of the FC.},

Besides, rectification constraints were posed to avoid defects that typically encounter during synthesis. The formulated nonlinear optimization problem was solved using nature-inspired and metaphor-less algorithms. It is found that the summed error between the desired and generated trajectories was very less in case of nature-inspired algorithm in comparison with metaphor-less algorithm.

In this work, we propose to combine the detector with the individual’s pose information in order to improve overall performance. To this end, a model that integrates grayscale images from the output of the handgun detector and heatmap-like images that represent pose is proposed. The results show an improvement over the original handgun detector.

It is an economical due to its construction and installation and an accurate in discharge measurement in open channel and non-full pipe. Exchange of oxygen between water and air is termed as aeration. In the study, advance soft computing models; Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Generalized Structure- Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) have used to predict aeration efficiency (E20) values at Parshall flumes and its modified forms and also compared with existing conventional models.

Agreement plot of GS-GMDH and MARS models showed that the MARS model has the maximum exactness in predicting E20 values at Parshall flumes and its modified forms with the lowest RMSE = 0.0020, MAE = 0.0015. MARS model with input combination of ratio of throat width to throat length (W/L), ratio of sill height to throat length (S/L) and Froude number is performing better than that of all other input combinations used for models and found to be more suitable for predicting the E20.

  abstract     = {This work presents an analysis of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based forecasting models for vehicular traffic flow. The forecasting was performed for three periods of time: 1 week, 1 month and 1 year. The vehicular traffic flow data analysed were collected from Interstate 87, a highway located within the U.S. state of New York. Temporal and climate information, such as weekday, time of day, precipitation, visibility and temperature, were provided to the ANNs. Two different architectures were implemented to forecast vehicular traffic flow: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and comparing the predicted flow with the real data in the evaluated period. The MLP resulted in RMSE of 113.96, 185.98 and 201.19, and MAP of 9.56\%, 15.49\% and 16.95\% for a forecasting interval of 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, respectively. Similarly, the LSTM network resulted in RMSE of 122.20, 179.55 and 203.63 and MAPE of 14.66\%, 17.89\% and 24.10\% for the same time periods. Additionally, the two developed ANNs were evaluated to perform a forecasting vehicular traffic flow for another highway, the Interstate 88. The results from the two ANNs are similar, the MLP network resulted in MAPE of 17.15\%, 25.65\% and 19.76\% for a forecasting interval of 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, respectively. On the other hand, the LSTM network presented RMSE of 19.14\%, 31.87\% and 22.97\%. The results obtained come close to the similar work results when considered shorter prediction periods. The results for longer prediction time could not be compared to the literature due to the lack of work in this area, being a novelty of the current work. Moreover, the models implemented in this paper were precise and stable and can be used as strategy information to help road and cities planning. In addition, results have shown that the model can be replicated for other roads in the same region or either from other states or countries.},

  abstract     = {Planetary gear trains (PGTs) are widely used in many industrial applications from wind turbines to automobile transmissions due to their high power-to-weight ratio. Since PGT can be subjected to faults and prone to failure over time, a non-intrusive method of monitoring the condition of PGT is required. Vibration-based machine learning algorithms are mostly used in fault diagnosis and classification in PGT, but due to the epicyclic motion of gears, vibration signals from one gear can get neutralized or amplified by signals from another gear. In addition, identification of smaller cracks in the sun gear can be challenging when using vibration-based fault diagnosis alone due to cancelation effects from the planet pinions. In this paper, epicyclic drivetrain of a Chevy Volt hybrid car is considered to study two scenarios: (1) detecting microcracks (0.02 mm) and (2) identifying faults in sun gear while its signal is affected by cracks at the planetary gears. Four different cases: a healthy PGT, PGT with a sun crack, PGT with a planet crack, and a PGT with a sun and a planet crack, were considered and simulated using the MSC ADAMS software. The joint forces at the exterior ring gear were extracted, and a Blackman function was applied to conversion to frequency-domain values. Each of the frequency-domain amplitude values was converted to pixel values in a grayscale image, and the generated images were fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train, validate, and test the datasets. The results indicated that the proposed grayscale 2D CNN algorithm has an accuracy of 92\% for the test set.},

  abstract     = {The classical maximum power point tracking (MPPT) approaches are powerful under uniform irradiance conditions. However, under partial shading conditions, they fail to find the global maximum power point (GMPP) and are trapped in one of the local maximum power points (MPPs), resulting in loss of power. This paper presents an experimental investigation of a novel hybrid MPPT approach for photovoltaic systems working under partial shading conditions (PSCs). In the proposed hybrid approach, the firefly algorithm (FA) is modified and employed for global searching through two loops, and the perturbation and observation (P&amp;O) algorithm is used for local searching through one loop. The model of the proposed algorithm is built in the environments of MATLAB/Simulink and Proteus virtual system modeling (VSM) while the experimental study is conducted using a 32-bit microcontroller. The simulation and experimental results are collected under irregular irradiance conditions and PSCs. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance in the task of finding and tracking the GMPP, shows high sensitivity in capturing any variation in atmospheric conditions, reduces the convergence time to the GMPP and reduces the steady-state oscillation around the optimal operating point. This finding has important implications for developing photovoltaic generation systems.},

Our method is called differentiable efficient generator search, which focuses on efficiently finding the generator in the GAN. Our search algorithm is inspired by the differential architecture search strategy and the global latent optimization procedure. This leads to both an efficient and stable GAN search. After the generator architecture is found, it can be plugged into any existing framework for GAN training.

Various distance functions for PFSs are introduced in the literature and have their own pros and cons. The common thread of incompetency for these existing distance functions is their inability to distinguish highly uncertain PFSs distinctly. To tackle this point, we introduce a novel distance measure for PFSs. An added advantage of the measure is its simple mathematical form. Moreover, superiority and reasonability of the prescribed definition are demonstrated through proper numerical examples. Boundedness and nonlinear behaviour of the distance measure is established and verified via suitable illustrations. In the current scenario, selecting an antivirus face-mask as a preventive measure in the COVID-19 pandemic and choosing the best school in private sector for children are some of the burning issues of a modern society. These issues are addressed here as multi-attribute decision-making problems and feasible solutions are obtained using the introduced definition. Applicability of the distance measure is further extended in the areas of pattern recognition and medical diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Shear wave velocity has many applications in subsurface engineering such as reservoir engineering, rock mechanics, and seismic studies. To estimate the shear wave velocity in rocks, different methods such as laboratory experiments and well logging approaches are used. These approaches are usually involved with high cost and are time-consumption. To overcome these issues, several methods such as the use of empirical correlations and machine learning methods were proposed in the past. Most of these methods involve the usage of a large number of features and the formation of specific data points. In this study, a new method is proposed for feature selection by coupling regression algorithms to reduce the likelihood of the error introduced because of the redundant variables. A substantial number of conventional well logs and acoustic data from the open-source data of Norwegian Volve field were utilized. Four machine learning algorithms such as Random forest Regressor, Adaboosting regressor, Gradient Boosting tree, and Support Vector Regressor were implemented. The prediction results on testing dataset showed that the Adaptive boosting Regressor algorithm accurately predict the interrelationship between the selected features and the desired output by yielding MAE of 0.032 and R2 of 0.93. The previous methods resulted in MAE up to 2.0 and low as R2 of 0.5 between actual and predicted values.},

  abstract     = {Massive studies focus on the prediction of main pollutants, to improve air quality by revealing the evolution of pollutants. However, existing prediction methods mostly emphasize the fitting analysis of time series, but ignore the spatial propagation effect among nearby places, resulting in a low prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel synthesis prediction method to simultaneously excavate the time series changing law and the spatial propagation effect. This method combines a characterization model named air quality spatial-temporal network (AQSTN) and a neural network model called graph convolution neural network (GCN). Firstly, by calculating three correlation coefficients, the time series of most related meteorological factors and aerosol data are gained for feature construction. The geographic distances between locations are computed to evaluate the spatial propagation cost. After that, AQSTN with locations as nodes and propagation relations as edges is constructed, compositing the temporal and spatial relationships. The network is regarded as graph data and input into GCN in chronological order. Secondly, GCN processing graph-structured data fits the optimal parameters in the training stage, simultaneously analyzes the spatial and temporal dimensions of the target site and its adjacent sites. And, the predicted $${\rm{PM}}_{2.5}$$ concentration is gained in the test stage. The near-surface monitoring data of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area are adopted for experiment. Compared with the second-best model, the RMSE value of AQSTN-GCN is 6.85\% lower, MAE value is 13.79\% lower, MSE value is 13.23\% lower, and MAPE value is 21.53\% lower.},

  abstract     = {The software implementations of neuronal systems have shown great effectiveness, even if the natural hardware separation between the processing and memory areas in computers slows down the analysis capacity. To overcome these limitations, new hardware configurations are moving towards neuromorphic models, capable of unifying the processing/memory dichotomy. Recently, integrated photonic X-junctions formed by waveguides written by spatial solitons have shown the ability to perform supervised learning. The solitonic technology, compared to the traditional one, offers the advantage of realizing plastic circuitry, a typical characteristic of biological neural networks. This work extensively studies both supervised and unsupervised learning of photonic soliton X-junctions. By exploiting the plasticity of the nonlinear refractive index at the base of the soliton formation, X-junctions can readdress their behaviours forwarding data to different outputs. In this article, we will extend the state-of-the-art: starting from supervised learning, for which all possible cases are now investigated, a material sensitive to the transported signals will be introduced to allow the junction to carry out unsupervised learning. In this way, the junction autonomously recognises the transported signals without the external intervention of the operator. Learning and memory now physically coincide in fact, learning means that the junction slowly switches based on the information sent; any further unknown information sent will find the junction in the modified state which corresponds to the learned information and will be recognised as well (reasoning based on comparison with stored information).},

  abstract     = {The multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP), as an extended version of the well-known traveling salesman problem, aims to search for a group of circuits when multiple salesmen are sent to travel a set of cities and each city should be visited exactly once. Although some research efforts have been devoted for this problem, most of them concentrate on how to minimize the sum of traveling distances of all salesmen, and only very few aim to specifically minimize the maximum distance traveled by all the salesmen (minmax mTSP). The minmax mTSP is of large practical importance as it is able to model various real-life applications where workload among salesmen should be balanced or where the travel time is adopted rather than the travel distance. This paper proposes a novel improved shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (ISFLA) to address this problem. In ISFLA, a novel population partition method and a heterogeneous evolution mechanism are introduced to improve cooperative evolution and yield a high-quality solution. Guided and unguided leaping mechanisms are devised to evolve frog individuals. Computational experiments on some benchmark problems are conducted, and the results reveal the superiority of ISFLA over some state-of-the-art approaches for this problem.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art Re-ID methods based on unsupervised domain adaption transferred the domain knowledge by pre-training model on labeled source domain and fine-tuned the pre-trained model with pseudo labels generated by clustering samples on unlabeled target domain. Unfortunately, compared with supervised Re-ID methods, the performance of exiting clustering-based UDA Re-ID methods dropped sharply, since these methods utilized a not good enough baseline and seldom handled the noisy pseudo labels generated by clustering algorithm. In this paper, we try to address the UDA problem by designing a Strong Clustering-based Unsupervised Re-ID (SCURID) baseline for further research at first. Then, we integrate the hard labels and soft multilabels to learn more discriminative features on a unified angular regularized metric space. Specifically, we design the angular margin losses consisting of Hard Angular Margin Identification (HAMI) loss and Soft Angular Margin Identification (SAMI) loss. The HAMI loss can learn generalizable and discriminative features through hard pseudo labels generated by clustering on unlabeled target domain. The SAMI loss is proposed to refine the hard noisy pseudo labels through the soft multilabels obtained from peer network. Benefited from SCURID baseline and two angular margin losses, it enables the clustering-based UDA Re-ID model to alleviate the negative effect of noisy labels and toward more discriminability. Comprehensive and extensive experiments on three public available Re-ID datasets, e.g., Matket-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17, demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art results on UDA Re-ID task.},

  abstract     = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a widespread, evitable and remediable ailment accentuated by the deregulation of a stream of air in the lungs or due to pleura anomalies owing to harmful fuels. Timely detection and prevention are of utmost importance to curb the spread of these disorders. To diagnose the respiratory illness, clinicians use the traditional approach of auscultation and this led to the development of state-of-the-art technology tools for sensing the morbidities. In this pursuit, in this work, a novel deep-learning structure is framed for better classification of lung sounds with the amalgamation of features extracted using the Empirical mode decomposition technique and improved network models. In this paper, a two-stage approach is proposed to classify the acoustic files from the ICBHI benchmark dataset. At the first stage, intrinsic mode function (IMF) feature vectors are extracted from lung sounds and the best combination of IMF features to classify respiratory disorders is found. In the next stage, Gammatone filters are applied on the best combination IMF features and Gammatone cepstral coefficients (GTCC) are computed. The GTCC are input to the deep-learning model, Recurrent Neural Network-based stacked BiLSTM classifier for classification. It is observed that the IMF 3 has more meaningful information and enhances the performance in conjunction with GTCCs compared to other IMFs and MFCC. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the proposed GTCC of the third IMF component applied to the stacked BiLSTM framework excels the competing Convolutional Neural Network method of classification in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {Based on the partial persistence of excitation (PE), the recent deterministic learning theory of adaptive RBF neural network (RBFNN) control can just guarantee that the partial weights of RBFNNs converge to their optimal values. This paper proposes two kinds of adaptive feedforward RBFNN control frameworks with a more deterministic learning mechanism: the reduced lattice scheme and the optimized scheme. Specifically, the RBFNNs satisfy a standard PE condition and the PE levels are deterministic. The reduced lattice scheme removes the insignificant hidden nodes from the lattice scheme, whereas the optimized scheme calculates the distribution of hidden nodes to optimally distribute along the desired trajectory by the K-means algorithm. Under the proposed method, the weights of all the hidden nodes converge to their optimal values, while a deeper insight on the convergence rate of the weights of the RBFNN is drawn. Comparative simulation experiments demonstrate that the optimized scheme outperforms both the reduced lattice scheme and the traditional lattice scheme from the perspectives of both the approximate performance and the PE level. Furthermore, when the sampling frequency is low, both the optimized and reduced lattice schemes achieve better tracking performance than the model-based scheme.},

A switched vertices approach is proposed to remove the bound assumptions on the derivative of time-varying parameters in the previous works. To fully facilitate the delay information and the slope information of activation function, some delay-dependent activation function inequalities are constructed under a separation of the estimation error of activation function. Based on these ingredients, a novel result on $$H_{\infty }$$ performance state estimation for MNNs is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which is more practical and less conservative.

  abstract     = {The prediction of a volatile stock market is a challenging task. While various neural networks are integrated to address stock trend prediction problems, the weight initialization of such networks plays a crucial role. In this article, we adopt feed-forward Vanilla Neural Network (VNN) and propose a novel application of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) for weight initialization of VNN model. VNN consists of an input layer, a single hidden layer, and an output layer; the edges connecting neurons in the input layer and the hidden layer are generally initialized with random weights. While PCC is primarily used to find the correlation between two variables, we propose to apply PCC for weight initialization instead of random initialization (RI) for a VNN model to enhance the prediction performance. We also introduce the application of Absolute PCC (APCC) for weight initialization and analyze the effects of RI, PCC, and APCC values as weights for a VNN model. We conduct an empirical study using these concepts to predict the stock trend and evaluate these three weight initialization techniques on ten years of stock trading archival data of Reliance Industries, Infosys Ltd, HDFC Bank, and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories for the duration of years 2008 to 2017 for continuous as well as discrete data representations. We further evaluate the applicability of these weight initialization techniques using an ablation study on the considered features and analyze the prediction performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed weight initialization techniques, PCC and APCC, provide higher or comparable results as compared to RI, and the statistical significance of the same is carried out.},

In the proposed algorithm, the genetic and simulated annealing algorithms have respective global and local search inclinations covering each other&#39;s shortcomings. A novel theorem is presented and applied to produce a semi-conducted initial population. In a used genetic algorithm with a global trend, the crossover operator is performed to explore search space. The thermodynamic simulated annealing algorithm is utilized to improve the efficiency, which considers entropy and energy difference concepts in the cooling schedule process. After obtaining a suitable solution, one of the three novel neighbor operators is randomly called to enhance the given solution potentially. In this way, the efficient balance between exploration and exploitation in the search space is achieved. Simulation results prove that the proposed hybrid algorithm has 10.17\%, 9.31\%, 7.76\%, and 8.21\% dominance in terms of makespan, schedule length ratio, speedup, and efficiency against other comparative algorithms.},

In this work, we present a novel and robust training scheme that integrates visual explanation techniques in the learning process. Unlike the attention mechanisms that focus on the relevant parts of images, we aim to improve the robustness of the model by making it pay attention to other regions as well. Broadly speaking, the idea is to distract the classifier in the learning process by forcing it to focus not only on relevant regions but also on those that, a priori, are not so informative for the discrimination of the class. We tested the proposed approach by embedding it into the learning process of a convolutional neural network for the analysis and classification of two well-known datasets, namely Stanford cars and FGVC-Aircraft. Furthermore, we evaluated our model on a real-case scenario for the classification of egocentric images, allowing us to obtain relevant information about peoples’ lifestyles. In particular, we work on the challenging EgoFoodPlaces dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with a lower level of complexity.

Past efforts of damage detection using images have mainly considered cross-domain transfer learning approaches using pre-trained ImageNet models that are subsequently fine-tuned for the target task. However, there are rising concerns about the generalizability of ImageNet representations for specific target domains, such as for visual inspection and medical imaging. We, therefore, evaluate a combination of in-domain and cross-domain transfer learning strategies for damage detection in bridges. We perform comprehensive comparisons to study the impact of cross-domain and in-domain transfer, with various initialization strategies, using six publicly available visual inspection datasets. The pre-trained models are also evaluated for their ability to cope with the extremely low-data regime. We show that the combination of cross-domain and in-domain transfer persistently shows superior performance specially with tiny datasets. Likewise, we also provide visual explanations of predictive models to enable algorithmic transparency and provide insights to experts about the intrinsic decision logic of typically black-box deep models.},

One way of identifying COVID-19 is by computed tomography (CT) images. Some segmentation methods are proposed to extract regions of interest from COVID-19 CT images to improve the classification. In this paper, an efficient version of the recent manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm is proposed based on the oppositionbased learning called the MRFO-OBL algorithm. The original MRFO algorithm can stagnate in local optima and requires further exploration with adequate exploitation. Thus, to improve the population variety in the search space, we applied Opposition-based learning (OBL) in the MRFO’s initialization step. MRFO-OBL algorithm can solve the image segmentation problem using multilevel thresholding. The proposed MRFO-OBL is evaluated using Otsu’s method over the COVID-19 CT images and compared with six meta-heuristic algorithms: sine-cosine algorithm, moth flame optimization, equilibrium optimization, whale optimization algorithm, slap swarm algorithm, and original MRFO algorithm. MRFO-OBL obtained useful and accurate results in quality, consistency, and evaluation matrices, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index. Eventually, MRFO-OBL obtained more robustness for the segmentation than all other algorithms compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the original MRFO and the other compared algorithms under Otsu’s method for all the used metrics.},

  abstract     = {Experience shows that cooperating and communicating computing systems, comprising segregated single processors, have severe performance limitations, which cannot be explained using von Neumann’s classic computing paradigm. In his classic “First Draft,” he warned that using a “too fast processor” vitiates his simple “procedure” (but not his computing model!); furthermore, that using the classic computing paradigm for imitating neuronal operations is unsound. Amdahl added that large machines, comprising many processors, have an inherent disadvantage. Given that artificial neural network’s (ANN’s) components are heavily communicating with each other, they are built from a large number of components designed/fabricated for use in conventional computing, furthermore they attempt to mimic biological operation using improper technological solutions, and their achievable payload computing performance is conceptually modest. The type of workload that artificial intelligence-based systems generate leads to an exceptionally low payload computational performance, and their design/technology limits their size to just above the “toy” level systems: The scaling of processor-based ANN systems is strongly nonlinear. Given the proliferation and growing size of ANN systems, we suggest ideas to estimate in advance the efficiency of the device or application. The wealth of ANN implementations and the proprietary technical data do not enable more. Through analyzing published measurements, we provide evidence that the role of data transfer time drastically influences both ANNs performance and feasibility. It is discussed how some major theoretical limiting factors, ANN’s layer structure and their methods of technical implementation of communication affect their efficiency. The paper starts from von Neumann’s original model, without neglecting the transfer time apart from processing time, and derives an appropriate interpretation and handling for Amdahl’s law. It shows that, in that interpretation, Amdahl’s law correctly describes ANNs.},

  abstract     = {How to ensemble the high representative ability for discriminating the target from its background and high adaptive ability to fast appearance changes, while keeping the real-time performance simultaneously is still an open topic in the field of object tracking, especially in the complex urban traffic scenes. To address this issue, motivated by that existing excellent trackers may have their advantages in tackling different kinds of tracking difficulties respectively, we propose a new real-time stage-wise object tracking method that allows different trackers to complement each other and combines their respective advantages. A tracker selection agent is trained to learn the policy of switching to the most appropriate candidate tracker according to the current tracking environment. To capture the dynamics of tracking environment effectively, we consider the tracker selection problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process problem. A lightweight deep neural network with the recurrent unit is designed for learning the optimal policy accurately and rapidly. We also elaborately collected Traffic Scenes Object Tracking Annotated Dataset (TS-OTAD) for demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results conducted on TS-OTAD and OTB-100 demonstrate that our method has superior performance than any of the candidate tracker and has a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our stage-wise tracking framework is not limited to any specific tracker, and any excellent tracker can be used as the candidate, which provides a new way for boosting object tracking accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the influence of manufacturing variability of a helicopter rotor blade on its aeroelastic responses. An aeroelastic analysis using finite elements in spatial and temporal domains is used to compute the helicopter rotor frequencies, vibratory hub loads, power required and stability in forward flight. The novelty of the work lies in the application of advanced data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques, such as convolution neural networks (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forests, support vector machines and adaptive Gaussian process (GP) for capturing the nonlinear responses of these complex spatio-temporal models to develop an efficient physics-informed ML framework for stochastic rotor analysis. Thus, the work is of practical significance as (i) it accounts for manufacturing uncertainties, (ii) accurately quantifies their effects on nonlinear response of rotor blade and (iii) makes the computationally expensive simulations viable by the use of ML. A rigorous performance assessment of the aforementioned approaches is presented by demonstrating validation on the training dataset and prediction on the test dataset. The contribution of the study lies in the following findings: (i) The uncertainty in composite material and geometric properties can lead to significant variations in the rotor aeroelastic responses and thereby highlighting that the consideration of manufacturing variability in analyzing helicopter rotors is crucial for assessing their behaviour in real-life scenarios. (ii) Precisely, the substantial effect of uncertainty has been observed on the six vibratory hub loads and the damping with the highest impact on the yawing hub moment. Therefore, sufficient factor of safety should be considered in the design to alleviate the effects of perturbation in the simulation results. (iii) Although advanced ML techniques are harder to train, the optimal model configuration is capable of approximating the nonlinear response trends accurately. GP and CNN followed by MLP achieved satisfactory performance. Excellent accuracy achieved by the above ML techniques demonstrates their potential for application in the optimization of rotors under uncertainty.},

Thus, it is used in tasks as diverse as analyzing population data, spatial locations in 2D sensor readings, or reconstructing scenes from 3D scans. In this paper, we introduce a learned, data-driven deep density estimation (DDE) to infer PDFs in an accurate and efficient manner, while being independent of domain dimensionality or sample size. Furthermore, we do not require access to the original PDF during estimation, neither in parametric form, nor as priors, or in the form of many samples. This is enabled by training an unstructured convolutional neural network on an infinite stream of synthetic PDFs, as unbound amounts of synthetic training data generalize better across a deck of natural PDFs than any natural finite training data will do. Thus, we hope that our publicly available DDE method will be beneficial in many areas of data analysis, where continuous models are to be estimated from discrete observations.},

Then, the normative idea of ‘optimal’ alternatives is discussed in this context. We argue that the meaning of ‘optimality’ can be adjusted to fit in with the structure of each problem. A sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal alternative for unrestricted sets of alternatives is proven. This result means a counterpart of Weierstrass extreme value theorem for softarisons; thus, it links soft topology with the act of choice. We also provide a decision-making procedure—the minimax algorithm—when the alternatives are compared through a softarison. A case-study in the context of group interviews illustrates both the application of softarisons as an evaluation tool, and the computation of minimax solutions.},

For each neural network model, we used its predictions as inputs to predict steps forward, iteratively, to examine the accuracy of the proposed models, for horizons that are both inside and outside to that defined by Lyapunov time. The results show that the deep learning GRU neural network produces iterative predictions of high accuracy and stability, following the trend evolution of actual values, even outside the safe horizon for 1-step and 10-step cases.},

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve appealing performance in object detection compared to hand-crafted methods, with single shot multiBox detector (SSD) being one of state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which is able to perform pedestrian detection by not only considering local features but also by incorporating global information into features to make them more discriminative for this task. Specifically, we first integrate feature pyramid network into the SSD detection framework. Next, a Squeeze-and-Excitation network is proposed to encode global information. Hence, the features become more focused on pedestrians, in particular those of small scale and with occlusion. We further introduce a network in network fusion module, which enhances the features by incorporating local details. In this way our framework is able to suppress background information and highlights pedestrian elements. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve comparable detection results to state-of-the-art methods and run an average of 17 frames per second (fps) on NVidia TITAN X GPU with image size of $$600\times 600$$ .},

It has many real-world applications such as airport gate assignment, and hospital layout problem. Designing enhanced optimization methodologies for the QAP is an active research area. In this paper, we present an integrated firefly algorithm (FA) based on mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS), named as FA-MOLS, to solve the QAP. In the optimization process, the FA-MOLS employs three improvements, namely the MOLS strategy, opposition-based learning scheme, and repeated 2-exchange mutation to maintain the balance between exploitation and exploration abilities. By these improvements, it is intended to avoid the trapping in local optima and improve the convergence speed. The performance of the proposed FA-MOLS is validated on different test instances from the literature. Additionally, two real-world QAPs are simulated and investigated, the office buildings of a single company and the layout of hospital departments. The comprehensive experimental simulations and the nonparametric Wilcoxon’s test affirm that the proposed FA-MOLS can provide a highly competitive performance compared with other algorithms from the literature. Therefore, it is concluded that FA-MOLS is an efficient and reliable algorithm for solving industrial quadratic assignment tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cryptography often involves substituting (and converting) the secret information into dummy data so that it could reach the desired destination without leakage. Within symmetric key cryptography, substitution-box (S-box) is often adopted to perform the actual block cipher substitution. To address the nonlinear requirement of cryptography (i.e., ensuring the generated S-box is sufficiently robust against linear and differential cryptanalysis attacks), many chaos-based metaheuristic algorithms have been developed in the literature. This paper introduces a new variant of a metaheuristic algorithm based on Tiki-Taka algorithm, called selective chaotic maps Tiki-Taka algorithm (SCMTTA). Unlike competing works (which typically integrates a single chaotic map into a particular metaheuristic algorithm), SCMTTA assembles five chaotic maps (i.e., tent map, logistic map, Chebyshev map, singer map and sine map) as part of the algorithm itself in order to further enhance ergodicity and unpredictability of the generated solution. Based on a simple penalized and reward mechanism, one best performing chaotic map will be selected in the current cycle, while the poor performing one will miss its current turn. Experimental results on the case study related to the generation of 8 × 8 substitution-box demonstrate that the proposed SCMTTA gives competitive performance against other existing works due to its ability to adaptively modify its chaotic behavior based on the performance feedback of the current search process.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an approach for the optimisation of geological disposal canister loadings, combining high resolution simulations of used nuclear fuel characteristics with an articial neural network and a genetic algorithm. The used nuclear fuels (produced in an open fuel cycle without reprocessing) considered in this work come from a Swiss Pressurised Water Reactor, taking into account their realistic lifetime in the reactor core and cooling periods, up to their disposal in the final geological repository. The case of 212 representative used nuclear fuel assemblies is analysed, assuming a loading of 4 fuel assemblies per canister, and optimizing two safety parameters: the fuel decay heat (DH) and the canister effective neutron multiplication factor k $$_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ . In the present approach, a neural network is trained as a surrogate model to evaluate the k $$_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ value to substitute the time-consuming-code Monte Carlo transport &amp; depletion SERPENT for specific canister loading calculations. A genetic algorithm is then developed to optimise simultaneously the canister k $$_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ and DH values. The k $$_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ computed during the optimisation algorithm is using the previously developed artificial neural network. The optimisation algorithm allows (1) to minimize the number of canisters, given assumed limits for both DH and k $$_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ quantities and (2) to minimize DH and k $$_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ differences among canisters. This study represents a proof-of-principle of the neural network and genetic algorithm capabilities, and will be applied in the future to a larger number of cases.},

However, quantifying the dependency syntactic intimacy (DSI) between word pairs in a dependency tree has not being considered to use in attentional and transformer-based NMT. In this paper, we innovatively propose a variant of Tree-LSTM to capture the syntactic dependency degree (SDD) between word pairs in dependency trees. Two syntax-aware distances, including a tuned syntax distance and a $$\varvec{\rho }$$ -dependent distance, are proposed. For attentional NMT, two syntax-aware attentions based on two syntax-aware distances are proposed for attentional NMT, and we also design a dual attention to simultaneously generate global context and dependency syntactic context. For transformer-based NMT, we explicitly incorporate the dependency syntax into self-attention network (SAN) to propose a syntax-aware SAN. Experiments on IWSLT’17 English–German, IWSLT Chinese–English and WMT’15 English–Finnish translation tasks show that our syntax-aware NMT significantly improves translation quality by comparing with baseline methods, even the state-of-the-art transformer-based NMT.},

In our study, we focused on the wind speed forecasting for the wind farms hosting purpose. A new hybrid architecture is implemented for the forecast of one-day ahead wind speed based on an Adaptive Grey Wolf optimizer (AGWO),the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and the proposed hybrid Encoder-Decoder-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Gated-Recurrent-Unit (ED-CNNGRU) model.The choice of the proposed framework was to overcome the limitation of the hyper-parameters tuning process that depends mainly on the datasets characteristics, to achieve a standard model capable to deal with several time series without adaptation.Where the AGWO is applied for the optimal combination tuning of the SSA window length with the ED-CNNGRU layers, then the AGWO-SSA is used to decompose the original wind speed series into its trend and details components in order to eliminate the fluctuating noise from the original raw data ,followed by the optimized ED-CNNGRU model designed for one day ahead efficient wind speed prediction. The experimental results showed that the proposed architecture outperformed the benchmark models in matter of adaptability and forecasting performance that were validated by a remarkable decrease in the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) , MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) error metrics values.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a fault detection system for photovoltaic standalone applications based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The installation is a communication repeater from the Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro (CHE), public institution which manages the hydrographic system of Aragón, Spain. Therefore, fault-tolerance is a mandatory requirement, complex to fulfill since it depends on the meteorology, the state of the batteries and the power demand. To solve it, we propose an online voltage prediction solution where GPR is applied in a real and large dataset of two years to predict the behavior of the installation up to 48 hour. The dataset captures electrical and thermal measures of the lead-acid batteries which sustain the installation. In particular, the crucial aspect to avoid failures is to determine the voltage at the end of the night, so different GPR methods are studied. Firstly, the photovoltaic standalone installation is described, along with the dataset. Then, there is an overview of GPR, emphasizing in the key aspects to deal with real and large datasets. Besides, three online recursive multistep GPR model alternatives are tailored, justifying the selection of the hyperparameters: Regular GPR, Sparse GPR and Multiple Experts (ME) GPR. An exhaustive assessment is performed, validating the results with those obtained by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Model (NARX) networks. A maximum error of 127 mV and 308 mV at the end of the night with Sparse and ME, respectively, corroborates GPR as a promising tool.},

  abstract     = {Recently, similar entity searching over knowledge graph (KG) has gained much attentions by researchers. However, in rich-semantic KGs with multi-typed entities and relations, also known as heterogeneous information network, relevant entity search is considered as a challenging task due to the ambiguity as well as complexity of user’s queries in realistic applications, such as QA chatbot and KG-based information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called W-KG2Vec which enables to automatically learn the semantic representations of entities in KG by applying the meta-path. The proposed W-KG2Vec is a meta-path-specific model which supports to evaluate both semantic relations as well as the text-based similarity between entities. The combination of text- and structure-based embedding mechanism of W-KG2Vec is promising to achieve better representations of entities in given KGs for handling complex user’s queries. To effectively learn the sequential textual representations of entities’ descriptions, we propose a combination of BERT pre-trained model with LTSM encoder, called BERT-Text2Vec. Then, the text-based similarity between entities is used to leverage our weighted meta-path-based random walk mechanism in W-KG2Vec model. Extensive experiences on real-world KGs (YAGO and Freebase) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model against recent state-of-the-art KG embedding baselines.},

  abstract     = {During the bone drilling process, in case of excessive force can cause breakage, crack initiation and severe damage to bone tissue. Additionally, if drilling temperature rises higher than the generally believed 47 °C, it can cause thermal necrosis phenomenon which leads cell death of the bone tissue. In this paper, using helix angle and point angle as most influential factors, the evolution of process force and temperature are studied at the same time. For this purpose, using a central composite experimental design and preparing the required drills, the experimental tests have been performed on fresh bovine bone. Also, the present study benefits from an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) whose parameters are optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method in order to predict force and temperature. To model the process behavior, the results of performed experiments for training (based on 70\% of the data) and testing (based on 30\% of the data) of the system are utilized. The findings of this research show that the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is capable of properly predicting the force and temperature. Overall, the average errors in estimating the values of force and temperature in the training and test sections are 1.249 and 3.818\%, respectively. After modeling with ANFIS-PSO, the Sobol sensitivity analysis method is used to quantitatively measure the effect of each input parameter over the process temperature and force. The results of sensitivity analysis show that with increasing both helix and point angles, the temperature in bone drilling process is decreased while the force is increased. In addition, it is proved that the sensitivity of temperature and force values to changes in helix angle is slightly higher than changes in drill point angle.},

This paper proposes a new unsupervised learning method Recursive Cascaded Network with a segmentation mask, for two-dimensional medical image registration. Different from the original cascaded network, the network framework into two parts. The first section obtains a pair of image rolls and uses the registration sub-network to predict the deformation vector field from the moving image to the fixed image. The second part introduces anatomical segmentation into the network during training, makes full use of the auxiliary information of the volume, adds an autoencoder to encode the anatomical segmentation, and incorporates it into the learning process of the model in the form of constraints. The local and global ideas are combined to ensure the deformation field’s rationality and improve the distribution. The most important thing is that we propose a formula for calculating the cascaded network’s deformation field used in the test stage to evaluate the relationship between the registration accuracy and the deformation field’s effectiveness. Our experiments show that the system has a better registration effect and less information loss than the current state-of-the-art method. Simultaneously, the cascade method’s accuracy is an improvement at a certain number of layers, and the increase in accuracy needs to sacrifice the effectiveness of the deformation field.},

  abstract     = {In the study of human action recognition, two-stream networks have made excellent progress recently. However, there remain challenges in distinguishing similar human actions in videos. This paper proposes a novel local-aware spatio-temporal attention network with multi-stage feature fusion based on compact bilinear pooling for human action recognition. To elaborate, taking two-stream networks as our essential backbones, the spatial network first employs multiple spatial transformer networks in a parallel manner to locate the discriminative regions related to human actions. Then, we perform feature fusion between the local and global features to enhance the human action representation. Furthermore, the output of the spatial network and the temporal information are fused at a particular layer to learn the pixel-wise correspondences. After that, we bring together three outputs to generate the global descriptors of human actions. To verify the efficacy of the proposed approach, comparison experiments are conducted with the traditional hand-engineered IDT algorithms, the classical machine learning methods (i.e., SVM) and the state-of-the-art deep learning methods (i.e., spatio-temporal multiplier networks). According to the results, our approach is reported to obtain the best performance among existing works, with the accuracy of 95.3\% and 72.9\% on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively. The experimental results thus demonstrate the superiority and significance of the proposed architecture in solving the task of human action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the critical buckling loads of functionally graded material (FGM) plates using an analytical method requires solving complex equations with various modes of deformation to determine the minimum loads. The approach is too complex for application in engineering practice. In this paper, a data-driven model using the artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for the critical buckling load of FGM plates, as an alternative tool for practicing engineers. A database is first developed for randomly selected inputs using an analytical solution based on first-order shear deformation theory for simply supported FGM plates. The database is then divided into a training dataset with 80\% of the data and a testing dataset with 20\% of the data for developing and validating, respectively, the ANN model. The ANN model developed using six hidden layers with 32 nodes in each layer is found to match the data with a coefficient of determination of 99.95\%. Using the ANN model, the stochastic characteristic of the critical buckling load is examined with respect to randomness of the input parameters. The study reveals that along with the dimensional parameters, the critical buckling load is significantly affected by the randomness of the volume fraction ratio and ratio of the modulus of elasticity of the ceramic and the metal.},

  abstract     = {Multicarrier transmission strategy provides great benefits in wireless communication technology. For this reason, all of the waveform contenders proposed for the fifth generation and beyond technologies are built on this strategy. Universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC) is one of the foremost representatives of the related waveform contenders. However, utilizing the multicarrier transmission strategy causes the UFMC to generate transmission signals with high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which leads to serious deteriorations in the communication quality. In order to solve this issue, it is crucial to reduce the PAPR of transmission signal before giving it to the wireless channel. With the aim of developing an efficient PAPR reduction scheme for the UFMC waveform, we first developed a new discrete version of the invasive weed optimization (DIWO) algorithm and integrated it to one of the classical PAPR reduction techniques called partial transmit sequence (PTS) as a phase optimizer. By doing so, we obtained an advanced scheme called DIWO–PTS. The function of DIWO algorithm in this new scheme is to optimize the phase sequences in discrete space. The usage of DIWO as a phase optimizer enables PTS to reach better phase combinations in less number of searches. Thus, it becomes possible to boost the PAPR reduction performance of the PTS scheme to a quite high level. Simulation results support the advantage of DIWO-based phase optimization. In the simulations, neither of the algorithms used for comparison in our paper could reach the performance level achieved by DIWO algorithm due to its efficient optimization capability.},

Therefore, this study concerns the correction to the definition and implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm to resolve this conflict. Moreover, a novel algorithm called double exponential cuckoo search is proposed, in which the discovery probability became adaptive based on the concept of the double Mersenne numbers. The proposed algorithm is compared to nine other variants to find the best variant that makes the discovery probability adaptive. All the variants are compared and tested on 30 and 50 dimensions of CEC2017 benchmark functions. The results have been statistically proved using the sign test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Friedman test. Moreover, multiple graphical methods are also used to visualize the median performance such as Violin plots and mean convergence graphs.

  abstract     = {Graph signal processing has recently emerged as a field with applications across a broad spectrum of fields including brain connectivity networks, logistics and supply chains, social media, computational aesthetics, and transportation networks. In this paradigm, signal processing methodologies are applied to the adjacency matrix, seen as a two-dimensional signal. Fundamental operations of this type include graph sampling, the graph Laplace transform, and graph spectrum estimation. In this context, topology similarity metrics allow meaningful and efficient comparisons between pairs of graphs or along evolving graph sequences. In turn, such metrics can be the algorithmic cornerstone of graph clustering schemes. Major advantages of relying on existing signal processing kernels include parallelism, scalability, and numerical stability. This work presents a scheme for training a tensor stack network to estimate the topological correlation coefficient between two graph adjacency matrices compressed with the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, augmenting thus the indirect decompression with knowledge stored in the network. The results from three benchmark graph sequences are encouraging in terms of mean square error and complexity especially for graph sequences. An additional key point is the independence of the proposed method from the underlying domain semantics. This is primarily achieved by focusing on higher-order structural graph patterns.},

Gradient-based artificial neural network training algorithms support iterative learning and have gained immense popularity for training different artificial neural networks end-to-end. However, training through gradient methods is time-consuming. Another family of training algorithms is based on the Moore–Penrose inverse, which is much faster than many other gradient methods. Nevertheless, most of those algorithms are non-iterative and thus do not support mini-batch learning in nature. This work extends two non-iterative Moore–Penrose inverse-based training algorithms to enable online sequential learning: a single-hidden-layer autoencoder training algorithm and a sub-network-based classifier training algorithm. We further present an approach that uses the proposed autoencoder for self-supervised dimension reduction and then uses the proposed classifier for supervised classification. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves satisfactory classification accuracy on many benchmark datasets with extremely low time consumption (up to 50 times faster than the support vector machine on CIFAR 10 dataset).},

  abstract     = {3D shape classification is a basic but challenging task for point clouds analysis. How to learn the discriminative shape descriptors from point clouds is crucial and difficult for this task. This paper proposes a novel point-to-vector capsule (PVC) network, which can obtain effective 3D shape descriptors from point clouds directly. The entire network contains three main steps. Concretely, we firstly build a hierarchical local feature extraction module with geometric information to capture a series of detailed features on point clouds layer by layer. Subsequently, the high-level features are further extracted by a nonlinear feature mapping and then grouped to obtain different and rich feature vectors. These feature vectors are squeezed and packaged into primary capsules to preserve the integrity of the information. Finally, the features are sufficiently integrated and reorganized by the dynamic routing algorithm to form a 3D shape descriptor with high discriminative ability. Compared with the existing methods, the main difference is that the proposed method avoids the use of global pooling and directly constructs the 3D capsule network with geometric structure information into the point clouds shape descriptor learning process. This could effectively promote classification performance. Experimental results on several challenging point clouds datasets demonstrate the superiority and applicability of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods in 3D shape classification.},

We also find the optimal decision thresholds that minimize the total error probability for each sample size. The experiments conducted on the samples with no more than 100 elements suggest that our method is more accurate and more powerful than the selected standard tests of normality for almost all the types of alternative distributions and sample sizes. In particular, the neural network was the most powerful method for testing normality of the samples with fewer than 30 elements regardless of the alternative distribution type. Its total accuracy increased with the sample size. Additionally, when the optimal decision-thresholds were used, the network was very accurate for larger samples with 250–1000 elements. With AUROC equal to almost 1, the network was the most accurate method overall. Since the normality of data is an assumption of numerous statistical techniques, the network constructed in this study has a very high potential for use in everyday practice of statistics, data analysis and machine learning.},

Subsequently, the resulting image is converted into the DNA sequences by the dynamic DNA encoding rules, and the rules are produced by plain image information and chaotic system. Next, the DNA matrix is permutated by a double random 3D matrix scrambling (DR3DMS), thus every element may arbitrarily move to other position. Thereafter, the permutated matrix is diffused by a plane diffusion of 3D DNA matrix controlled by plain image information (PD3DPI) to resist statistical attacks. Finally, the obtained DNA matrix is transformed into cipher image via DNA decoding rules. Additionally, SHA 256 hash function value of plain image is applied to choose keystreams from the obtained chaotic sequences, which not only solves the problem of repeatedly generating chaotic sequences when encrypting different images, but also results into higher difficulty for hackers to decipher the method by use of plaintext attack.

Hence, advanced optimization techniques are used these days to search for the optimal feature combinations. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a recent metaheuristic that has successfully applied to different optimization problems. In this work, we propose a new variant of WOA (SBWOA) based on spatial bounding strategy to play the role of finding the potential features from the high-dimensional feature space. Also, a simplified version of SBWOA is introduced in an attempt to maintain a low computational complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated on 16 high-dimensional datasets gathered from Arizona State University, and the results are compared with the other eight state-of-the-art feature selection methods. Among the competitors, SBWOA has achieved the highest accuracy for most datasets such as TOX_171, Colon, and Prostate_GE.

From a practical point of view, we propose a novel method that uses the encoder–decoder architecture to disentangle data into two visualizable representations that are encoded as latent spaces. Consequently, the encoded latent space can be used to manipulate data attributes in a simple and intuitive way. The experiments on image dataset and music dataset show that the proposed approach leads to produce complete interpretable latent spaces, which can be used to manipulate a wide range of data attributes and to generate realistic music via analogy.},

In this paper, we aim to transform LDL into scene classification. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic topic model (PTM) to capture label correlations, and propose a method termed as topic-based LDL (TB-LDL). By treating scene classes as documents in the PTM, the discovered topics indicate typical scene patterns, and class-topic distributions provide label measurements on multiple topics. For each topic, scenes with similar label measurements can be considered as neighbouring labels. The label distributions smooth image truth labels based on label correlations, which can formulate the label ambiguity of scene images. Training networks with the label distributions can prevent over-fitting and assist feature learning. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, namely the aerial image dataset (AID) and NWPU_RESISC45 (NR), demonstrate that our method is effective, especially when the amount of training data is limited.},

  abstract     = {A reliable and accurate prediction of the tunnel boring machine (TBM) performance can assist in minimizing the relevant risks of high capital costs and in scheduling tunneling projects. This research aims to develop a novel hybrid intelligent system, i.e., adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-polynomial neural network (PNN) optimized by the imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA), ANFIS-PNN-ICA for prediction of TBM performance. In fact, the role of ICA in this hybrid system is to optimize the membership functions obtained by ANFIS-PNN model for receiving a higher level of performance prediction. Based on previously published works, seven parameters including the rock quality designation, the rock mass rating, Brazilian tensile strength, rock mass weathering, the uniaxial compressive strength, revolution per minute and thrust force were set as inputs to predict TBM performance. Together with the ANFIS-PNN-ICA model, two single model of PNN and ANFIS were also constructed for comparison purposes. These models were designed conducting several parametric studies on their most important parameters and then, their performance capacities were assessed through the use of several performance indices, e.g., correlation coefficient (R). R values of (0.9642, 0.9654 and 1), (0.9482, 0.9671 and 0.9778) and (0.9652, 0.9642, 0.9898) were obtained for training, testing and all datasets of PNN, ANFIS and ANFIS-PNN-ICA models, respectively. These results revealed that the greater prediction capacity can be provided by the ANFIS-PNN-ICA predictive model compared to ANFIS and PNN models and this hybrid intelligent model can be introduced as an accurate, powerful and applicable technique in the field of TBM performance prediction.},

  abstract     = {Univariate time series forecasting is still an important but challenging task. Considering the wide application of temporal data, adaptive predictors are needed to study historical behavior and forecast future state in various scenarios. In this paper, inspired by human attention mechanism and decomposition and reconstruction framework, we proposed a convolution-based dual-stage attention (CDA) architecture combined with Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for univariate time series forecasting. Specifically, we first use the decomposition algorithm to generate derived variables from target series. Input variables are then fed into the CDA-LSTM machine for further forecasting. In the Encoder–Decoder phase, for the first stage, attention operation is combined with the LSTM acting as an encoder, which could adaptively learn the relevant derived series to the target. In the second stage, the temporal attention mechanism is integrated with decoder aiming to automatically select the relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. A convolution phase is concatenated parallelly to the Encoder–Decoder phase to reuse the historical information of the target and extract the mutation features. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method could be adopted as expert systems for forecasting in multiple scenarios, and the superiority is verified by comparing with twelve baseline models on ten datasets. The practicability of different decomposition algorithms and convolution architectures is also discussed by extensive experiment. Overall, our work carries a significant value not merely in adaptive modeling of deep learning in time series issues, but also in the field of univariate data processing and prediction.},

However, due to the high investment and operation costs of these power plants and their destructive effects on the environment, renewable energy sources (RESs) in power networks have been considered an effective alternative to traditional power plants. Optimal scheduling of microgrid in smart grids has a significant impact on reducing energy consumption, environmental pollutants and end-user&#39;s energy prices. In this paper, the influence of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) charging on microgrids&#39; optimal operation is evaluated. To assess the behaviour of PHEVs, three various charging patterns consisting of uncontrolled, controlled and smart charging methods are considered. Uncertainties due to forecast error in the PHEVs, loads, prices and renewable source output power are also considered in microgrid modelling energy management. To deal with the optimisation scheduling of microgrid considering uncertainty, a modified harmony search (MHS) algorithm is used. The suggested scheme is validated using simulations and without the PHEV charging effects compared with the conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the difficulty of controlling ammonia (NH $$_{3}$$ ) flow in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) nitrogen oxides (NO $$_{x}$$ ) decomposition (de-NO $$_{x}$$ ) process with time delay, modeling uncertainties and time-varying parameters, a constrained generalized predictive control (GPC) based on interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) is proposed in this paper. First, the proportional-integral (PI) controller cannot solve the time delay in the SCR de-NO $$_x$$ process due to long de-NO $$_x$$ reaction time, therefore this paper proposes a constrained GPC controller to predict the multistep outlet NO $$_x$$ concentration, where the predictive time domain is greater than the time delay. Second, an accurate process model used in GPC plays an important role in NO $$_{x}$$ control. Thus, this paper designs a novel IT2FNN model as the SCR de-NO $$_{x}$$ process model. IT2FNN which adopts interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) could deal with the modeling uncertainties owing to catalyst activity, uniformity of flue gas and other factors. Meanwhile, to cope with the time-varying parameters because of the fluctuation of load, the parameters of the proposed IT2FNN are updated by the derived algorithms in real time. For reducing computational complexity, this paper adopts the Nie–Tan (NT)-type reduction (TR) operation instead of the Karnik–Mendel (KM) method. Third, under the proposed control scheme, it is theoretically proved that the SCR de-NO $$_{x}$$ system is stable. Finally, the comparative simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed method.},

This work combined deep models with shallow architecture, which resulted in novel hybrid classifiers. Four distinct hybrid models were utilized: deep neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM), deep neural network-Gaussian mixture model (DNN-GMM), Gaussian mixture model-deep neural network (GMM-DNN), and hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN). All models were based on novel implemented architecture. The comparative study used three distinct speech datasets: a private Arabic dataset and two public English databases, namely Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) and Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). The test results of the aforementioned hybrid models demonstrated that the proposed HMM-DNN leveraged the verification performance in emotional and stressful environments. Results also showed that HMM-DNN outperformed all other hybrid models in terms of equal error rate (EER) and area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. The average resulting verification system based on the three datasets yielded EERs of 7.19, 16.85, 11.51, and 11.90\% based on HMM-DNN, DNN-HMM, DNN-GMM, and GMM-DNN, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the DNN-GMM model demonstrated the least computational complexity compared to all other hybrid models in both talking environments. Conversely, the HMM-DNN model required the greatest amount of training time. Findings also demonstrated that EER and AUC values depended on the database when comparing average emotional and stressful performances.},

Recent popularization of graph neural networks has also been spread to KGC. Typical techniques like SACN achieve dramatic achievements and beat previous state-of-the-art. However, those models still lack the ability to distinguish different local structures within a graph, which leads to the over smoothing problem. In this work, we propose SD-GAT, a graph attention network with a structure-distinguishable neighborhood aggregation scheme, which models the injective function to aggregate information from the neighborhood. The model is constituted of two modules. The encoder is a graph attention network that improved with our neighborhood aggregation scheme, which could be applied for a more distinct representation of entities and relations. The decoder is a convolutional neural network using $$3\times 3$$ convolution filters. Our empirical research provides an effective solution to increase the discriminative power of graph attention networks, and we show significant improvement of the proposed SD-GAT compared to the state-of-the-art methods on standard FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets.},

  abstract     = {Suspension bridges are critical components of transport infrastructure around the world. Therefore, their operating conditions should be effectively monitored to ensure their safety and reliability. However, the main cables of suspension bridges inevitably deteriorate over time due to corrosion, as a result of their operational and environmental conditions. Thus, accurate annual corrosion rate predictions are crucial for maintaining reliable structures and optimal maintenance operations. However, the corrosion rate is a chaotic and complex phenomenon with highly nonlinear behavior. This paper proposes a novel predictive model for the estimation of the annual corrosion rate in the main cables of suspension bridges. This is a hybrid model based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) technique optimized using marine predators algorithm (MPA). In addition, well-known metaheuristic approaches such as the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm algorithm (PSO) are employed to optimize the MLP. In order to implement the proposed model, a comprehensive database composed of 309 sample tests on the annual corrosion rate from all around the world, including various factors related to the surrounding environmental properties, is utilized. In addition, several input combinations are proposed for investigating the trigger factors in modeling the annual corrosion rate. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated using various statistical and graphical criteria. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed hybrid MLP-MPA model provides stable and accurate predictions, while it transcends the previously developed approaches for solving this problem. The effectiveness of the MLP-MPA model shows that it can be used for further studies on the reliability analysis of the main cables of suspension bridges.},

In this paper, we argue that this attention mechanism may miss opportunity of take advantage of the state information through multiple time steps. Thus, we propose a Gated State Network which manipulates the state information flow with sequential characteristics. We also incorporate a Focal Adaptive Attention Network which utilizes a Gaussian distribution to concentrate the attention distribution to a predicted focal position and its neighborhood. Experimental results on WMT’14 English–German and WMT’17 Chinese–English translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Emperor Penguin Optimizer (EPO) is a recently developed metaheuristic algorithm to solve general optimization problems. The main strength of EPO is twofold. Firstly, EPO has low learning curve (i.e., based on the simple analogy of huddling behavior of emperor penguins in nature (i.e., surviving strategy during Antarctic winter). Secondly, EPO offers straightforward implementation. In the EPO, the emperor penguins represent the candidate solution, huddle denotes the search space that comprises a two-dimensional L-shape polygon plane, and randomly positioned of the emperor penguins represents the feasible solution. Among all the emperor penguins, the focus is to locate an effective mover representing the global optimal solution. To-date, EPO has slowly gaining considerable momentum owing to its successful adoption in many broad range of optimization problems, that is, from medical data classification, economic load dispatch problem, engineering design problems, face recognition, multilevel thresholding for color image segmentation, high-dimensional biomedical data analysis for microarray cancer classification, automatic feature selection, event recognition and summarization, smart grid system, and traffic management system to name a few. Reflecting on recent progress, this paper thoroughly presents an in-depth study related to the current EPO’s adoption in the scientific literature. In addition to highlighting new potential areas for improvements (and omission), the finding of this study can serve as guidelines for researchers and practitioners to improve the current state-of-the-arts and state-of-practices on general adoption of EPO while highlighting its new emerging areas of applications.},

The recent machine translation approach, which consists of two sub networks named an encoder and a decoder, has gained state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks and for several language pairs. The increasing interest of researchers in NMT is due to its simplicity compared to SMT which consists of several components tuned separately. This paper describes the evolution of NMT.

The paper also presents some toolkits that are developed specifically for research and production of NMT systems. The superiority of NMT over SMT is discussed, as well as the problems facing NMT.},

  abstract     = {Although cancer diagnosis research has continuously made breakthroughs in a single indicator, it is a challenging task to improve its multiple joint indicators. This study proposes a multi-category multi-state information ensemble-based classification method. We fuse protein-coding and non-coding genes to construct co-expression profiles, which ensemble the field information of classical genetics and epigenetics. A hierarchical feature selection algorithm based on control groups is put forward to quickly remove irrelevant and redundant features without the bias caused by unbalanced dataset. Multiple heterogeneous diagnosis models, which ensemble multiple diagnosis model structures and model states, are constructed and a competition mechanism is then introduced to automatically select the best model from multiple heterogeneous models without deeply grasping the positive and negative fusion effects between different algorithms and features. We apply the proposed method to classify three high-incidence cancers, in which the classification accuracy and sensitivity are over 99.23\% and the classification specificity is over 97.37\%. This illustrates that the proposed method has upgraded the three joint indicators of cancer diagnosis at the same time. Compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods, the classification accuracy has been improved by 2.23–9.23\%, the sensitivity by 6.25–37.40\%, and the specificity by 0–12.02\%.

The unknown nonlinear functions are approximated by the radial basis function neural networks. Combining with the fixed-time stable theory, backstepping technique and event-triggered control technique, a novel event-triggered fixed-time adaptive controller is designed. The results manifest that the whole signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability. Meanwhile, the tracking error converges to a small residual set within a fixed-time interval.

First, we believe it is the first and the largest Swedish dataset of its kind provided as open access (15,000 high-resolution colour images of the era between 1800 and 1840). We also perform some data mining of the dataset to uncover some statistics and facts that might be of interest and use to genealogists. Second, we provide a comprehensive survey of contemporary datasets in the field that are open to the public along with a compact review of word spotting techniques. The word transcription file contains 17 columns of information pertaining to each image (e.g., child’s first name, birth date, date of baptism, father&#39;s first/last name, mother’s first/last name, death records, town, job title of the father/mother, etc.). Moreover, we evaluate some deep learning models, pre-trained on two other renowned datasets, for word spotting in SHIBR. However, our dataset proved challenging due to the unique handwriting style. Therefore, the dataset could also be used for competitions dedicated to a large set of document analysis problems, including word spotting.},

The efficacy of the algorithm was evaluated by testing the same on a tiny dataset with only 47 samples as well as a large dataset with 170 samples. The UCS of rock samples has some outlier points in the dataset. It is well known that the samples are equally responsible for the end regressor in the case of random forest (RF), extreme learning machine (ELM), least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) primal least squares twin SVR (PLSTSVR), and even few of them act as outliers. Due to this, the prediction performance may degrade. In this study, a new density weighted approach for PLSTSVR is proposed as density weighted least squares twin support vector regression (PDWLSTSVR) in primal space, to deal with input samples in the presence of outliers. Hence, it boosts the performance of PDWLSTSVR in terms of efficiency. Here, the weights are determined with the help of k–Nearest Neighbour (k–NN) distance. Further, the proposed PDWLSTSVR is applied to real-world application like the prediction of the UCS of rock samples. To assess the competence of the proposed PDWLSTSVR, the performance of the models is tested based on different evaluation measures like RMSE, MAE, SMAPE, MASE, SSE/SST, SSR/SST and R2. The result shows that PDWLSTSVR outperforms the RF, ELM, LSSVR and PLSTSVR in terms of all the evaluation measures.},

  abstract     = {The most effective way to communicate between the brain and electronic devices in the outside world is the brain–computer interface (BCI) systems. BCI systems use signals of being through neural activity in the brain to fulfill this function. Traditional BCI systems use electroencephalography (E.E.G.) signals due to their characteristics, such as temporal resolution, cost, and noninvasive nature. However, the inherent complex features make the analysis process very difficult. In addition, its sensitivity to internal and external noise affects performance negatively. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which describes brain hemodynamics, is a noninvasive method and robust against the problems that E.E.G. suffers. We present an effective study examining the effects of E.E.G. and NIRS signals for BCI and investigating the contribution of their combination to performance. Also, a novel classification framework using multiple bandwidth method with optimized convolution neural network (CNN) is proposed. The proposed method classifies the recorded E.E.G. and NIRS signals according to the imagination of opening and closing the subjects&#39; right and left hands. A CNN architecture including fully connected layer optimization using E.E.G. and NIRS signals is trained in an end-to-end manner. Instead of using a single bandwidth as in the literature, multiple bandwidths are used in the training process. In this way, information loss in band filtering tasks is prevented. Performance indicators obtained from experiments performed using the proposed framework are superior to current state-of-the-art methods in the literature in the most significant performance metrics: accuracy and stability. The proposed approach has a higher classification performance than current state-of-the-art methods, with an accuracy performance of 99.85\%. On the other hand, in order to test the performance of the proposed CNN method, a detailed ablation study section on single-band experiments and including analysis of each component is presented.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world problems, the datasets are imbalanced when the samples of majority classes are much greater than the samples of minority classes. In general, machine learning and data mining classification algorithms perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. In recent years, various oversampling techniques have been developed in the literature to solve the class imbalance problem. Unfortunately, few of the oversampling techniques can be spread to tackle the relationship between the classes and use the correlation between attributes. Moreover, in most cases, the existing oversampling techniques do not handle multi-class imbalanced datasets. To this end, in this paper, a simple but effective outlier detection-based oversampling technique (ODBOT) is proposed to handle the multi-class imbalance problem. In the proposed ODBOT, the outlier samples are detected by clustering within the minority class(es), and then, the synthetic samples are generated by consideration of these outlier samples. The proposed ODBOT generates very efficient and consistent synthetic samples for the minority class(es) by analyzing well the dissimilarity relationships among attribute values of all classes. Moreover, ODBOT can reduce the risk of the overlapping problem among different class regions and can build a better classification model. The performance of the proposed ODBOT is evaluated with extensive experiments using commonly used 60 imbalanced datasets and five classification algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed ODBOT oversampling technique consistently outperformed the other common and state-of-the-art techniques in terms of various evaluation criteria.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the interaction of debris flow with different arrangements of buildings and providing an accurate and real-time predictions for the corresponding flow distribution has become a challenging task. Two parts of this problem, namely new constructions and rapid reaction, have made this as a daunting topic. Although the numerical methods can provide precise predictions, their applicability due to the above-mentioned issues is challenging as one has to redo the computations when new buildings are added. In this paper, thus, a deep learning model is developed to efficiently predict the spatiotemporal distribution of debris flow as it interacts with different building arrangements. As such, we employed U-net as the base model, which is combined with the residual network to alleviate the gradient vanishing issue. An autoregressive strategy is proposed to help the model capture the dynamics of the debris flow, where the output at the previous timestep is used as the input to predict the current timestep. A synthetic dataset based on the numerical methods is used to train the residual U-net model. The results indicate that the proposed method can predict the general trend at different timesteps, and its robustness is verified using an extensive sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract     = {There is an increase in the number of people who have changed their country for compulsory reasons due to the wars experienced worldwide. This raises the problem of identifying the regions where these people, called refugees, will live in the countries. In this regard, we determine in this paper where the camps established for refugees living in Istanbul should be located. The presence of many quantitative and qualitative factors which should be handled in determining the best location has enabled this problem to have multi-criteria decision-making structure. In addition, the advantage of fuzzy logic is used to convert the evaluations taken from experts into available numbers and to include them in decision-making process. For this purpose, a novel model with the integration of Pythagorean fuzzy AHP and Pythagorean fuzzy WASPAS methods is proposed for the first time in the literature, to select the best location for the refugee camp. In addition, a comparative analysis is applied to determine the validity of the results obtained and the sensitivity analysis is applied to check the robustness of the model. As a result, the most suitable location for a refugee camp in Istanbul is identified reasonably with the proposed model.},

The closed-loop margin notion is enhanced for MIMO type STC architectures. The adjustment mechanism is composed of only STC structure, and system model is not needed. Optimal values of STC parameters are obtained using the tracking error without any need to estimate the controlled system dynamics. In the proposed control architecture, the prediction capability of SVR and the robustness of the PID controller are combined. The success of the introduced SVR-based MIMO STC has been assessed by simulations carried out on the nonlinear Van de Vusse benchmark system.

The transport phenomena occur in a porous medium along with the viscous dissipation and suction/injection effects. The governing equations expressing the current problem were modified into a solvable form of the mathematical model by applying valid similarity transformations. The function bvp4c in MATLAB was used to solve the attained equations. Two different solutions were achieved, and the stability analysis results designated that the upper branch solution promises stable transport phenomena in the flow region. The study also verified the influences of porosity parameter and nanoparticle volume fraction to broaden the existence range of the dual solutions. The heat transfer performance of hybrid nanofluid is enhanced than ordinary nanofluid. The proposed mixed convection hybrid nanofluid model is significant in the extrusion process, which yields desired heat transfer phenomena, and the disrupted flow phenomena are identified and clarified through the unstable solutions and stability analysis.},

I reanalyzed two datasets regarding category IS: They were coded by a human expert, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a convolutional neural network (CNN). It is visible that in Heckhausen&#39;s origin data category IS produces saw-tooth related curves in the stories across the pictures and that this could potentially better be detected by the RNN than by the CNN or the human coder. Second, I reanalyzed a study that experimentally assessed the DoA with a picture x position effect and rejected it. Here again, only the RNN coded IS-score produces a statistical significant picture x position effect. This shows that because of its sequential structure the RNN detects different phrases in the text that are barely capable by human coder or other neural networks but are related to motive theories.},

  abstract     = {During the last (15) years, improved omics sequencing technologies have expanded the scale and resolution of various biological applications, generating high-throughput datasets that require carefully chosen software tools to be processed. Therefore, following the sequencing development, bioinformatics researchers have been challenged to implement alignment algorithms for next-generation sequencing reads. However, nowadays selection of aligners based on genome characteristics is poorly studied, so our benchmarking study extended the “state of art” comparing 17 different aligners. The chosen tools were assessed on empirical human DNA- and RNA-Seq data, as well as on simulated datasets in human and mouse, evaluating a set of parameters previously not considered in such kind of benchmarks. As expected, we found that each tool was the best in specific conditions. For Ion Torrent single-end RNA-Seq samples, the most suitable aligners were CLC and BWA-MEM, which reached the best results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, duplication rate, saturation profile and running time. About Illumina paired-end osteomyelitis transcriptomics data, instead, the best performer algorithm, together with the already cited CLC, resulted Novoalign, which excelled in accuracy and saturation analyses. Segemehl and DNASTAR performed the best on both DNA-Seq data, with Segemehl particularly suitable for exome data. In conclusion, our study could guide users in the selection of a suitable aligner based on genome and transcriptome characteristics. However, several other aspects, emerged from our work, should be considered in the evolution of alignment research area, such as the involvement of artificial intelligence to support cloud computing and mapping to multiple genomes.},

This problem is concomitant with reducing the active power loss, the total voltage deviation and the voltage stability index of the RDS considering different types of load models (such as constant power (CP), industrial (IL), residential (RES) as well as commercial (COM)). To solve this weighting factor-based multi-objective DG allocation problem, a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, student psychology-based optimization (SPBO), is suggested in this article. A multi-criteria approach (such as the analytic hierarchy process) is employed to optimize the weighting factors involved. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that this novel SPBO algorithm is being used for optimal siting and sizing of DGs in the RDS for different types of load models (like CP, IL, RES and COM) for IEEE 33-bus, IEEE 69-bus and practical Brazil 136-bus RDS. The simulation results attained by the proposed SPBO algorithm are compared with the results provided by recently surfaced Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms. The outcomes prove that the suggested SPBO algorithm is more efficient to solve the optimal multiple DG allocation problem with minimum real power loss, less computational time and prominent convergence rate.},

Decision-makers faced the challenge of accessing adequate and precise information during emergency cases due to the time limitation, inadequate data on and about the disasters and thus decision-making process becomes complex and complicated. A well-advanced and developed mathematical tool is required to respond adequately in the presence of these challenges. The current study investigates the effects of post-flood management plans in Iran through sustainable development features in the possible early time. A new hybrid emergency decision-making approach integrating the best–worst method (BWM), Z numbers and zero‐sum game is proposed to ensure much more effective responses in realistic cases. The importance weights of criteria are computed using the BWM, the payoff assessments of decision-makers are collected employing the Z numbers, and finally, the zero‐sum game method is utilized to rank the alternative of emergency solutions. The proposed hybrid approach assists the decision-makers to deal decisively with the ambiguity associated with the data for assessing and evaluating the emergency circumstances. To show the efficiency of the proposed approach, a real-life example of the Golestan flood of 2019 is presented. More so, a comparison analysis is performed to assess the practicability and feasibility of the proposed hybrid approach. The result indicates that the proposed methodology has considerable merits compared with the existing tools and can adequately deal with these shortages. In this case, the aircraft emergency delivery system of the relief supplies is obtained as the best solution to the problem.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer holds a vital spot amidst the causes of cancer deaths among humans. The best way to maximize the survival rate of the patient with cancer is the prior prediction of cancerous cells. But various traditional methods fail to diagnose cancerous cells in their earlier stage. The traditional methods also lead to reduced accuracy. This paper is a mere attempt to demonstrate the methods for diagnosing the disease earlier and also to enhance the accuracy rate. So, at first, the LIDC dataset is considered to be used in this investigation to deal with the higher volume of the scanned image, to attain maximum accuracy. Second, Gaussian noise is excised using Gaussian and Wiener filter. Here pre-processing is carried out to reduce noise in the images. Third, region growing segmentation is used to achieve accurate segmentation of ROI (Region of Interest). In a region growing segmentation, seed points are selected and the adjacent pixels are merged to attain a larger region. After this, features that are extremely significant for a nodule of interest such as area, perimeter, entropy, intensity, or statistical-based features are extracted. From these extracted features, dimensionality is reduced using deep Gaussian mixture model in region-based convolutional neural network [DGMM-RBCNN]. The proposed model is a network with multiple layer latent variables. Here, at every layer, the variables follow Gaussian distributions. Therefore, DGMM forms a cluster of Gaussian distributions to offer a nonlinear model and to describe the image data more flexibly. To eliminate over-parameterized solutions, Gaussian-based dimensionality reduction by designing an overfitting model is used. This is applied at every layer of architecture thereby giving the outcome in deep mixtures of factor analyses. Here, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, ROC curves, and Martins&#39; correlation coefficient are considered as performance metrics. The simulation was carried out in a MATLAB environment, to achieve an accuracy of about 87.79\% during the 18thepoch for training and testing the image samples. The false-positive rate could also be determined through this investigation. The anticipated DGMM-RBCNN shows a better and best trade-off than the prevailing systems.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional path planning for autonomous robots is a prevalent problem in mobile robotics. This paper presents three novel versions of a hybrid method designed to assist in planning such paths for these robots. In this paper, an improvement on Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, namely Adapted-RRT, is presented that uses three well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Incremental Grey Wolf Optimization (I-GWO), and Expanded Grey Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). RRT variants, using these algorithms, are named Adapted-RRTGWO, Adapted-RRTI-GWO, and Adapted-RRTEx-GWO. The most significant shortcoming of the methods in the original sampling-based algorithm is their inability in finding the optimal paths. On the other hand, the metaheuristic-based algorithms are disadvantaged as they demand a predetermined knowledge of intermediate stations. This study is novel in that it uses the advantages of sampling and metaheuristic methods while eliminating their shortcomings. In these methods, two important operations (length and direction of each movement) are defined that play an important role in selecting the next stations and generating an optimal path. They try to find solutions close to the optima without collision, while providing comparatively efficient execution time and space complexities. The proposed methods have been simulated employing four different maps for three unmanned aerial vehicles, with diverse sets of starting and ending points. The results have been compared among a total of 11 algorithms. The comparison of results shows that the proposed path planning methods generally outperform various algorithms, namely BPIB-RRT*, tGSRT, GWO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, PSO, Improved BA, and WOA. The simulation results are analysed in terms of optimal path costs, execution time, and convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {In the recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) because of their ability to be used as aerial base stations for collecting data from IoT devices have attracted substantial interest in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this paper, a novel method has been proposed to increase the quality of the uplink IoT communications and to decrease the transmission power of IoT devices. For this purpose, to compute the UAVs’ trajectory, association of device-to-UAV and IoT transmission power, a novel objective function has been defined to optimize the link quality and energy consumption in the considered UAV-based IoT system. Then, for optimizing this objective function, a novel constrained version of gravitational search algorithm is proposed, which is an NP-hard problem. In this algorithm, to handle the constraints, a multiple constraint ranking method is used. Moreover, to calculate the value of the parameter of this method, a fuzzy logic controller is used to control the exploitation and exploration abilities and improve the performance of this algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, simulations have been performed and the results were compared with those of the other methods. the experimental results show that an increase in system throughput and a decrease in the energy consumption of the considered UAV-based IoT system can be achieved simultaneously using the proposed optimization algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis (TB) is known as a potentially dangerous and infectious disease that affects mostly lungs worldwide. The detection and treatment of TB at an early stage are critical for preventing the disease and decreasing the risk of mortality and transmission of it to others. Nowadays, as the most common medical imaging technique, chest radiography (CXR) is useful for determining thoracic diseases. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are also crucial mechanisms to provide more reliable, efficient, and systematic approaches with accelerating the decision-making process of clinicians. In this study, we propose voting and preprocessing variations-based ensemble CNN model for TB detection. We utilize 40 different variations in fine-tuned CNN models based on InceptionV3 and Xception by also using CLAHE (contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization) preprocessing technique and 10 different image transformations for data augmentation types. After analyzing all these combination schemes, three or five best classifier models are selected as base learners for voting operations. We apply the Bayesian optimization-based weighted voting and the average of probabilities as a combination rule in soft voting methods on two TB CXR image datasets to get better results in various numbers of models. The computational results indicate that the proposed method achieves 97.500\% and 97.699\% accuracy rates on Montgomery and Shenzhen datasets, respectively. Furthermore, our method outperforms state-of-the-art results for the two TB detection datasets in terms of accuracy rate.},

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task twin support vector machine with pinball loss (Pin-DMTSVM) to enhance the noise insensitivity of DMTSVM. Besides, in order to improve the computational speed of Pin-DMTSVM, we further construct a safe screening rule (SSR) for accelerating Pin-DMTSVM based on the optimality conditions. SSR could identify and pre assign most of the inactive instances before actually solving the optimization problem. So, the computational time will be reduced a lot by solving a smaller problem. More importantly, it can get an exactly same solution as solving the original larger optimization problem, so the classification accuracy will not be affected in theory. Numerical experiments on six benchmark datasets and seven image datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, shunt capacitors are effectively placed in two radial distribution networks with 69 and 85 nodes for the purpose of reducing the sum of capacitor investment cost and energy loss cost by using a novel metaheuristic, called slime mould optimization algorithm (SMOA). The main duty of SMOA is to find the most suitable position of the shunt capacitors and to determine optimal generation of the shunt capacitors over a year with three load levels. In addition to comparison with previous methods in the literature, SMOA is also compared to two other applied methods including bonobo optimization algorithm (BOA) and tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA). The novelty of the paper is to apply three new methods in which SMOA and TSA were developed in early 2020 and BOA was introduced in 2019. The three methods can reach the same success rate of 100\%, but SMOA is more powerful. In fact, SMOA can reach better minimum, mean and maximum total costs, faster convergence speed and more effective stability of fifty independent runs. BOA and TSA cannot find one the same good solution as SMOA even they are run 50 times for each study case. Comparison with previous methods in the literature indicates that SMOA can find better position and more suitable generation for shunt capacitors and it can get less total cost, and use smaller population size and a lower number of iterations. The best result from SMOA is also the main contribution of the study and it is recommended that SMOA should be used for placing capacitors in radial distribution networks.},

Combined the Lyapunov method and graph theory, a systematic method to construct a global Lyapunov function for TSFCCSs is proposed, and then the substantial criteria of global stability at the equilibrium point with the condition of the system topology property are obtained. The theoretical results are suitable for the microgrid which is an application of the coupled control system. The significance of the presented results is that the global asymptotic stability of the microgrid can be achieved at the equilibrium point owing to the proposed secondary nonlinear T-S fuzzy control.

  abstract     = {The paper discusses the development of a new method for automatic generation of information in adaptive information systems (AIS), based on the application of neural network technologies. The analysis of existing approaches for the solution of this problem is carried out, on the basis of which a conclusion is made about the prospects of using neural networks for information generation in AIS. Prevailing public methods (AutoKeras, DEvol, AutoSklearn, AutoGAN) do not allow solving the whole range of selected problems of generating information in AIS in automatic mode. The analysis showed that these methods do not satisfy the following conditions: support for multidimensional input and output data, formation of independent outputs, work with generative adversarial networks and autoencoders, quality assessment of generated output objects of arbitrary type. Therefore, a neural network method for automatic generation of information in AIS was developed; its formalization in the notation of set theory, theoretical grounding, algorithms for solving specific problems in accordance with the developed method are presented. During the experimental research, the practical implementation of the neural network method and its comparison with existing analogues were conducted. The scientific novelty of the method consists in the automatic determination of the class of data generation problems and operations for the preparation and processing of initial data, the use of an iterative approach for the automatic selection of the structure and parameters of the neural network, adaptation of Fréchet Inception Distance and Inception Score metrics for evaluating arbitrary data. The practical significance of the method is shown in the versatility of the approach, increasing the accuracy and reducing the search time for the optimal structure of neural networks, the possibility of integrating different architectures of neural networks (including generative adversarial and autoencoders) for automatic solution of information generation problems. Comparing the neural network method with existing approaches (AutoKeras, DEvol, AutoSklearn, AutoGAN), it was found that the developed method is more functional, exhibits more speed of the structure of neural networks search (3.2 times), and provides comparable accuracy (by 2.3\%).},

  abstract     = {In our world of today developing incredibly fast, load frequency control (LFC) is an indispensable and vital element in increasing the standard of living of a country by providing a good quality of electric power. To this end, rapid and notable development has been recorded in LFC area. However, researchers worldwide need for the existence of not only effective but also computationally inexpensive control algorithm considering the limitations and difficulties in practice. Hence, this paper deals with the introduction of (1 + PD)-PID cascade controller to the relevant field. The controller is simple to implement and it connects the output of 1 + PD controller with the input of PID controller where the frequency and tie-line power deviation are applied to the latter controller as feedback signals also, which is the first attempt made in the literature. To discover the most optimistic results, controller gains are tuned concurrently by dragonfly search algorithm (DSA). For the certification purpose of the advocated approach, two-area thermal system with/without governor dead band nonlinearity is considered as test systems initially. Then single/multi-area multi-source power systems with/without a HVDC link are employed for the enriched validation purpose. The results of our proposal are analyzed in comparison with those of other prevalent works, which unveil that despite its simplicity, DSA optimized (1 + PD)-PID cascade strategy delivers better performance than others in terms of smaller values of the chosen objective function and settling time/undershoot/overshoot of the frequency and tie-line power deviations following a step load perturbation.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven is the use of data to drive knowledge and decisions. This has the potential to produce better results but can also suboptimal based on a misinterpretation of data, faulty data, and/or missing data. It is therefore interesting to study the problem of uncertainties in the data and how to integrate them into the models in order to improve performances. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular data-driven approaches that is not designed to handle the uncertainty of the sensor measurements represented by interval type data. The complete information PCA (CIPCA) is one of the pioneering static approaches in the processing of interval data. Because the process operating conditions and their parameters may vary over time, as well as the oldest data that are not representative of the current process operation, a continuous update of the CIPCA model is necessary. The objective of this paper is to design an adaptive version of the CIPCA methodology for handling complex data, i.e., time-varying and interval data. At each time instant, when a new uncertain measurement of interval type is available, the CIPCA model is recursively updated, where recursive formulas for updating weighted mean and covariance matrix of interval-valued data are proposed. Indeed, the proposed CIPCA approach allows a robust and recursive representation, which improves fault detection and isolation decisions. Based on the updated CIPCA model, the interval $$T^2$$ and SPE statistics are calculated and used to monitor the operating conditions of a process. A wind turbine benchmark is adopted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed adaptive CIPCA method for fault detection and isolation in wind turbines is quite promising.},

Many multi-view subspace clustering methods based on graph regularization build the adjacency matrix directly based on a simple similarity measure between data points for each view. However, these simply constructed graphs are sensitive to light corruptions and even generate misleading manifold. Considering this shortcoming, this paper presents a multi-view subspace clustering algorithm (CGMSC) with a well-defined locally consistent graph regularization. We formulate CGMSC by a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, an adaptive self-weighted multi-view local linear embedding (ASWMVLLE) method is proposed to build the locally consistent geometric relationship between instances. In the second stage, ASWMVLLE is introduced into CGMSC by defining a local graph regularization term about the consensus latent subspace representation, which can not only effectively keep the manifold structure of data, but also ensure the consistency across different views. Experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has good robustness and clustering performance.},

In this work, we propose the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to evaluate if a given animal EGC image was obtained from a healthy individual or one affect by a chronic degenerative disease. In the proposed approach, we have performed the classification task with handcrafted features and deep learning-based techniques, also known as non-handcrafted features. The handcrafted features were obtained from the textural content of the ECG images using texture descriptors, such as the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Moreover, the representation learning techniques employed in the approach are based on different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, such as AlexNet and VGG16, with and without transfer learning. The complementarity between the handcrafted and non-handcrafted features was also evaluated with late fusion techniques. The datasets of EGC images used in the experiments, which are also contributions of this paper, are composed of three different chronic degenerative diseases: Cancer, Diabetes Mellitus, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. The experimental results, supported by statistical analysis, show that the proposed approach can distinguish healthy cells from the sick ones with a recognition rate of 89.30\% (Rheumatoid Arthritis), 98.45\% (Cancer), and 95.13\% (Diabetes Mellitus), being achieved by combining classifiers obtained on both feature scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the process of building electrical load data collection, it is inevitable to introduce different kinds of noises, which makes the observation values deviate from the actual values, thus resulting in high levels of uncertainties. And such uncertainties make it difficult to achieve accurate point prediction of the short-term building electrical load. To improve the rationality of the prediction results and offer more effective information for decision makers, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective algorithm optimized modular fuzzy method which can accomplish the interval prediction for the short-term electrical load. First, one novel single-input-rule-modules (SIRMs)-based distributed interval fuzzy model (SIRM-DIFM) is proposed by replacing the original functional weights of the traditional SIRMs-based fuzzy inference system (SIRM-FIS) with the interval functional weights. Then, a data-driven learning scheme is presented for constructing the SIRM-DIFM. This learning sheme includes two main steps. The first step utilizes the iterative least square method to generate fuzzy rules for the SIRMs and determine the centers of the interval functional weights, while in the second step, the genetic algorithm (GA)-based multi-objective optimization algorithm is adopted to determine the widths of the interval functional weights. Through these two steps, accurate point estimation and reasonable interval prediction results can be achieved. Finally, two building electrical load prediction experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the presented SIRM-DIFM. Simulation results indicate that the proposed SIRM-DIFM can compensate the shortcomings of the low accuracy of the point estimation and the predicted interval can effectively cover the observed data, providing the decision-makers more reliable and useful information.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing complexity and volume of the software, the number of defects in software modules is also increasing consistently, which affects the quality and delivery of software in time and budget. To improve the software quality and timely allocation of resources, defects should be detected at the initial phases of the software development life cycle. However, the existing defect prediction methodology based on high-dimensional and limited data only focuses on predicting defective modules. In contrast, the number of defects present in the software module has not been explored so far, especially using deep neural network. Also, whether deep learning could enhance the performance of defect count prediction is still uninvestigated. To fill this gap, we proposed an improved Convolutional Neural Network model, called metrics-based convolutional neural network (MB-CNN), which combines the advantages of appropriate metrics and an improved CNN method by introducing dropout for regularization between convolutions and dense layer. The proposed method predicts the presented defect count in the software module for homogeneous scenarios as within-version and cross-version. The experimental results show that, on average, across the fourteen real-world defect datasets, the proposed approach improves Li’s CNN architecture by 31\% in within-version prediction and 28\% in cross-version prediction. Moreover, the Friedman ranking test and Wilcoxon nonparametric test reveal the usefulness of our proposed approach over ten benchmark learning algorithms to predict defect count.},

  abstract     = {Sand–cement stabilization is considered as one of the most common in situ methods in the soil improvement practices. Despite the importance of studying some fundamental characteristics such as the stress (q)–strain ( $$\varepsilon$$ ) and the pore pressure (u)–strain ( $$\varepsilon$$ ) behavior of the stabilized soils, very few studies have examined this so far. Hence, this paper aims at adopting an initiative approach which is group method of data handling (GMDH)-type neural network to specifically predict such behavior for cement-treated sands using the consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial test results. To do so, the q– $$\varepsilon$$ and u– $$\varepsilon$$ results from the CU tests are considered on the basis of different variables such as cement content (C), confining pressure (CP), porosity ( $$\eta$$ ) and curing time (D). The obtained data, regarding similar statistical characteristics, are randomly sorted into three groups namely training, validation and testing. Current modeling is based on the first group (80\% of the data), whereas the comparisons are made among other approaches in terms of the last one. Moreover, to achieve more accurate predictions, parameters related to the stress ( $$q_{n - 1}$$ ) and pore pressure ( $$u_{n - 1}$$ ) in the previous strain level are assumed in the modeling. It can be concluded that the two-hidden layer model is capable of accurately predicting the q– $$\varepsilon$$ and u– $$\varepsilon$$ behavior for the testing data, compared to other machine learning methods. By and large, GMDH modeling is strongly suggested as a potent method to estimate the soil mechanical properties like brittle index (IB), maximum strength (qmax), failure strain $$(\varepsilon_{{\text{f}}} )$$ and stiffness (E50).},

  abstract     = {The f-wave extraction (FE) is essential for analysis of atrial fibrillations. However, the state-of-the-art FE methods are model-based, and they cannot well adapt to the QRST complexes with high morphological variabilities which often appear in clinical electrocardiogram (ECG). Recently, the encoder-decoder based deep learning networks have been successfully applied to separate variable speech waveforms. However, how these networks are exploited to extract f-waves from ECG recordings is still unclear. Moreover, these networks require different sources to share the common encoder and decoder, which restricts the effectiveness of source representations. To address these issues, a dual temporal convolutional network called DT-FENet is proposed for single lead FE, which integrates the source-specific encoder-decoder mappings and the information fused attention mechanism to respectively learn the latent masks of f-waves and QRST complexes. The proposed DT-FENet can be considered as a dual-stream extension of the famous Conv-TasNet. Compared to Conv-TasNet, the source-specific encoder-decoder mappings of the DT-FENet can obtain more representative bases and sparser activations in latent feature spaces to facilitate the FE task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning method for single-lead FE. Extensive experiments were conducted on the clinical ECG records, and the experimental results show that the proposed DT-FENet performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art FE methods with less than one tenth of unnormalized ventricular residuals and about twice spectral concentrations. The proposed DT-FENet can provide accurate f-wave information for atrial fibrillations detection using single-lead ECGs.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks are a group of spatially distributed nodes deployed to sense, gather, and transmit data to the sink for further analytics. Due to continuous operations, the battery-equipped sensor nodes (SNs) drain energy rapidly, and replacing them is a hectic task. Wireless energy transfer (WET) is evolved as a promising innovation to recharge the SNs battery wirelessly to address the challenges. A WET is embedded in a vehicle called a mobile charger (MC) and traveled in the network to recharge the SNs. However, scheduling the mobile charger over the network before a sensor node dies is challenging. In this work, we introduced a partial charging strategy to avoid the long waiting time for MC because full recharging of a single node takes a long time. The partial charging strategy preempts the current charging node and moves to the newly requested node to minimize the network’s dead nodes. However, it will increase the traveling distance. Hence, adequate charging time and MC traveling path are required. In this context, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based mobile charger scheduling strategy called dynamic partial mobile charger scheduling using deep-Q-networks (DPMCS). The proposed DPMCS learns from the environment and decides each sensor’s charging duration in an identified tour. Experimental results reveal that the proposed DPMCS outperforms well compared to the existing studies, enhance the lifetime and diminish the dead nodes count.},

  abstract     = {In medical science, collecting and classifying data from various diseases is a vital task. The confused and large amounts of data are problems that prevent us from achieving acceptable results. One of the major problems for diabetic patients is a failure to properly diagnose the disease. As a result of this mistake in diagnosis or failure in early diagnosis, the patient may suffer from complications such as blindness, kidney failure, and cutting off the toes. Nowadays, doctors diagnose the disease by relying on their experience and knowledge and performing complex and time-consuming tests. One of the problems with current diabetic, diagnostic methods is the lack of appropriate features to diagnose the disease and consequently the weakness in its diagnosis, especially in its early stages. Since diabetes diagnosis relies on large amounts of data with many parameters, it is necessary to use machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM) to predict the complications of diabetes. One of the disadvantages of SVM is its parameter adjustment, which can be accomplished using metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), genetic algorithm, or grey wolf optimizer (GWO). In this paper, after preprocessing and preparing the dataset for data mining, we use SVM to predict complications of diabetes based on selected parameters of a patient acquired by laboratory test using improved GWO. We improve the selection process of GWO by employing dynamic adaptive middle filter, a nonlinear filter that assigns appropriate weight to each value based on the data value. Comparison of the final results of the proposed algorithm with classification methods such as a multilayer perceptron neural network, decision tree, simple Bayes, and temporal fuzzy min–max neural network (TFMM-PSO) shows the superiority of the proposed method over the comparable ones.},

For the convenience of digital processor realization, discrete-time expressions of weights updating and errors iteration are inferred by the Taylor expansion. In order to ensure the convergence of performance of this discrete-time model, the relation between the constant C in the equation of error iteration and sampling interval has been discovered by applying Z transform theory. The tracking error of autonomous nonlinear dynamical system will converge to the neighborhood of zero, which has been testified by discrete-time Lyapunov stability theory. For comparative purposes, discrete-time MWNN, Raised-Cosine Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RCRBFNN) and Gaussian Radial Basis Function Neural Network (GRBFNN) are used for solving the problem of autonomous nonlinear dynamical system identification.

Image classification is an area in machine learning and computer vision in which convolutional neural networks have flourished since they have shown remarkable performance in such problems. However, these models suffer in terms of transparency, interpretability and explainability, considered as black box models. This work proposes a novel explainable image classification framework applying it on skin cancer and plant diseases prediction problems. This framework combines segmentation and clustering techniques aiming to extract texture features from various subregions of the input image. Then, a feature filtering and cleaning procedure is applied on these extracted features in order to ensure that the proposed model will be also reliable and trustful, while these final extracted features are utilized for training an intrinsic linear white box prediction model. Finally, a hierarchy-based tree approach was created, in order to provide a meaningful interpretation of the model’s decision behavior. The experimental results have shown that the model’s explanations are clearly understandable, reliable, and trustful. Furthermore, regarding the prediction accuracy, the proposed model manages to achieve almost equal performance score (1–2\% difference on average) comparing to the state-of-the-art black box convolutional image classification models.

We offer a method and algorithm, which make possible fully autonomous (unsupervised) detection of new classes, and learning following a very parsimonious training priming (few labeled data samples only). Moreover, new unknown classes may appear at a later stage and the proposed xClass method and algorithm are able to successfully discover this and learn from the data autonomously. Furthermore, the features (inputs to the classifier) are automatically sub-selected by the algorithm based on the accumulated data density per feature per class. In addition, the automatically generated model is easy to interpret and is locally generative and based on prototypes which define the modes of the data distribution. As a result, a highly efficient, lean, human-understandable, autonomously self-learning model (which only needs an extremely parsimonious priming) emerges from the data. To validate our proposal, we approbated it on four challenging problems, including imbalanced Faces-1999 data base, Caltech-101 dataset, vehicles dataset, and iRoads dataset, which is a dataset of images of autonomous driving scenarios. Not only we achieved higher precision (in one of the problems outperforming by 25\% all other methods), but, more significantly, we only used a single class beforehand, while other methods used all the available classes and we generated interpretable models with smaller number of features used, through extremely weak and weak supervision.

  abstract     = {Our research is devoted to answering whether randomisation-based learning can be fully competitive with the classical feedforward neural networks trained using backpropagation algorithm for classification and regression tasks. We chose extreme learning as an example of randomisation-based networks. The models were evaluated in reference to training time and achieved efficiency. We conducted an extensive comparison of these two methods for various tasks in two scenarios: $$\bullet$$ using comparable network capacity and $$\bullet$$ using network architectures tuned for each model. The comparison was conducted on multiple datasets from public repositories and some artificial datasets created for this research. Overall, the experiments covered more than 50 datasets. Suitable statistical tests supported the results. They confirm that for relatively small datasets, extreme learning machines (ELM) are better than networks trained by the backpropagation algorithm. But for demanding image datasets, like ImageNet, ELM is not competitive to modern networks trained by backpropagation; therefore, in order to properly address current practical needs in pattern recognition entirely, ELM needs further development. Based on our experience, we postulate to develop smart algorithms for the inverse matrix calculation, so that determining weights for challenging datasets becomes feasible and memory efficient. There is a need to create specific mechanisms to avoid keeping the whole dataset in memory to compute weights. These are the most problematic elements in ELM processing, establishing the main obstacle in the widespread ELM application.},

  abstract     = {Specialized data preparation techniques, ranging from data cleaning, outlier detection, missing value imputation, feature selection (FS), amongst others, are procedures required to get the most out of data and, consequently, get the optimal performance of predictive models for classification tasks. FS is a vital and indispensable technique that enables the model to perform faster, eliminate noisy data, remove redundancy, reduce overfitting, improve precision and increase generalization on testing data. While conventional FS techniques have been leveraged for classification tasks in the past few decades, they fail to optimally reduce the high dimensionality of the feature space of texts, thus breeding inefficient predictive models. Emerging technologies such as the metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics optimization methods provide a new paradigm for FS due to their efficiency in improving the accuracy of classification, computational demands, storage, as well as functioning seamlessly in solving complex optimization problems with less time. However, little details are known on best practices for case-to-case usage of emerging FS methods. The literature continues to be engulfed with clear and unclear findings in leveraging effective methods, which, if not performed accurately, alters precision, real-world-use feasibility, and the predictive model&#39;s overall performance. This paper reviews the present state of FS with respect to metaheuristics and hyper-heuristic methods. Through a systematic literature review of over 200 articles, we set out the most recent findings and trends to enlighten analysts, practitioners and researchers in the field of data analytics seeking clarity in understanding and implementing effective FS optimization methods for improved text classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a deep learning model that integrates a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent unit with groups of neighboring stations to accurately predict PM2.5 concentrations at 25 stations in Seoul, South Korea. The deep learning model uses observations obtained from one Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) station, 25 National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) stations, and 28 automatic weather stations (AWSs) throughout Seoul. To train the deep learning model, we use all available meteorological and air quality data observed between 2015 and 2017. With the trained model, we predict PM2.5 concentrations at all 25 NIER stations in Seoul for 2018. This study also proposes a geographical polygon group model that determines the optimal number of neighboring NIER stations required to increase the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration predictions at the target station. Comparing the model measures for each of the 25 monitoring sites in 2018, we find that the geographical polygon group model achieves an index of agreement of 0.82–0.89 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.70–0.83. Compared to the method using only meteorological and air quality data from one target station (average IOA = 0.77) to predict PM2.5 concentrations at the 25 stations in Seoul, the proposed method using geographical correlation-based neighboring NIER stations as polygonal groups (average IOA = 0.85) improves the PM2.5 prediction accuracy by an average of about 10\%. This approach, based on deep learning, can be updated to predict air pollution or air quality indices up to several days in advance.},

  abstract     = {Instance segmentation is one of the image processing problems where deep learning techniques are beginning to show potential. In agriculture, one of its main application is automatic fruit harvesting. This study focuses on its application on strawberry crops, where the development of automatic harvesting machines is of particular interest. At present, the reference methodology to deal with instance segmentation is Mask R-CNN. However, Mask R-CNN requires a large processing power which limits its implementation in real-time systems. This work proposes a new methodology to carry out instance segmentation of strawberries based on the use of a fully convolutional neural network. Instance segmentation is achieved by adding two new channels to the network output so that each strawberry pixel predicts the centroid of its strawberry. The final segmentation of each strawberry is obtained by applying a grouping and filtering algorithm. The methodology was tested using the publicly available StrawDI_Db1 database. The evaluation results show values of mean average precision (mAP) and mean instance intersection over union (I $$^{2}$$ oU) of 52.61 and 93.38, respectively, with a processing speed of 30 fps. These figures mean an increase in precision higher than 15\% and a fps rate six times higher than those obtained in the reference methodologies based on Mask R-CNN. Therefore, the methodology presented in this paper can be considered as the latest reference methodology for strawberry segmentation, meeting the precision and speed requirements needed for it to be used in the automatic strawberry harvesting systems that work in real time.},

In this paper, the fuzzy graph theory is used to analyse the overall performance of India for the SGD 5. To solve this problem, the new concept of pseudo-vertex-covering set of a fuzzy graph to make a well coverage of the entire fuzzy graph with the combined coverage of vertex-covering set and underlying edge-covering set of the fuzzy graph is defined. With this new covering concept of pseudo-vertex-covering set of fuzzy graphs, an analysis of the performance status of India for SDG 5 is made with the individual performance status of all the states/UTs of India. We show a nice covering of the whole country by some particular states/UTs which are actively helping to make the pseudo-vertex-covering of the transformed form of the graph of India as a fuzzy graph. At last, a comparison between the covering score and index score for SDG 5 is given. Here, covering score is a new term in fuzzy graph theory for coverage of a fuzzy graph by some vertices with underlying some edges. Also, an analysis is given which reflecting a clean idea of the methodology for the performance status of India and these help to find the self-governing states/UTs in India for a better performance.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of biomedical images is the method of semiautomatic and automatic detection of boundaries within 2D and 3D images. The major challenge of medical image segmentation is the high variability of shape, location, size and texture of the medical images. Manual segmentation is a time-consuming and monotonous process; therefore, a fully automated segmentation process is highly desirable. UNet is deployed as one of the most popular and generic architectures for medical image segmentation. This paper proposes and deploys two variants based on UNet architecture, namely 2DGA-UNet and 3DGA-UNet for the segmentation of 2D and 3D medical images, respectively. The first variant increases the impact of the 2DGA-UNet framework performance by applying transfer learning with the UNet architecture. We use simple convolutional neural networks from the VGG family known as VGG 16 as an encoder in the 2DGA-UNet network. The critical concept of 3DGA-UNet is to supplement a comprehensive contracting network by successive layers, where upsampling operators replace pooling operators. Such layers, therefore, improve the resolution of the output and further be trained end-to-end from very few images, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed models are evaluated for 2D and 3D medical images on five benchmark datasets including brain tumor segmentation (BRATS 2018 and BRATS 2019), brain lesion segmentation (MICCAI 2008 multiple sclerosis challenge), lung segmentation (NIH tuberculosis chest X-ray dataset, Shenzhen No. 3 Hospital X-ray set, RSNA pneumonia detection challenge), liver segmentation (3D-IRCADb-01 database). The comprehensive results show remarkable performance considering 14 different evaluation parameters for the segmentation of medical images. Besides, the GA-UNet outperforms traditional methods in terms of ACC, i.e., 97.0\% and the DSC of 91.8\%.},

In this study, we proposed a machine learning algorithm based prediction model over retrospective medical records, which are named as SISA (the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus) and SISAL (the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus with Laboratory) datasets. Therefore, we aim to inform the clinicians about the use of machine learning with transfer learning success for diagnosis and comprehensive comparison of the classification performances over the SISA/SISAL datasets in the resource-limited settings that may cause to the small datasets of arboviral infection. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory have achieved 100\% accuracy and 1 of area under the curve (AUC) score, Fully Connected Deep Network has provided 92.86\% accuracy and 0.969 AUC score in the SISAL dataset with transfer learning. Moreover, 98.73\% accuracy and 0.988 AUC score were obtained by Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory for the SISA dataset. Furthermore, Linear Discriminant Analysis (shallow algorithm) has provided reaching up to 96.43\% accuracy.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the dynamics of a non-autonomous tabu learning two-neuron model is investigated. The model is obtained by building a tabu learning two-neuron (TLTN) model with a composite hyperbolic tangent function consisting of three hyperbolic tangent functions with different offsets. The possibility to adjust the compound activation function is exploited to report the sensitivity of non-trivial equilibrium points with respect to the parameters. Analysis tools like bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, and basin of attraction are used to explore various windows in which the neuron model under the consideration displays the uncovered phenomenon of the coexistence of up to six disconnected stable states for the same set of system parameters in a TLTN. In addition to the multistability, nonlinear phenomena such as period-doubling bifurcation, hysteretic dynamics, and parallel bifurcation branches are found when the control parameter is tuned. The analog circuit is built in PSPICE environment, and simulations are performed to validate the obtained results as well as the correctness of the numerical methods. Finally, an encryption/decryption algorithm is designed based on a modified Julia set and confusion–diffusion operations with the sequences of the proposed TLTN model. The security performances of the built cryptosystem are analyzed in terms of computational time (CT = 1.82), encryption throughput (ET = 151.82 MBps), number of cycles (NC = 15.80), NPCR = 99.6256, UACI = 33.6512, χ2-values = 243.7786, global entropy = 7.9992, and local entropy = 7.9083. Note that the presented values are the optimal results. These results demonstrate that the algorithm is highly secured compared to some fastest neuron chaos-based cryptosystems and is suitable for a sensitive field like IoMT security.},

However, in order to effectively integrated PV systems into the power system, many challenges regarding these renewable resources such as extracting maximum power under various conditions should be solved. This paper suggests an enhanced maximum power point tracking (MPPT) by the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and a modified bat algorithm (MBA) to fine-tune the parameters of the controller. The FLC is greatly affected by rule base and membership functions (MFs). The fine-tuning of such parameters cannot be appropriate when accurate information regarding the system is not available. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, the MBA algorithm is utilized to optimize the scaling factors of MFs. Simulation results confirm that the suggested MBA-FLC method can effectively cope with the global maxima under different weather circumstances with high efficiency, faster tracking and stable output.},

  abstract     = {An explicit challenge for mine productivity and personnel’s safety in mechanized underground mines is to envisage the uncontrolled roof displacements, usually occurred in underground roadways. For this purpose, support systems are to be installed to guarantee the proper functionality of underground structures during mining operations. Roof displacement is a reliable indicator to examine stability conditions of tunnels or roadways, which are driven in underground coal mines. In this research, a neuro-fuzzy-based method, namely hierarchical local model tree (HiLoMoT), was employed to predict the roof displacements and consequently indicate the unstable zones in a tailgate roadway. In this regard, the geomechanical and instrumentation information measured from a longwall panel at Tabas coal mine was employed to validate the developed HiLoMoT model. According to the results, the proposed HiLoMoT model could predict roof displacements in reasonable conformity when compared with measured ones. In order to examine the prediction capability of the HiLoMoT model, three indices of the coefficient of determination ( $$R^{2}$$ ), variance accounted for (VAF), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used. Introducing unseen test data, $$R^{2}$$ , VAF, and RMSE were, respectively, obtained as 0.952, 95.13, and 0.0193, which showed high goodness of fit and low error for the proposed model. In comparison with ANFIS as a common fuzzy-based model, HiLoMoT could predict the roof displacement by a nonlinear partitioning based on the incremental tree-construction, which improves the quality of the model without further iteration loops or trial and error. Therefore, the HiLoMoT model may be implemented as a new applicable tool for predicting roof displacements ahead of time in mechanized longwall mining.},

  abstract     = {Question answering system (QAS) can be applied everywhere such as in schools, hospitals, banks, e-commerce websites. A smart QAS that can replace people is what people expect. Therefore, there are a lot of studies to build, develop, and improve QAS. However, QAS used for low-resource languages like Vietnamese is still very limited. So, in this paper, we present a method for building Vietnamese QAS. Except for specific Vietnamese language processes, most of our solutions can also be applied to other languages. We build QAS based on knowledge graph (KG) and convolutional neural network (CNN). KG provides knowledge and deducing ability for QAS. CNN is used to classify questions in the natural language to identify the correct answer to a given question. Moreover, we also use distributed architecture to train the CNN model. On the other hands, we also propose a solution to speed up searching for answers in a large KG by partitioning and indexing KG by using the DM-Tree structure. Besides, we also present experimental results and evaluation results of our model using common metrics to prove the effectiveness of our solution.},

  abstract     = {Marston’s load theory is commonly used for understanding the soil–conduit interaction. However, there are no practical methods available which can estimate the Marston’s soil prism (MSP) width ratio. Moreover, the advent of soft computing methods has made many traditional approaches antiquated. The main purpose of this work is to compare and evaluate the predictive abilities of several machine learning-based models in predicting the MSP width ratio for the reinforced concrete (RC) and corrugated steel (CS) conduits. By utilizing the finite element modelling, a large-scale dataset was generated for the width of the soil prism for both types of conduit material, when buried under sandy soils of varying stiffness. After preparing the required dataset, feature validity technique based on correlation-based feature selection was employed to find the most influential parameters affecting the MSP width. Thereafter, five regression-based data driven models namely artificial neural networks (ANN), least-square support vector regression, extreme learning machine, Gaussian process regression, and multiple linear regression were developed to forecast the MSP width ratio. The results showed that the ANN outperforms the other predictive models for both the conduit types. In addition, due to the excellent overall performance of the ANN, it was translated into functional relationship for predicting the MSP width ratio for RC and CS conduits.},

  abstract     = {Green supplier selection (GSS) is a crucial issue in green supply chain management. CAPS indicate that industries spend yearly USD 25 million per procurement, which is a huge amount that necessitates a systematic GSS to avoid financial catastrophes. Literatures on GSS reveal that researchers have not addressed the issue of missing preferences, consistency of decision matrices, and repairing inconsistencies. Moreover, handling of complex linguistic expressions is another open challenge in GSS. Motivated by these research gaps, a two-stage decision framework was proposed. From the analysis of different linguistic models, it is clear that a double-hierarchy linguistic model is flexible for handling complex expressions. In the preprocessing stage, preferences were imputed using the case-based method. Later, consistency of matrices was determined using the Cronbach’s coefficient, and inconsistent matrices were repaired using the iterative method. In the next stage, new mathematical models were formulated to calculate weights of experts and criteria. Preferences were sensibly aggregated by using the Maclaurin symmetric mean operator, which captures the criteria interrelationship. Green suppliers were prioritized by using the TODIM method. Finally, the practicality, strengths, and weaknesses of the proposed framework were realized by demonstrating a case study of GSS and comparison with other methods. Results infer that the proposed framework (i) is consistent with the existing models, and the values are 0.60, 0.86, and 0.75, respectively; (ii) is robust with 100\% rank-order stability even after adequate weight alterations; and (iii) finally can better discriminate suppliers with a broad deviation range of 0.34–0.35.},

With this research objective, the recent development of the hybrid convolution neural network (CNN) has resulted in the improvement of the accuracy of land use land cover classification of hyperspectral satellite images (HSI) and also provided a new dimension to explore. This paper proposes a variant of the 3D-2D CNN Hybrid model to extract representational features from a different class of land use land cover using different receptive fields in a multi-stack arrangement. The proposed model focused on reducing the number of bands required for classification and training samples but on the other hand improving the diverse representational feature extraction. The paper also explores through experimentation the possible replacement of monotonic activation function ReLu using non-monotonic functions like Swish and Mish in 3D-2D CNN Hybrid models.

Although various methods have been developed to characterize STs, few applications have been reported in tactile discrimination applications. In this paper, a neurocomputing method based on reference spike train (RST) is proposed to establish a neural computation scheme, on which existing ST metrics could be fed into various traditional models directly. Moreover, existing metrics in the field of statistics and vector measurement are introduced together to extract more discriminative features. With the binning technique and feature selection algorithm applied, the neural computation scheme is aimed at taking advantage of as maximal as possible information contained in tactile signals. Based on our designed artificial fingertip, the effect is validated by improving the recognition accuracy from 77.6\% to 83.4\% when it is applied to the discrimination of eight roughness surfaces. Furthermore, properties of RST, such as spike intervals and distributions, are evaluated and it is found that RSTs with uniform distribution perform the best for tactile discrimination.},

This study presents a novel approach for the prediction of life conditions and the classification of metal loss (ML) faults for a group of five pipeline sections of a pipeline system. An intelligent model is developed using artificial neural networks. The historical reports are grouped from the oil and gas industry located in Sudan. The results obtained by a proposed intelligent model are found to be satisfactory based on the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest mean squared error (MSE) values. The model developed with 12 number of hidden neurons accurately predicted the pipeline condition with an overall R2 value of 0.98148, 0.99359, 0.9943, 0.99336, and 0.99084 for the pipeline sections S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, respectively. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to understand the interrelationship between the factors affecting pipeline conditions for all sections of a pipeline system. The remaining useful life for all the sections of the pipeline system has been estimated, and a comparative analysis has been conducted in this work. The significant advantage of the present work is that the developed model can estimate the type of ML due to which the pipeline condition would mostly deteriorate. The deterioration profiles of the selected factors considered for this study have been generated, and the assessment scale has been designed. The proposed approach is more valuable in oil and gas industries to avoid unnecessary inspection costs and to plan the maintenance schedule. This study is progressively worthwhile to organize pipeline inspections and rehabilitation necessities.},

The trivial identity create-and-discard process at higher layers of the protocol stack alone is not sufficient to effectively counter security threats, such as masquerading and Sybil attacks. To counter these attacks, various radio frequency fingerprinting-based solutions are proposed for the identification of the devices. However, these approaches use expansive devices for signal capturing and rely on high sampling rates and large feature sets for analysis. In this paper, we propose a radio frequency fingerprinting-based device identification technique. The proposed technique is tested on 4G-LTE network for combined intra and inter-manufacturer device detection. It uses low-cost software defined radio to capture smartphone emissions at a lower sampling rate, using our proposed preamble threshold-based detection algorithm. The results show that our proposed technique provides classification accuracy of 95.6\% at different SNR levels.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated super performance in most learning tasks. However, a DNN typically contains a large number of parameters and operations, requiring a high-end processing platform for high-speed execution. To address this challenge, hardware-and-software co-design strategies, which involve joint DNN optimization and hardware implementation, can be applied. These strategies reduce the parameters and operations of the DNN, and fit it into a low-resource processing platform. In this paper, a DNN model is used for the analysis of the data captured using an electrochemical method to determine the concentration of a neurotransmitter and the recoding electrode. Next, a DNN miniaturization algorithm is introduced, involving combined pruning and compression, to reduce the DNN resource utilization. Here, the DNN is transformed to have sparse parameters by pruning a percentage of its weights. The Lempel–Ziv–Welch algorithm is then applied to compress the sparse DNN. Next, a DNN overlay is developed, combining the decompression of the DNN parameters and DNN inference, to allow the execution of the DNN on a FPGA on the PYNQ-Z2 board. This approach helps avoid the need for inclusion of a complex quantization algorithm. It compresses the DNN by a factor of 6.18, leading to about 50\% reduction in the resource utilization on the FPGA.},

While the use of prior spatial knowledge, given or learned, might be beneficial, in this work we question this principle by comparing traditional forms of convolution-based neural networks for regression with their respective spatial agnostic versions. Our results show that the typical inclusion of prior spatial information is not really needed in most cases. In order to validate this counterintuitive result, we perform thorough experiments over ten different datasets related to sustainable mobility and air quality, substantiating our conclusions on real world problems with direct implications for public health and economy.

To identify the best candidate word, this paper proposes a hybrid model that ranks the words in the candidate word list. Multiple ranking techniques such as Soundex, Shapex, LCS and N-gram are used standalone, as well in combination, to determine the best technique in terms of F1 score. A dictionary containing 48,551 words is developed from UMC corpus and Urdu newspaper corpus.

In the proposed study, an earthquake with the magnitude of Mw = 6.8 on the Richter scale that occurred on January 24, 2020, in Elazig province, Turkey, is analyzed in detail. Tweets under twelve hashtags are clustered separately by utilizing the Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm with some modifications. The sum-of intra-cluster distances (SICD) is utilized to measure the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm. In addition, SICD, which works in a way of assigning a new solution to its nearest node, is used as an integer programming model to be solved with the GUROBI package program on the test data-sets. Optimal results are gathered and compared with the proposed SSO results. In the study, center tweets with optimal results are found by utilizing modified SSO. Moreover, results of the proposed SSO algorithm are compared with the K-means clustering technique which is the most popular clustering technique. The proposed SSO algorithm gives better results.

  abstract     = {The crow search algorithm (CSA) is a recently proposed population-based optimization algorithm for continuous optimization. Since the original CSA searches for a feasible solution in a continuous search space, it cannot handle binary optimization problems directly. A few binary variants of CSA are presented in the literature. However, these variants search for a new solution in the continuous domain and need transfer functions to adapt the solution to the binary domain. This may cause poor exploration, making some regions in the search space impossible to discover. This paper proposes an effective binary CSA (BinCSA) using bitwise operations that directly searches for a feasible solution in the binary search space. For this purpose, the original update mechanism of the CSA is improved using exclusive-OR and AND logical operators in order to provide a good balance between exploration and exploitation in the binary search space. The effectiveness of the proposed BinCSA is evaluated on the uncapacitated facility location problem (UFLP), one of the most widely investigated pure binary optimization problems. The performance of BinCSA is examined using two different UFLP datasets, ORLIB and M*. The experimental results show that BinCSA obtained the optimal solution for 13 out of 15 instances of ORLIB and 12 out of 20 instances of M*. Moreover, BinCSA exhibits superior performance on ORLIB instances when compared to other methods and is very competitive on M* instances in terms of solution quality and robustness. The source code for BinCSA, as used for the UFLP, is available at https://github.com/3mrullah/BinCSA.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present the novel Deep-MEG approach in which image-based representations of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data are combined with ensemble classifiers based on deep convolutional neural networks. For the scope of predicting the early signs of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), functional connectivity (FC) measures between the brain bio-magnetic signals originated from spatially separated brain regions are used as MEG data representations for the analysis. After stacking the FC indicators relative to different frequency bands into multiple images, a deep transfer learning model is used to extract different sets of deep features and to derive improved classification ensembles. The proposed Deep-MEG architectures were tested on a set of resting-state MEG recordings and their corresponding magnetic resonance imaging scans, from a longitudinal study involving 87 subjects. Accuracy values of 89\% and 87\% were obtained, respectively, for the early prediction of AD conversion in a sample of 54 mild cognitive impairment subjects and in a sample of 87 subjects, including 33 healthy controls. These results indicate that the proposed Deep-MEG approach is a powerful tool for detecting early alterations in the spectral–temporal connectivity profiles and in their spatial relationships.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a systematic benchmarking method called BenchMetrics to analyze and compare the robustness of binary classification performance metrics based on the confusion matrix for a crisp classifier. BenchMetrics, introducing new concepts such as meta-metrics (metrics about metrics) and metric space, has been tested on fifteen well-known metrics including balanced accuracy, normalized mutual information, Cohen’s Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), along with two recently proposed metrics, optimized precision and index of balanced accuracy in the literature. The method formally presents a pseudo-universal metric space where all the permutations of confusion matrix elements yielding the same sample size are calculated. It evaluates the metrics and metric spaces in a two-staged benchmark based on our proposed eighteen new criteria and finally ranks the metrics by aggregating the criteria results. The mathematical evaluation stage analyzes metrics’ equations, specific confusion matrix variations, and corresponding metric spaces. The second stage, including seven novel meta-metrics, evaluates the robustness aspects of metric spaces. We interpreted each benchmarking result and comparatively assessed the effectiveness of BenchMetrics with the limited comparison studies in the literature. The results of BenchMetrics have demonstrated that widely used metrics have significant robustness issues, and MCC is the most robust and recommended metric for binary classification performance evaluation.},

  abstract     = {E-commerce websites produce a large number of online reviews, posts, and comments about a product or service. These reviews are used to assist consumers in buying or recommending a product. However, consumers are expressing their views on a specific aspect category of a product. In particular, aspect category detection is one of the subtasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis, and it classifies a given text into a set of predefined aspects. Naturally, a class imbalance problem occurs in real-world applications. The class imbalance is studied over the last two decades using machine learning algorithms. However, there is very little empirical research in deep learning with the class imbalance problem. In this paper, we propose bidirectional LSTM and GRU networks to deal with imbalance aspect categories. The proposed method applies a data-level technique to reduce class imbalance. Specifically, we employ the stratified sampling technique to deal with imbalanced classes. Moreover, we create word vectors with the corpus-specific word embeddings and pre-trained word embeddings. This word representations fed into the proposed method and their merge modes such as addition, multiplication, average, and concatenation. The performance of this method is evaluated with a confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score with micro-average, macro-average, and weighted average. The experimental result analysis suggests that the proposed method outperforms with pre-trained word embeddings.},

At the beginning, for each class we train a separate one-against-all convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract class-specific features representing person shape. Each class-specific, multivariate time-series is processed by a Siamese multichannel 1D CNN or a multichannel 1D CNN to determine features representing actions. Afterwards, for the nonzero pixels representing the person shape in each depth map we calculate statistical features. On multivariate time-series of such features we determine Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) features. They are determined on the basis of DTW distances between all training time-series. Finally, each class-specific feature vector is concatenated with the DTW feature vector. For each action category we train a multiclass classifier, which predicts probability distribution of class labels. From pool of such classifiers we select a number of classifiers such that an ensemble built on them achieves the best classification accuracy. Action recognition is performed by a soft voting ensemble that averages distributions calculated by such classifiers with the largest discriminative power. We demonstrate experimentally that on MSR-Action3D and UTD-MHAD datasets the proposed algorithm attains promising results and outperforms several state-of-the-art depth-based algorithms.},

This study, for the very first time, proposes a novel approach to annotate the grounded red chili samples using a clustering mechanism at a 550 nm wavelength spectral response due to its dark appearance at a specified wavelength. Later the spectral samples are classified into pure or adulterated using one-class SVM. The classification performance achieves 99\% in the case of pure adulterants and/or red chili whereas 85\% for adulterated samples.

We claim that, just like human semantic cognition is based on multimodal statistical structures, joint statistical modeling of music and dance artifacts is expected to capture semantics of these modalities. We evaluate the ability of this model to effectively capture underlying semantics in a cross-modal retrieval task, including dance styles in an unsupervised fashion. Quantitative results, validated with statistical significance testing, strengthen the body of evidence for embodied cognition in music and demonstrate the model can recommend music audio for dance video queries and vice versa.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing helps users to store and retrieve their data in the cloud online on an as-per-pay basis anytime, anywhere in the world. As a consequence, the security of data stored in the cloud serves as a key concern for cloud consumers due to ongoing hacking incidents in the cloud. Both cloud service providers (CSPs) and consumers face various attacks that pose a serious threat to both the organization and the user. Therefore, a robust intrusion detection system (IDS) needs to be configured to identify and avoid potential attacks in the cloud at an earlier stage. The state-of-the-art IDS system which used shallow machine learning techniques suffered from poor accuracy with a higher false alarm rate and higher response time. To overcome this problem, a hybrid semantic deep learning (HSDL) architecture is developed in this paper by integrating the long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machine (SVM) architectures. The semantic information present in the network traffic is identified using a semantic layer known as the Word2Vec embedding layer. The HSDL model classifies the intrusion present in the text along with its corresponding attack class. The normal text without any trace of intrusion is encrypted using an advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm to enhance cloud storage security, and the optimal key with the largest key breaking time for the AES algorithm is selected using the crossover-based mine blast optimization algorithm (CMBA). The proposed HSDL scheme is evaluated and tested using two real-time intrusion detection benchmark datasets, namely NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.98\% for the NSL-KDD and 98.47\% for the UNSW-NB15 dataset, respectively. The experimental and security analysis conducted proves the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Slope deformation prediction is crucial for early warning of slope failure, which can prevent property damage and save human life. Existing predictive models focus on predicting the displacement of a single monitoring point based on time series data, without considering spatial correlations among monitoring points, which makes it difficult to reveal the displacement changes in the entire monitoring system and ignores the potential threats from nonselected points. To address the above problem, this paper presents a novel deep learning method for predicting the slope deformation, by considering the spatial correlations between all points in the entire displacement monitoring system. The essential idea behind the proposed method is to predict the slope deformation based on the global information (i.e., the correlated displacements of all points in the entire monitoring system), rather than based on the local information (i.e., the displacements of a specified single point in the monitoring system). In the proposed method, (1) a weighted adjacency matrix is built to interpret the spatial correlations between all points, (2) a feature matrix is assembled to store the time-series displacements of all points, and (3) one of the state-of-the-art deep learning models, i.e., T-GCN, is developed to process the above graph-structured data consisting of two matrices. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by performing predictions based on a real dataset. The proposed method can be applied to predict time-dependency information in other similar geohazard scenarios, based on time-series data collected from multiple monitoring points.},

  abstract     = {Speech ‘in-the-wild’ is a handicap for speaker recognition systems due to the variability induced by real-life conditions, such as environmental noise and the emotional state of the speaker. Taking advantage of the principles of representation learning, we aim to design a recurrent denoising autoencoder that extracts robust speaker embeddings from noisy spectrograms to perform speaker identification. The end-to-end proposed architecture uses a feedback loop to encode information regarding the speaker into low-dimensional representations extracted by a spectrogram denoising autoencoder. We employ data augmentation techniques by additively corrupting clean speech with real-life environmental noise in a database containing real stressed speech. Our study presents that the joint optimization of both the denoiser and speaker identification modules outperforms independent optimization of both components under stress and noise distortions as well as handcrafted features.},

  abstract     = {Recent research has raised interest in applying image classification techniques to automatically identify the commodity label images for the business automation of retail enterprises. These techniques can help enterprises improve their service efficiency and realize digital transformation. In this work, we developed a lightweight attention network with a small size and comparable precision, namely MS-DenseNet, to identify the commodity label images. MS-DenseNet is based on the recent well-known DenseNet architecture, where we replaced the regular planner convolution in dense blocks with depthwise separable convolution to compress the model size. Further, the SE modules were incorporated in the proposed network to highlight the useful feature channels while suppressing the useless feature channels, which made good use of interdependencies between channels and realized the maximum reuse of inter-channel relations. Besides, the two-stage progressive strategy was adopted in model training. The proposed procedure achieved significant performance gain with an average accuracy of 97.60\% on the identification of commodity label images task. Also, it realized a 94.90\% average accuracy on public datasets. The experimental findings present a substantial performance compared with existing methods and also demonstrate the effectiveness and extensibility of the proposed procedure.

  abstract     = {Sign languages are used by the deaf community around the globe to communicate with one another. These are gesture-based languages where a deaf person performs gestures using hands and facial expressions. Every gesture represents a word or a phrase in the natural language. There are more than 200 different sign languages in the world. In order to facilitate the learning of sign languages by the deaf community, researchers have compiled sign language repositories comprising of gestures. Similarly, algorithms have been proposed to translate the natural language into sign language, which is subsequently converted into gestures using avatar technology. On the other hand, several different approaches for gesture recognition have also been proposed in the literature, many of which use specialized hardware. Similarly, cell phone applications have been developed for learning and translation of sign languages. This article presents a systematic literature review of these multidisciplinary aspects of sign language translation. It provides a detailed analysis of carefully selected 147 high-quality research articles and books related to the subject matter. Specifically, it categorizes different approaches used for each component, discusses their theoretical foundations, and provides a comparative analysis of the proposed approaches. Lastly, open research challenges and future directions for each facet of the sign language translation problem have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on sign language translation that discusses state-of-the-art research from multi-disciplinary perspectives.},

  abstract     = {The principal motivation of the marine predators algorithm (MPA) is the common foraging technique, including Lévy and Brownian motions in ocean predators coupled with optimal contact intensity policy in predator–prey biological interaction. This paper proposes an improved marine predators algorithm (IMPA), which is an extension of the original MPA. The suggested improvements lead to rapid convergence and avoid local minima stagnation for the original MPA. IMPA controls the active and reactive power injected into distribution systems to minimize the total system losses and the total voltage deviations and maximize the voltage stability and improve the distribution system&#39;s overall performance. On the one hand, the proposed IMPA determines the optimal location and active power (location and size, respectively) of distributed generation (DG). On the other hand, the IMPA controls reactive power by optimally placing and sizing the shunt capacitors (SCs) and determining the PF of DGs. Two standard test systems, 69-bus and 118-bus distribution networks, are considered to prove the proposed algorithm’s efficiency and scalability. Results of the proposed IMPA are compared with those obtained by MPA, AEO, and PSO algorithms. The findings of the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IMPA can effectively find the optimal problem solutions and beats the other algorithms. Moreover, the framework of multi-objective IMPA outperforms based on MPA in terms of the performance measures of diversity, spacing, coverage, and hypervolume.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, many researchers have used chaos maps to encrypt digital images due to their unpredictability, ergodicity, and sensitivity to initial values. This paper introduces a novel image encryption algorithm based on an integrated chaos map and bit-level diffusion technique. First, a novel multi-directional diffusion technique is applied to bit levels of the plain image. The innovative technique shifts bit levels of the plain image vertically and horizontally to eliminate visual information of the plain image. The proposed technique is so strong that is able to create high level of diffusion in just one round of implementation. Second, the integrated chaos map, which is a combination of Sine, Tent, and Logistic maps, is applied to the diffused image to encrypt the image. Also, for the objective of evaluating the performance of the proposed method, this paper presents new evaluation criteria, namely ClosenessNPCR and ClosenessUACI, in the field of number of pixel changing rate and unified average changed intensity, respectively. This paper proves that the novel evaluation criteria are more accurate than the preceding one, which is the mean of the achieved values. The implementation results show that the proposed image encryption scheme reaches a high security level, even more than preceding approaches.},

Hence, to cover these gaps, this study proposes a scenario-based multi-objective programming model to examine the resilient-sustainable routing-allocation problem considering the concept of fairness. The proposed model aims at minimizing total traveling time, total environmental impacts and total demand loss. The fuzzy robust stochastic optimization approach is utilized to cope with uncertain data arisen in disaster conditions. Then, due to the complexity of the research problem, a hybrid approach based on the multi-choice goal programming method and a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the problem in a reasonable time. A case study is then selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and the developed method. Finally, sensitivity analyses have been conducted in some parameters of the model and also the robustness of the solution has been investigated.},

Although SR coefficients enjoy remarkable discrimination nature as a one-to-many relationship, it carries out variable selection at the individual level so that possible inherent group structure is ignored. In order to make the most of information implied in the group structure, this paper employs the exclusive lasso strategy to perform the similarity evaluation in two novel nearest-neighbor classification methods.

So, it was invested an idea of Internet of things technology and intelligent data analysis (&quot;Internet of things&quot; and &quot;Intelligent Data Analysis&quot;) for the construction of an integrated system of Hardware entities and Software entities placed. The aim of this work is to build a programmable system capable of predicting the pollutant concentrations within the next 48 h called intelligent forecaster of concentrations caused air pollution (IFCsAP) and making the machine the primary source of information after these concentrations are collected and stored in real time. On this basis, we will rely on modern technologies to reach this goal. The proposed design is highly efficient, cost-effective and easy to use and can be deployed in all places (environment with concentrations of air pollution). The main objective of the proposed system is to issue periodic reports (within 48 h of the future) based on the information input from different stations in real time. These reports are issued based on the readings of sensors planted at each station. Each sensor has a measurement of one or more concentrations that cause air pollution. Designed system consists of three basic phases: the construction phase of an integrated electronic circuit consisting of several devices (Modern, LoRa, Waspmate Platform, Arduino, Five sensors).},

  abstract     = {Image classification tasks widely exist in many actual scenarios, including medicine, security, manufacture and finance. A major problem that hurts algorithm performance of image classification is the class imbalance of training datasets, which is caused by the difficulty in collecting minority class samples. Current methods handle this class imbalance problem from three aspects: data resample, cost-sensitive loss function and ensemble learning. However, the average accuracy of these common methods is about 95\% and performance gets degenerating dramatically when the training datasets are extremely imbalanced. We propose an image classification method on class imbalance datasets using multi-scale convolutional neural network and two-stage transfer learning. Proposed methods extract multi-scale image features using convolutional kernels with different receptive fields and reuse image knowledge of other classification task to improve model representation capability using two-stage transfer strategy. Comparison experiments are carried to verify the performance of proposed methods on DAGM texture dataset, MURA medical dataset and an industrial dataset. The average accuracy obtained by proposed methods reaches about 99\% which is 2.32\% higher than commonly used methods over all the cases of different imbalance ratio, accuracy increase of 4.0\% is achieved when some datasets are extremely imbalanced. Besides, proposed method can also achieve best accuracy of more than 99\% on the industrial dataset containing only several negative samples. In addition, visualization technique is applied to prove that the accuracy boost comes from advantage of proposed architecture and training strategy.},

  abstract     = {We propose “Deep Autoencoders for Feature Learning in Recommender Systems,” a novel discriminative model based on the incorporation of features from autoencoders in combination with embeddings into a deep neural network to predict ratings in recommender systems. The work has two major motivations. The first is to engineer features for recommender systems in a domain-agnostic way using autoencoders. The second is to develop a method that sets a benchmark for predictive accuracy. In our proposed solution, we build a user autoencoder and item autoencoder that extract latent features for the users and items, respectively. The additional features engineered are the latent features for the users and items, and these come from the bottleneck activations of the autoencoder. Our method of feature engineering is domain agnostic, as the inner-most activations would differ for domains without any additional effort required on part of the modeler. Next, we then use the activations of the inner-most layers of the autoencoders as features in a subsequent deep neural network to predict the ratings along-with user and item embeddings. Our method incorporates additional linear and nonlinear latent features from the autoencoders to improve predictive accuracy. This is different from the existing approaches that use autoencoders as full-fledged recommender systems or use autoencoders to generate features for a subsequent supervised learning algorithm or without using embeddings. We demonstrate the out performance of our solution on four different datasets of varying sizes and sparsity, namely MovieLens 100 K, MovieLens 1 M, FilmTrust and BookCrossing datasets, with strong experimental results. We have compared our DAFERec method against mDA-CF, TrustSVD, SVD variants, BiasedMF, ItemKNN and I-AutoRec methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed solution beats the benchmarks and is a highly flexible model that works on different datasets solving different business problems like book recommendations, movie recommendations and trust.},

  abstract     = {The nodes in the wireless sensor network are furnished with restricted and irreplaceable battery power. The continuous sensing, computation, and communication drain out the energy of sensors very quickly. The optimal utilization of the sensor energy has always been a key issue for all the applications in the wireless sensor network. To manage the energy issue of nodes, various approaches were proposed in the past which focused on designing the proper energy management methods. The clustering of sensors is one of the most popular techniques used to manage the energy-related concerns of networks. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization-based energy efficient clustering protocol (PSO-EEC) is proposed to enhance the network lifetime and performance. The proposed protocol uses the particle swarm optimization technique to select the cluster head and relay nodes for the network. The cluster head is selected by employing the particle swarm optimization based fitness function which considers the energy ratio (initial energy and residual energy) of nodes, distance between nodes and cluster head, and node degree to appoint the most optimal node for the cluster head job. For the data transfer to base station, the proposed scheme uses the fitness value based on residual energy of cluster head and distance to base station parameters to nominate the relay nodes for the multi-hop data transfer to the base station. The performance of the proposed protocol is compared with the various existing approaches in terms of different performance parameters such as energy expenditure, network lifetime, and throughput to evaluate its effectiveness. The proposed scheme has improved the lifetime of the network by 238\%, 136\%, 106\%, and 71\% as compared to the existing MDCH-PSO, MCHEOR, MOPSO, and HSA-PSO techniques used in the simulation results for the comparison purpose. The stability period of the network in proposed scheme is approximately 396\%, 321\%, 246\%, and 126\% more than the existing MDCH-PSO, MCHEOR, MOPSO, and HSA-PSO protocol .},

  abstract     = {Colonoscopy is the “gold” standard for evaluating disease activity in ulcerative colitis (UC). An important area of research is finding a cost-efficient, non-invasive solution for estimating disease activity. We aimed to develop and validate a neural network (NN) model that uses routinely available clinical–biological variables to predict UC activity. Standard clinical–biological parameters and endoscopic Mayo score from 386 UC patient records were collected. A training set (n = 285), a test set (n = 71) and a validation set (n=30) were used for constructing and validating three NN models. The first two models predicted the active/inactive endoscopic disease status through a binary output. The third model estimated the complete endoscopic Mayo score through a categorical output. First model (with seven categorical and 13 continuous input variables) obtained an accuracy of 94.37\% on the test set and 93.33\% on the validation set. The second model (with 12 biological input parameters) achieved an accuracy of 88.73\% on the test set and 83.33\% on the validation set. The third model used the same input variables as the first model obtaining an accuracy of 76.06\% on the test set and 80\% on the validation set. We designed an accurate and non-invasive artificial intelligence solution to estimate disease activity, other than colonoscopy. Our NN model achieved better results than pooled performance metrics of fecal calprotectin (the best non-invasive marker to date) investigated in UC. Given these promising results, we envision introducing of a non-invasive algorithm for routinely predicting disease activity shortly.},

Grey wolves belong to the Canis Lupus species and they act in a number of organization and cooperation while hunting in swarm in nature. Thanks to this heuristic technique, which was created by transferring this collaboration first to the algorithm and then to the code, many engineering problems were quickly solved. Similarly, in this study, inverse kinematics solution, which is an engineering problem, was solved with the grey wolf swarm optimization technique. The results are given in comparison with the traditional grey wolf algorithm and the modified grey wolf algorithm obtained by improving one of the control parameters of this algorithm and with other swarm-based algorithms. According to these results, it has been clearly observed that the grey wolf algorithm produces similar results with other swarm-based algorithms, but the modified grey wolf algorithm produces better values. This shows that the grey wolf optimization algorithm can achieve much better convergence by modifying or strengthening it.},

Currently, DNN is a superior technique of extracting information from massive sets of data in a self-organized method. DNNs have different structures and parameters, which are usually produced for particular applications. Nevertheless, the training procedures of DNNs can be protracted depending on the given application and the size of the training set. Further, determining the most precise and practical structure of a deep learning method in a reasonable time is a possible problem related to this procedure. Meta-heuristics techniques, such as swarm intelligence (SI) and evolutionary computing (EC), represent optimization frames with specific theories and objective functions. These methods are adjustable and have been demonstrated their effectiveness in various applications; hence, they can optimize the DNNs models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent optimization methods (i.e., SI and EC) employed to enhance DNNs performance on various tasks. This paper also analyzes the importance of optimization methods in generating the optimal hyper-parameters and structures of DNNs in taking into consideration massive-scale data.

In this study, based on the shape factor and hardness Shore A of a cork-rubber block, the application of artificial neural networks methodology, for the prediction of apparent compression modulus, was evaluated. A large database with compression test results was used for the training and testing of neural networks. Using the early stopping method, several studies were performed regarding artificial neural networks architecture and training: the number of neurons on the hidden layer, change of training parameters and dataset division method. Neural networks with three neurons on the hidden layer proved to be more efficient without overfitting and presented a good correspondence between predicted and measured results. The use of different methods to divide the dataset through different development stages also influences the model performance. A comparison of performance with other models available in the literature revealed that the chosen ANN model proved, in most cases, to have a better performance regarding these materials.},

This paper introduces a novel approach for effectively and reliably finding vulnerabilities in open-source software programs. In this paper, we are motivated to examine the potential of the clonal selection theory. A novel deep learning-based vulnerability detection model is proposed to define features using the clustering theory of the clonal selection algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first time we have used deep-learned long-lived team-hacker features to process memories of sequential features and mapping from the entire history of previous inputs to target vectors in theory. With an immune-based feature selection model, the proposed approach aimed to improve static analyses&#39; detection abilities. A real-world SA dataset is used based on three open-source PHP applications. Comparisons are conducted based on using a classification model for all features to measure the proposed feature selection methods&#39; classification improvement. The results demonstrated that the proposed method got significant enhancements, which occurred in the classification accuracy also in the true positive rate.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has provided numerous breakthroughs in natural imaging tasks. However, its successful application to medical images is severely handicapped with the limited amount of annotated training data. Transfer learning is commonly adopted for the medical imaging tasks. However, a large covariant shift between the source domain of natural images and target domain of medical images results in poor transfer learning. Moreover, scarcity of annotated data for the medical imaging tasks causes further problems for effective transfer learning. To address these problems, we develop an augmented ensemble transfer learning technique that leads to significant performance gain over the conventional transfer learning. Our technique uses an ensemble of deep learning models, where the architecture of each network is modified with extra layers to account for dimensionality change between the images of source and target data domains. Moreover, the model is hierarchically tuned to the target domain with augmented training data. Along with the network ensemble, we also utilize an ensemble of dictionaries that are based on features extracted from the augmented models. The dictionary ensemble provides an additional performance boost to our method. We first establish the effectiveness of our technique with the challenging ChestXray-14 radiography data set. Our experimental results show more than 50\% reduction in the error rate with our method as compared to the baseline transfer learning technique. We then apply our technique to a recent COVID-19 data set for binary and multi-class classification tasks. Our technique achieves 99.49\% accuracy for the binary classification, and 99.24\% for multi-class classification.},

The proposed framework focuses on conducting a sequence of transformations on the original low-quality time-series data for generating high-quality time-series data, “suitable” for efficiently training and fitting a deep learning model. These transformations are performed in two successive stages: The first stage is based on the smoothing technique for the development of a new de-noised version of the original series in which every value contains dynamic knowledge of the all previous values. The second stage of transformations is performed on the smoothed series and it is based on differencing the series in order to be stationary and be considerably easier fitted and analyzed by a deep learning model. A number of experiments were performed utilizing time-series datasets from the cryptocurrency market, energy sector and financial stock market application domains on both regression and classification problems. The comprehensive numerical experiments and statistical analysis provide empirical evidence that the proposed framework considerably improves the forecasting performance of a deep learning model.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be categorized on the basis of prolonged complication in the retinal blood vessels which may lead to severe blindness. Early stage prediction and diagnosis of DR requires regular eye examination to reduce the complications causing vision loss. Indicative significance of DR forecast and evaluation to help the ophthalmologists in standard screening has prompted the improvement of computerized DR recognition frameworks. This work focuses on automatic DR disease identification and its grading by the means of transfer learning approach using dynamic investigation. Our proposed approach utilizes deep neural network for feature extraction from fundus images and these features are further ensembled with supervised machine learning technique for DR grading. An optimized classification is achieved by applying an ensemble of convolution neural networks (CNNs) with statistical feature selection module and SVM classifier. The learning of classifier is achieved by the feature information transferred from CNN model to the SVM classifier, which results in remarkable performance of the learned models. Statistically optimized feature set utilized for transfer learning technique yields in the classification accuracy of 90.51\% with proposed Prominent Feature-based Transfer Learning (PFTL) method employing Inception V3 model. The cost analysis of the proposed model provides a minimum cross-entropy loss of 0.295 consuming the time of 38 min 53 s, thus, maintaining a trade-off. The generalization ability of the proposed model is established by the performance assessment using latest IDRiD dataset that yields accuracy of 90.01\% for Inception V3 network providing uniform outcomes for all the evaluation parameters. The diagnosis ability of the proposed transfer learning-based model is justified by comparing the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art methods. The optimized PFTL model (CNN + Statistical Analysis + SVM) outperforms other classification algorithms and provides the maximum accuracy improvement of 16.01\% over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a powerful swarm intelligence metaheuristic optimization algorithm called Dynamic Cat Swarm Optimization. The formulation is through modifying the existing Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm. The original Cat Swarm Optimization suffers from the shortcoming of “premature convergence,” which is the possibility of entrapment in local optima which usually happens due to the off balance between exploration and exploitation phases. Therefore, the proposed algorithm suggests a new method to provide a proper balance between these phases by modifying the selection scheme and the seeking mode of the algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, 23 classical test functions, 10 modern test functions (CEC 2019) and a real-world scenario are used. In addition, the dimension-wise diversity metric is used to measure the percentage of the exploration and exploitation phases. The optimization results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which ranks first compared to several well-known algorithms available in the literature. Furthermore, statistical methods and graphs are also used to further confirm the outperformance of the algorithm. Finally, the conclusion and future directions to further improve the algorithm are discussed.},

In this paper, a vehicle driver drowsiness detection method using wearable electroencephalographic (EEG) based on convolution neural network (CNN) is proposed. The presented method consists of three parts: data collection using wearable EEG, vehicle driver drowsiness detection and the early warning strategy. Firstly, a wearable brain computer interface (BCI) is used to monitor and collect the EEG signals in the simulation environment of drowsy driving and awake driving. Secondly, the neural networks with Inception module and modified AlexNet module are trained to classify the EEG signals. Finally, the early warning strategy module will function and it will sound an alarm if the vehicle driver is judged as drowsy. The method was tested on driving EEG data from simulated drowsy driving. The results show that using neural network with Inception module reached 95.59\% classification accuracy based on one second time window samples and using modified AlexNet module reached 94.68\%. The simulation and test results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed drowsiness detection method for vehicle driving safety.},

The IVq-ROFS is a tool to represent the uncertain information with an integer parameter $$q\ge 1$$ , while the connection number (CN) processes the uncertainties and certainties into a single system with three degrees, namely “identity”, “contrary” and “discrepancy”. Driven by these required properties, this paper introduces a q-CN for IVq-ROFSs to represent the information in a more concise way. To this end, we divide the paper into three aspects. First, we define q-CN and a scoring function to evaluate the numbers. Second, we give some new q-exponential operation laws (q-EOLs) and operators over q-CNs in which bases are real numbers and exponents are q-CNs. Moreover, we define an operator based on these laws and derive their properties. Third, a novel MAGDM method for solving decision problems with IVq-ROFS information is illustrated with several examples. The advantages and superiority analysis of the proposed framework are also given to assert the results.},

  abstract     = {The generative adversarial network (GAN) is a state-of-the-art technique in the field of deep learning. A number of recent papers address the theory and applications of GANs in various fields of image processing. Fewer studies, however, have directly evaluated GAN outputs. Those that have been conducted focused on using classification performance, e.g., inception score (IS) and statistical metrics, e.g., Fréchet inception distance (FID). Here, we consider a fundamental way to evaluate GANs by directly analyzing the images they generate, instead of using them as inputs to other classifiers. We characterize the performance of a GAN as an image generator according to three aspects: 1) creativity: non-duplication of the real images; 2) inheritance: generated images should have the same style, which retains key features of the real images; and 3) diversity: generated images are different from each other. A GAN should not generate a few different images repeatedly. Based on the three aspects of ideal GANs, we have designed the likeness score (LS) to evaluate GAN performance and have applied it to evaluate several typical GANs. We compared our proposed measure with two commonly used GAN evaluation methods: IS and FID, and four additional measures. Furthermore, we discuss how these evaluations could help us deepen our understanding of GANs and improve their performance.

The convergence of neural network is analyzed and its state exponentially converges to an optimal solution of distributed optimization under certain conditions. Since no additional conditions are required to guarantee the convergence, the neural network is superior to distributed algorithms based on penalty method, which need to estimate penalty parameters. Compared with some existed approaches, the neural network has the advantage of possessing fewer state variables.

  abstract     = {In the sign language alphabet, several hand signs are in use. Automatic recognition of performed hand signs can facilitate the communication between hearing and none hearing people. This framework proposes hand posture recognition of the American Sign Language alphabet based on a neural network (NN) which works on geometrical feature extraction of the hand. The user’s hand is captured by a 3D depth-based sensor camera. Consequently, the hand is segmented according to the depth features. The proposed system is called ‘Depth-based Geometrical Sign Language Recognition’ (DGSLR). The DGSLR adopted an easier hand segmentation approach, which is further used in other segmentation applications. The proposed geometrical feature extraction framework improves the accuracy of recognition due to unchangeable features against hand orientation or rotation compared to Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Moment Invariant. As a support vector machine (SVM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN), it is used to drive desired outcomes. Since there are 26 different signs in the Sign Language alphabet, a multi-class SVM versus a single SVM classifier with 26 classes by an RBF kernel was used to validate each class. The proposed framework is proficient to hand posture recognition and provides an accuracy of up to 96.78\%. The findings of the iterations demonstrated that the combination of the extracted features resulted in a better accuracy rate in the recognition process in the classification step.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational-wave detection strategies are based on a signal analysis technique known as matched filtering. Despite the success of matched filtering, due to its computational cost, there has been recent interest in developing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for signal detection. Designing these networks remains a challenge as most procedures adopt a trial and error strategy to set the hyperparameter values. We propose a new method for hyperparameter optimization based on genetic algorithms (GAs). We compare six different GA variants and explore different choices for the GA-optimized fitness score. We show that the GA can discover high-quality architectures when the initial hyperparameter seed values are far from a good solution as well as refining already good networks. For example, when starting from the architecture proposed by George and Huerta, the network optimized over the 20-dimensional hyperparameter space has 78\% fewer trainable parameters while obtaining an 11\% increase in accuracy for our test problem. Using genetic algorithm optimization to refine an existing network should be especially useful if the problem context (e.g., statistical properties of the noise, signal model, etc) changes and one needs to rebuild a network. In all of our experiments, we find the GA discovers significantly less complicated networks as compared to the seed network, suggesting it can be used to prune wasteful network structures. While we have restricted our attention to CNN classifiers, our GA hyperparameter optimization strategy can be applied within other machine learning settings.},

It is a symmetric block cipher and considered to be very strong against all known attacks at that time. It uses 64-bit key size and block size, but the advancement in technology results in increasing the speed of the computers and thus makes DES not secure any more. The shorter key size is the weak area of DES. In this article, we have increased the block size as well as the key size from 64 to 128 bits. The internal structure of our proposed mechanism ultimately changed all other components of DES accordingly. By this improvement, our anticipated scheme is more secure due to its robust due to its confusion and diffusion components. The algorithm is applied on the plain text and on images.

Then, DL based Inception v4 network is applied as a feature extractor to extract a useful set of features and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used for classification. An extensive set of simulations takes place to ensure the effective diagnostic performance of the DL-ICH model and the results are investigated under diverse dimensions.

In this paper, we focus on the learnability and robustness of SNNs, obtained by a greedy tight force heuristic algorithm [a Performance Driven Back-Propagation (PDBP)] and a loose force meta-heuristic algorithm [a variant of particle swarm optimization (VPSO)]. From the engineering prospective, all sensors are well justified for a specific task. Hence, all sensor readings should be strongly correlated to the target, and the structure of an SNN should depend on the dimensions of a problem space. The key findings of the research are summarized as follows: (1) The number of hidden neurons of an SNN depends on the nonlinearity of the training data, and the number of hidden neurons up to the dimension number of a problem space could be enough; (2) The learnability of SNNs, produced by error-driven PDBP, is always better than that of SNNs, optimized by error-driven VPSOs; (3) The performances of SNNs, obtained by PDBPs and VPSOs, do not change much for different training rates; and (4) Comparing with other classic machine learning algorithms, such as C4.5, NB and NN in literature, the SNNs, obtained by accuracy-driven PDBPs, win for all tested data sets, and the improvement percentage is up to 32.86\%.

The main idea is to maximize mutual information (MMI) through regularizing key information as follows: (1) the features between original input and the representation of latent space, (2) that between the first convolutional layer output and the last convolutional layer input, (3) original input and output of the decoder to train the model. Therefore, the proposed CVAE is optimized by combining the representations learned across the three different objectives targeted at MMI on both local and global variables with the original training objective function of Kullback–Leibler divergence distributions. It allowed achieving the additional supervision power for the detection of image and vector data anomalies using convolutional and fully connected layers, respectively. Our proposal CVAE combined by regularizing multiple discriminator spaces to detect anomalies was introduced for the first time as far as we know. To evaluate the reliability of the proposed CVAE-MMI, it was compared with the convolutional autoencoder-based model using the original objective function. Furthermore, the performance of our network was compared over state-of-the-art approaches in distinguishing anomalies concerning both image and vector datasets. The proposed structure outperformed the state-of-the-arts with high and stable area under the curve values.},

Initially, predictions are obtained by employing baseline regressors, RFR and RBFNN in terms of error indices. Later, a stacked LSTM forecast engine (SLFE) has been proposed to improve the efficacy, accuracy, and prediction capability of the forecast engine by using leaky rectified linear units (Leaky ReLU) as kernel function. SLFE has been implemented and tested on the datasets acquired from four different wind farms having a temporal locality of 10 min for short-term wind speed prediction. Furthermore, an ensemble of stacked LSTM with RFR, SVR, and RBFNN has also been developed for the comparison. The strength of the SLFE has been evaluated in terms of various performance measures such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R2Score, and explained variance score (EVS). The efficacy of the proposed models is evaluated in terms of performance metrics, MAE, RMSE, R2Score and EVS, 0.043, 0.065, 0.813, and 0.814, respectively, demonstrating the worth of the forecast engine. Additionally, statistical one-way ANOVA is also carried out with multiple independent executions of the proposed algorithm to demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and reliability of the model.},

  abstract     = {Text clustering is considered one of the most important topics in modern data mining. Nevertheless, text data require tokenization which usually yields a very large and highly sparse term-document matrix, which is usually difficult to process using conventional machine learning algorithms. Methods such as latent semantic analysis have helped mitigate this issue, but are nevertheless not completely stable in practice. As a result, we propose a new feature agglomeration method based on nonnegative matrix factorization, which is employed to separate the terms into groups, and then each group’s term vectors are agglomerated into a new feature vector. Together, these feature vectors create a new feature space much more suitable for clustering. In addition, we propose a new deterministic initialization for spherical K-means, which proves very useful for this specific type of data. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we compare it to some of the latest research done in this field, as well as some of the most practiced methods. In our experiments, we conclude that the proposed method either significantly improves clustering performance or maintains the performance of other methods, while improving stability in results.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers have become reality thanks to the effort of some majors in developing innovative technologies that enable the usage of quantum effects in computation, so as to pave the way towards the design of efficient quantum algorithms to use in different applications domains, from finance and chemistry to artificial and computational intelligence. However, there are still some technological limitations that do not allow a correct design of quantum algorithms, compromising the achievement of the so-called quantum advantage. Specifically, a major limitation in the design of a quantum algorithm is related to its proper mapping to a specific quantum processor so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied. This hard problem, known as circuit mapping, is a critical task to face in quantum world, and it needs to be efficiently addressed to allow quantum computers to work correctly and productively. In order to bridge above gap, this paper introduces a very first circuit mapping approach based on deep neural networks, which opens a completely new scenario in which the correct execution of quantum algorithms is supported by classical machine learning techniques. As shown in experimental section, the proposed approach speeds up current state-of-the-art mapping algorithms when used on 5-qubits IBM Q processors, maintaining suitable mapping accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Systems of sensor human activity recognition are becoming increasingly popular in diverse fields such as healthcare and security. Yet, developing such systems poses inherent challenges due to the variations and complexity of human behaviors during the performance of physical activities. Recurrent neural networks, particularly long short-term memory have achieved promising results on numerous sequential learning problems, including sensor human activity recognition. However, parallelization is inhibited in recurrent networks due to sequential operation and computation that lead to slow training, occupying more memory and hard convergence. One-dimensional convolutional neural network processes input temporal sequential batches independently that lead to effectively executed operations in parallel. Despite that, a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network is not sensitive to the order of the time steps which is crucial for accurate and robust systems of sensor human activity recognition. To address this problem, we propose a network architecture based on dilated causal convolution and multi-head self-attention mechanisms that entirely dispense recurrent architectures to make efficient computation and maintain the ordering of the time steps. The proposed method is evaluated for human activities using smart home binary sensors data and wearable sensor data. Results of conducted extensive experiments on eight public and benchmark HAR data sets show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on recurrent settings and temporal models.},

We define spectral filters via the LB operator on a graph and explore the feasibility of Chebyshev, Laguerre, and Hermite polynomials to approximate LB-based spectral filters. We then update the LB operator for pooling in the LB-CNN. We employ the brain image data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) to demonstrate the use of the proposed LB-CNN. Based on the cortical thickness of two datasets, we showed that the LB-CNN slightly improves classification accuracy compared to the spectral graph-CNN. The three polynomials had a similar computational cost and showed comparable classification accuracy in the LB-CNN or spectral graph-CNN. The LB-CNN trained via the ADNI dataset can achieve reasonable classification accuracy for the OASIS dataset. Our findings suggest that even though the shapes of the three polynomials are different, deep learning architecture allows us to learn spectral filters such that the classification performance is not dependent on the type of the polynomials or the operators (graph Laplacian and LB operator).},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the most common among women that leads to death if not diagnosed at early stages. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in decreasing the mortality rate globally. Manual methods for diagnosing breast cancers suffer from human errors and inaccuracy, and consume time. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can overcome the disadvantages of manual methods and helps radiologists for accurate decision-making. A CAD system based on artificial neural network (ANN) optimized using a swarm-based approach can improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis due to its strong prediction capabilities. Artificial bee colony (ABC) and whale optimization are metaheuristic search algorithms used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This paper proposes a hybrid artificial bee colony with whale optimization algorithm (HAW) by integrating the exploitative employee bee phase of ABC with the bubble net attacking method of whale optimization to propose an employee bee attacking phase. In the employee bee attacking phase, employee bees use exploitation of humpback whales for finding better food source positions. The weak exploration of standard ABC is improved using the proposed mutative initialization phase that forms the explorative phase of the HAW algorithm. HAW algorithm is used in simultaneous feature selection (FS) and parameter optimization of an ANN model. HAW is implemented using backpropagation learning that includes resilient backpropagation (HAW-RP), Levenberg–Marquart (HAW-LM) and momentum-based gradient descent (HAW-GD). These hybrid variants are evaluated using various breast cancer datasets in terms of accuracy, complexity and computational time. HAW-RP variant achieved higher accuracy of 99.2\%, 98.5\%, 96.3\%, 98.8\%, 98.7\% and 99.1\% with low-complexity ANN model when compared to HAW-LM and HAW-GD for WBCD, WDBC, WPBC, DDSM, MIAS and INbreast, respectively.},

In this paper, we proposed a new context-aware feature extraction method as a pre-processing step for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based multiclass intrusion detection. Feature selection is also used to reduce the feature space and classification time. For attack-type classification, we used CNN which is generally well-known for its better classification ability on image recognition tasks. We have exploited this ability to develop an IDS that can identify different types of intrusions ranging from 4 to 12 types. In our study, we evaluated our proposed Context-aware Feature Extraction-based CNN IDS on different datasets with multiple classes where it was able to successfully improve classification accuracy compared to the models with no preprocessing steps and other existing methods. We carried out the performance evaluation and comparison using four different datasets, NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, ADFA-LD, and ADFA-WD.

To detect each abnormal behavior, the problem is transformed into a multi-class classification task where it lies into data imbalance representation. In data imbalance setting, minority classes are over-sampled to improve the performance of the classifier. Existing methods are unable to learn the distribution of the minority class and effects the performance of classifier. In this research, we introduced a data generative model (DGM) to improve the minority class presence in the anomaly detection domain. Our approach is based on a conditional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic samples for minority classes. It includes the KL-divergence to guide the model towards the true learning of minority class distribution. In this way, model learns the complex underlying data distribution and generates new samples. We performed experiments over the two benchmark datasets NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 that are publicly available to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

In this paper, we propose a U-net style model for AD diagnosis using 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Combining with deep supervision has been proved to be effective in improving the performance of the model. Our method has been tested on a subset of ADNI dataset and AIBL dataset and achieves a superior average accuracy of $$95.71\pm 1.36\%$$ for AD versus NC (normal control), $$90.14\pm 3.66\%$$ for EMCI (early mild cognitive impairment) versus LMCI (late mild cognitive impairment), $$90.05\pm 2.63\%$$ for AD versus LMCI, and $$87.98\pm 4.54\%$$ for NC versus EMCI, respectively. Besides these binary-classification tasks, we also test this model for multi-class classification task (AD vs. NC vs. EMCI vs. LMCI) and it achieves an accuracy of $$86.47\pm 9.60\%$$ . Furthermore, 3D-Grad-CAM method is used to visualize the focused areas of the proposed model. We find that the proposed model pays more attention to the characteristics of the ventricles, hippocampus, and some regions of cortex, which have been proven to be affected by AD.},

  abstract     = {The main purpose of this study was to predict Turkey’s future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using an artificial neural network (ANN) model trained by a grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm. Gross domestic product, energy consumption, population, urbanization rate, and renewable energy production data were used as predictor variables. To probe the accuracy of the proposed model, the new ANN-GWO model’s performance was compared with the performance of ANN-BP (back propagation), ANN-ABC (artificial bee colony), and ANN-TLBO (teaching–learning-based optimization) models using multiple error criteria. According to calculated error values, the ANN-GWO models predicted GHG emissions more accurately than classical ANN-BP, ANN-ABC, and ANN-TLBO models. According to the average relative error values calculated for the test set, ANN-GWO performs 32.23\% better than ANN-BP, 35.29\% better than ANN-ABC, and 19.33\% better than ANN-TLBO. Using the ANN-GWO model, GHG emissions were forecasted out to 2030 under three different scenarios. The predictions obtained, consistent with a prior forecasting study in the literature, indicated that GHG emissions are expected to outpace official predictions (model prediction range for 2030, 956.97–1170.54 Mt CO2 equivalent). The present study demonstrated that GHG emissions can be predicted accurately with an ANN-GWO model, and that the GWO optimization method is advantageous for predicting future GHG emissions.},

Just as important, we have presented a systematic parameter selection method for finding the optimal fractional parameter values with respect to pattern recognition applications. Finally, an experimental and comparative study was carried out to test the capacity of FrJMs for the image reconstruction, extraction of global and local image characteristics, invariance to RST, sensitivity to noise, ability to recognize similar grayscale images and the computational times of the new descriptors. The proposed descriptors outperformed the recent orthogonal moments with fractional orders.},

  abstract     = {Remaining useful life estimation is gaining attention in many real-world applications to alleviate maintenance expenses and increase system reliability and efficiency. Deep learning approaches have recently provided a significant improvement in the estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) and degradation progression concerning machinery prognostics. This research presents a new data-driven approach for RUL estimation using a hybrid deep neural network that combines CNN, LSTM, and classical neural networks. The presented CNN–LSTM neural network aims to extract the spatio-temporal relations in multivariate time series data and capture nonlinear characteristics to achieve better RUL prediction accuracy. To improve the proposed model&#39;s performance, PSO is handled to simultaneously optimize the hyperparameters of the network consisting of the number of epochs, the number of convolutional and LSTM layers, the size of units (or filters) in each convolutional, and LSTM layers. Besides, the proposed model in this paper, called the CNN–LSTM–PSO, realizes the multi-step-ahead prediction. In the experimental studies, the popular lithium-ion battery dataset presented by NASA is selected to verify the CNN–LSTM–PSO approach. The experimental consequences revealed that the presented CNN–LSTM–PSO model gives better results than other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and deep learning approaches considering various performance criteria.},

  abstract     = {Most super-resolution (SR) methods proposed to date do not use real ground-truth high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) image pairs; instead, the vast majority of methods use synthetic LR images generated from the HR images. This approach yields excellent performance on synthetic datasets, but on real-world poor quality surveillance video footage, they suffer from performance degradation. A promising alternative is to apply recent advances in style transfer for unpaired datasets, but state-of-the-art work along these lines has used LR images and HR images from completely different datasets, introducing more variation between the HR and LR domains than necessary. In this paper, we propose methods that overcome both of these shortcomings, applying unpaired style transfer learning methods to face SR but using HR and LR datasets that share important properties. The key is to acquire roughly paired training data from a high-quality main stream and a lower-quality sub-stream of the same IP camera. Based on this principle, we have constructed four datasets comprising more than 400 people, with 1–15 weakly aligned real HR–LR pairs for each subject. We adopt a cycle generative adversarial networks (Cycle GANs) approach that produces impressive super-resolved images for low-quality test images never seen during training. Experiments prove the efficacy of the method. The approach to face SR advocated for in this paper makes possible many real-world applications requiring the extraction of high-quality face images from low-resolution video streams such as those produced by security cameras. Developers of diverse applications such as face recognition, 3D face reconstruction, face alignment, face parsing, human–computer interaction, remote sensing, and access control will benefit from the methods introduced in this work.},

A novel wavelet neural learning (WNL)-based type-2 fuzzy system controller is devised in this paper to accomplish effective speed control of the BLDC motor with the set specifications. The performance characteristics of the BLDC motor are simulated and analysed based on the wavelet neural learning-based type-2 fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller. This work employs wavelet neural learning to provide inputs to the constructed new type-2 fuzzy PID controller model, and this drives the BLDC motor mechanism. The gain values of the PID controller are tuned with the developed WNL-based type-2 fuzzy system to carry out most operational speed regulation process for the motor mechanism. The developed speed controller model for the BLDC motor is tested for its superiority by performing step variations of the input signal and also for load disturbances. In WNL, to derive the output a wavelet function is applied and this drives the operation of the type-2 fuzzy system PID controller and attains better gain values for speed control operation. The classic slime mould algorithm is used in this contribution to tune the weight coefficients during wavelet neural learning process and due to which the delayed convergence is controlled. Results attained during the simulation process prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed speed controller for the design specifications of the BLDC motor in comparison with the earlier literature contributions made.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a multi-branch deep convolutional fusion architecture is proposed to solve electromagnetic inverse scattering problems. The conventional methods for solving inverse problems face various challenges, including strong ill-conditioning, expensive computational cost, and unavoidable intrinsic nonlinearity. To overcome these difficulties, we designed a novel multi-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct the 3D images of the moisture distribution in stored grain. Inspired by objective-function techniques for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problems, the proposed CNN architecture takes in the scattered-field data and prior information to produce 3D images of the moisture content. With the aim of using inputs of different formats, i.e., a complex-valued vector of scattered-field data and a 3D image of the background moisture distribution as prior information, we propose a multi-branch architecture consisting of decoder-only, and encoder–decoder, convolutional branches. The two branches are later fused to produce the final reconstructed 3D image. To train the CNN, we use the true numerical grain moisture distribution image, which were synthetically generated. The reconstructed moisture distribution images produced by the proposed CNN show that the network is not only able to reconstruct the 3D moisture distribution images directly from measured scattered-field data for high contrast objects-of-interest, but it also achieves a higher imaging quality compared with traditional inversion techniques in microwave imaging. Quantitative evaluations are reported using receiver operating characteristics curves for the hotspot detectability and RMS error. The proposed approach opens a novel path for the deep learning-based real-time quantitative microwave imaging.},

In order to show the capability of the proposed mechanism, three different payloads and noise cases are studied in the real-time control experiments of flexible-joint manipulator and tracking results are compared with three more non-model-based controllers which are conventional adaptive fuzzy control, indirect adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller and proportional–integrative–derivative control.

To each successive layer corresponds a different wavelet basis with more null moments than its predecessor. We consider two types of operations in the scheme: firstly, a input signal treatment phase—the awake phase—and, secondly, a reorganizing phase of the random wavelet coefficients obtained in the previous awake phase—the asleep phase. The next awake phase input treatment will include a feedback derived from the previous asleep phase. The set of random wavelet coefficients of the deepest layer—at each stage of the learning process—is supposed to be Gaussian distributed, and the corresponding sequence of Gaussian distributions constitutes the inner representation of the world in the scheme. We show that in the case of a constant average value of the inputs in each successive awake phases, the mean value of the feedback converges to a multiple of the constant expected value of the inputs. We show a general result on the stabilization of the Gaussian distribution corresponding to the deepest layer, and we show that when the estimated means and covariances converge, then the sequence of Gaussian distributions of the inner representation of the world in the scheme also converges. We present an example of a neural network scheme for supervised learning corresponding to extracting a signal from data corrupted with Gaussian noise.},

  abstract     = {Metro system has been increasingly recognized as a backbone of urban transportation system in many cities around the world. To improve the demand management and operation efficiency, it is crucial to have accurate prediction of real-time metro passenger flow. However, the forecast performance is often subject to the complex spatial and temporal distributions of the metro passenger flow data. To this end, we developed a novel dual attentive graph neural network that can effectively predict the distribution of metro traffic flow considering the spatial and temporal influences. Specifically, two directed complete metro graphs (i.e., inbound and outbound graphs) and the weighted matrix of them are proposed to characterize the inbound (entering the system) and outbound (leaving the system) passenger flow, respectively. The weighted matrix of inbound graph is estimated based on the historical origin-destination demand and that of the outbound graph is estimated based on the similarity metrics between every two stations. Moreover, to capture the dependencies between inbound and outbound flows, multi-layer graph spatial attention networks that incorporate the spatial context are applied to exploit the dynamic inter-station correlations. Then, the acquired dependency features integrated with external factors, such as weather conditions, are filtered by temporal attention and fed into a sequence decoder to produce short-term and long-term passenger flow predictions. Finally, a series experiments are conducted based on a comprehensive empirical dataset. Findings indicated that the proposed model does not only well predict the metro passenger flow, but also effectively detect the emergencies and incidents of metro system.},

Some examples include recognition of hand-drawn graphics components like circuit components and diagrams. Complete digitization of such handwritten documents is not possible without automatic conversion of the said circuit diagrams. Besides, to date, in most of the cases for commercial circuit design purposes, concerned people manually enter the components into the simulating software like Cadence, Spice to analyze the circuit and judge its performance. In this work, it has been tried to move one step towards automating this process by recognizing the hand-drawn circuit components which are considered as the most important step for this automation. The present endeavour is to design a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model that recognizes the hand-drawn circuit components. In the first stage, all the similar-looking (i.e., similar shape and structure) circuit components are clustered into a single group using visual perception and input from confusion matrix of single-stage CNN-based classification, and in the later stage, the circuit components belong to the same group are classified into their actual classes. The proposed model has been evaluated on a self-made database where 20 different classes of hand-drawn circuit components are considered. The experimental outcome shows that the proposed two-stage classification model provides an accuracy 97.33\% which is much higher than the single-stage method, which provides an accuracy of 86.00\%.},

  abstract     = {Image authentication based on image hashing has gained large attention in recent years. However, limited work has been done in color image hashing. Also, most of the existing methods are unable to detect tampering, if the composite rotation–scaling–translation (RST) distortion and tampering in a color image occur simultaneously. In this paper, an image hashing technique has been proposed based on convolutional stacked denoising auto-encoders (CSDAEs). In addition, a blind geometric correction approach is used to correct the composite RST distortion in the image. An input image is hierarchically mapped to a lower-dimensional hash code via CSDAEs, which have been trained for content-preserving operations (CPOs). An image map is generated from the hash via the decoder. The tampered area has been localized, by comparing the image map of hash codes from the reference image and the received image. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against most of the CPOs, especially to composite RST, a better trade-off between robustness and discrimination, and can localize the tampered regions. The receiver operating characteristics show that the proposed model is better than some of the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Texture-based instance retrieval is typically performed on images that present a single texture pattern and is mainly applied to the retrieval of fabrics or textiles. In this work, we apply it to indoor scene images that typically present many different texture patterns, which constitutes a more challenging problem. Such retrieval systems, together with the retrieval of faces and objects, can be used as a valuable tool for evidence matching in crime scene investigation. Even though recent deep learning-based approaches have made significant improvement in many computer vision tasks, texture retrieval remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce a Fourier-based approach, in which spatial images and their discrete Fourier transform maps are combined to derive a novel texture representation. We further present a new and efficient texture-based image retrieval framework based on region proposal networks, convolutional autoencoders and transfer learning, in which we extract the features from the latent space layer of the encoder as texture descriptors. The experimental results on four datasets: TextileTube, Outex, USPtex and Stex, validated the effectiveness of our proposed method, yielding better results than the current state of the art.},

  abstract     = {Detecting source-code level vulnerabilities at the development phase is a cost-effective solution to prevent potential attacks from happening at the software deployment stage. Many machine learning, including deep learning-based solutions, have been proposed to aid the process of vulnerability discovery. However, these approaches were mainly evaluated on self-constructed/-collected datasets. It is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed approaches due to lacking a unified baseline dataset. To bridge this gap, we construct a function-level vulnerability dataset from scratch, providing in source-code-label pairs. To evaluate the constructed dataset, a function-level vulnerability detection framework is built to incorporate six mainstream neural network models as vulnerability detectors. We perform experiments to investigate the performance behaviors of the neural model-based detectors using source code as raw input with continuous Bag-of-Words neural embeddings. Empirical results reveal that the variants of recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural network perform well on our dataset, as the former is capable of handling contextual information and the latter learns features from small context windows. In terms of generalization ability, the fully connected network outperforms the other network architectures. The performance evaluation can serve as a reference benchmark for neural model-based vulnerability detection at function-level granularity. Our dataset can serve as ground truth for ML-based function-level vulnerability detection and a baseline for evaluating relevant approaches.},

Signal reconstruction modelling is done through prediction of missing samples, and a sliding window mechanism is utilized to recover long segments of missing samples in periodic and aperiodic corrupted signals.

Diverse network architectures of the proposed Multi-Chromosomal Cartesian Genetic Programming-evolved Recurrent Neural Network (MC-CGPRNN) are evolved to explore the robustness of algorithm in terms of optimization of hyper parameters, evolutionary speed and generalization ability. The proposed algorithm is trained and tested on speech signal with both periodic and aperiodic noise. The best trained network is also evaluated on standard music signals achieving remarkable results. Experimental results show that the proposed MC-CGPRNN algorithm achieved SNR of 25.23 dB for speech signal, 29.92 dB for guitar signal and 28.45 dB for flute signal in case of 50\% missing samples showing best SNR improvement in comparison with its counterparts for time domain signal reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {Advanced persistent threat (APT) attack is a malicious attack type which has intentional and clear targets. This attack technique has become a challenge for information security systems of organizations, governments, and businesses. The approaches of using machine learning or deep learning algorithms to analyze signs and abnormal behaviors of network traffic for detecting and preventing APT attacks have become popular in recent years. However, the APT attack detection approach that uses behavior analysis and evaluation techniques is facing many difficulties due to the lack of typical data of attack campaigns. To handle this situation, recent studies have selected and extracted the APT attack behaviors which based on datasets are built from experimental tools. Consequently, these properties are few and difficult to obtain in practical monitoring systems. Therefore, although the experimental results show good detection, it does not bring high efficiency in practice. For above reasons, in this paper, a new method based on network traffic analysis using a combined deep learning model to detect APT attacks will be proposed. Specifically, individual deep learning networks such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) will also be sought, built and linked into combined deep learning networks to analyze and detect signs of APT attacks in network traffic. To detect APT attack signals, the combined deep learning models are performed in two main stages including (i) extracting IP features based on flow: In this phase, we will analyze network traffic into networking flows by IP address and then use the combined deep learning models to extract IP features by network flow; (ii) classifying APT attack IPs: Based on IP features extracted in a task (i), the APT attack IPs and normal IPs will be identified and classified. The proposal of a combined deep learning model to detect APT attacks based on network traffic is a new approach, and there is no research proposed and applied yet. In the experimental section, combined deep learning models proved their superior abilities to ensure accuracy on all measurements from 93 to 98\%. This is a very good result for APT attack detection based on network traffic.},

  abstract     = {The evolution in science and innovation has to lead to an immense volume of information from various agricultural fields to be accumulated in the public domain. As a result, an objective arises from the investigation of the accessible information and incorporating them with processes like foreseeing crop yield, plant diseases examination, crops enhancement, etc. Machine learning has grown with tremendous processing methods to conceive new innovations in the multi-disciplinary agricultural sector. In experimenting with machine learning models, there exist certain limitations like improvident nonlinear mapping between the raw data and crop yield values. Hence, deep learning models are comprehensively used to extricate critical crop parameters for prediction. Foreseeing the crop yield depending on climate, soil and water parameters has been a potential research subject. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning-based crop yield prediction system using deep belief network (DBN) and fuzzy neural networks system (FNN). DBN is a combination of statistics and probability with neural networks. Though DBN performs better for nonlinear systems, the algorithm alone cannot provide satisfactory results in terms of robustness, model accuracy and learning speed, which is predominantly due to gradient diffusion. Hence, a DBN along with FNN has been proposed to overcome the nonlinearity and gradient diffusion problems. The proposed model initially performs an efficient pre-training technique by DBN for enhanced model development and feature vector generation. This characteristic feature vector is fed as an input to the FNN for further processing. The superiority of the proposed fuzzy neural network-based deep belief network is analyzed by comparing it with other deep learning algorithms. The proposed model efficiently predicts the results outperforming the other models by preserving the original data distribution with an accuracy of 92\%.},

  abstract     = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have drawn great attention recently since they are the powerful models to generate high-quality images. Although GANs have achieved great success, they usually suffer from unstable training and consequently may lead to the poor generations in some cases. Such drawback is argued mainly due to the difficulties in measuring the divergence between the highly complicated the real and fake data distributions, which are normally in the high-dimensional space. To tackle this problem, previous researchers attempt to search a proper divergence capable of measuring the departure of the complex distributions. In contrast, we attempt to alleviate this problem from a different perspective: while retaining the information as much as possible of the original high dimensional distributions, we learn and leverage an additional latent space where simple distributions are defined in a low-dimensional space; as a result, we can readily compute the distance between two simple distributions with an available divergence measurement. Concretely, to retain the data information, the mutual information is maximized between the variables for the high dimensional complex distributions and the low dimensional simple distributions. The departure of the resulting simple distributions are then measured in the original way of GANs. Additionally, for simplifying the optimization further, we optimize directly the lower bound for mutual information. Termed as SimpleGAN, we conduct the proposed approach over the several different baseline models, i.e., conventional GANs, DCGAN, WGAN-GP, WGAN-GP-res, and LSWGAN-GP on the benchmark CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets. SimpleGAN shows the obvious superiority on these baseline models. Furthermore, in comparison with the existing methods measuring directly the distribution departure in the high-dimensional space, our method clearly demonstrates its superiority. Finally, a series of experiments show the advantages of the proposed SimpleGAN.},

The difficulties in proposing reliable and precise empirical correlations and theoretical models forced the researchers to use alternative and more accurate models based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The present study has been carried out to predict two parameters, thermal conductivity, and damage threshold for Jalore granite using AI techniques. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs), linear regression, support vector regressors (SVRs), and decision tree regressors (DTRs) have been applied to obtain reliable and more accurate models. The extensive analysis revealed that the optimum performance is obtained by the ANN model with 8 nodes in the input layer with 2 hidden layers. Hidden layers having 15 and 7 nodes in the first and second layers, respectively. Softmax function has been applied as activation for each layer of the developed model. The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) values for the model while predicting the thermal coefficient were 0.0033671 and 184E−05. These values were 0.0016141 and 3.89E−06 for the damage threshold. DTRs with the number of estimators, n = 100, 1000, and 10,000 perform relatively well for predicting the values for both parameters. Linear regression and SVRs models (linear and robust kernel) show some deviations from the observed values at points where the trend shows a sudden change or kink. In the case of DTRs, the model with the number of estimators, n = 1000, and 100 performs most efficiently for predicting thermal conductivity (MSE = 6.81E−05) and the damage threshold (MSE = 2.84E−05), respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study an important class of stochastic difference-of-convex (SDC) programming whose objective is given in the form of the sum of a continuously differentiable convex function, a simple convex function and a continuous concave function. Recently, a proximal stochastic variance reduction difference-of-convex algorithm (Prox-SVRDCA) (Xu et al., 2019) is developed for this problem. And, Prox-SVRDCA reduces to the proximal stochastic variance reduction gradient (Prox-SVRG) (Xiao and Zhang, 2014) as the continuous concave function is disappeared, and hence Prox-SVRDCA is potentially slow in practice. Inspired by recently proposed acceleration techniques, an accelerated proximal stochastic variance reduction difference-of-convex algorithm (AProx-SVRDCA) is proposed. Different from Prox-SVRDCA, an extrapolation acceleration step that involves the latest two iteration points is incorporated in AProx-SVRDCA. The experimental results show that, for a fairly general choice of the extrapolation parameter, the acceleration will be achieved for AProx-SVRDCA. Then, a rigorous theoretical analysis is presented. We first show that any accumulation point of the generated iteration sequences is a stationary point of the objective function. Furthermore, different from the traditional convergence analysis in the existing nonconvex stochastic optimizations, a global convergence property with respect to the generated sequences is established under the assumption: the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property together with the continuity and differentiability of the concave part in objective function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the acceleration trick is incorporated into nonconvex nonsmooth SDC programming. Finally, extended experimental results show the superiority of our proposed algorithm.},

The potential of supervised machine learning and shallow feed-forward neural network (NN) architectures is studied to predict and reconstruct temperature fields based on a single sensor measurement. The reason to study shallow (not deep nor gated) NN first before more complex networks is that shallow NN can provide us with robust nonlinear mapping at a low computational cost. Simultaneously, their mathematical structures can be simple, especially for a limited amount of training data. Thus, revealing a governing law in data via a simpler architecture is desirable. Further, the problem suits feed-forward architectures as only one temperature sensor is considered input in real time. It is investigated which type of shallow NN architectures with which learning algorithm can be most accurate with the best generalization for provided turboprop temperature field data. The important finding is that it is possible to capture the deterministic governing law of temperatures in a turboprop engine. Thus, the temperature sensor locations in rakes can be analyzed to allocate the important positions for a limited number of temperature sensors inside the engine. The machine learning results also confirm the importance of slow heat transfer between internal engine parts and temperature sensors alongside the air propulsion. Thus, the proposed neural network application concept is promising as a funding base for further design of modern turboprop health monitoring system.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an efficient hybridized approach for the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) samples into crucial arrhythmia classes to detect heartbeat abnormalities. The physiological detection using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has been the most popular means and widely accepted automated detection system to monitor heart health. Additionally, arrhythmia beat classification plays a prominent role in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis dedicated elucidate cardiac health status while analyzing heart rhythm. The authors aim to classify ECG samples into major arrhythmia classes precisely by removing the inherent noise of ECG signals in preprocessing phase using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The QRS complex plays a crucial role in ECG signal identification. Therefore, the position and amplitude of R-peaks are determined to detect the QRS complex. The feature vectors of the QRS complex are further optimized with cuckoo search (CS) optimization algorithm in addition to denoising signals using DWT to select the most relevant set of features. The Support vector machine (SVM)-trained support vector contains the best training information used to train feed-forward back-propagation neural network (FFBPNN) to propose the variant DWT + CS + SVM-FFBPNN to classify signals among five classes. MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is utilized for different types of heartbeats. The classification analysis based on a variant with optimized feature vector using cuckoo search algorithm and SVM-FFBPNN determines heart rate with an accuracy of 98.319\%. In contrast, the variant FFBPNN without optimization obtains 97.95\% accuracy. The improved performance of the novel combination of classifiers resulted in overall classification accuracy of 98.53\% with precision and recall of 98.247\% and 95.68\%, respectively. The simulation analysis comprising 3600 samples and 1160 heartbeats also outperformed the existing arrhythmia classifications performed based on neural networks. This illustrates the success of the proposed ECG classification model in accurately categorizing ECG signals for arrhythmia classification.},

  abstract     = {The application of artificial neural networks in mapping the mechanical characteristics of the cement-based materials is underlined in previous investigations. However, this machine learning technique includes several major deficiencies highlighted in the literature, such as the overfitting problem and the inability to explain the decisions. Hence, the present study investigates the applicability of other common machine learning techniques, i.e., support vector machine, random forest (RF), decision tree, AdaBoost and k-nearest neighbors in mapping the behavior of the compressive strength (CS) of cement-based mortars. To this end, a big experimental database has been compiled based on experimental data available in the literature considering, namely the cement grade, which is an important parameter for the modeling of mortar’s CS. Other important parameters are namely the age, the water-to-binder ratio, the particle size distribution of the sand and the amount of plasticizer. Many models based on the influential factors affecting machine learning techniques have been developed, and their prediction capacities have been assessed using performance indexes. The present research highlights the potential of AdaBoost and RF models as useful tools which can assist in mortar design and/or optimization. In addition, mapping the development of mortar characteristics can assist in revealing the influence of the different mortar mix parameters on the compressive strength.},

  abstract     = {The cloud computing systems are sorts of shared collateral structure which has been in demand from its inception. In these systems, clients are able to access existing services based on their needs and without knowing where the service is located and how it is delivered, and only pay for the service used. Like other systems, there are challenges in the cloud computing system. Because of a wide array of clients and the variety of services available in this system, it can be said that the issue of scheduling and, of course, energy consumption is essential challenge of this system. Therefore, it should be properly provided to users, which minimizes both the cost of the provider and consumer and the energy consumption, and this requires the use of an optimal scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we present a two-step hybrid method for scheduling tasks aware of energy and time called Genetic Algorithm and Energy-Conscious Scheduling Heuristic based on the Genetic Algorithm. The first step involves prioritizing tasks, and the second step consists of assigning tasks to the processor. We prioritized tasks and generated primary chromosomes, and used the Energy-Conscious Scheduling Heuristic model, which is an energy-conscious model, to assign tasks to the processor. As the simulation results show, these results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has been able to outperform other methods.},

  abstract     = {Energy generation from wind resources is now a mature technology with the ability to compete with traditional energy sources at utility scales in many countries, through the identification of suitable sites. However, beyond site suitability, predicting the wind resource variability of the potentially viable site presents overarching benefits in strategic and operational planning prior to site development. This study, therefore, combines geographical information systems multicriteria decision-making (GIS-MCDM) and hybrid neurofuzzy modeling tools for site suitability and resource variability forecast, respectively, in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The GIS model uses two factors (climatological and environmental), and analytical hierarchical process was used for evaluating criteria degree of influence. Wind resource variability using diurnal satellite-based data for the candidate site was used on the models. Adaptive neurofuzzy inference system models hybrid with genetic algorithm (GA-ANFIS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO-ANFIS) were compared with standalone ANFIS and Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation neural network (LMBP-ANN) using six statistical measures of error, accuracy, and variability. The GA-ANFIS and PSO-ANFIS accurately model the resource with PSO-ANFIS having lesser computational time compared to GA-ANFIS. However, LMBP-ANN is most robust and resistant in modeling the resource variability among the four models. Hence, wind resource variability investigation on a potentially viable site obtained from the GIS-MCDM model can complement on-site investigations prior to site development. Also, tuning ANFIS with evolutionary algorithms offers improved accuracy over standalone ANFIS model for wind resource forecast and further its robustness in predicting variability of the resource. From our findings, cross-boundary wind resource exploration between South Africa and Lesotho could foster regional interconnectivity.},

Afterward, a single neural network (NN) which serves as critic and actor NN simultaneously is employed for the realization of ADP-based optimal regulation. The NN weights are updated in real-time and the weight estimate errors are proved to be convergent. As a result, computational complexity is efficiently decreased together with the storage space.

Both models were investigated for predicting single values of volume loss over a predetermined duration as well as the full volume loss versus time curves. The results show that after training the neural networks can accurately substitute the predictions of the CFD model for both single values and the full curves. For the multi-layer perceptron, accurate predicts are even obtained after substantial reducing the training data, which illustrates that a coupling between a CFD model and a neural network can significantly decrease the overall calculation time.},

The detection of skin cancer based on visual information requires highly skilled dermatologists, and also it is a time-consuming process. To analyse the condition of patients and diagnose the diseases at the earliest, an automated classification system is needed that may help to enhance the clinical decision. There are many clinical trials available to classifying melanoma skin cancer. In this study, soft computing techniques are enabled such as image processing, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) to get accurate result of classification. To achieve this, three major modules are developed. The first part is dermoscopic image preprocessing from which the dermoscopic images can be prepared by removing noises and skin hairs. The second one is feature extraction and selection. The former one utilizes 3-dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform (3DWT), and later one uses GA. The last module is the knowledge discover step where the dermoscopic images are classified using an appropriate DLNN classifier. In the result of comparative analysis, a maximum accuracy of 98.67\% is obtained using the proposed system on PH2 database and 94.50\% on International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 database.},

Experimental studies are essential for the design of weirs, but they require a lot of time to collect a real database. The main objective of this paper is to predict the relative head of PK-Weir for submerged flow using artificial neural networks. To do this, we have used the results of our experimental study to develop a neural model. The results obtained were very satisfactory with very acceptable errors (RMSE = 0.0133 and MAE = 0.0066). In addition, a comparative study was made between empirical relationships and the developed model. The results of this comparative study showed a good agreement.},

The diagnosis of IDC becomes a challenging task when a microscopic cell line structure is classified manually which requires a lot of expertise. Literature suggests a lot of computer-assisted deep models that prove as a helping hand for radiologists. But one limitation identified in most of the deep models is the vanishing gradient problem. This paper presents a dense model that overcomes the limitation of the vanishing gradient problem and outperforms in terms of classification accuracy with respect to other deep models. In addition, the proposed methodology also focused on the feature reusability with an optimized number of parameters for IDC histology image classification. The proposed method uses the CLAHE as a preprocessing method with 9 layers of dense deep architecture for experimentation purposes. The proposed model uses the base architecture of Densenet-169 with some proposed layer modifications to solve the targeted problem. While during the experimentation, validation of the proposed model is found satisfactory with an accuracy of 98.21\%.

  abstract     = {One-class classification (OCC) needs samples from only a single class to train the classifier. Recently, an auto-associative kernel extreme learning machine was developed for the OCC task. This paper introduces a novel extension of this classifier by embedding minimum variance information within its architecture and is referred to as VAAKELM. The minimum variance embedding forces the network output weights to focus in regions of low variance and reduces the intra-class variance. This leads to a better separation of target samples and outliers, resulting in an improvement in the generalization performance of the classifier. The proposed classifier follows a reconstruction-based approach to OCC and minimizes the reconstruction error by using the kernel extreme learning machine as the base classifier. It uses the deviation in reconstruction error to identify the outliers. We perform experiments on 15 small-size and 10 medium-size one-class benchmark datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed classifier. We compare the results with 13 existing one-class classifiers by considering the mean $$\hbox {F}_1$$ score as the comparison metric. The experimental results show that VAAKELM consistently performs better than the existing classifiers, making it a viable alternative for the OCC task.

In this paper, we put forward a convolutional neural network for single image denoising, mainly consisting of a noise mapping block (NMB), a texture compensation block (TCB), and a composition block (CB). The NMB borrows a series of standard residual blocks to learn the noise mapping. Specifically, we employ the TCB to enhance the details via multi-scale dilated residual blocks (MDRBs) that hold the characteristics of fusing multi-scale contexture information with dilated convolution. Finally, the CB does an element-wise addition to composite the output. Besides, we have conducted extensive experiments on gray as well as color image datasets.

We show that our feature-based approach outperforms the compared indexes for optimal model selection: they are more efficient from low- to high-dimensional range as well as they are more robust to noise. To show the efficiency of our indexes on a real-life application, we consider the task of diachronic analysis on a textual dataset.

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving research is an emerging area in the machine learning domain. Most existing methods perform single-task learning, while multi-task learning (MTL) is more efficient due to the leverage of shared information between different tasks. However, MTL is challenging because different tasks may have different significance and varying ranges. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture for statistically correlated MTL using a single input image. Statistical correlation of the tasks is handled by including shared layers in the architecture. Later network separates into different branches to handle the difference in the behavior of each task. Training a multi-task model with varying ranges may converge the objective function only with larger values. To this end, we explore different normalization schemes and empirically observe that the inverse validation-loss weighted scheme has best performed. In addition to estimating steering angle, braking, and acceleration, we also estimate the number of lanes on the left and the right side of the vehicle. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture to estimate this type of lane information. The proposed approach is evaluated on four publicly available datasets including Comma.ai, Udacity, Berkeley Deep Drive, and Sully Chen. We also propose a synthetic dataset GTA-V for autonomous driving research. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. The GTA-V dataset and the lane annotations on the four existing datasets will be made publicly available via https://cvlab.lums.edu.pk/scmtl/.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion is a major problem in the last few decades. Though the Government is taking various measures like installing more traffic signals, constructing fly-overs, one-ways, etc., the problem could not be addressed effectively on the heavily congested areas. The increasing number of vehicles, the dynamic population of traffic, the narrowness of roads and the absence of alternative roads or other routes are the major obstacles to reduce traffic congestion. Researchers of various streams have been working on predicting traffic volume to solve this problem. In this paper, a new method named Intuitionistic Fuzzy Grey-Markov Model(IFGMM) is introduced, which is an extension of Grey-Markov to Intuitionistic fuzzy set. The model is distinctive when compared with other models as it has a high level of accuracy performance. The forecasting result of this model is almost in proximity with the actual result of the traffic volume. In addition, the relative errors shown in this method are lesser than that of other models, due to its prediction accuracy is higher. Since the data collected in this method are taken from a heavily congested road from a metropolitan city, the proposed approach will be suitable for any congested area of the world.},

  abstract     = {Welding robot path planning gradually has increasingly widespread attention in automatic production on account of improving the production efficiency in the actual production process. It is a combinational optimization problem to find an optimal welding path for the robot manipulator by arranging the sequence and directions of welding seams. To solve the problem with two objectives, path length and energy consumption, this paper proposed an improved discrete MOEA/D based on a hybrid environment selection (DMOEA/D-HES) with a parallel scheme to search the optimal sequence and directions simultaneously for welding seams. The discretized reproduction and adaptive neighborhood provide a larger search range in solution space to overcome difficulties in duplication and uneven distribution of solutions. Adaptive decomposition method and improved hybrid environment selection promote solutions converge to the optimal direction and further balance convergence and diversity. Eight TSPLIB problems were tested with the proposed algorithm and the other four algorithms. Besides, the algorithm is compared with four multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on the multi-objective welding robot path planning on the balance beam. The test results indicate DMOEA/D-HES outperforms other algorithms on convergence with a competitive diversity, which is effective to be applied in the actual welding process.},

Several lines of research seek to resemble artificial neural networks to biological ones by incorporating new bioinspired mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is the biological concept of metaplasticity, defined as the plasticity of synaptic plasticity and which has been shown to be directly related to learning and memory. It has also been shown that incorporating this mechanism into a multilayer perceptron improves the neural network performance in both accuracy and learning rate when diagnosing breast cancer. The early detection of breast cancer is one of the most important strategies to prevent deaths from this disease. In this work, we have modeled synaptic metaplasticity in a radial base function network, which converges faster than multilayer perceptrons, with the motivation to achieve a more accurate solution in the diagnosis of breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {Compared to 1D compressed sensing (CS), 2D CS is more efficient for compressing the plaintext image from two directions, but security level of current 2D CS-based ciphers is unsatisfactory. To solve this problem, this paper presents a novel color image compression and encryption algorithm by combining 2D CS, information entropy and chaos. Firstly, the color image is decomposed into red, green and blue components, then they are sparsely transformed by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to get three sparse matrices. Next, the obtained matrices are observed by two asymptotical deterministic random measurement matrices based on information entropy and counter (ADMMIC), which not only encrypts the plaintext image, but also compresses it in proportion to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage space. Subsequently, the corresponding measurement value matrices are shuffled by a double random scrambling based on Arnold map and index vector (DRSAIV) to eliminate the correlation between adjacent pixels. Furthermore, the obtained permutated matrices are diffused by a simultaneous multiple random diffusion of inter–intra components (SMRDIC) to obtain the final cipher image, the plaintext pixel to be diffused, the key matrix involved in diffusion and the position of the obtained ciphertext pixel are all unpredictable, which makes statistical attack invalid. In addition, information entropy values of plaintext image are obtained to generate the initial values of the used chaotic systems, which greatly improve the ability to resist the known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacks. Simulation results and security analyses verify that this algorithm has good compression and high security.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) across multi-camera views remains a very challenging task. In fact, the use of global convolutional neural network (CNN) features is not optimal since the appearance similarity of identities is overlooked. Hence, persons with similar global appearance (wearing in very similar clothes) may be confused and hard to distinguish. To address these shared challenges, some attribute labels (such as hat or bag) can improve the discriminative ability of Re-ID model by depicting person images with more detailed descriptions. Hence, we propose in this paper a new attributes recognition model, called ARN, based on a deep CNN model. Then, we propose a new approach based on attributes similarity and k-reciprocal re-ranking algorithm in order to enhance person Re-ID baseline performances. The proposed approach, called K-RNNA, is motivated first of all, by the potential of re-ranking methods to resort the ’baseline’ re-identification results from the initial retrieval. Second, attributes, as a mid-level semantic representation of the person’s local appearance, could also potentially resolve these challenges. In fact, learned semantic attributes such as gender, hair, accessories (hat, bags, backpack, etc.) are used as a supplement during the re-ranking phase in order to discriminate between identities with similar global appearance. The experimental study conducted on Market-1501, Duke-MTMC-reID and CUHK03 datasets confirms that when attributes are used as supplement in the verification phase, we improve considerably the person Re-ID performances and we reach competitive results in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and Rank-1.},

For this purpose, eight CEMI cements and three commercial HRWR admixtures were used. The rheological properties of 112 paste mixtures with different admixture dosages and water/cement (W/C) ratios were determined in accordance with Herschel–Bulkley model. Then after, using the experimental data, proper models were established to predict the dynamic yield stress and final viscosity of the pastes. In addition to cement characteristics (such as fineness, compound composition and equivalent alkali content), water-reducing admixture content and its solid material content as well as water/cement ratio of the pastes were considered as input data. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and multiple additive regression trees (MART) methods were used in the models. Besides, artificial neural network (ANN) and conventional regression analysis (CRA) including linear, power, and exponential functions were applied to determine the accuracy of the heuristic regression methods. Three statistical indices, root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, and Nash–Sutcliffe, were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Modeling findings indicated that the model with the lowest error for both of the rheological variables in the testing set is the MART, followed by ANN, MARS, and CRA-Exponential methods. The most effective cement characteristics causing incompatibility, hence detraction of paste rheological properties, in decreasing order, were determined as cement fineness, C3S, C3A and equivalent alkali contents. C4AF and C2S contents of the cement were found to have less effect on the cement–admixture incompatibility. It will be possible to determine the rheological properties of mixtures containing different cements without conducting an experimental study by using the model based on MART method.},

The minimum learning parameter method of neural network replaces the traditional multilayer neural network to compensate uncertain dynamics and time-varying disturbances, which further reduces the computational burden of the controller.

Thus, only employing a few keys in the chaotic maps avoids the transmission of the Gaussian matrix. Then, combine the obtained measurements and shuffle the combined measurements through Latin squares. Finally, to enhance the security of the cryptosystem, the compressed and shuffled image is further diffused using the key streams generated from both the chaotic maps and the plain images. The combined image can be reconstructed by decrypting the cipher images and utilizing a recovery algorithm. The proposed scheme can efficiently reduce data volume and simplify keys.

But the only implementation of the CI algorithm of the theory is the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) used by AlphaZero. Since ant colony optimization (ACO) is an extensively used CI algorithm, it is useful to implement CI evolution using ACO. A genetic version of ACO is adapted to satisfy the CI evolution theory by two methods. One method is realized by using a policy network, namely policy network guided ACO (P-ACO). The other method is realized by using a policy network and a value network, namely policy and value network guided ACO (PV-ACO). Both methods of ACO evolution algorithm are applied to Tic-Tac-Toe and Four in a Row, where traditional ACO played poorly compared to the tree search algorithm, e.g., MCTS. Computational experiments are done to compare both methods with pure ACO and MCTS. As a result, the intelligence level of ACO evolution algorithm quickly exceeds pure ACO and MCTS.

They are often referred to as ‘emergent patterns,’ which arise due to nonlinear interactions of species in spatial scales that are much more larger than the individuals characteristic scale. In this work, we examine the spatial pattern formation of diffusive fractional predator–prey models with different functional response. In the first model, we investigate the dynamics of the Riesz fractional predation of Holling type-II functional response with the prey Allee effects, while the second model describes prey-dependent functional response of Ivlev-case and fractional reaction–diffusion. In order to give good guidelines on the correct choice of parameters for numerical simulation experiment of full fractional-order reaction–diffusion systems, we discuss the dynamics of each system in the biologically meaningful region $$u\ge 0$$ and $$v\ge 0$$ and give conditions for the existence of Hopf bifurcation, and Turing instability with either homogeneous (zero-flux) boundary conditions which imply no external input or Dirichlet boundary conditions. A novel alternating direction implicit based on backward Euler scheme with either the homogeneous Neumann (zero-flux) or Dirichlet boundary is applied for the numerical solution. The performance of this method is compared with that of the shifted Grünwald formula in terms of accuracy and computational time. Numerical experiments which justify our theoretical findings exhibits some fractional-order controlled patterns of stripes, spots and chaotic spiral-like structures that are mostly found in animal coats.},

Prior methods generally have required neighbor selection process for candidate sketch patches on a large-scale of training data, which is tedious and time consuming. This paper proposes a new face sketch synthesis method by means of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) recurrent neural network, that is commonly utilized for sequence regression. BiLSTM neural networks can learn spatial and texture patterns within a single regression model, which does not only significantly speeds up the synthesis process but also improves the synthesis performance. The main thought behind the proposed method is to transfer the input photo into sequential patterns on the basis of regular overlapping patches. Then, the synthesized sketch patch corresponding to each input photo patch is predicted through BiLSTM Regression Model (BiLSTM-RM) learned from training photo-sketch pairs. Experimental results on public face sketch databases demonstrated that the proposed BiLSTM-RM method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and also it can be generalized well to face sketch synthesis for real-world applications that work on photos with pose variance.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to develop a multi-objective version of the search group algorithm (SGA) called the multi-objective search group algorithm (MOSGA) to help determine thermo-economic optimization of flat-plate solar collector (FPSC) systems. Search mechanisms of the SGA were modified to determine non-dominated solutions through mutation, generation, and selection stages. Authors also mined the Pareto archive with a selection mechanism to maintain and intensify convergence and distribution of solutions. The study tested the proposed MOSGA with well-known multi-objective benchmark problems. Results were compared with outcomes from conventional algorithms using the same performance metrics to validate the capability and performance of the MOSGA. Afterward, MOSGA was applied to find the best design parameters to simultaneously optimize thermal efficiency and the total annual cost of FPSC systems. Four case studies were conducted with four different working fluids (pure water, SiO2, Al2O3, and CuO nanofluids). Optimization results obtained by the MOSGA were analyzed and compared with solutions provided by other algorithms. The findings revealed relative improvement in thermal efficiency and reduced annual cost for all nanofluids compared to pure water. Thermal efficiency was improved by 2.2748\%, 2.4298\%, and 2.7948\% for SiO2, Al2O3, and CuO case studies, respectively, compared to pure water. Meanwhile, TAC rates were increased by 2.4111\%, 2.3403\%, and 2.9133\% for these case studies, respectively. Comparative results also demonstrated that MOGSA was robustly effective and superior in the selection of appropriate design parameters of FPSC systems.},

  abstract     = {Machine parts always work under different types of stresses or loading conditions. The sudden dimensional changes lead to sudden increase in stress on the critical section of the machine parts. This state is defined as stress concentration factor (SCF). The strength of the machine part decreases on the located point at maximum stress. In this study, SCFs of circular/elliptical holes with bead reinforcement in an infinite panel under uniaxial and biaxial stresses were modeled, simulated, calculated and verified using analytical, finite element analysis (FEA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. This study presents a new model for predicting SCF for panels using artificial intelligence techniques under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. Theoretical SCF (Kt) values for different shapes and loading conditions have been compiled and graphical forms of these experimental results were published by Peterson (Peterson’s stress concentration factors, 3rd edn. Wiley, Hoboken, 2007). There is a need to convert these curves into a numerical data set to be used in machine part design easily. Theoretical SCF (Kt) was obtained from the Peterson’s charts in numerical form according to dimensional parameter ratios using high-accuracy graphical computer software. Using these dimensional parameter ratios, a parametric finite element model (FEM) was created. Uniaxial and biaxial boundary conditions were applied to the FEM model. Mesh optimization was accomplished to the parametric FEM model. Mesh formation is compatible with the model according to dimensional sizes and ratios. Mesh optimization was provided to element size and per unit volume. Numerical and FEA results were tested, approved and confirmed with Peterson’s original data using statistical methods. A code was created for the improvement of the ANN model in the Matlab ANN Toolbox Editor. Different ANN model variations were tested and the best-performing ANN model was determined among the tried models. Numerical, FEA and ANN model results were compared and confirmed with one another. The developed model provides an easy method to predict and calculate the stress in defining the Kt according to dimensional ratios and applied loading states (uniaxial/biaxial).},

  abstract     = {Milling by mechanical means is vital unit operation in pharmaceutical processing which can be used for controlling particle size reduction. This approach can be also used for mechanochemical synthesis of pharmaceutical cocrystals. However, controlling the particle size of cocrystal during the milling process is challenging due to complexity of the process and different mechanisms involved. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) approach was performed to predict the size of particles during mechanochemical synthesis of pharmaceutical cocrystals in ball milling operation. Theophylline was used as active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and 4-aminobenzoic acid as co-former in the experiments. Different types of excipients including hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), lactose, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were used to see the effect of excipients on the cocrystals particle size. ANN was developed considering excipient type, excipient percentage, jar size, milling time as inputs, while median particle size (d50) was considered as the response, and representative of particle size. Two hidden layers were considered in developing ANN, and a combination of linear and nonlinear functions was used as transfer function. ANN was trained and validated with measured data, and R2 greater than 0.99 was obtained for the training and validation, with RMSE values of 1.06 and 3.89 for training and validation, respectively. The results were used to provide a design space for understanding the cocrystal particle size variation during ball milling process. It was indicated that the largest particles were formed using PEG as excipient, and increase in particle size over the milling time. The latter was attributed to the electrostatic attraction forces between the particles, thus aggregation and agglomeration of particles as the milling time exceeds a threshold. Furthermore, larger particles were obtained with the larger jar size. It turned out that faster cocrystallization rate occurred after only 5 min of milling in 25 mL jar compared to 25 min in 10 mL milling jar. The developed methodology has been shown to be robust and can be used as predictive tool for designing pharmaceutical cocrystallization using ball milling, and controlling the particle size during size reduction process.},

In a large number of applications, heat is transferred by employing passive methods through fins. Over the years a lot of research has been done to improve the heat transfer ability of fins by introducing pores in them. In this work, temperature distribution and heat transfer rates of stepped, convex and triangular profiled porous fins have been studied and compared simultaneously. Two powerful metaheuristic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and firefly algorithm (FA) have been used to optimize significant variables that regulate heat transfer through porous step and tapered fins. For the same volume constraint the heat transfer rate through step porous fins have been found to increase by 1.59\% and 40.98\% as compared to their triangular and convex counterparts. While the heat transfer rates obtained by PSO are marginally better (0.32\%) and similar in case of step and triangular porous fins, respectively, as compared to FA, FA has reported better sub optimal points (i.e., 6.91\% higher heat transfer rate) in case of convex porous fin.},

Desperate times have called for desperate measures to detect the disease at an early stage via various medically proven methods like chest computed tomography (CT) scan, chest X-Ray, etc., in order to prevent the virus from spreading across the community. Developing deep learning models for analysing these kinds of radiological images is a well-known methodology in the domain of computer based medical image analysis. However, doing the same by mimicking the biological models and leveraging the newly developed neuromorphic computing chips might be more economical. These chips have been shown to be more powerful and are more efficient than conventional central and graphics processing units. Additionally, these chips facilitate the implementation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in real-world scenarios. To this end, in this work, we have tried to simulate the SNNs using various deep learning libraries. We have applied them for the classification of chest CT scan images into COVID and non-COVID classes. Our approach has achieved very high F1 score of 0.99 for the potential-based model and outperforms many state-of-the-art models. The working code associated with our present work can be found here.},

  abstract     = {Natural language summaries of codes are important during software development and maintenance. Recently, deep learning-based models have achieved good performance on automatic code summarization, which encode token sequence or abstract syntax tree (AST) of code with neural networks. However, almost all of these models are trained using maximum likelihood estimation, which do not guarantee the quality of generated summaries. Moreover, existing models that benefit from multiple encoders lack a fined-grained selection between different encoders, and the encoders may be insufficiently optimized. To address these issues and generate better code summaries, we propose a novel code summarization framework based on adversarial training and ensemble learning. It includes two separately trained encoder-decoder models, one for source code sequence and the other for its AST. Here, an efficient approach to obtain AST node sequence is introduced. We train our models via adversarial training, where each model is guided by a well-designed discriminator that learns to evaluate its outputs. During inference, a module named mixture network is introduced to compute an adaptive combination weight of the models’ outputs. We evaluate our framework on a large Java corpus and compare it to several state-of-the-art models. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the best baseline by 22.6\% on BLEU-4, 5.7\% on ROUGE-L and 7.6\% on METEOR.},

Different statistical as well as deep learning methods have been proposed till now, but seldom those have been used to forecast future long-term pollution trends. Forecasting long-term pollution trends into the future is highly important for government bodies around the globe as they help in the framing of efficient environmental policies. This paper presents a comparative study of various statistical and deep learning methods to forecast long-term pollution trends for the two most important categories of particulate matter (PM) which are PM2.5 and PM10. The study is based on Kolkata, a major city on the eastern side of India. The historical pollution data collected from government set-up monitoring stations in Kolkata are used to analyse the underlying patterns with the help of various time-series analysis techniques, which is then used to produce a forecast for the next two years using different statistical and deep learning methods. The findings reflect that statistical methods such as auto-regressive (AR), seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and Holt–Winters outperform deep learning methods such as stacked, bi-directional, auto-encoder and convolution long short-term memory networks based on the limited data available.},

  abstract     = {Electronic health records (EHRs) in hospital information systems contain patients’ diagnoses and treatments, so EHRs are essential to clinical data mining. Of all the tasks in the mining process, Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a fundamental and important one, and most state-of-the-art methods greatly rely on large scale of manually annotated data. Since annotation is time-consuming and expensive, efforts have been devoted to techniques, such as active learning, to locate the most informative samples for modeling. In this paper, we follow the trend and present an active learning method for CWS in EHRs. Specifically, a new sampling strategy combining normalized entropy with loss prediction (NE–LP) is proposed to select the most valuable data. Meanwhile, to minimize the computational cost of learning, we propose a joint model including a word segmenter and a loss prediction model. Furthermore, to capture interactions between adjacent characters, bigram features are also applied in the joint model. To illustrate the effectiveness of NE–LP, we conducted experiments on EHRs collected from the Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The results demonstrate that NE–LP consistently outperforms conventional uncertainty-based sampling strategies for active learning in CWS},

  abstract     = {Agricultural machines (AMs) refer to equipment usually used in agriculture such as tractors, hand tools, and power tools. It reduces the labor work, increases farms produce, enhances goods quality, and reduces farming time and cost-saving. However, the faults in the fuel system, blades, engine of the AM will often result in degraded vehicle performance, compromising the vehicle’s efficiency and strength. To overcome these problems, fault detection algorithms are developed to identify the faults even before they occur with high classification accuracy. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is a popular deep learning model that offers a high classification recognition rate, and it is widely adopted in similar fields for monitoring the health status of machines. Very few state-of-the-art works are available to identify the health state of agricultural machines using deep learning techniques and extracting the acoustic features from an audio recording. The acoustic signal-based agricultural machine health monitoring and fault prediction model using smartphones is a cost-effective option that is deployed in this proposed work. To optimize the network structure of the DCNN, this paper proposes a Levy flight optimization algorithm (LFOA). The DCNN-LFOA model is implemented on the smartphone’s on-board device (OBD) along with the health monitoring application. The LFOA algorithm minimizes the number of neurons in the DCNN hidden layer and the number of input features from the audio recordings and enhances the classification accuracy. The LFOA algorithm provides the optimal solution which is essential in developing a lightweight DCNN model to implement in the edge processor (smartphone). The experimental results prove that the proposed model gives improved accuracy for the six faults to be classified and serves as a new research model to identify the health condition of the vehicles.},

A set of data points, collected from scientific papers containing the dynamic adsorption kinetics of adsorption on activated carbon, was used in the modelling process. The studied parameters were molar mass, initial concentration, flow rate, bed height, BET surface area, time and concentration of non-dimensional effluents. Overall, the developed model was able to accurately estimate 11,763 experimental data points gathered from the literature. The performance of the optimised models has been evaluated using different metrics between the experimental and the predicted data. Results show that SVM-DA model can estimate accurately the dynamic adsorption of organic pollutants on activated carbon against the other tested models.

Evaluating sustainable supply chain performance and efficiency is a significant topic for many researchers and scholars. Presence of input and intermediate product congestion is one of the key issues that results in lower efficiency and performance in a sustainable supply chain. Therefore, determination of congestion is of prime importance and removing it improves performance of the sustainable supply chain. One of the most appropriate methods for detecting congestion is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Some studies have been conducted to detect the intermediate product congestion via solving Network DEA (NDEA) models without considering the role of intermediate products. In this study, a sustainable supply chain with two-stage structure was considered. Then, the congestion status according to the role of intermediate products was found out for the first time. Towards this aim, different scenarios which congestion can occur in intermediate products were identified. Then, in each scenario, the dominant cone definition was developed in network structure and NDEA models were proposed. Finally 20 Iranian sustainable supply chains of Resin manufacturing companies have been used to demonstrate applicability of the proposed models.},

  abstract     = {This study investigated the AISI 1040 steel turning in dry environment with four cutting inserts of different corner radii coated by CVD method. Experimental investigations were performed for different levels of cutting speeds, feeds and depths of cut using a randomized full factorial design. Quality characteristics of the workpiece machined surface were measured (arithmetical mean roughness) as well as the cutting inserts tool life characteristics (average width of flank wear). Machining times and chip volume were calculated, and based on this, chip quantity in time (material removal rate). The response surface approach and analysis of variance were used to determine the effects of input process parameters on the response variables. Based on the derived regression models, multi-objective optimization of output process parameters was performed using genetic algorithm. The objective function was simultaneous minimization of flank wear, minimization of surface roughness and maximization of material removal rate. The parameters of the genetic algorithm (crossover ratio, crossover fraction, mutation rate, Pareto front population fraction) were varied to obtain the optimal values of the objective function. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed, which showed that the selected values of genetic algorithm parameters gave the best (minimum) value of objective function. Instead of the usual approach of obtaining only one combination of optimal parameters as a final solution, the basic idea was to obtain multiple combinations of optimal input process parameters depending on the importance of each output process parameter, i.e. requirements of production. Accordingly, the results of multi-objective optimization showed that there are a large number of Pareto optimal solutions. To validate the optimal input and output process values, confirmation experiments were conducted for selected trials of Pareto optimal results obtained from multi-objective optimization. A mean error percentage of 1.478\% and 1.146\% for flank wear and arithmetical mean roughness, respectively, proves that the predicted optimum values are confirmed by experimental results.},

However, modeling remains a difficult approach due to the strongly nonlinear performance of the removal mechanisms of organic molecules by NF/RO. The present work features the application of neural networks based on quantitative structure–activity relationship (single neural networks “QSAR-SNN” and bootstrap aggregated neural networks “QSAR-BANN(Staking of 30 networks)&quot;) for prediction of the removal of 23 pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs). Overall, the models proposed are able to accurately correlate 599 experimental data points gathered from the literature. According to the results, the QSAR-BANN(Staking of 30 networks) is a more powerful and effective computational learning machine than the QSAR-SNN. The regression coefficients “ $${R}^{2}$$ ” and the root mean squared error “RMSE” for the QSAR-BANN(Staking of 30 networks) model are estimated to be 0.9672 and 3.2810\%, respectively. Moreover, QSAR-BANN(Staking of 30 networks) model capabilities is showed to describe the removal of PhACS by NF/RO and its precision is compared to proposed previous models, where this comparison showed the superiority of our BANN model. The work with one class of organic compounds (PhACs) is more suitable for prediction performances NF/RO by QSAR-BANN model.},

  abstract     = {A malicious data miner can infer users’ private information in online social networks (OSNs) by data mining the users’ disclosed information. By exploring the public information about a target user (i.e. an individual or a group of OSN users whose privacy is under attack), attackers can prepare a training data set holding similar information about other users who openly disclosed their data. Using a machine learning classifier, the attacker can input released information about users under attack as non-class attributes and extract the private information as a class attribute. Some techniques offer some privacy protection against specific classifiers;, however, the provided privacy can be under threat if an attacker uses a different classifier (rather than the one used by the privacy protection techniques) to infer sensitive information. In reality, it is difficult to predict the classifiers involved in a privacy attack. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving technique which first prepares a training data set in a similar way that an attacker can prepare and then takes an approach independent of the classifiers to extract patterns (or logic rules) from the training data set. Based on the extracted rule set, it then suggests the target users to hide some non-class attribute values and/or modify some friendship links for protecting their privacy. We apply our proposed technique on two OSN data sets containing users’ attribute values and their friendship links. For evaluating the performance of the proposed technique, we use conventional classifiers such as Na $$\ddot{\text {i}}$$ ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest on the privacy-protected data sets. The experimental results show that our proposed technique outperforms the existing privacy-preserving algorithms in terms of securing privacy while maintaining the data utility.},

  abstract     = {Along with online social media’s prosperity, the amount of user-generated reviews dramatically increases. The kinds of text-based user-generated content are conducive to estimating public sentiments. Many sentiment analysis works are based on the assumption that the sentiment expressed in online reviews can be retrieved from general text features. However, text redundancy and quantity can potentially impact the analysis performance, especially when strict corpus size constraints are applied. This paper proposes a sentiment subset selection framework to construct a small set of documents from the original corpus to convey a subjective representation. The framework can filter irrelevant sentiment information based on topic modeling and select subsets by submodular maximization with respect to a cardinality constraint. Our proposed score function can facilitate the framework to capture fine-grained sentiment features expressed in reviews compared with the conventional submodular-based one. An empirical analysis for the efficacy of the proposed sentiment subset selection framework (SentiSS) on different context domains is conducted. The comparative study of the subset’s metric impact on different sentiment levels, namely positive, neural, and negative, is also performed. Experimental results show that the SentiSS framework can compress the sentiment corpus and maintain the classifier’s performance on the metrics at the same time.},

  abstract     = {Opinion maximization is a crucial optimization approach, which can be used in preventative health, such as heart disease, stroke or diabetes. The key issue of opinion maximization is to select a subset of initial influential individuals (i.e., seed nodes) with the desired opinion, spread the desired opinion to their neighbors and achieve the greatest opinion propagation. Previous researches on opinion maximization focus on user’s activation process or static opinions, but pay little attention to the combination between their activation process and dynamic opinion process. In addition, prevalent greedy and heuristic algorithms have some disadvantages, such as low accuracy or low efficiency. In this paper, we study the multi-stage opinion maximization for preventative health in social networks. First, we formulate the opinion maximization problem and leverage the proportion of desired opinions as the objective function. Based on multi-stage independent cascade and weighted voter model, we design the activated voter model to obtain user’s activation status and dynamic opinion process. Moreover, we propose a novel Multi-stage Opinion Maximization Scheme (MOMS), which is composed of three phases: (i) the selection of candidate seed nodes, (ii) the generation of seed nodes and (iii) dynamic change of node opinions by the activated voter model. We use an effective heuristic rule to exclude some less essential nodes and select candidate seed nodes. Then, we determine seed nodes of each stage using the improved heuristic algorithm through combining the advantages of heuristic algorithm and greedy algorithm. Finally, experimental results on six social network datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has more superior proportion of desired opinions than the chosen benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Localization or positioning of wireless sensor nodes is an essential task for a wide range of applications in wireless sensor networks-based fifth generation (5G) networks. Node localization using mobile aerial beacon nodes (MABNs) provides high localization accuracy and less deployment cost compared to the localization using fixed ground beacon nodes because MABN deployed in unmanned aerial vehicles sends signals to unknown nodes (UNs) through reliable air to ground (AG) channel link. The classical received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based multilateration and optimization-based least square localization (OLSL) schemes result high localization error because of the nonlinear distortions induced in the wireless channel. So, the highly nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) are used effectively for nonlinear node localization problems. ANN-based localization techniques are also capable of localizing mobile UNs. Further, the RBF with Gaussian activation has a little edge over the MLP with sigmoid activation because the wireless channel usually modelled with a Gaussian random variable. The simulation results included in this article also justify the efficacy of the proposed RBF localization with performance gain of about (7–70)\% over MLP, OLSL and RSSI localization techniques.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we report a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-based weight-quantized/binarized online-learning spiking neural network (SNN). The SNN uses bio-plausible integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron and conductance-based synapse as the basic building blocks and realizes online learning by STDP and winner-take-all (WTA) mechanism. Weight quantization/binarization is introduced into the online-learning SNN to reduce storage requirements and improve computing efficiency. After the training process with STDP and weight quantization on the MNIST training set, the quantized SNN with 4-bit weight achieves a recognition accuracy of 93.8\% on the MNIST test set, showing little loss compared with the accuracy of the non-quantized 32-bit SNN (94.1\%). The accuracy of the binarized SNN slightly decreases to 92.9\%, which is cost-effective considering the reduction in the weight storage space by ~ 32 times, and the product of input and weight in the binarized SNN can be realized by computationally cheap 1-bit “AND” operation. The proposed weight quantization/binarization online-learning scheme can largely save hardware costs. The area of the quantized (8-bit and 4-bit) and binarized (1-bit) SNN-based hardware is evaluated to be 448,524, 179,263, and 162,129 μm2, respectively, which is much smaller than their non-quantized 32-bit competitor (area of ~ 5.862 × 108 μm2). The hardware resource evaluation also provides a guide to make a trade-off between computational cost and performance. Moreover, the quantized/binarized STDP training method can be further extended to train various types of SNNs. In this regard, a hybrid STDP SNN and a hybrid STDP convolutional SNN, which are trained by combining unsupervised quantized/binarized STDP and supervised backpropagation (BP) training methods, achieve high accuracy in facial expression recognition scenarios.},

The algorithm also limits the usage of too many parameters like acceleration factors, maximum velocity, inertia weight that plays a vital role in PSO, GSA and PSOGSA. The efficacy of the algorithm has been tested upon unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. We have also evaluated the performance of the algorithm by applying it on various benchmark datasets. The algorithm uses a wrapper-based approach that includes Support Vector Machine as a learner algorithm, and improves both the execution time and the performance accuracy.

The proposed approach in this paper provides a fast and simple procedure for training a deep neural network to identify the object and its keypoints based on synthetic dataset and autolabeling program. To our knowledge, this is the first deep network trained only on synthetic data that can find keypoints of intra-category objects for pose estimation purposes. The speed of training and the simplicity of this method make it very easy to add a new class of objects to the system which is the main advantage of this approach.

  abstract     = {Content-based image retrieval is the process of retrieving images similar to the Query Image. The task of finding the dissimilarity among the different objects is the primary challenge in the content-based retrieval system. The challenge increases when the dissimilarity among similar objects is less. For instance, retrieving sunflowers from the dataset having different types of objects (i.e., the uncategorized dataset) like faces, rose, ball, mountains, etc. is a challenging task but what if the sunflowers are to be retrieved from the dataset having flowers only (i.e., the categorized dataset)? Such scenarios make content-based image retrieval more challenging because now the objects are very much similar to each other (categorized) and finding dissimilarity among them is a difficult task. In the state-of-the-art approaches, much work has been done on uncategorized data as compared to categorized one. The present paper proposes an image retrieval approach out of the objects of the same category as of Query Image.

ICOA is first developed by carrying out two improvements on two new solution generation mechanisms of original coyote optimization algorithm (COA). In the first mechanism, ICOA has used the so-far best solution instead of the tendency solution like COA. In the second mechanism, a local search mechanism has been proposed to update the so-far best solution. ICOA determines opened switches in aim to minimize total power losses. In addition, a modified power flow (MPF) method based on the technique of backward/forward sweeps is proposed to solve power flow for unbalanced distribution system. The proposed MPF method has been highly accurate in comparison with the Power System Simulator/Advanced Distribution Engineering Productivity Tool software (PSS/ADEPT). The ICOA together with COA, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and sunflower optimization (SFO) have been implemented on three systems including 25-node, 33-node and 69-node for comparison. As a result, ICOA has outperformed COA, PSO, SFO and other existing methods for the EDNR problem. Consequently, the combination of the proposed MPF method and ICOA for solving EDNR problem with unbalanced load can lead to high effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a modified version of a well-known optimization technique called Farmland Fertility Optimization algorithm (FFA). The modified FFA (MFFA) is developed in order to improve the performance of conventional FFA. It is mainly based on two stages. Firstly, the Levy flights are used to enhance the local searching capability in the exploitation phase and the global searching capability in the exploration phase. Secondly sine–cosine functions are used to create different solutions which fluctuate outwards or towards the best possible solution. The developed algorithm has been validated using ten benchmark functions and three mechanical engineering benchmark optimization problems. After that, the newly developed algorithm MFFA is used for extracting the effective unknown parameters of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) models. The optimal extraction of these parameters is essential to determine an accurate semi-empirical mathematical model for PEMFC. The sum of squared errors between the experimental data and the corresponding calculated ones is adopted as the objective function. Four different commercial PEMFC stacks are used to validate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. The results obtained by MFFA are compared with those obtained by the conventional FFA and other well-known optimization techniques. Moreover, a comprehensive statistical analysis is performed to determine the accuracy and efficiency of the developed algorithm. The results prove the reliability and superiority of the developed algorithm compared with the conventional FFA and other state-of-the-art optimizers.},

  abstract     = {Popular translators such as Google, Bing, etc., perform quite well when translating among the popular languages such as English, French, etc.; however, they make elementary mistakes when translating the low-resource languages such as Bengali, Arabic, etc. Google uses Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approach to build its multilingual translation system. Prior to NMT, Google used Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach. However, these approaches solely depend on the availability of a large parallel corpus of the translating language pairs. As a result, a good number of widely spoken languages such as Bengali, remain little explored in the research arena of artificial intelligence. Hence, the goal of this study is to explore improvized translation from Bengali to English. To do so, we study both the rule-based translator and the corpus-based machine translators (NMT and SMT) in isolation, and in combination with different approaches of blending between them. More specifically, first, we adopt popular corpus-based machine translators (NMT and SMT) and a rule-based machine translator for Bengali to English translation. Next, we integrate the rule-based translator with each of the corpus-based machine translators separately using different approaches. Besides, we perform rigorous experimentation over different datasets to report the best performance score for Bengali to English translation till today by revealing a comparison among the different approaches in terms of translation performance. Finally, we discuss how our different blending approaches can be re-used for other low-resource languages.},

Action potential detection is performed by using an adaptive threshold. Also, during this process we have identified six different action potential shapes from the signals, which have been used to classify the action potentials. Our implementation runs at a frequency of 100 MHz with a low resource consumption for both architectures, and action potentials can be also observed in real time during a simulation in an OLED display.},

  abstract     = {Extracting information about Web entities has become commonplace in the academy and industry alike. In particular, data about places distinguish themselves as rich sources of geolocalized information and spatial context, serving as a foundation for a series of applications. This data, however, is inherently noisy and has several issues, such as data replication. In this work, we aim to detect replicated places using a deep-learning model, named PlacERN, that relies on multi-view encoders. These encoders learn different representations from distinct information levels of a place, using intermediate mappings and non-linearities. They are then compared in order to predict whether a place pair is a duplicate or not. We then indicate how this model can be used to solve the place linkage problem in an end-to-end fashion by fitting it into a pipeline. PlacERN is evaluated on top of two distinct datasets, containing missing values and high class imbalance. The results show that: (1) PlacERN is effective in performing place deduplication, even on such challenging datasets; and (2) it outperforms previous place deduplication approaches, and competitive algorithms, namely Random Forest and LightGBM using pairwise features, on both datasets in regards to different metrics (F score, Gini Coefficient and Area Under Precision-recall Curve).},

Multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) signals are converted to colour images for feeding them as an input for the p-DCNN. A deep neural network (DNN) such as a convolution neural network (CNN) may be directly used instead of transfer learning-based networks. However, a DNN requires too much training data, too much training time, and a computer with high-performance computational capability. The DNN also has several user-supplied hyper-parameters that must be tuned to obtain desirable classification success. To prevent these drawbacks, we propose a transfer learning technique to solve the neonatal seizures detection problem. Results of simulations and the statistical analysis enable us to devise a transfer learning technique employed for seizure detection.},

Meanwhile, detecting anomalies from graph has become a vital research problem of pressing societal concerns. Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning task of identifying rare data that differ from the majority. As one of the dominant anomaly detection algorithms, one-class support vector machine has been widely used to detect outliers. However, those traditional anomaly detection methods lost their effectiveness in graph data. Since traditional anomaly detection methods are stable, robust and easy to use, it is vitally important to generalize them to graph data. In this work, we propose one-class graph neural network (OCGNN), a one-class classification framework for graph anomaly detection. OCGNN is designed to combine the powerful representation ability of graph neural networks along with the classical one-class objective. Compared with other baselines, OCGNN achieves significant improvements in extensive experiments.},

A novel hybrid model called m-polar fuzzy soft expert sets is developed by the combination of m-polar fuzzy sets with soft expert sets; thus, it investigates soft expert sets in the m-polar fuzzy environment. The characteristics of this hybrid model are explored with the aid of numerical examples. Further, its basic properties are investigated, and the operations of subsethood, complement, intersection, union, plus the OR and AND operators are introduced. Two well-known real-world problems are solved with the developed hybrid model, namely site selection for a dam and human trafficking analysis for different countries. The algorithm of the proposed model proves its efficiency and cogency. A comparison of the developed model with existing mathematical methods is provided.},

  abstract     = {Pigmented skin lesions are common spots or growths on the skin that originate from melanocyte cells. Skin cancer occurs as a result of the uncontrolled division of melanocyte cells. Skin cancer is common worldwide and its incidence has been increasing. Timely and accurate diagnosis of skin cancer is important in reducing deaths. Skin cancer cases are diagnosed by expert dermatologists, but the number of experts is insufficient for the population. Dermoscopy is one of the most commonly used methods for imaging skin lesions. Sometimes misdiagnosis can occur in the interpretation of dermoscopic images by human experts. Computer-aided systems help to make accurate and objective decisions in the diagnosis of skin lesions. Convolutional neural network(CNN) is a deep learning technique commonly used in the field of computer vision and is also widely used in medical image analysis In this study, a CNN model was proposed to classify seven different skin lesions in the HAM10000 dataset. The model provided a classification accuracy of 91.51\%. The performance of the model was compared with similar studies in the literature and it was found that it showed higher success than most studies. The model was connected to a web application and evaluated in two phases by seven expert dermatologists. In the first phase, it was concluded that the model could diagnose skin lesions with 90.28\% accuracy in practice. In the second phase, the model corrected the experts&#39; misdiagnoses by 11.14\%.},

  abstract     = {Medical image segmentation plays an important role in many clinical medicines, such as medical diagnosis and computer-assisted treatment. However, due to the large quality differences, variable lesion areas and their complex shapes, medical image segmentation is a very challenging task. However, most of the recent deep learning methods ignore the global context information as well as the receptive fields of pixels and do not consider the reuse of pixel features during the feature extraction stage. In this paper, we propose DGFAU-Net, an encoder–decoder structured 2D segmentation model, to overcome the shortcomings aforementioned. In the encoder, DenseNet and AtrousCNN networks are leveraged to extract image features. The DenseNet network is mainly used to achieve the reuse of pixel features, and AtrousCNN is utilized to enhance the receptive field of pixels. In the decoder, two modules, global feature attention upsample (GFAU) and pyramid pooling attention squeeze-excitation (PPASE), are proposed. GFAU combines low-level and high-level features to generate new features with richer information for improving the perceptions of global contextual information of pixels. PPASE employs a multi-scale pooling layer to enhance the pixel’s acceptance field. In addition, Focal loss is used to balance the difference between samples of the lesion and non-lesioned areas. Extensive experiments are conducted on one local dataset and two public datasets, which are the local dataset of MRI images of carotid plaque, DRIVE vessel segmentation dataset and CHASE_DB1 vessel segmentation dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {The number of patients who die from stomach cancer is still very excessive. Early diagnosis of cancer patients is necessary to reduce the death rate. In this case, a molecular structure classification system can help carry out early diagnosis of cancer. The existing system has some problems. These problems are high cost, low accuracy rate and waste of time. To tackle this problem, this article presents a new method. This method consists of a new size reduction algorithm called as extending extract histogram of oriented gradients (EEHOG). A multimodality size reduction method is obtained by combining the new EEHOG method and other dimension reduction methods (ODRM). Other dimension reduction methods are multidimensional scaling (MDS), Sammon mapping, Isomap, local linear embedding (LLE), Laplacian eigenmaps, stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). As well, extract histogram of oriented gradients (EHOG) features have been calculated in this article. Then, EEHOG + MDS, EEHOG + Sammon mapping, EEHOG + Isomap, EEHOG + LLE, EEHOG + Laplacian Eigenmaps, EEHOG + SNE and EEHOG + t-SNE methods have been used for the dimensional reduction of the EHOG features. Thus, the high dimension of these features has been reduced to lower dimensions with a multimodality size reduction method. These new nominal feature sizes have been given to multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) and random forest (RF) classifier entries for classification of the histopathological stomach images. The accuracy results established by using the EEHOG + ODRM size reduction method are higher than the accuracy results obtained by using only ODRM. The accuracy result obtained with the MLP classifier is found to be higher from the accuracy results obtained with the RF classifier, when the performance of the MLP classifier is compared with the performance of the RF classifier. The stomach cancer images used this article were obtained from Fırat University Medical Faculty Pathology Department. It has been found that the highest accuracy results are obtained as 98.14\% with EHOG_EEHOG + LLE_MLP method. The average of the accuracy results obtained with the MLP classifier has been found as 89.57\%. However, the average of the accuracy results obtained with the RF classifier has been found as 84.49\%. These results have been compared with previous studies. It has been proven that more high accuracy results than single solutions of the multimodality solutions are given.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an examination of the wire electric discharge machining (WEDM) in processing Inconel 625. The major WEDM variables (pulse-on time, pulse-off time, servo voltage, wire feed rate) were experimentally investigated to address multiple aspects of this process, namely to reduce the gap current and surface roughness and increase the cutting speed. After testing the statistical significance of the major WEDM parameters for the three responses, an advanced statistical procedure was utilized for tackling correlations among outputs and their integration into the WEDM output performance in a fully objective manner. The Bayesian regularized neural network established a highly accurate process model that was engaged as the objective function for the evolutionary algorithms to identify the optimal machining conditions. The following algorithms were employed: particle swarm optimization, teaching-learning based optimization, grey wolf optimization and Jaya algorithm. Their results were thoroughly analyzed in terms of accuracy, i.e., repeatability of the resulting solutions, convergence speed and computational time, including assessment of the hyperparameter effects. The obtained optimal solution was highly convincing and it was successfully validated in a confirmation run. Therefore, the benefits of these findings are twofold, offering: (i) a thorough analysis of the four metaheuristics effectiveness in dealing with a real industrial problem, (ii) useful insights for controlling WEDM variables to enhance the technological, environmental and economic aspects at the same time.},

First, for sequential opcode data, we utilize natural language processing and deep learning techniques to facilitate the extraction of deeper behavioral features. Due to these features, this method can be impervious to code obfuscation and effective against novel malware. Finally, these features are fed to various machine learning algorithms for classification. The experiments on a more class balanced dataset of 26869 samples demonstrated that MCC (Matthew’s correlation coefficient) score as high as 0.95 is achievable with this approach. The MCC score results for the experiments conducted on imbalanced and artificially balanced datasets are 0.81 and 0.83, respectively.},

However, through experiments on soccer data we found that it can be surprisingly challenging to train a deep learning model for player trajectory prediction which outperforms linear extrapolation on average distance between predicted and true future trajectories. We propose and test a novel method for improving training by predicting a sparse trajectory and interpolating using constant acceleration, which improves performance for several models. This interpolation can also be used on models that are not trained with sparse outputs, and we find that this consistently improves performance for all tested models. Additionally, we find that the accuracy of predicted trajectories for a subset of players can be improved by conditioning on the full trajectories of the other players, and that this is further improved when combined with sparse predictions. We also propose a novel architecture using graph networks and multi-head attention (GraN–MA) which achieves better performance than other tested state-of-the-art models on our dataset and is trivially adapted for both sparse trajectories and full-trajectory conditioned trajectory prediction.},

The analytical approach was used to construct the models of the Etotal and Ttotal.

The reductions in the Etotal and Ttotal were 16.99\% and 17.78\%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed models of the Etotal and Ttotal were significant and could be used to predict technical performances with acceptable accuracy.

  abstract     = {Salinization of streams, rivers and other water sources threaten the civilizations, ecologies enduring constituent species that results in rendering the precious water unusable for human chores. Increase in salinity across the flow in streams and wet-lands have been mostly to raise a concern towards salt tolerance to various limits. Hence, it becomes important to monitor the acidity/alkalinity causing water parameters that can be referred to as salinity. The prime measure scale of salinity is the quality of potential-of-hydrogen (pH) present in river waters at two sample locations. Two locations that have been identified by CPCB as per the highly reported pollutants’ level found, have been analysed through artificial-intelligence (AI) conjucted with Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS). The hybrid of wavelet neuro-fuzzy inferences with that of MARS (WNF-MARS) predicted with more accuracy. Simulation of performance measures: root meant square error (RMSE); mean absolute error (MAE); goodness-of-fit (R2) together with their execution time for the three prototypes provided remarkable results. RMSE outcomes diminish on the whole on applying the training and validating data division in Wavelet conjucted MARS and WNF-MARS as compared to studying the data through MARS. Goodness-of-fit statistic analysed the concentration levels of salinity in the river at the identified sites. Thus, it is observed from this study that the pH levels provide future estimation of inapt quality of water at the source, so that it prohibits the further-decay of water consumed in the ecosystem. Thus, these predictors would be helpful towards formulation of strategies for protection of vegetation and other required purposes.},

  abstract     = {Traditional local image descriptors such as SIFT and SURF are based on processings similar to those that take place in the early visual cortex. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks still draw inspiration from the human vision system, integrating computational elements typical of higher visual cortical areas. Deep CNN’s architectures are intrinsically hard to interpret, so much effort has been made to dissect them in order to understand which type of features they learn. However, considering the resemblance to the human vision system, no enough attention has been devoted to understand if the image features learned by deep CNNs and used for classification correlate with features that humans select when viewing images, the so-called human fixations, nor if they correlate with earlier developed handcrafted features such as SIFT and SURF. Exploring these correlations is highly meaningful since what we require from CNNs, and features in general, is to recognize and correctly classify objects or subjects relevant to humans. In this paper, we establish the correlation between three families of image interest points: human fixations, handcrafted and CNN features. We extract features from the feature maps of selected layers of several deep CNN’s architectures, from the shallowest to the deepest. All features and fixations are then compared with two types of measures, global and local, which unveil the degree of similarity of the areas of interest of the three families. From the experiments carried out on ETD human fixations database, it turns out that human fixations are positively correlated with handcrafted features and even more with deep layers of CNNs and that handcrafted features highly correlate between themselves as some CNNs do.},

  abstract     = {Water distribution network (WDN) is one of the most essential infrastructures all over the world and ensuring water quality is always a top priority. To this end, water quality sensors are often deployed at multiple points of WDNs for real-time contamination detection and fast contamination source identification (CSI). Specifically, CSI aims to identify the location of the contamination source, together with some other variables such as the starting time and the duration. Such information is important in making an efficient plan to mitigate the contamination event. In the literature, simulation-optimisation methods, which combine simulation tools with evolutionary algorithms (EAs), show great potential in solving CSI problems. However, the application of EAs for CSI is still facing big challenges due to their high computational cost. In this paper, we propose DLGEA, a deep learning guided evolutionary algorithm to improve the efficiency by optimising the search space of EAs. Firstly, based on a large number of simulated contamination events, DLGEA trains a deep neural network (DNN) model to capture the relationship between the time series of sensor data and the contamination source nodes. Secondly, given a contamination event, DLGEA guides the initialisation and optimise the search space of EAs based on the top K contamination nodes predicated by the DNN model. Empirically, based on two benchmark WDNs, we show that DLGEA outperforms the CSI method purely based on EAs in terms of both the average topological distance and the accumulated errors between the predicted and the real contamination events.},

The proposed SMA-based method deals with the coordination problem using the most recent digital relays by selecting the optimal tripping standardized curve plus time dial and current pickup. Afterwards, the problem gets more sophisticated by bounding the relay tripping time inside a practical range to simulate the real network conditions. SMA’s performance is evaluated on two different test cases including highly penetrated distributed generators in the second one. The results of SMA are compared with other recent metaheuristic and conventional approaches reported in the literature under same conditions aimed at fair comparisons. It is declared that the SMA attains 29.9\% reduction in the relays total operating time for the first test case compared to the well-matured water cycle algorithm. Even, if the tested network is a highly penetrated by distributed generators, more reduction is achieved by 33.7\% with better convergence characteristics. It can be established that the SMA-based method demonstrates a competitive and reliable tool for minimizing the relays total operating time satisfying all the constraints even for the sophisticated scenarios.},

  abstract     = {With the exponential growth of the amount of data being generated, stored and processed on a daily basis in the machine learning, data analytics and decision-making systems, the data preprocessing established itself as the key factor for building reliable high-performance machine learning models. One of the roles in preprocessing is variable reduction using feature selection methods; however, the processing time needed for these methods is a major drawback. This study aims at mitigating this problem by migrating the algorithm to a MapReduce implementation suitable for parallelization on a high number of commodity hardware units. The genetic algorithm-based methods were put in the focus of this study. Hadoop, an open-source MapReduce library, was used as a framework for implementing parallel genetic algorithms within our research. The representative machine learning methods, SVM (support vector machine), ANN (artificial neural network), RT (random tree), logistic regression and Naive Bayes, were embedded into implementation for feature selection. The feature selection methods were applied to four NSL-KDD data sets, and the number of features is reduced from cca 40 to cca 10 data sets with the accuracy of 90.45\%. These results have both significant practical and theoretical impact. On the one hand, the genetic algorithm has been parallelized in the MapReduce manner, which has been considered unachievable in a strict sense. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm allows randomness-enhanced feature selection and its parallelization reduces overall data preprocessing and allows larger population count which in turn leads to better feature selection. On the practical side, it has been shown that this implementation outperforms the existing feature selection methods.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, ultra wideband (UWB) has been popular in indoor positioning systems. Because of obstacles such as walls, doors, desks and pedestrians in the indoor area, UWB devices have to be conducted in a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environment. The placement of nodes has significant influences on the performance of localization. In this paper, an anchor placement method for the target’s trajectory based on genetic heuristic differential evolution algorithm is proposed to improve the UWB localization accuracy. To be specific, in an area with low anchor densities, a target does not have enough anchors for multilateration localization; thus, a coverage degree criterion is defined. Meanwhile, the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) is used as an evaluation metric for localization accuracy, and both of CRLB and coverage degree criterion are incorporated into the evaluation function of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Furthermore, instead of using the liner distance path loss model, the more practical UWB-based through-wall signal propagation model is adopted to reflect the influences of obstacles that are widespread in indoor environments. In addition, a software application is developed to visualize the indoor scenario, signal propagation status and anchor placement results. Finally, field experiments and simulations are performed, and a thorough case study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. The average localization error of the proposed placement scheme can be reduced by 28.2\% and 12.5\% compared to the random scheme and the default DE-based scheme.},

First, judgments from decision makers (DMs) are expressed by PF sets that can describe more uncertain and ambiguous information than available fuzzy sets. Second, PF point operators are applied to denote the risk preference of the DM who may express an attitude toward an emerging science and technology. Third, a new generalized distance measurement formula considering all the characteristics of PF sets is proposed, and some attractive properties of distance measure, which outperforms available distance measures, are proved. Fourth, the novel generalized distance measure is employed to relative distance to identify the optimum and worst PF values and then employed in $$L_{p}$$ -metric VIKOR formula to accurately gain the group utility, individual regret, and compromise index. The novel PF-VIKOR algorithm considering DM’s risk preference and a novel distance measure is described in detail, and a blockchain technology solution selection problem is utilized to validate the feasibility of our technique. Then, the sensitivity analysis is implemented to test stability of our PF-VIKOR technique when the parameters in risk preferences and generalized distance measure are adjusted. Fifth, the comparison among various PF-MCDM techniques is performed to validate superiority and practicability of our presented technique.},

The improving of photovoltaic models based on optimizing method is recently the main simulation tool to construct I-V and P–V characteristic curves with the aid of system parameters. These parameters are extracted by using powerful optimal techniques that are building-up from datasheet of manufacturers or experimental data. This paper presents a novel proposed photovoltaic model based on Marine Predators Algorithm to estimate the optimal model parameters of solar cells or modules. Also, it can extract parameters of single diode, double diode and three diode models. Moreover, the Route Mean Square Error value between each model computed parameters and measured results of photovoltaic components are considered as the objective function. R.T.C. France Solar Cell, Photowatt-PWP201 and thin-film photovoltaic modules have been implemented to extract parameters for all three previously mentioned models at different irradiance intensities or temperature degrees. The proposed algorithm results of such cells and modules for each diode model are compared with other research works and manufacturer&#39;s results. Moreover, the evaluation of proposed algorithm has been presented considering the complexity analysis and statistical tests. The compared results show that, the accuracy of algorithm results is the best and their I-V and P–V characteristic curves are highly coinciding with manufacturer&#39;s curves. Therefore, the results of the proposed algorithm are satisfied with high superiority and better reliability to optimize parameters under different operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Physics-based reservoir simulation is the backbone of many decision-making processes in the oil and gas industry. However, due to being computationally demanding, simulating a model multiple times in iterative studies, such as history matching and production optimisation, is extremely time intensive. This downside results in it being practically impossible to update the model every time a set of new data are available. One of the popular solutions for this problem is creating a proxy model of the desired reservoir. However, the consequence of this approach is that such a proxy model can only represent one corresponding reservoir, and, for every new reservoir, a new proxy model must be rebuilt. Additionally, when the overall runtime is considered, it can be observed that, in some cases, iteratively running a numerical reservoir simulation may be quicker than the process of building, validating and using a proxy model. To overcome this obstacle, in this study, we used deep learning to create a data-driven simulator, deep net simulator (DNS), that enables us to simulate a wide range of reservoirs. Unlike the conventional proxy approach, we collected the training data from multiple reservoirs with completely different configurations and settings. We compared the precision and reliability of DNS with a commercial simulator for 600 generated case studies, consisting of 500,000,000 data points. DNS successfully predicts 45\%, 70\% and 90\% of the cases with a mean absolute percentage error of less than 5\%, 10\% and 15\%, respectively. Due to the indirect dependency of DNS on the initial and boundary conditions, DNS acts incredibly fast when compared with physics-based simulators. Our results showed that DNS is, on average, 9.25E+7 times faster than a commercial simulator.},

An attempt has been made to link functionality to distinct morphologies of retinal ganglion cells (RGC). Each RGC’s are organized in specific modular connectivity patterns with the photoreceptor cells via bipolar cells. Two distinct morphologies, separately integrated to a single layer network of RGCs, suggest multi-scale feature extraction and identification as one of the functional aspects, depending on the spatial spread of the dendrites of an individual neuron. Apart from texture selectivity, the model also suggests image segmentation as the basic functionality of a single-layered network of RGCs, which might be further feed-forward to successive networks for clustering and classification of visual information. The model shows directional edge selectivity as connectivity specific computation whereas the sensitivity toward fine to coarse edges is specific to the dendritic spread of the connected RGC. Later, the proposed model is incorporated in the hmax model designed by Poggio inspired by Hubel and Wiesel’s functional architecture of the striate cortex that produces some significant results in terms of pattern learning and object recognition.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have the potential to closely mimic the information processing of biological brains, by using massive neurons that are interconnected in a complex network. Recent researches have considered using electronic hardware circuits to SNN implementations to meet real-time processing requirements. Network-on-Chips (NoCs) have been widely used to develop such SNN circuits as their interconnections can offer stable interconnectivity for neuron communications with high throughput and real-time execution. However, its scalability is limited due to expensive and complex NoC routers which leads to high energy consumption and large area utilization. Therefore, a minimally buffered deflection router (MBDR) is proposed in this work to address the scalability challenge of the hardware SNNs. It employs a deflection router technique to remove most of the inter-buffers and other expensive components of the conventional routers. Moreover, a novel flow controller is developed in MBDR to further reduce power consumption. Compared to existing approaches, experimental results show that based on 90-nm CMOS technology the area and power consumption of the proposed router are reduced by ~ 86\% and ~ 88\%, respectively. In the meantime, system throughput is maintained at a high level.},

The machining behavior of biocomposites is affected by the matrix, the reinforcements (nature and size), by the cutting conditions and the mechanical properties of biocomposites. Some of the newly developed biocomposites are made of a polypropylene/polyolefin blend matrix, which has low thermal conductivity and low softening temperature. Therefore, the selection of cutting parameters should be done with care to avoid thermal-induced damages occurred during drilling biocomposites. Also, due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic properties of biocomposites, it is essential to develop models for predicting the effects of these factors on the machining process performance indicators. In this research work, a full factorial design is used to investigate the effects of machining parameters (feed rate, drill diameter, spindle speed, and reinforcement type) on machinability indicators during the drilling of the three new biocomposites: Polypropylene/Polyolefin matrix reinforced with biocarbon particles and/or miscanthus fibers. The regression and ANFIS-based models are established for predicting thrust force (Ft) and surface roughness (Ra) based on empirical data. The results obtained show that, for each tested biocomposite, the proposed ANFIS models have better predictive accuracy for thrust force and surface roughness than the regression-based models. Furthermore, the drilling parameters and reinforcements used in these biocomposites considerably affect their machinability.},

  abstract     = {Cardiac arrhythmias impose a significant burden on the healthcare environment due to the increasing ratio of mortality worldwide. Arrhythmia and abnormal ECG heartbeat are the possible symptoms of severe heart diseases that can lead to death. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common form of cardiac arrhythmia which begins from the lower chamber of the heart, and frequent occurrence of PVC beat might lead to mortality. ECG signals are the noninvasive and primary tool used to identify the actual life threat related to the heart. Nowadays, in society, the computer-assisted technique reduces doctors&#39; burden to evaluate heart disease and heart arrhythmia automatically. Regardless of well-equipped and well-developed health facilities that are available for monitoring the cardiac condition, the success stories are yet unsatisfactorily due to the complexity of the cardiac disorder. The most challenging part in ECG signal analysis is to extract the accurate features relevant to the arrhythmia for classification due to the inter-patient variation. There are many morphological changes present in the ECG signals. Hence, there is a gap in the usage of appropriate methods for the extraction of features and classification models, which reduce the biased diagnosis of PVC arrhythmia. To predict PVC arrhythmia accurately is a quite challenging task owing to (a) QRS negative (b) long compensatory pause (c) p-wave (d) biased diagnosis of PVC detection due to the small feature set. This study presents a new approach for PVC prediction using derived predictor variables from the electrocardiograph (ECG-MLII) signals: R–R wave interval, previous R–R wave interval, QRS duration, and verification of P-wave whether it is present or absent using threshold technique. We propose the machine learning-data mining MACDM integrated approach using five different models of multiple logistic regression and four classifiers, namely, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB). The experiment was conducted on the public benchmark MIT-BIH-AR to evaluate the performance of our proposed MACDM technique. The multiple logistic regression models constructed as a function of all independent variables achieved an accuracy of 99.96\%, sensitivity 98.9\%, specificity 99.20\%, PPV 99.25\%, and Youden&#39;s index parameter 98.24\%.

A customized deep learning network comprising the convolutional neural network module and the recurrent neural network module is built and trained using raw AE data directly. No statistical characteristics or handmade features are extracted from raw data, avoiding any possible precursor information losses. More than 600 million AE data from a repetitive fault failure experiment are segmented as several thousand equilong sequences to form training and validation samples. The proposed network delivers satisfactory predicted results with the R2 value 0.55, much better than results using traditional earthquake catalogs method. Results of this study also demonstrate that our network does not prioritize those AE signals collected when failures impend, which is a common bias in traditional earthquake prediction methods. This study definitely holds the promise of using deep learning in earthquake prediction. Further studies are needed when analogous studies proceed to an industrial practice.},

The Hopfield neural network (HNN) with linear activation function augmented by a feed forward layer is used to compute the MPI. In this work, the inverse of Jacobian matrix in solving the PFEs is determined by including feed forward network along with feedback network. The developed power flow technique is coded in MATLAB, and its effectiveness is tested on well-conditioned IEEE bus systems (9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus), naturally ill-conditioned systems (11-bus and 13-bus), and real-time Malaysian 87-bus system. The results of voltage magnitude and phase angle obtained are compared with standard Newton–Raphson method in case of well-conditioned system. Further, the sensitivity analysis of this approach is carried out against change in initial conditions, line outage, and increase in power generation to validate its robustness. The computational cost of convergence time is compared with well-known power flow techniques of Modified HNN, fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4), Iwamoto, and Euler method. The convergence of solution obtained from proposed technique is ensured by Lyapunov notion of stability.},

  abstract     = {The quest to improve performance accuracy and prediction speed in machine learning algorithms cannot be overemphasized, as the need for machines to outperform humans continue to grow. Accordingly, several studies have proposed methods to improve prediction performance and speed particularly for spatio-temporal analysis. This study proposes a novel classifier that leverages ensemble techniques to improve prediction performance and speed. The proposed classifier, Ada-AdaSVM uses an AdaBoost feature selection algorithm to select small features of input datasets for a joint support vector machine (SVM)–AdaBoost classifier. The proposition is evaluated against a selection of existing classifiers (SVM, AdaSVM and AdaBoost) using the Jaffe, Yale, Taiwanese facial expression database (TFEID) and CK + 48 datasets with Haar features as the preferred method for feature extraction. The findings indicated that Ada-AdaSVM outperforms SVM, AdaSVM and AdaBoost classifiers in terms of speed and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper studied the estimation of fresh properties of hybrid fiber-reinforced self-compacting concrete (HR-SCC) mixtures with different types and combinations of fibers by using two different prediction method named as the methodologies of extreme learning machine and long short-term memory (LSTM). For this purpose, 48 mixtures, which were designed as single, binary, ternary and quaternary fiber-reinforced SCC with macro-steel fiber, two micro-steel fibers having different aspect ratio, polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylalcohol (PVA), were used. Slump flow, t50 and J-ring tests for designed mixtures were conducted to measure the fresh properties of fiber-reinforced SCC mixtures as per EFNARC. The experimental results were analyzed by Anova method. In the devised prediction model, the amounts of cement, fly ash, silica fume, blast furnace slag, limestone powder, aggregate, water, high-range water-reducer admixture (HRWA) and the fiber ratios were selected as inputs, while the slump flow, t50 and the J-ring were selected as outputs. Based on the Anova analysis’ results, the macro-steel fiber was the most important parameter for the results of slump-flow diameter and t50, while the most important parameter for the results of J-ring was fly ash. Furthermore, it was found that the use of more than 0.20\% by volume of 6/0.16 micro-steel fiber positively influenced the fresh properties of SCC mixtures with hybrid fiber. On the other hand, the inclusion of steel fiber instead of synthetic fiber into SCC mixture as micro-fiber was more advantageous in terms of workability of mixtures as result of hydrophobic nature of steel fibers. This study found that extreme learning machine model estimated the slump flow, t50 and J-ring with 99.71\%, 81\% and 94.21\% accuracy, respectively, while deep learning model found the same experimental results with 99.18\%, 77.4\% and 84.8\% accuracy, respectively. It can be emphasized from this study that the extreme learning machine model had a better prediction ability than the deep learning model.},

However, these cropped feature maps of local receptive fields will heavily lose global context information. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework, called global context aware (GCA) RCNN, aiming at assisting the neural network in strengthening the spatial correlation between the background and the foreground by fusing global context information. The core component of our GCA framework is a context aware mechanism, in which both global feature pyramid and attention strategies are used for feature extraction and feature refinement, respectively. Specifically, we leverage the dense connection to improve the information flow of the global context at different stages in the top-down process of FPN, and further use the attention mechanism to refine the global context at each level in the feature pyramid. In the end, we also present a lightweight version of our method, which only slightly increases model complexity and computational burden. Experimental results on COCO benchmark dataset demonstrate the significant advantages of our approach.},

In this paper, we propose a unique system, in which the smart shoes are capable of energy harvesting when the user is walking, running, dancing, or carrying out any other similar activities. This generated power can be used to charge portable devices (like mobile) and to light up the LED torch. It also has Wi-Fi-that allows it to get connected to smartphones or any device on a cloud. The recorded data were used to determine the walking pattern of the user (gait analysis) using deep learning. The overall classification accuracy obtained with proposed smart shoes could reach up to 96.2\%. This gait analysis can be further used for detecting any injury or disorder that the shoe user is suffering from. One more unique feature of the proposed smart shoe is its capability of adjusting the size by using inflatable technology as per the user’s comfort.},

In this work, we propose a hybrid approach by combining statistical and supervised deep learning with neural network classifier, and gradient descent backpropagation error function for road safety investigation. The study area of Tyne and Wear County in the north-east of England is used as a case study. An accurate dynamic road safety model is constructed, and an understanding of the key parameters affecting the cyclist safety is developed.

In addition, we define the quantitative evaluation methods of two clinical indicators (that is the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal and the cross-sectional area of the dural sac) to assist LSS diagnosis. To improve the segmentation performance, a dual-branch multi-scale attention module is embedded into the network. It contains multi-scale feature extraction based on three 3 × 3 convolution operators and vital information selection based on attention mechanism. In the experiment, we used lumbar datasets from the spine surgery department of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University to evaluate the effect of the method embedded the dual-branch multi-scale attention module.

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (MMW) images can be used to identify metallic or non-metallic embargoed items hidden under clothing in both active and passive modes. Detection of concealed objects aims to locate these forbidden items from given MMW images. However, how to effectively realize the detection of concealed objects from MMW images is still a very challenging task, since the prohibited items are relatively smaller in size than human bodies, and the quality of MMW images is also relatively lower than natural images such as in signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, and further, domain shifts of MMW images are common in the real applications. In this paper, a domain adaptive detection system, mainly composed of two parts: a detection module and a domain adaptation module, is proposed. Our system takes reconstructed single-channel MMW images as the input. For the detection module, a top-down region-free network with attention units is proposed to effectively fuse low-level and high-level features. For the domain adaptation module, an unsupervised hierarchical alignment is proposed and incorporated into the training process to constrain the inter-domain difference of the extracted features by embedding the extracted features into kernel Hilbert spaces and optimally matching different domain distributions. Ablative experiments are conducted to evaluate the function of each module and the performance of the proposed system. Experimental results on both active and passive MMW datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is evidently superior over existing methods in accuracy and speed of detection and should be very useful in practice for concealed object detection.},

The vehicle fleet managers’ actions on the driver’s driving style to achieve fuel consumption savings are measures to increase the fleet’s energy efficiency. The authors developed a model for evaluating driving style using a type-2 fuzzy logic system. The model comprehensively considers three parameters: engine speed, accelerator pedal position, and acceleration/deceleration. These parameters can precisely describe the driving style and additionally have a strong influence on fuel consumption. The model output is the driver’s score, representing the influence of driving style to fuel consumption. The model is tested in the company whose drivers have attended the eco-driving training course. Each driver’s driving style was monitored for 15 days to obtain trustworthy assessments regarding driving style. The result was twofold: firstly, we point out the importance of simultaneous observation of all three defined parameters to get reliable driver’s score in terms of driving style, and secondly, it is established that drivers have significantly different driving styles regardless of whether they have attended the same eco-driving training. The established differences in driving styles have a direct impact on the obtained differences in fuel consumption among drivers.

To this end, four grayscale image datasets have been constructed by converting some files from the source of the android applications into grayscale images. Then, two types of image-based features, namely local features and global features, have been extracted from the constructed image datasets and used for training the proposed model. The bag of visual words representation has been used for constructing one feature vector from multiple local feature descriptors extracted from each image. After that, 1D-convolutional layers-based neural network model has been proposed and trained using the extracted local and global image-based features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a convolutional neural network model is trained based on this type of features and used in the android malware detection domain. Furthermore, two classical 2D-convolutional layers-based neural network models have been proposed and two well-known deep learning models have been tested in order to compare the results of the proposed DeepVisDroid model with the results of the traditional convolutional neural network models and the results of the state-of-the-art deep learning models. The results of the proposed DeepVisDroid model are very promising, where its classification accuracy reached more than 98\% with very efficient run-time overhead ranging between 0.11 and 2.02 s for each sample.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study was to review different literatures to assess the applicability of artificial neural network in predicting temperature. Temperature prediction as part of weather prediction involves the application of science and technology to predict the state of temperature for a future period in a specific location. Artificial neural network (ANN) has been found to be a promising tool to be used in temperature prediction because it is able to handle complex and nonlinear physical variables of the atmosphere. The use of ANN for prediction of weather elements has shown significant improvements in prediction and accuracy. The performance of the ANN model varies depending on the nature and number of input data used in training the network, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, architecture of a network, transfer function and on the training algorithms. The choice of ANN architecture and the type of data depend on the nature of the problem to be addressed. ANN is therefore found to be a powerful tool in predicting temperature of a specific place, provided input parameters of the model are well chosen.},

  abstract     = {The goal of steganalysis is to unearth a concealed message hidden inside an innocent carrier by steganography. Steganography in the hands of unlawful people can pose a great threat to society. Secret message is embedded as a noise (residue) which silently disrupts the statistical nature of the carrier without visual transformation. For the purpose of unearthing covert communication, modeling this noise (residue) is a crucial factor. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning framework is proposed with convolutional neural network (CNN) to emphasize the need for residual based investigation for digital image steganalysis. In order to model the noise residuals, five types of handcrafted features are extracted, in which the first four types rely on acquiring noise residuals based on filtering by linear and nonlinear filters, and the fifth type relies on residual acquisition method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The extracted features are categorized using a robust CNN with a new parallel architecture that is capable of learning intricate details from input features to classify it as cover or stego. Mostly CNNs are trained with raw images, but in the proposed method, the 1-dimensional residual features are stacked into 2-dimensional grid and are then used to train the CNN. Three spatial content-adaptive and four spatial non-content-adaptive algorithms are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. The experimental results show the versatility and robustness of the proposed hybrid architecture towards these algorithms when compared to existing state-of-the-art steganalytic methods. A practical issue prevalent in deploying steganalysis in real-world is ‘mismatch scenario,’ and based on the experimentation done in this paper, the proposed architecture performs well under stego algorithm mismatch and payload mismatch scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle trajectory prediction is a task in mobile robot dynamic obstacle avoidance. One of the most critical issues of dynamic obstacle trajectory prediction is how the robot can accurately and timely perceive and predict trajectories of all obstacles in the same scene when their motion states are different. This study presents an adaptive trajectory prediction system (ATPS) to answer the question. First, we propose a semantic-based dynamic object classification benchmark to distinguish objects in different motion states. Second, this article proposes a dynamic strategy which adaptively selects suitable trajectory prediction methods for different types of dynamic objects. Finally, we develop an improved dynamic gray model (DGM) and apply it to the system to obtain higher prediction accuracy and efficiency. We conduct experiments on different public datasets and real scenes to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the ATPS. We first conduct an evaluation of the DGM’s performance. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the DGM is improved compared with the traditional gray model, and the prediction efficiency is improved by about 25\%. Second, we conduct a strategy evaluation experiment. The results show that the dynamic strategy proposed in this study improves prediction efficiency for regularly moving objects and improves the stability of prediction accuracy for randomly moving objects. Finally, we compared the ATPS with other advanced algorithms such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Particle Swarm Optimization—Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (PSO-ARIMA). Our system has the highest prediction accuracy and the most stable prediction efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Grouping the sensor nodes into clusters is an effective way to organize wireless sensor networks and to prolong the networks’ lifetime. This paper presents a static clustering algorithm that employs predator–prey optimization (PPO) for identifying cluster heads as well as routes for sending data to the sink. The objective of the optimization algorithm is to reduce the energy consumed in data collection and transmission, to achieve equalization in energy utilization by the wireless sensor nodes and to prolong the wireless sensor network lifetime while avoiding the expenses of cluster reformation in each communication round. The novelty of this algorithm is to treat the identification of cluster heads and the choice of transmission paths a unified optimization problem of minimizing the total energy cost of the network, whereas existing algorithms consider them two separate optimization sub-problems. PPO algorithm is applied to select the most appropriate pair of cluster heads for each cluster. It also identifies the optimum communication path, which can be single or multiple hop. The energy consumed in data transmission is reduced and a uniformity in residual energy of the nodes is achieved. The performance of the novel algorithm has been evaluated by observing the patterns in which nodes consume their energies. The number of packets that are successfully delivered has been found to be better than the existing static clustering algorithms, and at par with the finest dynamic clustering algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The real-time availability of key water quality parameters is of great importance for an advanced and optimized process control in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, due to the complex environment conditions and costly measuring instruments, it is generally difficult and time-consuming to measure certain key water quality parameters online, such as the effluent biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and the effluent total nitrogen (TN). Recently, artificial neural networks have powered the online prediction tasks in several WWTPs. Hence, in this paper, an adaptive task-oriented radial basis function (ATO-RBF) network is developed to design prediction models for accurate timely acquirements of the effluent BOD and the effluent TN. The advantage of ATO-RBF network is that the architecture is not designed by human engineers; it is adaptively generated from the data to be processed. First, to enhance the learning ability and generalization performance of prediction models, an error correction-based growing strategy and a second-order learning algorithm are combined to design the ATO-RBF network. Then, RFB nodes with low significance would be pruned without sacrificing the learning accuracy, making the prediction model more compact. Additionally, the convergence of the ATO-RBF network is analyzed based on the Lyapunov criterion, which can guarantee its feasibility in practical applications. Finally, the proposed methodology is verified by benchmark simulations and real industrial data, showing superior prediction accuracy in compared with conventional methods.},

In recent years, most of the computational approaches are constructed on protein sequence information, but the protein structure has not been considered. In this paper, we use a novel computational model of RNA-binding residues prediction, using protein sequence and structure information. Our hybrid features are encoded by local sequence and structure feature extraction models. Our predictor is built by employing the Granular Multiple Kernel Support Vector Machine with Repetitive Under-sampling (GMKSVM-RU). In order to evaluate our method, we use fivefold cross-validation on the RBP129, our method achieves better experimental performance with MCC of 0.3367 and accuracy of 88.84\%. In order to further evaluate our model, an independent data set (RBP60) is employed, and our method achieves MCC of 0.3921 and accuracy of 87.52\%. Above results demonstrate that integrating sequence and structure information is beneficial to improve the prediction ability of RNA-binding residues.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms (MOPS) are used successfully to solve real-life optimization problems. The multi-objective algorithms based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) have seen various adaptations to improve convergence to the true Pareto-optimal front and well-diverse non-dominated solution. In some cases, the values of the MOPS control parameters need to be fine-tuned while solving a specific multi-objective optimization problem. It is challenge to correctly fine-tune the value of the PSO control parameters when the true non-dominated solutions are not known as in case of a real-life optimization problem. To address this challenge, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm that uses constant PSO control parameters was developed. The new algorithm called NF-MOPSO is capable of solving different multi-objective optimization problems without the need of fine-tuning the value of the PSO control parameters. The NF-MOPSO enhances the convergence to the true Pareto-optimal front and improves the diversity of Pareto-optimal using the same fixed values for all the PSO control parameters. The NF-MOPSO uses constant values of the PSO control parameters such as acceleration coefficients $$c_{1}$$ and $$c_{2}$$ , and inertia weight $$\omega$$ . A Gaussian mutation is applied to the position of particles to increase diversity while a penalty function is used as constraint mechanism. The algorithm has been tested on 45 well-known benchmark test functions using four performance metrics. The test results demonstrate the capability of the NF-MOPSO to solve different multi-objective optimization problems using the same value of the PSO control parameters. The capability of the NF-MOPSO was demonstrated in real-life optimization problem by solving a multi-objective optimization problem of a neutron radiography collimator. The results of collimator optimization showed that the optimizer was able to provide a set of Pareto optimal solutions from which the geometrical design parameters of a collimator could be retrieved for given application.},

  abstract     = {Time series modelling is gaining spectacular popularity in the prediction process of decision making, with applications including real-world management and engineering. However, for short time series, prediction has to face unavoidable limitation for modelling extremely complex systems. It has to apply inadequate and incomplete data from short time to predict unknown observations. With such limited data source, existing techniques, such as statistical modelling or machine learning methods, fail to predict short time series effectively. To address this problem, this paper provides a global framework for short time series modelling predictions, integrating the rolling mechanism, grey model, and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. In addition, dragonfly algorithm and whale optimization algorithm are investigated and deployed to optimize the framework by enhancing its predicting accuracy with less computational costs. To verify the performance of the proposed framework, three industrial cases are introduced as simulation experiments in this paper. Experimental results confirm that the framework solves corresponding short time series modelling predictions with greater accuracy and speed than the standard GM(1,1) models.

  abstract     = {Distant supervised relation extraction has been widely used to find novel relational facts from unstructured text. As far as we know, nearly all existing relation extraction models assume that each sentence contains precisely one entity pair, i.e., two entities. However, in reality, the datasets constructed by distant supervision have lots of sentences which contain repeated entities. In other words, there may be more than two entities in a sentence. This phenomenon breaks the assumption of existing models and makes them inevitably encounter the attention bias problem; that is, the model focuses on the wrong entities during relation extraction. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we utilize the idea of ensemble learning and propose a novel distant supervised relation extraction model. The proposed model follows the multi-instance multi-label learning mechanism and conducts relation extraction based on the sentence-bag representations. Specifically, it first tries to identify the most critical entity and keywords, and then it uses voting mechanism to determine the sentence-level and bag-level features. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in relation extraction on a popular benchmark dataset, and it also indicates that the proposed model can indeed alleviate the problem caused by repeated-entity phenomenon.},

Although deep learning achieved better accuracy in sentiment analysis, there is a lack of explain-ability. Thus, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of techniques for sentiment analysis of Chinese short financial texts with deep learning. For this, we built a Chinese short financial texts corpus (CSFC) and designed an ablation experiment. Beside the CFSC, we used a Chinese review collection and an English short-text repository in the experiment for comparison. There are five techniques involved. They are the Pinyin, the segmentation, the lexical analysis, the phrase structure and the attention mechanism. As results, we found that the phrase structure and the attention mechanism are two of the best. Therefore, the best model in the experiment is called a Phrase Structure and Attention-based Deep network model (PhraSAD). Moreover, to improve the classification accuracy on neutral data, we use a dual classifier strategy for 3-class problems. Experimental results showed that PhraSAD outperformed all other compared models on all experimental datasets.},

  abstract     = {The impact of viscous dissipation in hybrid nanofluid plays a prominent role in industrial applications, for instance, in polymer processing flows and aerodynamic heating. Thus, the current investigation scrutinises the heat transfer performance of Al2O3–Cu/H2O in the magnetohydrodynamics stagnation point flow towards an exponentially stretching/shrinking surface with a viscous dissipation effect. By adopting valid similarity transformations, the differential equations that consist of multivariable functions and their partial derivatives are transformed into a special case of ordinary differential equations. The reduced mathematical model is elucidated using the bvp4c procedure in MATLAB systems software. This approach of solving is proficient for supplying non-uniqueness solution when sufficient initial assumptions are delivered. The effects of different controlling parameters were examined, and the findings disclosed that the coefficient of skin friction and the local Nusselt number increase by addition of nanoparticles. In contrast, the inclusion of the viscous dissipation effect causes an increase in the thermal state of the fluid hence triggers the thermal boundary layer to upraise. The outcomes are evidenced to provide more than one solutions, whereby necessarily result in an analysis of solution stability that affirms the first solution’s viability.},

  abstract     = {In the last years, a big interest of both the scientific community and the market has been devoted to the design of audio surveillance systems, able to analyse the audio stream and to identify events of interest; this is particularly true in security applications, in which the audio analytics can be profitably used as an alternative to video analytics systems, but also combined with them. Within this context, in this paper we propose a novel recurrent convolutional neural network architecture, named DENet; it is based on a new layer that we call denoising-enhancement (DE) layer, which performs denoising and enhancement of the original signal by applying an attention map on the components of the band-filtered signal. Differently from state-of-the-art methodologies, DENet takes as input the lossless raw waveform and is able to automatically learn the evolution of the frequencies-of-interest over time, by combining the proposed layer with a bidirectional gated recurrent unit. Using the feedbacks coming from classifications related to consecutive frames (i.e. that belong to the same event), the proposed method is able to drastically reduce the misclassifications. We carried out experiments on the MIVIA Audio Events and MIVIA Road Events public datasets, confirming the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other state-of-the-art methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Sediment transport modeling is of primary importance for the determination of channel design velocity in lined channels. This study proposes to model sediment transport in open channel flow using kernel ridge regression (KRR), a nonlinear regression technique formulated in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. While the naïve kernel regression approach provides high flexibility for modeling purposes, the regularized variant is equipped with an additional mechanism for better generalization capability. In order to better tailor the KRR approach to the sediment transport modeling problem, unlike the conventional KRR approach, in this study the kernel parameter is directly learned from the data via a new gradient descent-based learning mechanism. Moreover, for model construction, a procedure based on Cholesky decomposition and forward-back substitution is applied to improve the computational complexity of the approach. Evaluation of the recommended technique is performed utilizing a large number of laboratory experimental data where the examination of the proposed approach in terms of three statistical performance indices for sediment transport modeling indicates a better performance for the developed model in particle Froude number computation, outperforming the conventional models as well as some other machine learning techniques.},

  abstract     = {Classification tasks in datasets that suffer from high class imbalance pose challenge to machine learning algorithms and such datasets are prevalent in many real-world domains and applications. In machine learning research, ensemble methods for classification tasks in imbalanced datasets have attracted a lot of attention due to their ability to improve classification performance. However, these methods are still prone to the negative effects of noise in the training sets. Furthermore, many of them alter the original class distribution to create a sort of balance in the datasets through over-sampling or undersampling techniques, which can lead to overfitting or discarding useful data, respectively, and thus may still hamper performance. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble method for classification that creates an arbitrary number of balanced splits (sBal) of data generated based on Instance Hardness as a weighting mechanism for creating balanced bags. Each of the generated bags will contain all the minority instances, and a mixture of majority instances with varying degrees of hardness (easy, normal, and hard), and we call this approach sBal_IH technique. This will enable base learners to train on different balanced bags comprising varied characteristics of the training data. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method on a total of 100 datasets that include 30 synthetic datasets with controlled levels of noise, 29 balanced and 41 imbalanced real-world datasets, and compared its performance with both traditional ensemble methods (Bagging, Wagging Random Forest, and AdaBoost), and those specialized for class imbalanced problems (Balanced Bagging, Balanced Random forest, RUSBoost, and Easy Ensemble). The results reveal that our proposed method brings a substantial improvement in classification performance relevant to the compared methods. For statistical significance analysis, we conducted Friedman’s nonparametric statistical test with Bergman post hoc test. The analysis shows that our method performs significantly better than the compared traditional and specialized ensemble methods for imbalanced problems across many datasets.},

Different from conventional oversampling methods, ESMOTE finds the near-optimal oversampling parameters by evolving the parameter representation based on the pre-predicted warfarin dose and then synthesizes new samples to balance the data. The CEM, which improves the performance of random forest (RF) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models using a hybrid mechanism in the regression calculation, estimates the daily dose of warfarin. We test the ESMOTE-CEM on a dataset of 733 samples collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC). The results show that ESMOTE outperformed the other oversampling methods by at least 6.98\% for R2 and 5.03\% for the mean squared error (MSE). In terms of the percentage of patients whose predicted warfarin dose is within 20\% of the actual stable therapeutic dose (20\%-p value), the ESMOTE-CEM achieves a 20\%-p value of 50\%. Moreover, compared to RF, BRT and AdaBoost models, the CEM is the most suitable base predictive model for ESMOTE.},

This paper investigates pricing in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer with two distribution channels, direct (Internet) and indirect (retailer). The decision variables of the manufacturer are wholesale price and greening level of the product, while the retail price is the decision variable of the retailer. Due to the existence of uncertain conditions in the real world, this problem has been modeled by fuzzy parameters. A game theory approach is employed to provide equilibrium solutions for cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. Finally, a numerical analysis is presented, and a sensitivity analysis is investigated. For example, it is concluded that vertical cooperation in the supply chain, in addition to increasing the entire supply chain profit, increases the product greenness level and thus improves the environment.},

This study has two objectives: first, to observe the effect of using different sized training sets in LSTM training for various and numerous databases; second, to develop a clustering model that contributes to adjusting the training set size. For this purpose, 83 datasets were divided into certain sizes and LSTM model performances were examined depending on these training set sizes. As a result, enlargement of the training set size reduced LSTM errors monotonic for certain datasets. This phenomenon was modeled with the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression and pattern recognition networks (PRNet). In these models, statistical properties of datasets were utilized as input. The best results were obtained by PRNet, and SVM model performance was closest to PRNet. This study indicates that enlarging the training set size in traffic flow prediction increases the LSTM performance monotonically for specific datasets. In addition, a high-precision clustering model is presented to assist researchers in short-term traffic forecasting to adjust the size of the training set.},

In order to represent elements in knowledge graphs, knowledge graph embedding techniques are proposed to map entities and relations into continuous vector spaces as numeric vectors for computational efficiency. Convolution-based knowledge graph embedding models have promising performance for knowledge graph representation learning. However, the input of those neural network-based models is frequently in handmade forms and may suffer from low efficiency in feature extraction procedure of the models. In this paper, a convolutional autoencoder is proposed for knowledge graph representation learning with entity pairs as input, aiming to obtain corresponding hidden relation representation. In addition, a bi-directional relation encoding network is utilized to represent semantic of entities in different directional relation patterns, as an encoder to output representation for initialization of the convolutional autoencoder.

In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Networks with Attention (GCN-A) model for multi-label weather recognition. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce GCN into weather recognition. Specifically, we employ GCN to capture weather co-occurrence dependencies via a directed graph. The graph is built over weather labels, where each node (weather label) is represented by word embeddings of a weather label. Furthermore, we design a re-weighted mechanism to build weather correlation matrix for information propagation among different nodes in GCN. In addition, we develop a channel-wise attention module to extract informative semantic features of weather for effective model training. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experiment results on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed GCN-A model achieves promising performance.},

  abstract     = {With an increase in online longitudinal users’ interactions, capturing users’ precise preferences and giving accurate recommendations have become an urgent need for all businesses. Existing sequence-aware methods generally exploit a static low-rank vector for acquiring the overall sequential features, and incorporate context information as auxiliary input. As a result, they have a restricted modeling ability for extracting multi-grained sequential behaviors over contextual information. In other words, they poorly capture the hierarchical relationship between context relations and item relations that currently influence users’ preferences in a unified framework. Besides, they usually utilize users’ short-term preferences with either static or irrelevant long-term representation for the prediction. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Context-aware Recommender System Based on a Deep Sequential Learning Approach (CReS) to capture users’ dynamic preferences by modeling the hierarchical relationships between contexts and items in a particular session, and for combining users’ short-term sessions with the relevant long-term representations. Specifically, within a certain session, we design a hierarchical attention network between the identified context relations and items relations, namely CReSession. Therefore, with CReSession, we could provide a suitable session representation that mimics the hierarchical user interests on multiple granularities of contextual types and its corresponding items. We then introduce a neural attentive bi-directional GRU network to distill only those highly related to the recent short-term session. Finally, the relevant long-term representations and the short-term session are combined with the sequential residual connection to form the final user representation in a unified manner. With extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, CReS not only achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of pre-defined metrics, but also provides an interpretable result regarding why we recommend these items to users.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence-based methodology [artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic] and a multiple regression-based analysis were conducted for modeling of the biogas production rate from a real full-scale sludge digestion process. In the computational analysis, five process-related parameters such as influent sludge flow rate, total solids content, total volatile solids content, alkalinity, and volatile fatty acids concentration were considered as the input variables for the proposed models. In the ANN-based modeling, a benchmark comparison of 11 backpropagation (BP) algorithms was employed in the first step, and the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm was chosen as the best BP algorithm in terms of their respective mean squared errors. According to the selected BP algorithm (scaled conjugate gradient BP), the number of neurons at the hidden layer was optimized as 14, and the coefficient of determination (R2) was obtained as 0.65 for the optimal three-layer ANN structure (5:14:1). In the second part of the study, a MISO (multiple-input single-output)-type fuzzy-logic model was developed, and five input variables were fuzzified in a knowledge-based manner. For the fuzzy subsets, trapezoidal membership functions were implemented with 10 and 20 levels, and a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system (FIS) was used to employ 394 rules in the if–then form. The product, summation, and centroid methods were employed, respectively, for implication, aggregation, and defuzzification processes conducted in the FIS. Fuzzy logic-produced forecasts were compared with the estimations obtained from both ANN-based model and a polynomial multiple regression-based model (employed as the third part of this study) derived in this study. Findings of this study clearly indicated that compared to ANN model and conventional multiple regression approach, the proposed MISO fuzzy logic-based model produced smaller deviations and exhibited a superior predictive performance on forecasting biogas production rate from a full-scale treatment plant with a satisfactory R2 value of 0.88.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is considered as one of the core concepts in the areas of machine learning and data mining which immensely impacts the performance of classification model. Through FS, irrelevant or partially relevant features can be eliminated which in turn helps in enhancing the performance of the model. Over the years, researchers have applied different meta-heuristic optimization techniques for the purpose of FS as these overcome the limitations of traditional optimization approaches. Going by the trend, we introduce a new FS approach based on a recently proposed meta-heuristic algorithm called Manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) which is developed following the food foraging nature of the Manta rays, one of the largest known marine creatures. As MRFO is apposite for continuous search space problems, we have adapted a binary version of MRFO to fit it into the problem of FS by applying eight different transfer functions belonging to two different families: S-shaped and V-shaped. We have evaluated the eight binary versions of MRFO on 18 standard UCI datasets. Of these, the best one is considered for comparison with 16 recently proposed meta-heuristic FS approaches. The results show that MRFO outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both classification accuracy and number of features selected.

  abstract     = {The growing demand for cloud computing adoption presents more challenges for researchers to make cloud computing more efficient and affordable for infrastructure providers and end users. The management of cloud computing involves investing in IT infrastructure in the first phase and investing in energy, maintenance and space costs in the second phase. However, energy costs account for a large portion of cloud management costs, and saving energy consumption can significantly reduce overall cloud management costs. Server consolidation is a strategy to improve data center energy efficiency and resource utilization. Virtual machine (VM) placement is considered one of the main problems with VM consolidation. The VM placement problem aims to reduce the number of active physical machines in data center to reduce data center power consumption and maintenance costs. However, the waste of data center resources has a significant impact on the energy efficiency of the data center, so it should be considered in the VM placement strategy. This paper proposes a new method based on the Monarch Butterfly Optimization algorithm (MBO) called MBO-VM for new virtual machine placement, designed to maximize packaging efficiency and reduce the number of active physical servers. CloudSim toolkit is used to test the efficiency of the proposed MBO-VM approach under real cloud workloads as well as synthetic workloads. Simulation results show that MBO-VM produces significantly better results compared with known VM placement techniques. The proposed MBO-VM can reduce the number of active servers more effectively and maximize the packaging efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is a commonly used method for exploring and analysing data where the primary objective is to categorise observations into similar clusters. In recent decades, several algorithms and methods have been developed for analysing clustered data. We notice that most of these techniques deterministically define a cluster based on the value of the attributes, distance, and density of homogenous and single-featured datasets. However, these definitions are not successful in adding clear semantic meaning to the clusters produced. Evolutionary operators and statistical and multidisciplinary techniques may help in generating meaningful clusters. Based on this premise, we propose a new evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECA*) based on social class ranking and meta-heuristic algorithms for stochastically analysing heterogeneous and multifeatured datasets. The ECA* is integrated with recombinational evolutionary operators, Levy flight optimisation, and some statistical techniques, such as quartiles and percentiles, as well as the Euclidean distance of the K-means algorithm. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the ECA* against five conventional approaches: K-means (KM), K-means++ (KM++), expectation maximisation (EM), learning vector quantisation (LVQ), and the genetic algorithm for clustering++ (GENCLUST++). That the end, 32 heterogeneous and multifeatured datasets are used to examine their performance using internal and external and basic statistical performance clustering measures and to measure how their performance is sensitive to five features of these datasets (cluster overlap, the number of clusters, cluster dimensionality, the cluster structure, and the cluster shape) in the form of an operational framework. The results indicate that the ECA* surpasses its counterpart techniques in terms of the ability to find the right clusters. Significantly, compared to its counterpart techniques, the ECA* is less sensitive to the five properties of the datasets mentioned above. Thus, the order of overall performance of these algorithms, from best performing to worst performing, is the ECA*, EM, KM++, KM, LVQ, and the GENCLUST++. Meanwhile, the overall performance rank of the ECA* is 1.1 (where the rank of 1 represents the best performing algorithm and the rank of 6 refers to the worst performing algorithm) for 32 datasets based on the five dataset features mentioned above.},

One of the problems posed when research is the ranking of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to apply it to decision-making problems. But so far, there has not been a common method to rank two arbitrary IVIFNs. In this paper, we propose a new ranking function based on polynomial and exponential functions to rank fuzzy numbers. The numerical examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness of our proposed score function. In this paper, the multi-criteria decision-making models based on our proposed new score function are also presented namely MOORA models.

Then, a correlation-based circular Hough transform (we named it CCHT) is proposed to extract iris from the surrounding structures. One of the advantages of the proposed method is its ability to determine the closed-eye images, in order to remove these images in the process of eye tracking procedure. Moreover, the algorithm is simple and fast which make it suitable for on-line eye tracking. Experimental results on UBIRIS, which contains some defocused and eyelid-occluded images as non-ideal and noisy frames, indicate that the proposed method is efficient and much faster, in comparison with the previous approaches and encouraging improved accuracy on iris detection.},

  abstract     = {The imbalances between supply and demand in an urban rail transit system have received extensive attention. Addressing these imbalances by controlling the movements of passengers in the system is a real challenge. To complete the peak passenger flow control scheme, a novel discrete event simulation (DES) optimization model based on queuing theory is proposed to minimize the urban rail transit company losses and the passenger time delays considering effects of congestion propagation among facilities at busy stations. The proposed approach can generate a control scheme that consists of the controlling number of entering passengers and the controlling parameters of facilities inside the station. The first stage of the method models the subway network using queuing theory and then builds a DES model that is based on an urban rail transit queuing network. In the second stage, a service-security-economic-oriented optimization model is established and combined with a queuing network simulation model to implement the simulation optimization. We present three numerical experiments to compare the optimization results in different passenger flow scenarios. The results demonstrate that the DES optimization method in this paper can provide a reasonable and reliable control scheme in daily operations.},

This hybrid model makes use of the salient features of convolution neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) with long–short-term memory network (LSTM). It uses CNN to extract the features from the handwritten image. The features that are extracted are later modelled with a sequence-to-sequence approach and fed to RNN–LSTM for encoding the visual features and decoding the sequence of letters that are available in the handwritten image. The proposed model is tested with IAM and RIMES handwritten databases, which shows competitive letter accuracy and word accuracy results.},

Therefore, this paper proposes an unsupervised feature learning method that automatically extracts and selects the features without human intervention. Specifically, the proposed method jointly trains a convolutional denoising autoencoder with a convolutional neural network to learn the underlying features and produces a compact feature representation of the data. This allows not only more accurate and discriminative features to be extracted but also reduces the computational cost and improves generalization of the classification models. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with deep learning convolutional neural networks on a public dataset. Results have shown that the proposed method can learn a salient feature representation and subsequently recognize the activities with an accuracy of 0.934 and perform comparably well to the convolutional neural networks.},

Visual interpretation and detection of immature WBC is a time-consuming and burdensome task for hematologists. The reliable and confident examination of the ALL blood specimen relies on a valid classification of lymphoblast cells. In this paper, we proposed two-stages Artificial Neural Networks integrated with the Particle Swarm Optimization method to classify the immature WBC in ALL patients. The proposed method includes binary classification of lymphoid cells in the first stages and binary classification of lymphoblast cells in the second stages. In this study, we have used five peripheral blood specimen samples obtained from Sardjito Hospital ALL dataset to develop the proposed model. The proposed model consists of data preprocessing, features selection, features extraction, and two-stage classification. The performance of our approach is compared with the common backpropagation neural networks classification (multiclass NN-BP) and multiclass neural networks particle swarm optimization (multiclass NN-PSO). The results show that the proposed method has better accuracy than other compared models with 86.92\% accuracy and should be developed and applied in other cases.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is recognized as a simplistic yet robust evolutionary algorithm: it has been utilized to tackle different challenging optimization problems in various science and engineering disciplines. DE has some disadvantages, such as premature convergence and slow convergence rate, leading to the worst DE execution arrangement. Two DE variations named adaptive parameter selection-based DE (APSDE) and chaotic map hybridization based on DE and PSO (CMHDE-PSO) have been proposed to tackle the issues mentioned above. The proposed variants contain three unique advantages for APSDE: (1) new population initialization scheme to keep up the decent variety of the population diversity; (2) controlled mutation factor technique followed by adaptive decreasing parameter selection procedure; (3) novel mutation strategy with a specific weighted pattern to determine the mutant vector for the mutation operation. Similarly, for CMHDE-PSO (1) novel distribution called Torus for the selection of initial population located in the search space; (2) new parameter adoption technique based on chaotic circle maps defined by chaos theory; (3) average pattern means of two different mutation strategies; (4) and lastly the hybridization of proposed improved DE with PSO to supports DE escaping local minima. Both APSDE and CMHDE-PSO are compared with several standard non-DE old-fashioned optimization algorithms and various advanced DE variants. We accomplish definite experiments behind the powerful searching technique by applying the APSDE and CMHDE-PSO-based mutation and parameter selection strategy for the function optimization and weight optimization of feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) on real-world data classification problems. For data classification performance evaluation, 10 data sets are utilized from the repository of UCI machine learning. Experimental results showed that APSDE and CMHDE-PSO extensively beat different EAs in all test functions and obtained higher accuracy with the recent state-of-the-art algorithms for weight optimization.},

  abstract     = {Search and rescue are essential applications of disaster management in which people are evacuated from the disaster-prone area to a safer place. This overall process of search and rescue can be more efficient if an automated system can quickly locate the human or area where rescue is required. To provide a faster and accurate search of those places, this paper proposes a novel approach to search and rescue using automated drone surveillance. In this paper, a complex scene classification problem is solved using the proposed 3DCNN model. The proposed model uses spatial as well as temporal features of the video for the classification of the scene as help or non-help in the natural disaster. Due to the unavailability of such kind of dataset, it is impossible to train the model. Therefore, it is essential to develop a dataset for search and rescue. The proposed dataset is a first and unique dataset for scene classification using drone surveillance. The major contribution of this paper is (1) a novel 3DCNN powered model for scene classification in drone surveillance, (2) to develop the required dataset for the training of scene classification model, and (3) particular swarm optimization (PSO)-based hyper-parameter tuning for getting the best value of multiple parameters used for training the model. Our hybridization of parameter tuning with PSO helps for the convergence of parameter values of proposed 3DCNN model, and the proposed scene classification model (3DCNN+PSO) is applied to the dataset. The proposed model gives an impressive performance to help situation identification with 98\% training and 99\% validation accuracy.},

However, most existing studies merely concerned about the relationship between the criteria but they have not investigated the interactions between membership function and non-membership function. To explore the multiple heterogeneous relationships among membership functions and criteria, we propose a novel decision algorithm based on q-ROF set to deal with these using interactive operators and Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operators. Specifically, the new interaction laws in the membership pairs of q-ROF sets are explained, and their properties are analyzed as the initial stage. Then, taking into account the influence of two or more factors on decision analysis, a q-ROF interaction Maclaurin symmetry mean (q-ROFIMSM) operator is formed based on the proposed interaction law to identify these factors’ interrelationship. Thirdly, based on the proposed operator with q-ROF information, a MCDM algorithm is developed and illustrated by numerical examples. An analysis of the feasibility, sensitivity, and superiority of the proposed framework is provided to validate our proposed method.},

Various energy reduction schemes (ERSs) have been integrated to achieve a substantial enhancement in energy efficiency. For energy optimization, a set of nonlinear mathematical models for various ERSs are formulated and transformed to optimization problems. Three nature-inspired algorithms, namely GA, DE and PSO, are employed to compute these optimal process parameters and hence evaluate the energy efficiency. The simulated results accentuate that these algorithms efficiently converge approximately at the same values. The results reveal that the hybrid model with maximum efficiency of 8.24 is characterized as the most energy-efficient operating strategy. The amalgamation of flash tanks with the intention of reutilizing the waste steam further enhances the energy efficiency by 4.97\%, thereby proving to be the most prominent operating strategy with the highest efficiency of 8.65.},

Radiologists use automated tools for more precise opinion. Automated detection of the affected lung nodules is complicated because of the shape similarity among healthy and unhealthy tissues. Over the years, several expert systems have been developed that help radiologists to diagnose lung cancer effectively. In this article, we have proposed a framework to precisely detect lungs cancer to classify the benign and malignant nodules. The proposed framework is tested using the subset of the publicly available dataset, i.e., the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection (LIDC-IDRI). We applied filtering and noise removal in the pre-processing phase. Furthermore, the adaptive thresholding technique (OTSU) and the semantic segmentation are used to accurately detect the unhealthy lung nodules. Overall, 13 nodules features have extracted using principal components analysis algorithm. In addition, four optimal features are selected based on the classification performance. In the classification phase, 9 different classifiers are employed for the experimentation. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed system outperformed other techniques and provides 99.23\% accuracy using a logit boost classifier.},

  abstract     = {A recommender system plays a vital role in information filtering and retrieval, and its application is omnipresent in many domains. There are some drawbacks such as the cold-start and the data sparsity problems which affect the performance of the recommender model. Various studies help with drastically improving the performance of recommender systems via unique methods, such as the traditional way of performing matrix factorization (MF) and also applying deep learning (DL) techniques in recent years. By using DL in the recommender system, we can overcome the difficulties of collaborative filtering. DL now focuses mainly on modeling content descriptions, but those models ignore the main factor of user–item interaction. In the proposed hybrid Bayesian stacked auto-denoising encoder (HBSADE) model, it recognizes the latent interests of the user and analyzes contextual reviews that are performed through the MF method. The objective of the model is to identify the user’s point of interest, recommending products/services based on the user’s latent interests. The proposed two-stage novel hybrid deep learning-based collaborative filtering method explores the user’s point of interest, captures the communications between items and users and provides better recommendations in a personalized way. We used a multilayer neural network to manipulate the nonlinearities between the user and item communication from data. Experiments were to prove that our HBSADE outperforms existing methodologies over Amazon-b and Book-Crossing datasets.},

To find the optimal threshold value for a grayscale image, we improved and used a novel meta-heuristic equilibrium algorithm to resolve this scientific problem. Additionally, our improved algorithm has the ability to enhance the accuracy of the segmented image for research analysis with a significant threshold level.

According to the independent results and analysis of each algorithm, our algorithm can outperform all other algorithms in fitness values, peak signal-to-noise ratio metric, structured similarity index metric, maximum absolute error, and signal-to-noise ratio.

  abstract     = {With the development of science and technology and the need for multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), the optimization problem to be solved becomes extremely complex. The theoretically accurate and optimal solutions are often difficult to obtain. Therefore, meta-heuristic algorithms based on multi-point search have received extensive attention. The flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is a new swarm intelligence meta-heuristic algorithm, which can effectively control the balance between global search and local search through a handover probability, and gradually attracts the attention of researchers. However, the algorithm still has problems that are common to optimization algorithms. For example, the global search operation guided by the optimal solution is easy to lead the algorithm into local optimum, and the vector-guided search process is not suitable for solving some problems in discrete space. Moreover, the algorithm does not consider dynamic multi-criteria decision problems well. Aiming at these problems, the design strategy of hybrid flower pollination algorithm for virtual network embedding problem is discussed. Combining the advantages of the genetic algorithm and FPA, the algorithm is optimized for the characteristics of discrete optimization problems. The cross-operation is used to replace the cross-pollination operation to complete the global search and replace the mutation operation with self-pollination operation to enhance the ability of local search. Moreover, a life cycle mechanism is introduced as a complement to the traditional fitness-based selection strategy to avoid premature convergence. A chaos optimization strategy is introduced to replace the random sequence-guided crossover process to strengthen the global search capability and reduce the probability of producing invalid individuals. In addition, a two-layer BP neural network is introduced to replace the traditional objective function to strengthen the dynamic MCDM ability. Simulation results show that the proposed method has good performance in link load balancing, revenue–cost ratio, VN requests acceptance ratio, mapping average quotation, average time delay, average packet loss rate, and the average running time of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning improves the realistic expression of virtual simulations specifically to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems, which are generally rely on high-performance artificial intelligence. This study was inspired by the motivation theory and natural life observations. Recently, motivation-based control has been actively studied for realistic expression, but it presents various problems. For instance, it is hard to define the relation among multiple motivations and to select goals based on multiple motivations. Behaviors should generally be practiced to take into account motivations and goals. This paper proposes a deep Q-network (DQN)-based multi-criteria decision-making framework for virtual agents in real time to automatically select goals based on motivations in virtual simulation environments and to plan relevant behaviors to achieve those goals. All motivations are classified according to the five-level Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and the virtual agents train a double DQN by big social data, select optimal goals depending on motivations, and perform behaviors relying on a predefined hierarchical task networks (HTNs). Compared to the state-of-the-art method, the proposed framework is efficient and reduced the average loss from 0.1239 to 0.0491 and increased accuracy from 63.24 to 80.15\%. For behavioral performance using predefined HTNs, the number of methods has increased from 35 in the Q network to 1511 in the proposed framework, and the computation time of 10,000 behavior plans reduced from 0.118 to 0.1079 s.},

  abstract     = {Crime forecasting has been one of the most complex challenges in law enforcement today, especially when an analysis tends to evaluate inferable and expanded crime rates, although a few methodologies for subsequent equivalents have been embraced before. In this work, we use a strategy for a time series model and machine testing systems for crime estimation. The paper centers on determining the quantity of crimes. Considering various experimental analyses, this investigation additionally features results obtained from a neural system that could be a significant alternative to machine learning and ordinary stochastic techniques. In this paper, we applied various techniques to forecast the number of possible crimes in the next 5 years. First, we used the existing machine learning techniques to predict the number of crimes. Second, we proposed two approaches, a modified autoregressive integrated moving average model and a modified artificial neural network model. The prime objective of this work is to compare the applicability of a univariate time series model against that of a variate time series model for crime forecasting. More than two million datasets are trained and tested. After rigorous experimental results and analysis are generated, the paper concludes that using a variate time series model yields better forecasting results than the predicted values from existing techniques. These results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification is a crucial part in motor imagery brain–computer interface (BCI) system. Traditional supervised learning methods have performed well pleasing in EEG classification. Unfortunately, the unlabeled samples are easier to collect than labeled samples. In addition, recent studies have shown that it may degenerate performance of semi-supervised learning by exploiting unlabeled samples without selection. To address these issues, a novel semi-supervised broad learning system with transfer learning (TSS-BLS) is proposed in this paper. First, the pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples are obtained using the joint distribution adaptation algorithm. TSS-BLS is then constructed by an improved manifold regularization framework containing both labeled and pseudo-label information. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed TSS-BLS is evaluated on three BCI competition datasets and four benchmark datasets from UCI repository and compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms, including ELM, SS-ELM, HELM, SVM, LapSVM, BLS and GSS-BLS. Experimental results show that the performance of TSS-BLS is superior to BLS and GSS-BLS on average. It is thereby shown that TSS-BLS is safe and efficient for EEG classification.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging knowledge graph will benefit question answering tasks, as KG contains well-structured informative data. However, training knowledge graph-based simple question answering systems is known computationally expensive due to the complex predicate extraction and candidate pool generation. Moreover, the existing methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) overestimate the importance of predicate features thus reduce performance. To address these challenges, we propose a time-efficient and resource-effective framework. We use leaky n-gram to balance recall and candidate pool size in candidate pool generation. For predicate extraction, we propose a soft-histogram and self-attention (SHSA) module which serves the role of preserving the global information of questions via feature matrices. And this leads to reduce the RNN module as the simple feedforward network in predicate representation. We also designed a Hamming lower-bound label encoding algorithm to encode the label representations in lower dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the competitive work for end-tasks and achieves better recall with a significantly pruned candidate space.},

The comparison with the well-established architecture ARM Scalable Vector Extension is natural and challenging due to its closedness and mature nature. The results show how it is possible to vectorize posit operations on RISC-V, gaining a substantial speed-up on all the operations involved. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes highlight how the new architecture can catch up, in terms of performance, with the more mature ARM architecture. Towards this end, the present study is important because it anticipates the results that we expect to achieve when we will have an open RISC-V hardware co-processor capable to operate natively with posits.},

We experiment on lines of text from popular handwriting datasets and compare different activation functions for the attention mechanism used for aligning image pixels and target characters. We find that softmax attention focuses heavily on individual characters, while sigmoid attention focuses on multiple characters at each step of the decoding. When the sequence alignment is one-to-one, softmax attention is able to learn a more precise alignment at each step of the decoding, whereas the alignment generated by sigmoid attention is much less precise. When a linear function is used to obtain attention weights, the model predicts a character by looking at the entire sequence of characters and performs poorly because it lacks a precise alignment between the source and target. Future research may explore HTR in natural scene images, since the model is capable of transcribing handwritten text without the need for producing segmentations or bounding boxes of text in images.},

  abstract     = {Software testing process is a crucial part in software development. Generally the errors made by developers get fixed at a later stage of the software development process. This increases the impact of the defect. To prevent this, defects need to be predicted during the initial days of the software development, which in turn helps in efficient utilization of the testing resources. Defect prediction process involves classification of software modules into defect prone and non-defect prone. This paper aims to reduce the impact of two major issues faced during defect prediction, i.e., data imbalance and high dimensionality of the defect datasets. In this research work, various software metrics are evaluated using feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Correlation-based feature selection, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet and Boruta. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Machines and Ensemble Learning are some of the algorithms in machine learning that have been used in combination with the feature extraction and feature selection techniques for classifying the modules in software as defect prone and non-defect prone. The proposed model uses combination of Partial Least Square (PLS) Regression and RFE for dimension reduction which is further combined with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique due to the imbalanced nature of the used datasets. It has been observed that XGBoost and Stacking Ensemble technique gave best results for all the datasets with defect prediction accuracy more than 0.9 as compared to algorithms used in the research work.},

Compared with traditional feature extraction methods, the DSDAE model can be used to implement adaptive feature learning. Then, linear discriminant analysis is adopted to perform linear dimensionality reduction, thereby obtaining the maximum clustering features of the signals. Finally, a fault diagnosis model based on a support vector machine (SVM) with high versatility and accuracy is developed to identify the fault classes of analog circuits. In addition, the salp swarm algorithm, which is capable of convergence and strong global optimization, is employed to intelligently optimize the SVM classifier. The method is comprehensively evaluated with three typical analog circuits from the ISCAS’97 circuit set. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed fault diagnosis method can achieve excellent fault identification accuracy and generalization performance even under noise interference conditions.},

With the implication of digital technologies and Industry 4.0 on supply chain, the supplier selection process has been significantly changed during the recent years. Companies are willing to need new requirements for their own suppliers in accordance with Industry 4.0 implementations and technologies. This paper aims to identify key criteria to Industry 4.0 technologies and evaluate them to select the right suppliers selection in the era of Industry 4.0.

  abstract     = {Grounding natural language in video aims at retrieving a matching moment in a long, untrimmed video described by a referring natural language query. It is a challenging issue due to the dominating influence from noise background in untrimmed video and the complex temporal relationships introduced by the query. Existing methods treat different candidate segments separately in a matching and aligning manner and thus neglect that different target segments require different levels of context information. In this paper, we present the semantic modulation residual module, a novel single-shot feed-forward residual network that explicitly integrates various temporal scale features and introduces less noise to the final moments representation with the guide of query semantic information. To establish more fine-grained interactions between different moments, a global interaction module is embedded in the network. Moreover, the data imbalance issue caused by the sparse annotated moments weakens the effect of binary cross-entropy criterion. Therefore, we design a foreground recalibration mechanism to enhance the intra-class consistency and highlight the positive moments. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets i.e., TACoS, Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions, achieving state-of-the-art performance without any post-processing. In particular, we reach 32.17\%, 45.11\% and 43.76\% under the metric Rank@1, IoU@0.5 on TACoS, Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions, respectively. Furthermore, ablation studies were performed to show the effectiveness of individual components in our proposed method. We hope that the proposed method can serve as a strong and simple alternative for fine-grained video retrieval.},

Liu estimator, which is a statistically biased estimator, is considered in the learning phase of the proposed algorithm with Lasso regression approach. The proposed algorithm is compared with the conventional ELM and its variants including ELM forms based on Liu estimator (Liu-ELM), $$L_{1}$$ -norm (Lasso-ELM), $$L_{2}$$ -norm (Ridge-ELM) and elastic net (Enet-ELM). Convenient selection methods for the determination of tuning parameters for each algorithm have been used in comparisons. The results show that there always exists a d value such that LL-ELM overperforms either Lasso-ELM or Enet-ELM in terms of learning and generalization performance. This improvement in LL-Lasso over Lasso-ELM and Enet-ELM in the sense of testing root mean square error varies up to $$27\%$$ depending on the proposed d selection methods. Consequently, LL-ELM can be considered as a competitive algorithm for both regressional and classification tasks because of easy integrability property.},

  abstract     = {Sign language recognition is considered the most important and challenging application in gesture recognition, involving the fields of pattern recognition, machine learning and computer vision. This is mainly due to the complex visual–gestural nature of sign languages and the availability of few databases and studies related to automatic recognition. This work presents the development and validation of a Brazilian sign language (Libras) public database. The recording protocol describes (1) the chosen signs, (2) the signaller characteristics, (3) the sensors and software used for video acquisition, (4) the recording scenario and (5) the data structure. Provided that these steps are well defined, a database with more than 1000 videos of 20 Libras signs recorded by twelve different people is created using an RGB-D sensor and an RGB camera. Each sign was recorded five times by each signaller. This corresponds to a database with 1200 samples of the following data: (1) RGB video frames, (2) depth, (3) body points and (4) face information. Some approaches using deep learning-based models were applied to classify these signs based on 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks. The best result shows an average accuracy of 93.3\%. This paper presents an important contribution for the research community by providing a publicly available sign language dataset and baseline results for comparison.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the tracking control of the SbW system with unknown nonlinear friction torque and the unmeasured angular velocity. An observer-based adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic system controller is proposed to eliminate the adverse influence of the friction torque on the SbW system. Firstly, the angular velocity of the front wheels is estimated via the observer, such that the system sensitivity to measurement noise, the hardware cost, and the structural complexity are reduced. Then, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) is used to model the friction torque, in which the model and parameters are not effectively identified. IT2 FLS has a more exceptional ability to deal with uncertainties than the traditional type-1 fuzzy logic system (T1 FLS), so the friction modeling based on IT2 FLS has more satisfactory effect in practical application. Finally, an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic system controller is proposed to achieve excellent tracking performance. The tracking error can be guaranteed to converge asymptotically to zero by the Lyapunov stability theory. The numerical simulations and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed friction modeling method and control strategy.},

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the commonest neurodegenerative and dementing disease. The monetary value of caring for Alzheimer’s disease patients is involved to rise dramatically. The necessity of having a computer-aided system for early and accurate AD classification becomes crucial. Deep-learning algorithms have notable advantages rather than machine learning methods. Many recent research studies that have used brain MRI scans and convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved promising results for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Accordingly, this study proposes a CNN based end-to-end framework for AD-classification. The proposed framework achieved 99.6\%, 99.8\%, and 97.8\% classification accuracies on Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset for the binary classification of AD and Cognitively Normal (CN). In multi-classification experiments, the proposed framework achieved 97.5\% classification accuracy on the ADNI dataset.},

The architecture of preprocessing, permutation and diffusion is utilized. The original image is updated for the first time by the preprocessing process to modify statistical distribution of image pixels, which includes random data embedding and alphabetic XOR operation (AXO). Subsequently, the resulting image is converted to a 3D bit matrix, permutation based on 3D Latin cube (P3DL) and diffusion based on 3D Latin cube (D3DL) are successively manipulated on it to obtain the final cipher image, such that each bit element of plain image may move to any position across the bit plane, and the general transformation of matrix dimensions from permutation to diffusion is also unnecessary. Additionally, the adoption of preprocessing operation makes the permutation easy to resist attacks against special images. Moreover, random data used in preprocessing and 3D Latin cubes utilized in P3DL and D3DL are controlled by a 4D memristive hyperchaotic system, its initial values are computed by information entropy of plain image, which makes the chosen-plaintext and known-plaintext attacks invulnerable. Simulation results and performance analyses verify the effectiveness and security of the proposed image encryption scheme.},

  abstract     = {In primates’ cerebral cortex, depth rotation sensitive (DRS) neurons have the property of preferential selectivity for depth rotation motion, whereas such a property is rarely adopted to create computational models for depth rotation motion detection. To fill this gap, a novel feedforward visual neural network is developed to execute depth rotation object detection, based on the recent neurophysiologic achievements on the mammalian vision system. The proposed neural network consists of two parts, i.e., presynaptic and postsynaptic neural networks. The former comprises multiple lateral inhibition neural sub-networks for the capture of visual motion information, and the latter extracts the cues of translational and depth motion and later, synthesizes such clues to perceive the process of depth rotation of an object. Experimentally, the neural network is sufficiently examined by different types of depth rotation under multiple conditions and settings. Numerical experiments show that not only it can effectively detect the spatio-temporal energy change of depth rotation of a moving object, but also its output excitation curve is a quasi-sinusoidal one, which is compatible with the hypothesis suggested by Johansson and Jansson in projective geometry. This research is a critical step toward the construction of artificial vision system for depth rotation object recognition.},

  abstract     = {An increasing number of complex problems have naturally posed significant challenges in decision-making theory and reinforcement learning practices. These problems often involve multiple conflicting reward signals that inherently cause agents’ poor exploration in seeking a specific goal. In extreme cases, the agent gets stuck in a sub-optimal solution and starts behaving harmfully. To overcome such obstacles, we introduce two actor-critic deep reinforcement learning methods, namely Multi-Critic Single Policy (MCSP) and Single Critic Multi-Policy (SCMP), which can adjust agent behaviors to efficiently achieve a designated goal by adopting a weighted-sum scalarization of different objective functions. In particular, MCSP creates a human-centric policy that corresponds to a predefined priority weight of different objectives. Whereas, SCMP is capable of generating a mixed policy based on a set of priority weights, i.e., the generated policy uses the knowledge of different policies (each policy corresponds to a priority weight) to dynamically prioritize objectives in real time. We examine our methods by using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to utilize the multithreading mechanism for dynamically balancing training intensity of different policies into a single network. Finally, simulation results show that MCSP and SCMP significantly outperform A3C with respect to the mean of total rewards in two complex problems: Food Collector and Seaquest.},

The dynamics of the problem is described by designing the key points to update the delivery information; by using an improved genetic algorithm (GA), the problem is solved to realize the goal of minimizing the total cost of three participants (i.e. drivers, passengers and courier companies) and the time penalty costs.

The time series of the CH4 concentration was decomposed using a discrete wavelet transform into five components—one approximating and four detailing components. These five components, together with synchronized series of meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, and pressure), were used to train ten ANNs—five autoregressive networks with exogenous input (NARX) and five recurrent neural networks (Elman). The forecast was calculated as the sum of the forecasts for each of the five components. The forecast accuracy was assessed using several indices and a Taylor chart. The hybrid approach improved the accuracy of the forecasts by more than 20\%. The hybrid model based on the NARX shown the best accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Tooth segmentation, as one of the key techniques of medical image segmentation, can be widely applied to various medical applications, e.g., orthodontic treatment, corpse identification, dental training systems, dental disease diagnosis, etc. Although there have been many studies on tooth segmentation, few tooth segmentation studies have focused on enhancing tooth segmentation with fuzzy root boundaries which is a difficult but essential task in dentistry to determine the root resorption and the tooth brace. The existing methods for tooth segmentation usually exploited the contrast enhancement to sharpen the boundaries of teeth, while the final segmentation results heavily depended on the subsequent processing steps of the method. To address the issue of fuzzy boundaries, this paper proposes a novel multi-scale location perception network to segment teeth from panoramic X-ray images. The core of the proposed method stems from three aspects: (1) multi-scale structural similarity loss conducts accurate prediction with clear boundary from patch-level scale; (2) location perception module locates each tooth pixel in the image from the perspective of global-level scale; (3) aggregation module reduces the semantic gap between multi-scale feature branches. Our proposed method was tested on a dataset containing 1500 dental panoramic X-ray images and the Dice score of our method is 93.01\%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, our proposed method has better boundary quality and the Pratt (1978)’s figure of merit used for boundary quality evaluation reaches 76.56\%.},

  abstract     = {Modern deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art results for many tasks in computer vision, such as image classification and segmentation. However, its adoption into high-risk applications, e.g. automated medical diagnosis systems, happens at a slow pace. One of the main reasons for this is that regular neural networks do not capture uncertainty. To assess uncertainty in classification, several techniques have been proposed casting neural network approaches in a Bayesian setting. Amongst these techniques, Monte Carlo dropout is by far the most popular. This particular technique estimates the moments of the output distribution through sampling with different dropout masks. The output uncertainty of a neural network is then approximated as the sample variance. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of such a variance-based uncertainty metric and propose an novel approach. Our approach is based on the overlap between output distributions of different classes. We show that our technique leads to a better approximation of the inter-class output confusion. We illustrate the advantages of our method using benchmark datasets. In addition, we apply our metric to skin lesion classification—a real-world use case—and show that this yields promising results.},

In cases of significant plant-model mismatch, non-desirable responses may be observed in the controlled outputs. This paper proposes a parameter adaptation technique for tackling this problem. In the proposed approach, the output disturbance is selected as the adaptation parameter while the adaptation law is modelled as a function of the tracking error using a first-order difference equation. The adaptation law is integrated into a $$\mathrm{NMPC}$$ algorithm to achieve offset-free tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated on two simulation case studies—a pH system and a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR); and an experimental cascaded two tank process. The simulation results obtained showed that the proposed scheme achieves zero offset in the face of significant plant-model mismatch arising from uncertainties in model parameters, unmeasured disturbances, and measurement noise and compared favourably with existing methods. The experimental results obtained during real-time implementation of the proposed control scheme corroborate this assertion and show its industrial applicability.},

Cyber-physical system applications have a significant impact on different industrial sectors. The number and variety of cyber-attacks are growing, aimed not only at obtaining data from cyber-physical systems but also managing the production process itself. Detecting and preventing attacks on cyber-physical systems is critical because they can lead to financial losses, production interruptions, and therefore endanger national security. This paper proposes a deep hybrid model based on three parallel neural architectures: a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, a gated recurrent unit neural network, and a long short-term memory neural network. The SPOCU activation function is considered in hidden layers of the proposed model and improves its performance. Furthermore, to improve the classification accuracy, a modified version of Adam optimizer is considered. The experiments are conducted on two datasets: raw water treatment plant and gasoil heater loop process as the cyber-physical system applications. They contain information about the normal behavior of these systems and their failures caused by cyber-attacks. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the recent works using machine learning techniques.},

A robust multilayered convolutional neural network (MLCNN)-based auto-CODEC for audio signal denoising which is utilizing the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) has been proposed in this research. The MLCNN takes the input as MFCC with different frames from the noise-contaminated audio signal for training and testing. The proposed MLCNN model has been trained and tested as 80:20 ratios for the available MIT database. After the training, the proposed method has been validated. From the validation, it has been found that the proposed MLCNN model provides an accuracy of 93.25\%. The performance of MLCNN has been evaluated and compared with the reported methods using short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and cosine similarities. From the performance comparisons, it has been found that the proposed MLCNN model outperforms other models. From the cosine similarity, it has been proved that MLCNN provides high security level which can be used for many secure applications.},

  abstract     = {The traditional failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) aims to define the risk priority number of each failure mode by multiplying occurrence, severity and detection parameters of each failure mode. Many studies in the literature commented the traditional FMEA due to its limitations such as equal importance degrees, discrete ordinal scales and multiplication of O, S and D criteria. This study suggests coping with these drawbacks a new method, which combines the quality function deployment (QFD) method under interval type-2 fuzzy set, Bayesian network and VIKOR method. The previous studies generally handle to rank the failure modes as only goal. This paper investigates concurrently the failure modes and the reasons of failure modes. QFD method provides us this benefit by employing customer requirements (CRs) and design requirements (DRs). CRs are the reasons of failure modes while DRs are failure modes. This study presents a new perspective to examine the correlations of CRs and DRs as linguistic terms by using Bayesian network. The VIKOR method deals with ranking the failure modes by aggregating the weights of O, S and D criteria. The developed method is utilized for risk evaluation of tile and marble works in building construction. The result shows that the most significant design requirement or failure mode is DR14 (unsuitable plug-socket utilization).},

It can effectively identify clusters in data sets with different densities and can also handle outliers. We first compute relative density for each data point. Then, the density peak points are screened and the initial clusters are obtained according to these peak points. The strategy for assigning the remaining points is to find unallocated points from the perspective of the cluster, which can effectively identify different density. In experiments, we compare the proposed algorithm IDDC with some existing algorithms on synthetic and real-world data sets.

  abstract     = {Quality-relevant fault detection aims to reveal whether quality variables are affected when a fault is detected. For current industrial processes, kernel-based methods focus on the nonlinearity within process variables, which is insufficient for obtaining nonlinearities of quality variables. Alternatively, neural network is an option for nonlinear prediction. However, these models are driven by predictive errors on samples. For quality-relevant tasks, the key is to capture the trends of quality variables. Therefore, this study proposes a new model, namely, maximizing correlation neural network (MCNN), to predict the quality-relevant information intuitively. The MCNN is trained to maximize the linear correlation between quality variables and the combinations of nonlinear representations mapped by a multilayer feedforward network. As such, fault detection can be implemented in the quality-relevant and irrelevant subspaces on the basis of the deep most correlated representations of process variables. Considering that different variables have different sensitivities to quality at various locations due to their nonlinear relationship, fault backpropagation is designed in the MCNN to isolate the faulty variables on the basis of real-time faulty information. Finally, numerical example and Tennessee Eastman process are used to evaluate the proposed method, which exhibits a competitive performance.},

So, a composition of MWCNT and TiO2 nanoparticles with the composition ratio of 2/3 is added to the mentioned oil derivative. Interestingly, a 15\% reduction in the viscosity in comparison with the pure oil is observed at a temperature of 45 °C and a concentration of 0.05\%. The more viscosity reduction will result in a more significant oil recovery. Hence, satisfactory results of viscosity behavior at 45 °C could keep the scientific groups hopeful to have more viscosity reduction at higher temperatures and especially at oil well temperature. The selected solid volume fraction of 0.05\%, as the lowest studied amount, makes the proposed composition more economic and reasonable.

  abstract     = {Due to the pervasiveness of geomagnetic fields and independence from external infrastructure, localization with smartphone-based magnetic has attracted considerable attention. However, existing approaches are still facing the problem of localization accuracy because of their low discernibility in geomagnetic features. Due to the need to traverse the magnetic database, these approaches cannot obtain localization results in real-time, especially in large indoor localization areas. To address these problems, a novel magnetic indoor localization approach based on long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) is proposed. The magnetic indoor localization is first formulated as a recursive function approximation problem. Based on the analysis of magnetic characteristics, a double sliding window-based dimension expansion approach is designed to generate a time-series magnetic feature dataset. The LSTMs are invoked for magnetic localization on this dataset by taking advantage of its benefits in time-series prediction and characterization. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we implement the proposed LSTMs-based magnetic localization approach on a real Android-based smartphone and compare it with fingerprint-based localization algorithms. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the accuracy, response time, and robustness of the proposed algorithm in indoor localization.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation is a crucial stage in digital image processing used to obtain a more straightforward representation of images. Although classic bi-level segmentation is a relatively simple task, it only suffices to analyze rather simple images. More complex real-life scenarios such as medical imaging processing usually require multi-level segmentation to differentiate between the many regions of interest present in the original images. Traditional histogram-based approaches for multi-level segmentation tend to perform suboptimally, with the best performing being computationally expensive. This difficult compromise between performance and computational cost has led to the proposal of new approaches mixing a variety of optimization algorithms and statistical criteria. Despite the success of these new approaches, there is still room for improvement. It is under these circumstances that evolutionary algorithms like the cluster chaotic optimization (CCO) become relevant. The CCO takes advantage of the classification procedures of clustering techniques and the randomness of chaotic sequences for encouraging the search strategy. This paper proposes a novel method based on the CCO algorithm named minimum cross-entropy multi-level segmentation CCO (CEMS-CCO). The CEMS-CCO employs the cross-entropy as its fitness function and the CCO capabilities to deal with multimodal functions to search for the optimal solution to the multi-level segmentation problem. The CEMS-CCO shows competitive results for medical images multi-level segmentation regarding different quality metrics. Furthermore, its robustness and effectiveness are tested through the analysis of well-known benchmark images. Statistical analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed CEMS-CCO technique outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Thus, capturing the semantic content of an image relies only on the human interpretation. In this paper, a novel edge detection algorithm is proposed. Compared to usual edge detectors based on derivative filters, the idea behind the proposed algorithm is to extract edges by exploiting only information present in the image itself without need of any extra information. The used detection process is composed of two main phases, smoothing the image and extracting edges. Besides the simplicity of its implementation, the detection algorithm CMAX is doted to more flexibility enabling us to decide on the degree of details embedded in each region of the image independently. Also, as a complementary phase, the quality of detection can be improved by using an optimization approach based on the nature-inspired algorithm smell bees optimization. The quantitative evaluation results of CMAX before and after enhancement and their comparison with others well-known detectors are done by using the benchmark of Berkeley images.},

  abstract     = {Providing of energy is one of the most important issues for each country. Also, environmental issues due to fossil fuel depletion are other serious concern of them. In this regard, moving toward energy sustainability is a constructive solution for each country. This paper studies the short-term planning of generating units in renewable energy-based distribution networks equipped with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). PEVs can cause problems for distributed energy sources in the electrical grid, as well as power units inside the grid. So, to overcome this problem, an efficient stochastic programming technique is designed to allow the control entity to control the charging behavior of PEVs for managing power units. In this paper, to obtain the least total cost, a new method is suggested to decrease the reliability expenses. In other words, the vehicle-2-grid (V2G) is applied to decrease the operating. On the other hand, a novel stochastic flow using the unscented transform is suggested to improve the model of the severe uncertainty due to the wind power, photovoltaic (PV) and charging/discharging power of PEVs. In this research work, a novel and efficient optimization algorithm called ‘θ-modified krill herd (θ-MKH)” is used as an applicable technique to optimize the microgrid (MG) operation. This algorithm is useful and has many advantages like the runaway from the local optima with fast converging in comparison with other methods. Also, the satisfactory efficiency of the suggested randomized manner is validated on an MG connected to the main grid.},

Its performance is evaluated through comparison to the methodologies PESQ, ViSQOL and P.563. The experiments were conducted in publicly available databases and in another database that was built to evaluate our model in the context of background noise. The results are analyzed by means of correlation measures and statistical descriptions. Through four experiments, we have concluded that: (1) our model achieved high overall generalization, even when it was trained with a limited quantity of samples; (2) it also characterized speech and background sound even for databases where complex degradation is present; and (3) the proposed model tends to assign high scores to clean speech and low scores to samples with just noise, right as expected.},

  abstract     = {The semi-supervised support vector machine (S3VM) for classification is introduced for dealing with quantities of unlabeled data in the real world. Labeled data are utilized to train the algorithm and then were adapted to classify the unlabeled data. However, this algorithm has several drawbacks, such as the non-smooth term of semi-supervised objective function negatively affects the classification precision. Moreover, it is required to endure heavy burden in solving two quadratic programming problems with inversion matrix operation. To cope with this problem, this article puts forward a novel class of Bézier smooth semi-supervised support vector machines (BS4VMs), based on the approximation property of Bézier function to the non-smooth term. Because of this approximation, a fast quasi-Newton method for solving BS4VMs can be used to decrease the calculating time scale. This new kind of algorithm enhances the generalization and robustness of S3VM for nonlinear case as well. Further, to show how the BS4VMs can be practically implemented, experiments on synthetic, UCI dataset, USPS dataset, and large-scale NDC database are offered. The theoretical analysis and experiments comparisons clearly confirm the superiority of BS4VMs in both classification accuracy and calculating time.},

Firstly, we construct a ranking function template by DNN structure. And then the coefficients of the template can be learned by the train-set we construct to get a candidate ranking function, which is transcendental and non-polynomial because of the existence of sigmoid activation function in the neural network. Finally, the candidate ranking function will be verified to show if it is a real ranking function. Most of the existing methods focus on linear or polynomial ranking functions, and are limited to verification tools, while in this paper we make progress regarding the synthesis of non-polynomial ranking functions and new verification method for candidate ranking functions. The experimental results show us that for some of loops from other work, we can find their ranking functions efficiently. Moreover, for some loops having multi-phase ranking functions obtained by existing methods, our method can directly detect their global ranking functions. Especially, our method can also detect the global ranking functions for some loops with transcendental terms, which cannot be dealt with by existing methods.},

The objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of mobile robots is jointly incorporated with the operational criterions when implementing part feeding tasks. Due to the NP-hardness nature of the proposed greening problem, a multi-objective disturbance and repair strategy enhanced cohort intelligence (MDRCI) algorithm is established to deal with the multi-objective problem. Computational results indicate that the enhanced strategies are of great significance to the MDRCI algorithm and it outperforms the other benchmark algorithms on both global search capability and search depth. In addition, the energy-saving strategy and disturbance and repair strategy are validated by comparison experiments. Furthermore, managerial insights are illustrated to make trade-offs between the total line-side inventory level and the energy consumption, jointly making it helpful in the greening scheduling process of the practical production. The achievements acquired in this paper may be inspiring for further researches on the energy-related production scheduling problem.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous passenger counting in public transportation represents an integral part of an intelligent transportation system, as it provides vital information to improve the efficiency and resource management of a public transportation network. However, counting passengers in highly crowded scenes is a challenging task due to their random movement, diverse appearance settings and inter-object occlusions. Furthermore, state-of-the-art methods in this domain rely heavily on additional custom cameras or sensors instead of existing onboard surveillance cameras, which consequently limits the feasibility of such systems for large-scale deployment. Hence, this paper puts forward an enhanced appearance descriptor with lateral movement compensation, which addresses the difficulty in counting passengers bidirectionally in cluttered scenes. We first construct a head re-identification dataset, which is used to train an appearance descriptor. This dataset addresses the absence of a person re-identification dataset, which in turn allows for accurate tracking of passengers in cluttered scenes. Then, a novel technique of applying a fedora counting line is introduced to count the number of passengers entering and exiting a bus. This technique compensates the impact of passengers’ lateral movement, which crucially increases the accuracy of bidirectional passenger counting using onboard bus surveillance cameras. In addition, a real-time implementation of the proposed method, which includes the integration of DeepStream and fedora counting line, is also presented. Experimental results on a challenging test dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmarked techniques with an average counting accuracy of 93.21\% for entering and 96.10\% for exiting public buses. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves this accuracy at an average frame rate of 16 frames per second, which represents a practical solution to a real-time application.},

Although radar signal processing has been revolutionized since the introduction of deep learning, applying deep learning in RTD is considered as a novel concept. In this paper, we propose a model for multitask target detection based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which works directly with radar echo data and eliminates the need for time-consuming radar signal processing. The proposed detection method exploits time and frequency information simultaneously; therefore, the target can be detected and located in multi-dimensional space of range, velocity, azimuth and elevation. Due to the lack of labeled radar complex data, we construct a radar echo dataset with multiple signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for RTD. Then, the CNN-based model is evaluated on the dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the CNN-based detector has better detection performance and measuring accuracy in range, velocity, azimuth and elevation and more robust to noise in comparison with traditional radar signal processing approaches and other state-of-the-art methods.},

Nevertheless, the resulted minimized set of features should maintain or even improve the performance of the classification models. Throughout this article, an innovative feature selection algorithm is proposed and is called “the Highest Wins” (HW). To evaluate the generalization ability of HW, it has been applied for creating classification models using naïve Bayes technique from 10 benchmark datasets. The obtained results were compared against two well-known strategies, namely chi-square and information gain. The experimental results confirmed the competitiveness ability of the suggested strategy in terms of various evaluation measurements such as recall, precision, and error rate while significantly decreasing the number of selected features in datasets. Further, the HW is used for building a naïve Bayes and decision tree intrusion detection classifiers using the well-known dataset from Network Security Laboratory-Knowledge Discovery in Databases (NSL-KDD). The results were promising not just in terms of overall performance, but also in terms of the time needed to build the classification model.},

However, the large number of mobile apps makes it difficult for users to determine which ones are of interest. Current app recommendation methods focus on the similarities between user interest and mobile app functionality at a single moment, but they do not consider how these change over time and do not address the underlying mutual effect of such changes. This paper describes a bidirectional sensing method for user interest and app changes that enables precise mobile app recommendations. The proposed method applies continuous bidirectional sensing to both user interest and the functional changes to apps and obtains the evolution trajectory of both. Then, a personal interest evolution network is used to learn the relationship between the two trajectories. Finally, user interest in an app is predicted, and the top-N strategy is used to recommend suitable apps. Experiments on real data sets show that our method can accurately sense user interests and functional changes to apps, and that recommendations based on the personal interest evolution network correspond to actual recommendation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The modelling and prediction of extreme temperature changes in enclosed compartments is a domain with applications ranging from residential fire alarms, industrial temperature sensors to search and rescue personnel safety systems. The spread of fire in enclosed compartments is a highly uncertain and nonlinear process. Hence, in safety-critical cases, any false negatives pose a serious threat to the safety of individuals such as firefighters that are engaged in rescue activities. This work aims to model the nonlinear fire spread behaviour as a temporal, deep learning-based regressive methodology. The objective is to efficiently identify abrupt and extreme temperature changes that often result in increases of 300+ °C. A major challenge in such time-series models is that of learning from historic time-series samples which are known to suffer from high noise levels, outliers and data imbalance. This work contributes on the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) methodology to handle temperature data originating from body-mounted and fixed sensors and develop a temperature increase warning mechanism. The main contribution exploits the contextualisation ability of CNN-LSTM to predict temperature changes in windows of 5–120 s. The model identifies the spatial temperature change patterns via a CNN encoder, which are then fed into an LSTM network. This regression mechanism is trained and validated against a set of unique fire spread conditions and involved live tests ranging from containers to residential and industrial units. The model’s performance was evaluated with MAPE sensitivity analysis against data originating from body-mounted sensors and third-party NIST datasets. The outcome showed an error ranging from 0.89 to 2.05\% to 5.46\% and 6.23\%, respectively. The model efficacy was also evaluated against a range of input–output temperature ranges from 5, 30 to 120-s windows and showed a FN rate of 2.15\% for pre-alarm-to-normal and 3.11\% for alarm-to-pre-alarm cases in body-mounted sensors and a higher FN rate of 5.14\% reported for pre-alarm-to-normal case for the raised platfor sensor tests.},

  abstract     = {The use of games in daily life, especially in education, has been in an incline during the COVID-2019 pandemic. Thus, game-based learning environments have caused an increase in the need of game contents, but generation of the game contents and levels is a time-consuming and costly process. Generated game contents and levels should be balanced, dense, aesthetic and reachable. Also, the time as well as the costs spent should be decreased. In order to overcome this problem, automatic and intelligent game content and level generation methods have emerged, and procedural content generation (PCG) is the most popular one of these methods. Artificial intelligence techniques are used for procedural game level generation instead of traditional methods. In this study, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-genetic algorithm (FAHP-GA) methods were used to generate procedural game levels. This proposed hybrid system was used in a developed educational game as a case study to create game levels. The performance of the proposed study was compared to the other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, and also further statistical analyses were investigated. The results showed that the BiLSTM-based FAHP-GA method can be used for procedural game level generation effectively.},

Previously, a lot of works have been proposed to solve the knowledge graph completion problem, for example, a series of Trans model, semantic matching models, convolutional neural networks based methods and so on. However, a series of Trans models and semantic matching models only focused on the shadow information of the knowledge graph, thus failed to capture the implicit fine-grained feature in the triple of knowledge graphs; convolutional neural networks based methods learned more expressive feature for knowledge graph completion, and it also ignored the directional relation characteristic and implicit fine-grained feature in the triple. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph completion model named directional multi-dimensional attention convolution model that explores directional information and an inherent deep expressive characteristic of the triple. At last, we evaluate our directional multi-dimensional attention convolution model based on three standard evaluation criteria in two robust datasets, and the experiment shows that our model achieves state-of-the-art MeanRank.},

However, the number of samples of speech-based PD is relatively small, and there exist discrepancies in the distribution between subjects. In order to solve the two problems, a novel unsupervised two-step sparse transfer learning is proposed in this paper to tackle with PD speech diagnosis. In the first step, convolution sparse coding with the coordinate selection of samples and features is designed to learn speech structure from the source domain to replenish sample information of the target domain. In the second step, joint local structure distribution alignment is designed to maintain the neighbor relationship between the respective samples of the training set and test set, and reduce the distribution difference between the two domains at the same time. Two representative public PD speech datasets and one real-world PD speech dataset were exploited to verify the proposed method on PD speech diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that each step of the proposed method has a positive effect on the PD speech classification results, and it also delivers superior performance over the existing relative methods.},

Despite the success, deep reinforcement learning algorithms’ performance is largely dependent on the approach of exploration. Some of them engage in exploratory behavior by injecting external noise into the action space or adopting a gaussian policy. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning algorithm without external noise called self-guided deep deterministic policy gradient with multi-actor (SDDPGM), which is the combination of deep deterministic policy gradient and generative adversarial networks (GANs). It employs the generator of GANs which trained from excellent experiences to guide the learning of the agent and makes discriminator constitute a subjective reward. Moreover, to make the learning more stable, SDDPGM applies a multi-actor mechanism that stands as a serially distinct actor based on the temporal phase of an episode. Finally, experiments show that SDDPGM is a promising deep reinforcement learning method.},

  abstract     = {The versatility of the existing A-optimal-based CNN for solving multiple types of signals classification problems has not been verified by different signals datasets. Moreover, the existing A-optimal-based CNN uses a simplified approximate function as the optimization objective function instead of precise analytical function, which affects the signals classification accuracy to a certain extent. In this paper, a classification method called IA-optimal CNN is proposed. To improve the stability of the classifier, the trace of the covariance matrix of the weights of the fully connected layer is used as the optimization objective function, and the parameter optimization model is established without any simplification of the optimization objective function. In addition, to avoid the difficulty of not being able to obtain the analytical expression formula of the partial derivative of the inverse matrix with regard to the networks parameters, a novel dual function is introduced to transform the optimization problem into an equivalent binary function optimization problem. Furthermore, based on the above analytical solution results, the parameters are updated using the alternate iterative optimization method and the accurate weight update formula is deduced in detail. Five signals datasets are used to test the universality of the IA-optimal CNN in signals classification fields. The performance of IA-optimal CNN is showed, and the experimental results are compared with the existing A-optimal-based classification algorithm. Lastly, the following conclusion is proved theoretically: For the A-optimal-based CNN, the trace of the covariance matrix will continue to decrease and approach a convergence value in the iterative process, but it is impossible for the networks to strictly reach the A-optimal state.},

  abstract     = {Automatic detection of road safety attributes is an important step in designing a reliable road safety system. Due to the outstanding performance over the handcraft feature extraction-based methods for detecting objects, deep learning can be used to develop a robust road safety system. However, there are many challenges in using deep learning models. Firstly, they require a large dataset for training. Secondly, a class imbalance is a common problem in deep learning models. Finally, when a new attribute is introduced to a deep learning model, the whole model must be re-trained using all training samples which requires a lot of time. In order to solve some of these problems, we propose a novel single class detection-based deep learning approach for the identification of safety attributes in roadside video data. The approach is based on fusion of multiple fully convolutional network (FCN) models. Each model is trained to detect a single attribute/class using two classes (single attribute vs all other attributes) datasets. The proposed approach was evaluated on data provided by the Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR). The proposed approach achieved high accuracy and a new attribute can be added to the system without retraining the whole system.},

Therefore, a robust maximum power point tracking (MPPT) approach is highly required to ensure the operation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) at the maximum power point. A new hybrid perturb &amp; observe and type-2 fuzzy-based adaptive step size MPPT for PEMFC system is proposed to enhance the dynamic response and eliminates the oscillations around maximum power point at steady state. The type-2 fuzzy approach has been used to scale the variable step size of conventional perturb &amp; observe algorithm to extract the maximum available power of the PEMFC system. The proposed hybrid controller has been tested and validated using MATLAB software via modeling of the fuel cell power system composed of 7 kW PEMFC powering a resistive load through a DC-DC boost converter. Comparative simulation results prove that our proposed hybrid P&amp;O type-2 fuzzy-based MPPT reduces the response time between 14.62 and 84.72\% compared to the P&amp;O type-1 fuzzy-based MPPT. The response time is also reduced between 43.99 and 88.04\% compared to the conventional P&amp;O fixed step size MPPT.

  abstract     = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performances on various applications. However, RNNs are prone to be memory-bandwidth limited in practical applications and need both long periods of training and inference time. The aforementioned problems are at odds with training and deploying RNNs on resource-limited devices where the memory and floating-point operations (FLOPs) budget are strictly constrained. To address this problem, conventional model compression techniques usually focus on reducing inference costs, operating on a costly pre-trained model. Recently, dynamic sparse training has been proposed to accelerate the training process by directly training sparse neural networks from scratch. However, previous sparse training techniques are mainly designed for convolutional neural networks and multi-layer perceptron. In this paper, we introduce a method to train intrinsically sparse RNN models with a fixed number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs) during training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse performance with long short-term memory and recurrent highway networks on widely used tasks, language modeling, and text classification.

  abstract     = {Outlier detection in the stream data has emerged as the challenging problems with the precipitously growing demand of applications like intrusion detection, sensor malfunctioning, fraud detection, and system failures, etc. To address these problems many density-based algorithms have been proposed for detecting the outliers in stream data. Still, it suffers a serious problem with the degree of outlierness measures on its neighbors. Using a right number k is not straightforward in the stream data since we do not know prior distribution of neighbor’s points. And, it must improvise with incoming data as appeared in the stream data. Additionally, stream-based algorithms are not able to detect sequential outliers as well as are having memory constraints. These challenges motivate the authors to propose “Self-Adaptive Density Summarizing incremental Natural Outlier Detection in Data Stream (ADINOF) with skipping scheme and without skipping scheme (ADINOF_NS)” that successfully overcome the challenges. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ADINOF and ADINOF_NS significantly outperforms the competitive executed algorithms (iLOF, MiLOF, TADILOF, DILOF, and DILOF_NS).},

Pan-sharpening in the fusion of remote sensing images aims to generate high-resolution MS images by integrating the spatial information of PAN images and the spectral characteristics of MS images. In this study, a novel deep perceptual patch generative adversarial network (FDPPGAN) was proposed to solve the pan-sharpening problem. First, a perception generator was constructed, it included, a matching module, which can process as input images of different resolutions, a fusion module, a reconstruction module based on the residual structure, and a module for the extracting perceptual features. Second, patch discriminator was utilized to convert the dichotomy of the sample into that multiple partial images of the same size to ensure that the generated results can retain more detailed features. Finally, the loss function of FDPPGAN comprised perceptual feature loss, content loss, generator loss, and discriminator loss.

  abstract     = {Modeling and optimization for compliant mechanisms are challenging tasks thanks to an unclear kinematic merging among rigid and flexible links. Hence, this paper develops a computational intelligence-based method for modeling and optimization. The proposed method concerns about statistics, numerical simulation, computational intelligence, and metaheuristics. A two degrees of freedom compliant mechanism is investigated to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested computational intelligence method. First, numerical datasets are collected by simulations. Then, sensitivity of design parameters is analyzed by analysis of variance and Taguchi technique. The results of sensitivity are employed to separate a few populations for lightning attachment procedure optimization (LAPO). Next, the values of two output performances of the mechanism are changed into the values in the range from zero to one through desirability function method. The calculated output values become two inputs of the fuzzy logic model, and the output of this system is a single objective function (SOF). Subsequently, the SOF is modeled by using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). LAPO algorithm is then utilized to maximize the SOF. The results revealed that the numerical example 3 is the best design for the mechanism. In comparison with artificial intelligence techniques and regression, the results show that the performance indexes of the proposed ANFIS model (R2 close 1, MSE about 10–4, and RMSE about 10–2) are superior to those of the multilayer perceptron, deep neural network, and multiple-linear regression. Additionally, the proposed computational intelligence method is more effective than the Taguchi-fuzzy logic, ANFIS-integrated teaching learning-based optimization, and ANFIS-integrated Jaya in searching the optimal design of the compliant mechanism. The results determined that the optimal displacement and parasitic error are about 2.2109 mm and 0.0028 mm, respectively.},

With the estimation results produced by RTNE, a neural adaptive event-triggered control is advanced by incorporating a relative threshold-based sampler into controller-to-actuator channel, such that unnecessary continuous sampling incurring in current time-driven researches can be successfully avoided. Moreover, an appointed-time prescribed performance control is constructed to make the responses of velocity and altitude subsystems evolve within pregiven regions with a user-defined settling time; meanwhile, the strict dependence on the exact knowledge for immeasurable initial system states is removed. The stability of system is proved by virtue of input-to-state stable method, and Zeno behavior is eliminated. Simulations are performed to certify the effectiveness of presented controller.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is a well-known evolutionary algorithm with simple operation and excellent performance, which has been applied to solve various optimization problems. To alleviate the problem of premature convergence or population stagnation faced by DE algorithm, this paper proposes an adaptive regeneration framework based on search space adjustment (ARSA), which can be easily embedded into various DE variants. When one individual cannot get improved for several generations, the ARSA framework will be triggered to randomly generate a substitute individual from a dynamic search space which is determined by a given adjustment mechanism controlled by two different levels of parameters. The trigger condition for each individual is adaptively controlled by its status in the current population. The space adjustment mechanism contains two strategies, one focuses on global exploration while the other on local exploitation. Moreover, the ARSA framework does not add any parameters that need to be pre-set, and all the included parameters are adaptive. To verify the availability of ARSA framework for solving complex optimization problems, thirty functions with different dimensions from IEEE CEC 2017 test platform and three real-life problems are employed for comparative experiments. The experimental results indicate that our ARSA framework notably improves the performance of two basic DE algorithms and six state-of-the-art DE variants.},

Similarity measure is one of the core tools for the application of interval and general type-2 fuzzy set. However, there are many similarities exist for interval type-2 fuzzy set, but very few for general type-2 fuzzy set, and the existing similarity measures have some limitations due to their dependence on certain representation, such as one of $$\alpha$$ -plane, zSlices and vertical slice. To solve this problem, in this paper, Dice similarity and Cosine similarity for interval and general type-2 fuzzy set are proposed. The proposed similarity measures for general type-2 fuzzy set are defined on the basis of vector similarity; therefore, they do not depend on certain representation. Furthermore, weighted Dice and Cosine similarity measures are proposed for dealing with special situations in this work. Several properties and a discussion are exposed for proving the presented similarities are indeed similarity measures and can obtain reasonable similarity results. Ultimately, based on presented similarity measures, a multi-criteria decision-making method in the case that criteria weights are completely unknown is proposed. Several examples are employed for illustrating the rationality and superiority of presented similarity measures and MCDM method.},

The proposed AutoFM can extract non-trivial and local structures characteristics from user–user/item–item co-occurrence pairs by integrating a low-complexity probabilistic auto-encoder. Furthermore, it supports both explicit and implicit feedback datasets. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The vendor managed inventory contract has motivated companies to cope with the bullwhip effect and its associated shortages. However, getting precise information on manufacturing/remanufacturing time is a challenge owing to human learning. Accordingly, this paper tries to incorporate the learning effect on the inventory control problem. This is a bridge to fill the gaps in the literature by considering how the learning process affects the production time and system costs in a CLSC problem. Moreover, the mean-standard deviation utility function is used in order to take the random defective rate into account, to minimize mean system costs with respect to the standard deviation. Due to the complexity of the proposed mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, three metaheuristic algorithms named, genetic algorithm, invasive weed optimization algorithm, and moth flame optimization algorithm are used to solve the problem, and Fibonacci algorithm will examine the validity of the applied methods. Two sets of numerical examples in small, medium, and large sizes are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithms in terms of objective function values and required CPU-time. Afterward, a statistical analysis is utilized in order to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

  abstract     = {Deep learning provides a variety of neural network-based models, known as deep neural networks (DNNs), which are being successfully used in several domains to build highly accurate predictors. A key factor which usually makes DNNs to outperform traditional machine learning models is the amount of data that is nowadays accessible and available. Nevertheless, there are other factors linked to DNNs topologies that may also have influence on the predictive performance of DNN models. In particular, fully connected deep neural networks (fc-DNNs) typically struggle in achieving good performance rates when applied to small datasets. This is due to the high number of parameters which need to be learned when training this kind of models, which makes them prone to over-fitting issues. In this paper, authors propose the use of problem-specific information in order to impose constraints to network architecture so that a fc-DNN is transformed into a partially connected DNN (pc-DNN), in such a way that network topology is driven by prior knowledge. This work compares two baseline models, the elastic net and fc-DNNs, to pc-DNNs applied on three synthetic datasets with different number of samples. Synthetic data was generated to estimate the goodness of using problem-specific information to drive network architectures. Furthermore, a similar analysis is performed herein on a real-world problem dataset to show the benefits of pc-DNN models in term of predictive performance. The results of the analysis showed that pc-DNNs with built-in problem-specific information clearly outperformed the elastic net and fc-DNNs in most of the datasets used, in either synthetic or real-world problems. The pc-DNNs turned out to be a useful model, especially when it is applied to small- or medium-size datasets, on which it significantly outperformed the baseline models considered in this study. Specifically, the pc-DNNs achieved AUC and MSE improvement rates of ( $$8.21\%$$ , $$19.79\%$$ ) and ( $$6.65\%$$ , $$20.54\%$$ ) in small- and medium-size datasets for both case studies analyzed, the synthetic and real-world problem, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) using deep Q-networks (DQNs) has shown performance beyond the human level in a number of complex problems. In addition, many studies have focused on bio-inspired hardware-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) given the capabilities of these technologies to realize both parallel operation and low power consumption. Here, we propose an on-chip training method for DQNs applicable to hardware-based SNNs. Because the conventional backpropagation (BP) algorithm is approximated, a performance evaluation based on two simple games shows that the proposed system achieves performance similar to that of a software-based system. The proposed training method can minimize memory usage and reduce power consumption and area occupation levels. In particular, for simple problems, the memory dependency can be significantly reduced given that high performance is achieved without using replay memory. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of the nonlinearity characteristics and two types of variation of non-ideal synaptic devices on the performance outcomes. In this work, thin-film transistor (TFT)-type flash memory cells are used as synaptic devices. A simulation is also conducted using fully connected neural network with non-leaky integrated-and-fire (I&amp;F) neurons.

  abstract     = {Video-based human action recognition remains a challenging task. There are three main limitations: (1) Most works are only restricted to single temporal scale modeling. (2) Although a few methods consider multilevel motion features, they disregard the fact that different features usually contribute differently. (3) Most attention mechanisms only notice important regions in frames without concerning the spatial structure information around them. To address these issues, a discriminative multi-focused and complementary temporal/spatial attention framework is presented, which consists of the multi-focused temporal attention network with multi-granularity loss (M2TEAN) and complementary spatial attention network with co-classification loss (C2SPAN). Firstly, M2TEAN not only focuses on discriminative multilevel motion features, but also highlights more discriminative features among them. Specifically, a short-term discriminative attention sub-network and a middle-term consistent attention sub-network are, respectively, constructed to focus on discriminative short-term and middle-term features. A long-term evolutive attention sub-network is proposed to focus on long-term action evolution over time. Followed by a multi-focused temporal attention module, more discriminative features are ulteriorly highlighted. Secondly, C2SPAN captures discriminative regions in frames, while mining the spatial structure information around them. Experiments reveal that our methods produce state-of-the-art results.},

To enhance interaction with the irregular environment, reference trajectory is learned via controller from states to optimal control. The main issue is to solve the optimal tracking control problem for a hybrid generation system consisting of multiple switched subsystems, and reinforcement learning can seek the globally optimal solution well without knowing accurate system dynamics. The investigated learning algorithm is used to generate an optimum map based on the learned ultimate value without knowledge of system parameters and obtains the optimal control law via deriving of algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) with unnecessary knowing of command generator dynamics. The optimal control solution can converge the online learning algorithm well based on policy iteration as verification in the simulation.},

However, it has been demonstrated that the brain operates as a network in which all regions are interconnected. Apart from physical links, the brain presents functional associations between non-physically connected regions that work synchronized in a common mental process. For this reason, the study of functional connectivity is essential to reveal new insights about brain’s behavior. In this work, a nonlinear functional connectivity metric called cross-sample entropy is applied for the first time to emotions recognition. Concretely, it has been computed for the detection of distress because of being one of the most influencing emotions in developed societies with several negative implications for health. Results reveal a strong coordinated activity between channels in central, parietal and occipital areas in each brain hemisphere separately, and also in the inter-hemispheric interactions among the same regions. Moreover, an augmented amount of similar dynamics under distress conditions in all brain regions with respect to a calm state reveals an increase in self-coordination of brain activity in distressful situations.},

In the current work, we aim to provide a threefold study on this particular domain. Firstly, we extract different statistical feature sets from word images and use five different off-the-shelf classifiers to delineate their performance. Then, we employ five different CNN-TL architectures, namely AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50, and GoogleNet, to understand how they perform on holistic Bangla words. Finally, we use a seven-layer FCN architecture and provide a comparison of results with all the aforementioned experimentations.

  abstract     = {Key process parameters such as production qualities and environmental pollution indices are difficult to be measured online in complex industrial processes. High time and economic costs make only limited small sample data be obtained to build process models, while the deep neural network model requires massive training samples. Although the deep forest algorithm is based on nonneural network structure, it mainly is utilized to effectively address classification problems. Owing to the above problems, a new deep forest regression algorithm based on cross-layer full connection is proposed. First of all, sub-forest prediction values of the input layer forest module are processed to obtain the layer regression vector, which is combined with the raw feature vector as the input of the middle layer forest model. And then, a cross-layer full connection way connecting the former layer regression vector contributes to an augmented layer regression vector. Meanwhile, the deep layer’s number is adaptively adjusted via verifying the validation error. In the end, the output layer forest model is trained by using the augmented layer regression vector originated from the middle layer forest model and the raw feature vector. Sequentially, the maximum information flow is effectively ensured by information sharing. Moreover, the proposed method has the advantages of simple hyper-parameter setting criterion. Simulation results based on benchmark and industrial data show that the proposed method has equal or better performance than several state-of-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Surface cracks on the concrete structures are a key indicator of structural safety and degradation. To ensure the structural health and reliability of the buildings, frequent structure inspection and monitoring for surface cracks is important. Surface inspection conducted by humans is time-consuming and may produce inconsistent results due to the inspectors’ varied empirical knowledge. In the field of structural health monitoring, visual inspection of surface cracks on civil structures using deep learning algorithms has gained considerable attention. However, these vision-based techniques require high-quality images as inputs and depend on high computational power for image classification. Thus, in this study, shallow convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture for surface concrete crack detection is proposed. LeNet-5, a well-known CNN architecture, is optimized and trained for image classification using 40,000 images in the Middle East Technical University (METU) dataset. To achieve maximum accuracy for crack detection with minimum computation, the hyperparameters of the proposed model were optimized. The proposed model enables the employment of deep learning algorithms using low-power computational devices for a hassle-free monitoring of civil structures. The performance of the proposed model is compared with those of various pretrained deep learning models, such as VGG16, Inception, and ResNet. The proposed shallow CNN architecture was found to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.8\% in the minimum computation. Better hyperparameter optimization in CNN architecture results in higher accuracy even with a shallow layer stack for enhanced computation. The evaluation results confirm the incorporation of the proposed method with autonomous devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicle, for real-time inspection of surface crack with minimum computation.},

The method is capable of dealing with nonlinear stochastic systems in strict-feedback form with any unknown dynamics. The proposed neural network allows the method not only to approximate any unknown dynamic of stochastic nonlinear systems, but also to compensate actuator nonlinearity. By employing dynamic surface control method, a common problem that intrinsically exists in the back-stepping design, called “explosion of complexity”, is resolved. The proposed method is applied to the control systems comprising various types of the actuator nonlinearities such as Prandtl–Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis, and dead-zone nonlinearity. The performance of the proposed method is compared to two different baseline methods: a direct form of backstepping method, and an adaptation of the proposed method, named APIC-DSC, in which the neural network is not contributed in compensating the actuator nonlinearity. It is observed that the proposed method improves the failure-free tracking performance in terms of the Integrated Mean Square Error (IMSE) by 25\%/11\% as compared to the backstepping/APIC-DSC method. This depression in IMSE is further improved by 76\%/38\% and 32\%/49\%, when it comes with the actuator nonlinearity of PI hysteresis and dead-zone, respectively. The proposed method also demands shorter adaptation period compared with the baseline methods.},

In this paper, by considering the diversity of scales of intrusion objects and complexity of application scenarios under power grid surveillance, we compiled a dataset which contains 8177 images captured by 653 different power grid surveillance cameras. Based on this dataset, we proposed an improved context-aware mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model, namely ID-Net, for intrusion object detection. A modulated deformable convolutional operation is integrated into the backbone network for learning robust feature representations from geometric variations in engineering vehicles. By considering the correlation between objects and their context, a self-attention-based module is leveraged for long-range context relation modeling. For small objects detection, a feature integration module is applied for multi-scale feature fusion under a pyramid hierarchy. Then, a cascaded coarse-to-fine region proposal network is incorporated for progressively refining the bounding box location regression. Experimental results have demonstrated that our model can achieve competitive performance in comparison with state-of-the-art object detection methods.},

  abstract     = {With the growth of IoT services, there has been an increased demand for indoor localization-based services. Wi-Fi access is omnipresent; its high accuracy and ability to use commodity devices makes it suitable to be widely adopted for localization in indoor environments. Recent sequence transduction models such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) mostly rely on recurrent and convolution. Both LSTM and RNN have achieved tremendous results in the localization tasks, but their sequential character prevents them from effectively performing parallel computing, therefore, limiting their performance in processing extremely long sequences. Lately, there have been different models developed for natural language processing transduction tasks that relied solely on attention mechanism, and they performed remarkably well with less computation. This paper is the first to propose the sole utilization of self-attention mechanism for localization time-series modeling. We introduce a self-attention mechanism fingerprinting-based model (SAMFI) which uses positional encoding and masking mechanism. To capture the temporal ordering information, we used the extended symbolic aggregate approximation strategy. Moreover, the proposed model utilizes calibrated channel state information as location fingerprints. SAMFI&#39;s pivotal concept is simple and empirically potent. The obtained results significantly minimized the location error on the collected dataset with an accuracy level score of 86.5\% outperforming both RNN and LSTM models which scored 82.6 and 67.5\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In electric vehicles (EVs) with multiple motors, torque vectoring (TV) control can effectively enhance the cornering response and safety. Moreover, TV systems can also improve the overall efficiency through an optimal torque distribution that also considers the power consumption. For such a complex control system with multiple objectives, intelligent control techniques have demonstrated to be one of the best alternatives. However, the works proposed in the literature do not handle both vehicle dynamics behaviour and energy efficiency, and generally do not consider the real-time implementability of the developed controllers. To overcome the aforementioned issues, in this work, a novel torque vectoring approach is proposed, which uses a neural network-based vertical tire forces estimator and considers the regenerative braking capabilities of EVs. Moreover, the implementability of the controller in a hetereogenous (FPGA and microcontroller) automotive suitable system on chip is addressed, ensuring its real-time capabilities. For the sake of validating the proposed approach, a set of experiments have been carried out in a hardware in the loop setup. The performance of the proposed TV approach has been compared with other two TV approaches from the literature, evaluating them in several challenging manoeuvres in high and low tire-road friction coefficient scenarios. Results show that the proposed approach not only is able to enhance the vehicle dynamics behaviour but also to decrease the energy consumption about 13\%.},

  abstract     = {One of the most captivating problems being faced nowadays in Physics are ultra-high energy cosmic rays. They are high-energy radiations coming mainly from outside the Solar System, and when they enter Earth’s atmosphere, they produce a cascade of particles. This cascade of particles, named as extensive air shower, can be recorded by means of photomultiplier tubes in surface detectors, obtaining different recordings of the energy signal (since the air shower can hit one or more detectors). Based on these signals, different features can be obtained that might give an insight into which particle has caused the extensive air shower, which is of utmost importance for physicists. Therefore, this work presents a supervised learning algorithm to determine that the particle is a photon or a hadron. Convolutional neural networks and feed forward neural networks are compared in order to analyze the importance of spatial information for the classification. Then, a comparison between using the information of each surface detector separately and integrating the information from them for the classification is studied, showing that the integration improves the results compared to using each surface detector’s trace independently. Furthermore, a comparison between manually extracted features from the signal and the automatically extracted features by the convolutional neural network is done, showing the classification potential of the latter. Finally, the addition of particle shower features which are external to the surface detector measurements is assessed, showing that the combination of automatically extracted features and external variables is able to predict the particle that has produced the air shower with an accuracy of 98.87\%.},

Most previous image decomposition algorithms and applications start with high-quality images, but it requires numerous steps to separate and edit the high-resolution structure and texture images from the low-resolution input counterparts. This paper proposes a simple but effective end-to-end deep neural image decomposition network, which is called ”scalable image decomposition”, by decomposing and upscaling structure and texture images from the degraded input image at the same time. We train the deep neural network to automatically estimate high-resolution structure and texture from the low-resolution input image by designing a shared feature extractor, and structure and texture upscaling networks which have a powerful capability to establish and distinguish a complex mapping between the low-resolution input image and high-quality structure and texture, while preserving more contextual information without any prior information regarding the low-resolution input image. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed scalable image decomposition network validate that the proposed method is stable and robust against blurring and staircase effects by separating texture and structure upscaling networks in real-time. The predicted upscaled structure and texture images can be used to a variety of applications, such as image abstraction, detail enhancement, and pencil sketching.},

  abstract     = {Automatic facial expression recognition (FER) is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision. FER admits a wide range of applications in human–computer interaction, behavioral psychology, and human expression synthesis. Extensive works have been reported in this field, mainly, based on handcrafted features. However, it is a challenging task to accurately extract all the correlated handcrafted features due to the effect of variations caused by emotional state. Therefore, there is a quest for further research on accurately extracting relevant features that can capture changes in facial expressions (FEs) with high fidelity. In this study, we propose FER-net: a convolution neural network to distinguish FEs efficiently with the help of the softmax classifier. We implement our method FER-net along with twenty-one state-of-the-art methods and test them on five benchmarking datasets, namely FER2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. Seven FEs, namely neutral, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise, are considered in this work. The average accuracies on these datasets are 78.9\%, 96.7\%, 97.8\%, 82.5\% and 81.68\%, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that FER-net is preeminent in comparison with twenty-one state-of-the-art methods.},

Here, two kernel functions i.e., radial basis function and wavelet kernel functions are deployed together to form the added kernel framework. From EMD, intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are obtained where Hilbert transform (HT) is used to obtain analytic form of IMFs. For classifying seizure and non-seizure EEG signals, the frequency modulation bandwidth and amplitude modulation bandwidth parameters are obtained from the analytical IMFs and are used as features for the OAKLSSVM model.

The aim of the present study is twofold. First, it compares three different input features for training and testing dysarthric speech recognition systems. These features are the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs), and the perceptual linear prediction features (PLPs). Second, the performance of the CNN- and LSTM-based architectures is compared against a state-of-the-art baseline system based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to determine the best dysarthric speech recognizer. Experimental results show that the CNN-based system using perceptual linear prediction features provides a recognition rate that can reach 82\%, which constitutes relative improvement of 11\% and 32\% when compared to the performance of LSTM- and GMM-HMM-based systems, respectively.},

In today’s world, magnetic resonance imaging is used for determining the brain tumor types in an effective manner. The manual classification of brain tumor consumes more time and also applicable for a limited number of images, so a deep learning-based model is proposed in this research paper for automatic classification of brain tumor types. At first, the brain images are collected from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image dataset. Then, the normalization technique and histogram of oriented gradients are employed to improve the visible level of the collected raw brain images and to extract the feature vectors from the normalized brain images. The histogram descriptor effectively describes the edge and contour features of the images related to other feature descriptors. Further, the extracted features are given as the input to convolutional neural networks to classify meningiomas, gliomas, and pituitary tumors. The hard swish-based RELU activation function is included in convolutional neural networks that effectively improve the classification performance and learning speed. In the experimental phase, the proposed model achieved 98.6\% of accuracy that is better compared to the existing algorithms like deep convolutional neural network with transfer learning and fine-tuning.},

Moreover, for new specific subject, the size of sample data is very small compared to that of existing subjects, which easily leads to overfitting in deep neural network training and reduces generalization performance of the network. In this paper, the deep multi-source adaptation transfer network (DMATN) is proposed for the new subjects in aBCI. In DMATN, the multi-source selection is employed to obtain the portion of existing EEG data mostly correlated with new subject and to decrease by two-fifth source data. To explore domain-invariant structures, deep adaptation network is used to map correlated source domain and the target domain (new subject) into reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) optimized by the multiple kernel variant of maximum mean discrepancies (MK-MMD). To more precisely predict the emotional state of the new subject, domain discriminator is applied in DMATN to make the data distribution of the two domains more similar. Finally, across-subject experiments on SEED dataset are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that DMATN model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 84.46\%, 83.32\% and 84.90\% in three sessions, respectively.

These approaches can significantly reduce human annotation efforts, although they remain inferior to fully supervised procedures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that iteratively refines pixel-level annotations and optimizes segmentation network. We first produce initial deep cues using the combination of activation maps and a saliency map. To produce high-quality pixel-level annotations, a graphical model is constructed over optimal segmentation of high-quality region hierarchies to propagate information from deep cues to unmarked regions. In the training process, the initial pixel-level annotations are used as supervision to train the segmentation network and to predict segmentation masks. To correct inaccurate labels of segmentation masks, we use these segmentation masks with the graphical model to produce accurate pixel-level annotations and use them as supervision to retrain the segmentation network. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods using static labels. The proposed method has state-of-the-art performance, which are $$66.7\%$$ mIoU score on PASCAL VOC 2012 test set and $$27.0\%$$ mIoU score on MS COCO validation set.},

  abstract     = {Harris hawks optimizer (HHO) has received widespread attention among researchers in terms of the performance, quality of results, and its acceptable convergence in dealing with different applications in real-world problems. This increased interest led to the emergence of many versions of HHO applied to various optimization problems in different fields. Therefore, this study aims to identify, retrieve, summarize, and analyze the critical studies related to the development of HHO. For this aim, we applied a review methodology. The applied methodology led to identified and selection of 69 related studies from different electronic sources. The review result revealed that although HHO algorithm is still in the infant stage, its superiority over several well-established metaheuristic algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy for addressing various benchmark problems and tackling several real-world optimization problems has been clearly observed. The HHO algorithm was evaluated, and its strengths and weaknesses were discussed. This review not only suggested possible future directions in this domain but also serves as a comprehensive source of information about HHO and HHO variants for future researchers due to the inclusion of charts and tabular comparison across a wide variety of attributes. A public website supports open access to this research and also source codes of the HHO in a different language and its supplementary materials at https://aliasgharheidari.com/HHO.html .},

  abstract     = {Ever since its foundational years, synthetic biology has been focused on the implementation of biological computing structures. In the beginning, engineered biological computation has mainly been based on uncoupled monoclonal cellular populations. Implementations of such computing structures were mostly inspired by digital electronic circuits and revealed many constraints that limited the advance of the field to relatively simple information processing structures. The focus has recently shifted towards the implementation of biological computing structures within coupled intercellular circuits composed of engineered cellular modules. These circuits have, however, advanced only to a certain point, namely to consist of a few engineered bacterial strains, which perform the computation. It is now time to make a transition from modules and relatively simple systems of biological processing structures to networks composing different strains each presenting a designated computing structure. In such networks, each strain is analogous to a logic chip on a breadboard circuit and is connected to other strains by means of intercellular communication mechanisms rather than copper wires. This analogy can be driven further to use a set of engineered biological modules to construct a complex computing system, such as a multicellular biological processor. We review the state of the art of distributed cellular computation, communication mechanisms, and computational analysis and design approaches for distributed biological computing. We demonstrate the potential next step in engineered biological computation by a proposal of a design of a multicellular biological processor. We demonstrate an analysis of the proposed computing network using in silico simulation and optimisation approaches. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of the reviewed distributed cellular computing structures to the field of neural computing.},

  abstract     = {Recently established Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) has natural behaviour for finding an optimum solution in global search space without getting trapped in previous convergence. However, the exploitation phase of the current Harris Hawks optimizer algorithm is poor. In the present research, an improved version of the Harris Hawks optimization algorithm, which combined HHO with Particle Swarm Optimization and named as ameliorated Harris Hawks optimizer algorithm, has been proposed to find the solution of various optimization problems such as nonlinear, non-convex and highly constrained engineering design problem. In the proposed research, the exploitation phase of the existing HHO algorithm is improved using a particle swarm optimization algorithm and its performance tested for CEC2005, CECE2017 and CEC2018 benchmark problems. Also, discrete algorithms such as FFT algorithms, convolution and image processing algorithm use multiply and accumulate (MAC) unit as a critical component. The efficiency of a MAC is mainly dependent upon the speed of operation, power dissipation and chip area along with the complexity level of the circuit. In this research paper, a power-efficient signed floating-point MAC (SFMAC) is proposed using universal compressor-based multiplier (UCM). Instead of having a complex design architecture, a simple multiplexer-based circuit is used to achieve signed floating output. The 8 × 8 SFMAC can take 8-bit mantissa and 3-bit exponent. And therefore, the input to the SFMAC can be in the range of − (7.96875)10 to + (7.96875)10. The design and implementation of the proposed architecture is done on the Cadence Spectre tool in GPDK 90 nm and TSMC 130 nm technologies. The analysis has proved that the proposed SFMAC architecture has consumed the least power than the recent MAC architectures available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has emerged as a global crisis with unprecedented socio-economic challenges, jeopardizing our lives and livelihoods for years to come. The unavailability of vaccines for COVID-19 has rendered rapid testing of the population instrumental in order to contain the exponential rise in cases of infection. Shortage of RT-PCR test kits and delays in obtaining test results calls for alternative methods of rapid and reliable diagnosis. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based solution using chest X-rays which can help in rapid triaging of COVID-19 patients. The proposed solution uses image enhancement, image segmentation, and employs a modified stacked ensemble model consisting of four CNN base-learners along with Naive Bayes as meta-learner to classify chest X-rays into three classes viz. COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. An effective pruning strategy as introduced in the proposed framework results in increased model performance, generalizability, and decreased model complexity. We incorporate explainability in our article by using Grad-CAM visualization in order to establish trust in the medical AI system. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art GAN architectures and their ability to generate realistic synthetic samples of COVID-19 chest X-rays to deal with limited numbers of training samples. The proposed solution significantly outperforms existing methods, with 98.67\% accuracy, 0.98 Kappa score, and F-1 scores of 100, 98, and 98 for COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes, respectively, on standard datasets. The proposed solution can be used as one element of patient evaluation along with gold-standard clinical and laboratory testing.},

Besides, there might be noisy labels in practical datasets, which impairs the training process of neural networks. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm for training data samples with noisy labels by performing selected positive learning and negative learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we designed a portable ECG patch-RealCare and applied the algorithm on a real-life dataset. Our experimental results show that we can achieve an accuracy of 91.0\%, which is 6.2\% higher than a normal training process with ResNet.

It has much important applications on non-photorealistic rendering and computer games. However, existing image-based methods cannot be readily extended to videos because of temporal flickering and stylization inconsistency. Therefore, the main effort of this work is to propose an efficient salient object-aware and depth-consistent video style transfer algorithm. Specifically, DenseNet is carefully extended as feed-forward backbone network for better style transfer quality. Then, through utilizing salient object segmentation and depth estimation results, depth-consistent loss and object masked long–short temporal losses are deliberately proposed at training stage. The proposed losses can preserve stereoscopic sense without salient semantic distortion and consecutive stylized frame flickering. The proposed network has been compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more superior on achieving real-time processing efficiency, nice rendering quality and coherent stylization at the same time.

According to literature review, proportional + integral + derivative (PID) structure is used to control many of these UAVs. This controller is insufficient against uncertain weather conditions and disturbance effects. In this study, many different control techniques are evaluated to select the controller structure that can respond to these uncertainties. The structure having the best result was chosen as the UAV controller. Ultrastick-25e mini UAV model is used to control the roll and yaw angle lateral dynamics. State-space presentation of the UAV longitudinal and lateral dynamics is explained, and it is just obtained for the lateral dynamics to control the attitude of the UAV under 60 km/h flight velocity condition. According to the aileron and rudder inputs, lateral dynamics simulations have successfully done by using five different controller methods such as classical PID, artificial neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), fuzzy logic controller, combined ANFIS-PID, and PD-Fuzzy-PI controllers. Moreover, three different input signals are assumed to evaluate the system response. Additionally, transient response and the time performance parameters such as overshoots, peak, rise and settling times, and steady-state error have analyzed for the designed different controllers. The simulated results for the five different controller designs showed that combined PD-fuzzy-PI and ANFIS-PID controllers have more acceptable performance than other controllers at the steady level flight condition. It is aimed that the simulation findings obtained in this study will contribute to experimental studies.},

This ensemble of regression tree modules is trained with optimized hyperparameters such as minimum leaf size, leaning cycles, and learning rate by using Bayesian optimization. A practical power transmission network of Chhattisgarh state is modeled/simulated in MATLAB software to employ the proposed fault location scheme. Exclusive datasets are provided by performing extensive simulation studies at a wide range of fault scenarios, thereby applying discrete wavelet transform as an explanatory signal processing technique. Further performance assessment is carried out by comparing different error metrics such as mean absolute error, mean absolute relative error, mean square error, and root mean square error. The simulation results confirm the applicability of the proposed scheme for fault location estimation, and it makes a research insight while designing relaying schemes to practical power transmission networks.},

In essence, an HMM is associated with each neuron of the SOHMMM lattice. In this paper, the SOHMMM algorithm is employed for anomaly detection in 802.11 wireless access point usage data. Furthermore, we extend the SOHMMM online gradient descent unsupervised learning algorithm for multivariate Gaussian emissions. The experimental analysis uses two types of data: synthetic data to investigate the accuracy and convergence of the SOHMMM algorithm and wireless simulation data to verify the significance and efficiency of the algorithm in anomaly detection. The sensitivity and specificity of the SOHMMM algorithm in anomaly detection are compared to two other approaches, namely HMM initialized with universal background model (HMM-UBM) and SOHMMM with zero neighborhood (Z-SOHMMM). The results from the wireless simulation experiments show that SOHMMM outperformed the aforementioned approaches in all the presented anomalous scenarios.},

There is not yet reported an aggregation operator (AO) which can provide desirable generality, flexibility and compatibility in adjusting risk preferences while aggregating attribute values under hesitant fuzzy (HF) environment, although based on algebraic t-norm and t-conorm, Einstein t-norm and t-conorm, Hammacher t-norm and t-conorm, Dombi t-norm and t-conorm and Frank t-norm and t-conorm; weighted AOs have been developed earlier to attempt to meet above such eventualities. So, the primary objective of this paper is to develop some general, flexible as well as compatible AOs that can be exploited to solve MADM problems with HF information. From this perspective, at the very beginning, we develop new operations between HFEs by uniting the features of Archimedean and Dombi operations. Next, based on these operations, we develop HF Archimedean-Dombi weighted arithmetic and geometric AOs, HF Archimedean-Dombi ordered weighted arithmetic and geometric AOs and HF Archimedean-Dombi hybrid arithmetic and geometric AOs. We have shown that the existing HF-algebraic weighted AOs, HF-Einstein weighted AOs and HF-Hammacher weighted AOs are special cases of our developed AOs. We discuss in detail some intriguing properties of the proposed AOs. Next, we establish a procedure of MADM endowed by the proposed operators under HF environment. Then, we present a practical example concerning the personnel selection to gloss the decision steps of the proposed method. We also conduct a validity test to show that our proposed AOs are authentic and legal. Moreover, we exhibit a sensitivity investigation with diverse criteria weight sets to examine the stability of our proposed intriguing approach. Also, we draw attention toward a comparison between the existing decision-making methods with the proposed method to prove the superiority of our model.},

  abstract     = {Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a newly swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm that simulate the swimming and foraging behaviour of salps in oceans so to search for global optimum solution. Similarly to other metaheuristic algorithms, SSA suffers from poor convergence rate and stagnation in local optima. In this paper, three different improvements to the original population update process are proposed in order to enhance its exploitation and exploration capabilities. The first modification (MSSA1) introduces the concept of local best information to the followers salps update process allowing a better exploration of local search neighbourhood. The second improvement (MSSA2) provide two followers update process. The first is based on a differential evolution combined with a randomly selected local best position, and the second uses a local search in the global best neighbourhood which is triggered by a non-improvement in the corresponding local best. A third modification to the SSA algorithm (MSSA3) penalises a non-improvement of the local best solution by computing a new corresponding follower’s position based on a local jump in the local best neighbourhood for better exploitation. The performances of the proposed algorithms are tested on 27 CEC’15 test suite, and two real-world optimisation problems. A comparative study using nonparametric statistical tests of the obtained results is conducted against those of eight well-known metaheuristics, including the original SSA. The results indicate an overall distinctive performance of all three modification compared to the remaining algorithms, while MSSA1 scored generally better than MSSA2 and MSSA3.},

  abstract     = {Grapes reception is a key process in wine production. The harvest days are extremely challenging days in managing the reception of the grapes, as the winery needs to deal with the non-uniform arrival of the grapes, while guaranteeing suppliers’ satisfaction and wine quality. The best management of the resources of the suppliers (i.e., grapes and trucks) and winery (i.e., grain-tanks and pressing machines) must be ensured. In this paper, the underlying optimization problem for grape reception is solved by developing a genetic algorithm (GA) tailored for this specific challenge. The results of this algorithm are compared with a FIFO policy for a typical scenario that occurs on the harvest days of a real winery. Additionally, different scenarios are simulated to assess the validity and quality of the solutions found. The results show that, using modest computational resources, it is possible to achieve better solutions with the proposed GA. This allows for the algorithm to be used in real time, even whenever plant conditions change significantly (e.g., when a new truck arrives, when a machine fails). Furthermore, the trucks and grapes waiting time for the results using the developed GA are significantly smaller than the ones observed using a FIFO approach.},

  abstract     = {The study of affective computing in the wild setting is underpinned by databases. Existing multimodal emotion databases in the real-world conditions are few and small, with a limited number of subjects and expressed in a single language. To meet this requirement, we collected, annotated, and prepared to release a new natural state video database (called HEU Emotion). HEU Emotion contains a total of 19,004 video clips, which is divided into two parts according to the data source. The first part contains videos downloaded from Tumblr, Google, and Giphy, including 10 emotions and two modalities (facial expression and body posture). The second part includes corpus taken manually from movies, TV series, and variety shows, consisting of 10 emotions and three modalities (facial expression, body posture, and emotional speech). HEU Emotion is by far the most extensive multimodal emotional database with 9951 subjects. In order to provide a benchmark for emotion recognition, we used many conventional machine learning and deep learning methods to evaluate HEU Emotion. We proposed a multimodal attention module to fuse multimodal features adaptively. After multimodal fusion, the recognition accuracies for the two parts increased by 2.19\% and 4.01\%, respectively, over those of single-modal facial expression recognition.},

The purpose of this study is to minimize the energy loss due to fluctuations and variation in the rotor speed and also find the optimum values of FOPI $$^\lambda $$ by using a recurrent neural network to enhance the overall implementation of the system. In this perspective, the low-speed execution of MRAS is poor due to the existence of a pure integral and derivative parameter. Towards enhancement of the performance at speed region, a MRAS method with RNN is used. The network is trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm, and FOPI $$^\lambda $$ control method is used for tuning the gain of proportional-integral of speed and current controller of the encoderless speed control of the ventilation drive. The presented RNN speed estimator with FOPI $$^\lambda $$ controller has shown better performance and stability in transitory and stable operation as well as it also provides an enhancement in the overall efficiency of the ventilation drive. The validation of the presented algorithm is detailed experiments on a fully digitized 5.5 kW ventilation system using the Lab VIEW interface.},

By using a novel differential inequality, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee synchronization, revealing the crucial role of the time average of the smallest eigenvalue of an augmented matrix in spite of the changeable pinning strength. Meanwhile, Zeno phenomenon is also successfully excluded. As applications, the main theorem is utilized to examine some specified dynamic pinning strategies, such as pinning control with periodic intermittency, switching pinned node set, and nonlinear pinning strength. An interesting finding is that drive-response synchronization is possible even when the underlying topology is disconnected. Finally, numerical examples on coupled Hopfield neural networks and networked nonlinear oscillators are given for demonstration purpose.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the group convolutions are widely used in mobile convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve the model’s efficiency. However, the training process of these popular group-conv mobile models is usually time-consuming compared to the regular models. Since some practical applications usually need retraining when the new data are added, the training process should be also efficient. Therefore, this paper firstly explores the inefficiency of current popular group-conv mobile CNNs to propose the guidelines of constructing mobile CNNs. According to these guidelines, the fully shared convolutional neural networks (FSC-Nets) are proposed in this paper. The FSC-Nets can share the same filter in both the channel and layer extents, and it is the first method to share the filters from all the extents. Experimental results show that, compared with current popular regular networks and the latest state-of-the-art group-conv mobile networks, the FSC-Nets can perform better while effectively decreasing the model size and runtime in both the training and test processes.},

  abstract     = {The strength of long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs) that have been applied is more located in handling sequences of variable length than in handling geometric variability of the image patterns. In this paper, an end-to-end convolutional LSTM neural network is used to handle both geometric variation and sequence variability. The best results for LSTMs are often based on large-scale training of an ensemble of network instances. We show that high performances can be reached on a common benchmark set by using proper data augmentation for just five such networks using a proper coding scheme and a proper voting scheme. The networks have similar architectures (convolutional neural network (CNN): five layers, bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM): three layers followed by a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) processing step). The approach assumes differently scaled input images and different feature map sizes. Three datasets are used: the standard benchmark RIMES dataset (French); a historical handwritten dataset KdK (Dutch); the standard benchmark George Washington (GW) dataset (English). Final performance obtained for the word-recognition test of RIMES was 96.6\%, a clear improvement over other state-of-the-art approaches which did not use a pre-trained network. On the KdK and GW datasets, our approach also shows good results. The proposed approach is deployed in the Monk search engine for historical-handwriting collections.},

  abstract     = {The increasing popularity of social media platforms has simplified the sharing of news articles that have led to the explosion in fake news. With the emergence of fake news at a very rapid rate, a serious concern has produced in our society because of enormous fake content dissemination. The quality of the news content is questionable and there exists a necessity for an automated tool for the detection. Existing studies primarily focus on utilizing information extracted from the news content. We suggest that user-based engagements and the context related group of people (echo-chamber) sharing the same opinions can play a vital role in the fake news detection. Hence, in this paper, we have focused on both the content of the news article and the existence of echo chambers in the social network for fake news detection. Standard factorization methods for fake news detection have limited effectiveness due to their unsupervised nature and primarily employed with traditional machine learning models. To design an effective deep learning model with tensor factorization approach is the priority. In our approach, the news content is fused with the tensor following a coupled matrix–tensor factorization method to get a latent representation of both news content as well as social context. We have designed our model with a different number of filters across each dense layer along with dropout. To classify on news content and social context-based information individually as well as in combination, a deep neural network (our proposed model) was employed with optimal hyper-parameters. The performance of our proposed approach has been validated on a real-world fake news dataset: BuzzFeed and PolitiFact. Classification results have demonstrated that our proposed model (EchoFakeD) outperforms existing and appropriate baselines for fake news detection and achieved a validation accuracy of 92.30\%. These results have shown significant improvements over the existing state-of-the-art models in the area of fake news detection and affirm the potential use of the technique for classifying fake news.},

Purchasing cost is one of the important factors to be considered by production managers, while designing or redesigning assembly line when collaborative robots are being utilized. Several objectives are to be optimized in an assembly line balancing problem and optimizing line efficiency along with purchasing cost sometimes results in conflicting situation. This paper presents the first study to tackle the cost-oriented assembly line balancing problem with collaborative robots, where several different types of collaborative robots with different purchasing costs are available and selected. A multi-objective mixed-integer programming model is developed to minimize the cycle time and the total collaborative robot purchasing cost. The multi-objective migrating bird optimization algorithm is developed to obtain a set of high-quality Pareto solutions. This algorithm utilizes the fast non-dominated sorting approach to update the population and develops a restart mechanism to select one solution in the permanent Pareto archive to replace the abandoned solution which remains unchanged for several iterations. The computational study validates that the utilization of the multi-objective model is reasonable and developed algorithm produces competing performance in comparison with multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm and two multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Endoscopic photoacoustic tomography (EPAT) is a rapidly developing catheter-based imaging technique to provide cross-sectional images of anatomical, functional and molecular data of tubular objects. The scanning geometry of the ultrasonic detector is enclosed in the cavity resulting in highly restricted acquisition of photoacoustically induced acoustic pressures. Thus, data-incompleteness is an important factor that causes degradation of the image quality. This work presents a method to solve the acoustic inverse problem of EPAT from incomplete measurements associated with the image formation process. This method combines the traditional variational iteration with convolutional neural network (CNN), in which the forward operator and adjoint operator of imaging are excluded from the network training and are embedded into each layer of the structural unit. The gradient information is utilized to reduce the influence of incomplete measurements on the image quality. The network is trained unit by unit in an adaptive way to achieve fast convergence. Our numerical results conducted on various data sets showed that the trained network is robust to the sampling rate of the measured data. Also, it is able to provide a generalization that can work across various noise levels in the data. In addition, a robust peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) improvement obtained in the reconstructed images has been demonstrated in comparison with conventional TR reconstruction, CS reconstruction and post-processing by U-net.},

  abstract     = {Concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns are widely used in the construction industry. Prediction of the ultimate bearing capacity of CFST columns is complicated because it is influenced nonlinearly by many factors such as steel tube length, steel tube thickness, ratio length and column diameter, and concrete compressive strength. This study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of CFST columns. The AI model was developed based on support vector regression (SVR) and grey wolf optimization (GWO). The GWO optimized the SVR configuration that produces highly accurate prediction results. A large experimental dataset with normal, high, and ultimate strength concretes was used to validate the model’s effectiveness through the learning and test phases. A k-fold cross-validation method was adopted to ensure the generalizability. The column diameter (D), thickness of steel tube (t), yield stress of steel, compressive strength of concrete, column length, D/t ratio were used as inputs for the model. Results show that the proposed SVR-GWO model was more effective than the compared models and empirical methods in the bearing capacity prediction of CFST columns. The SVR-GWO yielded the outstanding performance in which the accuracy improvements by the proposed model were ranged from 10.3 to 87.9\% in the mean absolute percentage error and from 15.4 to 74.2\% in the mean absolute error compared to baseline models and empirical methods.

  abstract     = {It is a long-standing challenge to reconstruct the locations and extents of cortical neural activities from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, especially when the EEG signals contain strong background activities and outlier artifacts. In this work, we propose a robust source imaging method called $$L_1$$ R-SSSI. To alleviate the effect of outliers in EEG, $$L_1$$ R-SSSI employs the $$L_1$$ -loss to model the residual error. To obtain locally smooth and globally sparse estimations, $$L_1$$ R-SSSI adopts the structured sparsity constraint, which incorporates the $$L_1$$ -norm regularization in both the variation and original source domain. The estimations of $$L_1$$ R-SSSI are efficiently obtained using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Results of simulated and experimental data analysis demonstrate that $$L_1$$ R-SSSI effectively suppresses the effect of the outlier artifacts in EEG. $$L_1$$ R-SSSI outperforms the traditional $$L_2$$ -norm-based methods (e.g., wMNE, LORETA), and SISSY, which employs $$L_2$$ -norm loss and structured sparsity, indicated by the larger AUC (average AUC $$&gt;0.80$$ ), smaller SD (average SD $$&lt;50$$ mm), DLE (average DLE $$&lt;10$$ mm) and RMSE (average RMSE $$&lt;1.75$$ ) values under all the numerically simulated conditions. $$L_1$$ R-SSSI also provides better estimations of extended sources than the method with $$L_1$$ -loss and $$L_p$$ -norm regularization term (e.g., LAPPS).},

  abstract     = {Most traditional genetic programming methods that handle symbolic regression are random algorithms without memory and direction. They repeatedly search for the same or similar positions in the symbolic space, and easily fall into premature convergence. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new symbolic expression search algorithm based on the Monte Carlo tree search named SE-MCTS. It creates a tree to represent the symbolic space and remembers its visiting positions. Moreover, it incorporates two neural networks—Actor and Critic into the upper confidence bound to direct its search based on the given dataset features and decide when to use particle swarm optimization to find fitted constants in a mathematical expression. The experiment results show that SE-MCTS can discover more proper mathematical expressions than canonical genetic programming methods.},

  abstract     = {Hydrological models are widely used tools in water resources management. Their successful application requires an efficient calibration of the model parameters. Nowadays, there are very powerful global search methods applied to this end, but they have the disadvantage of presenting a high computational cost, because the numerical model to be calibrated needs to be evaluated a large number of times with different parameter sets. In this context, surrogate models can reduce significantly the run time of hydrological models, easing the total computational burden of global search methods. In the present work, we propose and explore the combination of a swarm intelligence-based optimization method, the artificial bee colony algorithm, with a surrogate model based on artificial neural networks in order to calibrate hydrological models. The proposed approach (ABC-ANN) is applied to the calibration and validation of a nine-parameter continuous hydrological model in two basins located in the northwest of Spain. Several aspects of the algorithm are evaluated, including its capability to calibrate the model parameters and its efficiency in terms of CPU time compared to a standard implementation of the ABC algorithm. Results show that the ABC-ANN algorithm is able to identify the location of suitable parameter sets with an accuracy rate within 89 and 99\%, and a reduction in CPU time of more than three orders of magnitude when compared to a sequential implementation. In addition, the frequency distribution of the parameter sets identified gives valuable information about the sensitivity of model output to the input parameters.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the renewable energy has been occupied a lot of attention around the world since it presents cheap and sustainable energy. Consequently, its presence in power systems becomes a fact that had to deal with. Hence, load frequency control (LFC) in multi-area power systems that constitute photovoltaic (PV) and thermal plant sources is proposed. Two forms of competing cascaded controllers, namely proportional integral–proportional integral (PI–PI) and proportional–derivative with filter-PI (PDn-PI), are investigated, and their performances are compared with traditional PI and PIDn controller. An enhanced coyote optimization algorithm (ECOA) is proposed for finding the optimal tuned parameters of the proposed controllers. Furthermore, the uncertainty is considered under the variation of system parameters by ± 40\%. The performance of the proposed competing controllers is tested under dynamic load change that is applied individually in each area. These controllers are applied on two dissimilar test cases with various sets of disturbances. The obtained results are compared with various reported techniques. The simulated comparisons declare the great efficiency with high superiority robustness of the proposed cascaded PDn-PI based on ECOA for handling the LFC in multi-area power systems.},

However, the segmented clothing images usually contain complex backgrounds, and these clothing items appear to be twisted, as they are segmented from human body straightforwardly. In order to assist this cross-scenario clothing retrieval, this paper introduces a new triple-supervised GAN (TripleGAN) model by translating the clothes on human body into tiled clothes. Our model was trained on a large-scale dataset including over 30,000 clothing pairs constructed by ourselves.

  abstract     = {With growing hesitation in human perception, hesitant fuzzy set, an important extension of fuzzy set, has gained much attention from the research community. The concept of HFS gives decision makers the ability to provide multiple preferences for the same instance. However, the chance of these preferences occurring is assumed to be equal, which is unreasonable in practice. To circumvent this issue, probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (PHFS) is adopted in this work, which is an extension of hesitant fuzzy set with associated probability values. Based on the literature review on PHFS, it is evident that (i) occurrence probability of each element was not methodically calculated; (ii) hesitation was not properly captured during criteria weight calculation; (iii) interrelationship among criteria was not captured during aggregation; and (iv) broad/rational ranking of alternatives with compromise solution was lacking. Motivated by these challenges and to alleviate the same, a systematic procedure is proposed in this paper to estimate these probabilities. Additionally, in this procedure, decision makers’ preferences are aggregated using the newly proposed probabilistic hesitant fuzzy generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean operator and criteria weights are calculated using the proposed statistical variance method in the context of PHFS. A new ranking method is also proposed that extends a well-known VIKOR method to the PHFS context. Further, the practical use of the proposed decision framework is demonstrated by two examples viz., selecting a suitable coordinator for a research and development project and selection of a doctoral candidate for the supervisor position. Finally, the strength and weakness of the proposed decision framework are realized by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods.},

Exploiting the dynamic cluster-to-algorithm mapping via penalized and reward model with adaptive switching factor, HHGSO offers a novel approach for meta-heuristic hybridization consisting of Jaya Algorithm, Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm, Butterfly Optimization Algorithm, and Owl Search Algorithm, respectively. The acquired results from the selected two case studies (i.e., involving team formation problem and combinatorial test suite generation) indicate that the hybridization has notably improved the performance of HGSO and gives superior performance against other competing meta-heuristic and hyper-heuristic algorithms.},

It is required to maintain the product quality for profitability, and recent trends in soft-computing have seen a plethora of methods developed for this purpose. However, due to practical constraints experienced by the plant that limit extensive plant step tests, data available for the development of the soft sensor for this industrial debutanizer column is scarce. Hence, in this paper, a neuro-fuzzy technique (ANFIS) is investigated and compared against the widely used ANN model for the special case of limited training data samples of the industrial debutanizer column. It is observed that in comparison to ANN, ANFIS has better generalization performance and can work well with limited training data samples. From the results, it was observed that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model generally improved the RMSE by approximately 10 times in comparison to that of ANN.},

Second, we further implement the temporal consistent regularization formed by capturing dynamic appearance information from multiple historical frames with a high-confidence strategy to mitigate the model degradation.

This paper presents a comprehensive dataset that can be employed for recognizing, detecting, and captioning students’ behaviors in a classroom.

We analyze the special characteristics of the classroom scene and the technical difficulties for each module (task), which are verified by experiments. Due to the particularity of classrooms, our datasets proposes increasing the requirements of existing methods. Moreover, we provide a baseline for each task module in the dataset and make a comparison with the current mainstream datasets. The results show that our dataset is viable and reliable.

  abstract     = {In recent years, visual tracking methods that are based on discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) have been very promising. However, most of these methods suffer from a lack of robust scale estimation skills. Although a wide range of recent DCF-based methods exploit the features that are extracted from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their translation model, the scale of the visual target is still estimated by hand-crafted features. Whereas the exploitation of CNNs imposes a high computational burden, this paper exploits pre-trained lightweight CNNs models to propose two efficient scale estimation methods, which not only improve the visual tracking performance but also provide acceptable tracking speeds. The proposed methods are formulated based on either holistic or region representation of convolutional feature maps to efficiently integrate into DCF formulations to learn a robust scale model in the frequency domain. Moreover, against the conventional scale estimation methods with iterative feature extraction of different target regions, the proposed methods exploit proposed one-pass feature extraction processes that significantly improve the computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results on the OTB-50, OTB-100, TC-128 and VOT-2018 visual tracking datasets demonstrate that the proposed visual tracking methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods, effectively.},

  abstract     = {A dynamic texture refers to a sequence of images with regular and periodic changes in appearance from one image to another. Typical dynamic textures include burning flames, waving flags and flowing water. Given a reference dynamic texture, dynamic texture generation is meant to generate new dynamic textures that are of similar appearance to the reference one but are more diversified in terms of dynamics (i.e., periodic pattern changes). Existing dynamic texture generation algorithms may suffer from partially losing appearance information of the reference dynamic texture, resulting in such problems as structural distortion and blurred edges in the generated dynamic textures. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a structure-preserving dynamic texture generation algorithm based on a new two-stream convolutional networks model with feature reuse strategy (TSCN-FR). The proposed TSCN-FR makes use of spatial co-occurrence feature matrices to capture the spatial structure correlation of dynamic textures, thus alleviating the structural distortion and disordered color patch distribution in the generation of dynamic textures. In addition, an edge-preserving regular term, which uses the edge features of the reference dynamic texture extracted by the LoG operator, is introduced in the training of TSCN-FR to better maintain the edge structure of the reference dynamic texture. The application of our proposed method to dynamic style transferring is also presented. Experimental results have shown that our method for dynamic texture generation improves the existing methods by a clear margin on the ability to keep appearance information of the reference dynamic texture.},

  abstract     = {Among several types of fuel cells available in the market, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is characterized by low operating temperature, high efficiency and long lifetime. These advantages have prompted the PEM fuel cell to enter into several applications such as vehicle power sources, portable power and backup power applications. However, the PEM fuel cell faces several challenges due to the dependency of the output power on the operating condition like cell temperature and membrane water content. Under changing operating conditions, there is only one unique operating point for the fuel cell system with maximum output. Therefore, for better operation and optimal exploitation, the extraction of maximum power from PEM fuel cell is indispensable. This paper deals with the development golden section search (GSS)-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller for PEMFC power system. To our knowledge, this paper is a first, if modest, attempt to develop a fuel cell MPPT controller based on golden section algorithm. The proposed GSS-based MPPT has been implemented and validated on fuel cell power system composed of 7 kW PEMFC supplying a resistive load via a DC/DC boost converter controlled using the proposed MPPT. Simulation results obtained using MATLAB/Simulink show that the proposed GSS MPPT outperforms the variable step size incremental conductance one in all test cases including cell temperature and membrane water content variations in terms of static as well as dynamic performances regarding all used metrics reducing by the way the response time by 34.33\%, the overshoot and ripple by around 100\% and with neglect oscillation around MPP improving as a consequence the fuel cell efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the leaps and bounds of computer performance and the advent of the era of big data, deep learning has drawn more and more attention from all walks of life. It can combine low-level features to form more abstract high-level features and describe the data more essentially. Therefore, it is widely used in various fields such as computer vision. Image segmentation is one of the most basic research topics in the field of computer vision. The main purpose is to extract regions of interest from images for later image processing research. In 3D reconstruction based on sequence images, the segmentation accuracy and speed of sequence images determine the quality and efficiency of target reconstruction. Therefore, when facing large-scale sequence images, the biggest problem is how to improve the segmentation speed while ensuring accuracy. Based on the above background, the research content of this article is an indoor scene segmentation algorithm based on full convolutional neural network. According to the characteristics of indoor application scenes, this paper proposes a fast convolutional neural network image segmentation method to segment the indoor scene image and construct the fast fully convolutional networks (FFCN) for indoor scene image segmentation uses inter-layer fusion to reduce the amount of network calculation parameters and avoid the loss of picture feature information by continuous convolution. In order to verify the effectiveness of the network, in this paper, a basic living object data set (XAUT data set) in an indoor environment is created. The XAUT data set is used to train the FFCN network under the Caffe framework to obtain an indoor scene segmentation model. In order to compare the effectiveness of the model, the structure of the worn FCN8s, FCN16s, and FCN32s models was fine-tuned, and the corresponding algorithm model for indoor scene segmentation was obtained by training with the XAUT data set. The experimental results show that the pixel recognition accuracy of all types of networks has reached 86\%, and the mean IU ratio has reached more than 63\%. The mean IU of the FCN8s network is the highest at 70.38\%, but its segmentation speed is only 1/5 of FFCN. On the premise that other types of indicators are not much different, the average segmentation speed on FFCN fast segmentation convolutional neural network reaches 40 fps. It can be seen that the scale fusion technology can well avoid the loss of image feature information in the network convolution and reddening process. Compared with other FCN networks, it has a faster speed and is conducive to real-time image preprocessing.},

  abstract     = {A software defect report is a bug in the software system that developers and users submit to the software defect library during software development and maintenance. Managing a software defect report that is overwhelming is a challenging task. The traditional method is manual identification, which is time-consuming and laborious and delays the repair of important software defects. Based on the above background, the purpose of this paper is to study the software defect prediction (SDP) model based on LASSO–SVM. In this paper, the problem of poor prediction accuracy of most SDP models is proposed. A SDP model combining minimum absolute value compression and selection method and support vector machine algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the feature selection ability of the minimum absolute value compression and selection method is used to reduce the dimension of the original data set, and the data set not related to SDP is removed. Then, the optimal value of SVM is obtained by using the parameter optimization ability of cross-validation algorithm. Finally, the SDP is completed by the nonlinear computing ability of SVM. The accuracy of simulation results is 93.25\% and 66.67\%, recall rate is 78.04\%, and f-metric is 72.72\%. The results show that the proposed defect prediction model has higher prediction accuracy than the traditional defect prediction model, and the prediction speed is faster.},

The optimal segmentation algorithm is improved and applied to the training of RBF neural network parameters in this paper to increase the center and width of the class, and the center and width of the RBF network model are further improved.

  abstract     = {Attitude detection of cooperative robots can help robots recognize environment, understand tasks, and improve the safety, accuracy and efficiency of robot work. For robots with unknown configuration parameters, their configuration can be estimated; it is convenient for further kinematics and dynamics analysis. For an economical cooperative robot, its kinematic parameters can be corrected by attitude detection. An independent robot attitude detection system can be used as a secondary auxiliary system, and the fault diagnosis system of the robot is composed of the high-precision encoder system of the robot body. This paper studies the neural network control system of cooperative robot based on genetic algorithm. In this paper, the robot is taken as the research object. Aiming at its strong conjunction, non-linearity and multivariable characteristics, the problem of robot motion control based on neural network is mainly discussed. On this basis, the basic genetic algorithm and an improved genetic algorithm called messy are used to optimize the structure of the neural network, so as to better realize the motion control problem of the robot. The results of this study show that: After optimization with messy genetic algorithm, not only the tracking effect is better, but also the number of hidden layer nodes of the network is reduced from 12 to 7. This greatly simplifies the structure of the network and makes the design and training of the network relatively simple.},

  abstract     = {The sound quality evaluation model based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), Hilbert transform (HT) and relevance vector machine (RVM) is proposed to predict the sound quality of acoustical signals at power coupling mechanism of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The technique is applied with wave filtering and CEEMD of the acoustical signals acquired at power coupling mechanism of HEV to achieve the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. Built upon this is the calculation of the instantaneous frequencies of the IMF components by HT. Then, the critical frequency bands are used as the weight to calculate the weighted energy values of the IMF components. The weighted energy values are used as the new inputs of the sound quality evaluation model. Afterward, the subjective evaluation experiment of the acoustical signals at the power coupling mechanism is carried out based on pairwise comparison method. The subjective evaluation values are used as the outputs of the evaluation model. Finally, the new evaluation model is established based on RVM. In addition, the second RVM model is built for sound quality evaluation with the psychoacoustic objective parameters as the inputs. In this paper, the sound samples acquired under steady- and unsteady-state operating conditions are tested, respectively, in two models to obtain the prediction results. The prediction result suggests that the prediction accuracy of the evaluation model based on CEEMD-HT is higher than the evaluation model based on psychoacoustic objective parameters, and the prediction accuracy of the steady sound samples is higher than the unsteady sound samples.},

Traditional image classification methods are difficult to deal with huge image data and cannot meet people’s requirements on the accuracy and speed of image classification. In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has been developing rapidly, and it has performed extremely well. The image classification method based on CNN breaks through the bottleneck of traditional image classification methods and becomes the mainstream image classification algorithm at present. CT image classification algorithm is one of the research hot spots in the field of medical image. The purpose of this paper is to apply convolutional neural network to CT image classification, so as to speed up CT image classification and improve the accuracy of CT image classification and so as to reduce the workload of doctors and improve work efficiency. In this paper, CT images are classified by CDBN model. Vector machine SVM is used as the feature classifier of CDBN model to enhance feature transfer and reuse so as to enrich the features. It also suppresses features that are not very useful for current tasks and improves the performance of the model. Using CDBN to classify CT images, several commonly used gray images are compared. Comparing the results of the ordinary gradient algorithm with Adam algorithm, we can get the CDBN model using Adam optimization algorithm. In CT image classification, both accuracy and speed have a good effect. The experimental results show that the training speed of CDBN model of Adam optimization algorithm in CT image classification is 3\% faster than that of general gradient algorithm.},

In view of the extremely strong nonlinear processing power, self-organization, self-adaptation and learning ability of wavelet neural network (WNN), this paper uses it as the basic prediction model and uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm for the slow convergence rate and local optimal problem of WNN prediction algorithm. With the advantages of fast convergence, high robustness and strong global search ability, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the wavelet neural network prediction model. The improved wavelet neural network is used to predict short-term traffic flow. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the WNN and PSO–WNN algorithms alone.

  abstract     = {Internet is a new type of information exchange tool that has developed with the times. Now, it has been integrated into all aspects of our study and life. At the same time, in the era of the rise of social media, there are more and more platforms on the Internet. A variety of critical texts have also exploded in these platforms. In these opinions and comments, the subjective opinions of the presenters are included, and the emotional tendencies of the commenters are expressed. Nowadays, subjective text information resources are huge. One of the major problems to be solved by management objects facing information management is how to manage them effectively so that users can quickly and accurately find the required information. Therefore, classifying these text tendencies and mining the potential value in the text has broad application prospects. Based on the text granularity and processing efficiency, this paper conducts multi-granularity emotional block partitioning on network texts and compares the sentiment analysis under different granularities. Furthermore, a random subspace integrated learning text sentiment classification method based on BPSO (binary particle swarm optimization) is proposed to analyze text orientation. By simulating news site comments and e-commerce website reviews such as Taobao, the convergence analysis of BPSO in the optimization of the number of base classifiers shows that the BPSO algorithm can be applied to the random subspace method well, and the accuracy of the classification results is high.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a two degree of freedom lower-limb exoskeleton (LLE) design control is developed to reduce the fatigue level of healthy people and increase their load-carrying capacity. The LLE robot system is designed by comparing it to the twin-double pendulum system. One of the twin pendulums models is the human leg (with a knee and hip joint), and the other twin pendulum model is the exoskeleton robot. The movement of the human knee and hip joints in a walking pattern is recreated with a joint angle generator and applied to the joints with the help of a linear motor. The exoskeleton robot is provided to follow the movements of the leg with the help of a fuzzy controller. The control simulation with the mathematical model of the twin-double pendulum system and the fuzzy logic method was made using the MATLAB/Simulink program. The system response was analyzed and graphed for two different limb sizes (45 cm and 50 cm) and three different load conditions (no load, 25 Nm and 75 Nm). The maximum tracking errors are 3.2105° and 3.4730° for the hip and knee joint, respectively, with a 75 Nm load disturbance condition. These tracking error values can be interpreted as very low with high tracking success. The FL controller is robust to load changing and limb size-changing factors, and for this reason, it was suitable for use in LLEs.},

  abstract     = {Conjunctive management of surface–groundwater resources systems by means of mathematical optimization–simulation techniques becomes an important issue for sustainable water resources development, namely in water-scarce regions. In this study, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method has been coupled with a hybrid wavelet/ANFIS–fuzzy C-means (FCM) simulation model to determine the optimal agricultural irrigation water allocation in the Miandarband plain, western Iran. Firstly, the optimal amount of conveyed water (CW) from the Gavoshan Dam into the plain is determined by constrained PSO. The constraints are the long-term minimum monthly exceedance streamflows that are estimated for different exceedance probabilities—with a 70\% value found to best reflect the average annual river inflow of 3.4 m3/s into the dam—using the two-parameter Weibull distribution as well as the classical Weibull nonparametric plotting position method. Then, based on the politically prioritized proportions of the dam’s allocated water for domestic, environmental and agricultural uses, as well as the share of the plain devoted to  agriculture, the optimal monthly CW available for the plain (= 112 MCM/a) is obtained. However, the subsequent estimation of the irrigation water request (IWR) (= 265.8 MCM/a), calculated by the FAO-56 method and using empirical crop coefficients of the present agricultural pattern in the plain, indicates that there is an irrigation water deficit of 153.1 MCM/a that must be made up by groundwater withdrawal (GW), in a way that neither waterlogging nor severe drop conditions in groundwater levels (GL) will occur. The latter are then calculated by the hybrid wavelet/ANFIS (FCM) model, wherefore good performance indicators R2 and RMSE, equal to 0.98 and 0.21 m and 0.94 and 0.31 m in the training and testing phases, respectively, are obtained. Finally, PSO and the hybrid model are coupled to simulate the GL fluctuations—with the above GL constraints—under conjunctive use of the optimal surface (CW) and groundwater resources (GW) in the Miandarband plain. In conclusion, the innovative coupled simulation/optimization model turns out to be a very useful tool for optimal and sustainable conjunctive management of surface–groundwater resources in an irrigation area.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have evolved as popular machine learning models for image classification during the past few years, due to their ability to learn the problem-specific features directly from the input images. The success of deep learning models solicits architecture engineering rather than hand-engineering the features. However, designing state-of-the-art CNN for a given task remains a non-trivial and challenging task, especially when training data size is less. To address this phenomena, transfer learning has been used as a popularly adopted technique. While transferring the learned knowledge from one task to another, fine-tuning with the target-dependent fully connected (FC) layers generally produces better results over the target task. In this paper, the proposed AutoFCL model attempts to learn the structure of FC layers of a CNN automatically using Bayesian Optimization. To evaluate the performance of the proposed AutoFCL, we utilize five pre-trained CNN models such as VGG-16, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and NASNetMobile. The experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely CalTech-101, Oxford-102 Flowers, and UC Merced Land Use datasets. Fine-tuning the newly learned (target-dependent) FC layers leads to state-of-the-art performance, according to the experiments carried out in this research. The proposed AutoFCL method outperforms the existing methods over CalTech-101 and Oxford-102 Flowers datasets by achieving the accuracy of $$94.38\%$$ and $$98.89\%$$ , respectively. However, our method achieves comparable performance on the UC Merced Land Use dataset with $$96.83\%$$ accuracy. The source code of this research is available at https://github.com/shabbeersh/AutoFCL .},

  abstract     = {Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) is a major mechanical parameter of the rock which has an essential role in developing geomechanical models. It can be estimated directly by lab testing of retrieved core samples or from well log data. These methods are very expensive and require huge efforts and time. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new technique for predicting UCS values in real-time. In this study, three artificial intelligence (AI) models were developed using artificial intelligence tools; artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM) to predict UCS of the downhole formations while drilling based on real-time recording of the drilling mechanical parameters. These parameters include rate of penetration (ROP), mud pumping rate (GPM), stand-pipe pressure (SPP), rotary speed in revolution per minute (RPM), torque (T), and weight on bit (WOB). A dataset of 1771 points from a Middle Eastern field was used to build the developed models: for training and testing processes. A new UCS correlation was developed based on the optimized AI model. Another set of data (2175 data points unseen by the model) was used to validate the model and the developed UCS correlation. The developed ANN-model outperformed the ANFIS- and SVM-models with a correlation coefficient (R-value) of 0.99 and an average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 3.48\% between the predicted and actual UCS values. The new UCS correlation outperformed the available correlations for UCS prediction and it was able to predict the UCS with AAPE of 4.2\% compared to the actual UCS values.},

They are either not accurate, time-consuming in training or error accumulative. In this paper, we propose a method consisting of two camera pose estimators that deal with the information from pairwise images and a short sequence of images, respectively. For image sequences, a transformer-like structure is adopted to build a geometry model over a local temporal window, referred to as transformer-based auxiliary pose estimator (TAPE). Meanwhile, a flow-to-flow pose estimator (F2FPE) is proposed to exploit the relationship between pairwise images. The two estimators are constrained through a simple yet effective consistency loss in training. Empirical evaluation has shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning-based methods by a large margin and performs comparably to supervised and traditional ones on the KITTI and Malaga dataset.},

The battery usage data is processed with the ConvLSTM model to predict every 30 min of the next 24-h remaining battery capacity of the smartphone. Then, the rate of power consumption is calculated for each hour interval according to predicted values of the remaining battery capacity. Depending upon the rates of power consumption, the value of numeric features (screen brightness, media volume, etc.) is reduced and non-numeric features (GPS, Wi-Fi, etc.) are turned off. Our approach saved much power at some time interval, besides saved up to 21\% power saving overall. The performances of CNN, RNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM, and ARIMA were also evaluated.

  abstract     = {The recently proposed network model, Operational Neural Networks (ONNs), can generalize the conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are homogenous only with a linear neuron model. As a heterogenous network model, ONNs are based on a generalized neuron model that can encapsulate any set of non-linear operators to boost diversity and to learn highly complex and multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training data. However, the default search method to find optimal operators in ONNs, the so-called Greedy Iterative Search (GIS) method, usually takes several training sessions to find a single operator set per layer. This is not only computationally demanding, also the network heterogeneity is limited since the same set of operators will then be used for all neurons in each layer. To address this deficiency and exploit a superior level of heterogeneity, in this study the focus is drawn on searching the best-possible operator set(s) for the hidden neurons of the network based on the “Synaptic Plasticity” paradigm that poses the essential learning theory in biological neurons. During training, each operator set in the library can be evaluated by their synaptic plasticity level, ranked from the worst to the best, and an “elite” ONN can then be configured using the top-ranked operator sets found at each hidden layer. Experimental results over highly challenging problems demonstrate that the elite ONNs even with few neurons and layers can achieve a superior learning performance than GIS-based ONNs and as a result, the performance gap over the CNNs further widens.},

Therefore, it is essential to inform people before disasters occurring to prevent and warn of abnormal conditions. In this paper, a deep learning approach was used to predict arterial events over the course of a few weeks/months prior to the event using a 5-min electrocardiogram (ECG) recording and extracting time–frequency features of ECG signals. Considering the possibility of learning long-term dependencies to identify and prevent these events as quickly as possible, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used. A Deep Belief Network (DBN) was also used to represent and select more efficient and effective features of the recorded dataset. This approach is briefly called LSTM-DBN. Four publicly available datasets in the field of health care were used to evaluate the proposed approach. These data were collected from wearable heart rate monitoring sensors along with demographic features in the context of the Internet of Things. The prediction results of the proposed LSTM-DBN were compared with other deep learning approaches (simple RNN, GRU, CNN and Ensemble), and traditional classification approaches (MLP, SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest). In addition, DBN performance was compared with other methods of feature selection and representation such as PCA and AutoEncoder. Experimental results showed that the proposed LSTM-DBN (88.42\% mean accuracy) had significantly better performance in comparison with all other deep learning approaches and traditional classifications.},

Conventional fire smoke methods using static features extracted form single image directly cannot handle some disturbed factors exist in forest, such as shaking trees and fog/haze. On the other hand, it is difficult to capture the dynamic features of fire smoke while they are vital for fire smoke detection. This paper proposes an effective method of extracting features based on sequential images for smoke detection, quasi-dynamic features are extracted using on pixel-block arranged image sets. First, consecutive frames are rearranged into a new big image based on a pixel-block rule, so that the new image still keep the whole structure of original image on block level, and the change of different pixels in the same block, which comes from the same position of each frame, can reflect the dynamic features by special process. Second, to process the new arranged big image, driven by single image wavelet transform for denoting local signal characteristics, Dual Tree-Complex Wavelet Transform is utilized to decompose the new big image into eight images with the same size of the source image after several level-decomposition, including four directions (HH, HL, LH, LL) with two decomposed images in each direction, so that the changes from smoke in different orientation can be extracted and depicted in these subbands. Third, a multi-scale dictionary learning method is proposed to learn dictionaries of each group images. Furthermore, elastic net is introduced for sparse coding and feature coefficients extraction. All operations above contribute to a significant improvement for smoke detection in this paper. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

First of all, we built an array of linearly coupled MIDNNs. Second, by using linear matrix inequality, Lyapunov function, comparison principle, and an extended Halanay differential inequality, we derived some conclusions which rely on impulses effects and periodically intermittent control insures the global exponential synchronization of the coupled MIDNNs.

Meanwhile, these designed controllers guarantee the synchronization of the CCNs in a given time. The estimated settling time improves corresponding results in the literature. Furthermore, based on rigorous mathematical proof and the structured comparison system, several FDT synchronization criteria are obtained.

  abstract     = {Associative memory and filling-in are two essential functions of the human brain. To implement these two brain-inspired functions in hardware, we proposed a memristor-based bidirectional associative memory (BAM) circuit in this paper. This circuit combines an online algorithm with a memristor array adjustment process, thus makes the circuit more universal for various tasks. The proposed circuit is constructed out of memristive synaptic circuits, IN modules and ACT modules. The memristive synaptic circuits utilize memristor arrays to represent weight matrix and operate corresponding operations hence make computing-in-memory and process information in parallel, which simplifies the complexity of circuit and improves the processing speed. The IN modules employ transistors as switches to choose the input layer hence can get initial information flow bidirectionally. The ACT modules perform activation function and can output continuous arbitrary real numbers. Thereby, both binary and gray-scale images can be tested in the proposed circuit. In addition to the hetero-association and filling-in results given in detail, the retrieval rates of the proposed circuit with the impact of different degrees of noise and the number of stored patterns are also evaluated and compared with software-based BAM. The simulation has experimented via MATLAB and PSpice, and the corresponding results show a remarkable performance of the proposed circuit. The influence of memristor’s stuck-at-fault is also considered. In comparison with software-based BAM and similar memristor-based neural network circuit, the proposed circuit performs better in processing speed.},

The interpretability of the model is significantly improved by the proposed Pythagorean fuzzy LASSO regression model (PFLRM). Thus, a system reliability analysis is considered as an application of the study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed PFLRM. There is no doubt that a system reliability analysis is vital to improve the safety performance of chemical processing industries, where an extensive number of industrial accidents occur annually. These accidents have subsequently highlighted the failure of some of the intervention actions to keep the systems safely in operation.

A learning algorithm is developed using the combination of Lyapunov stability and dynamic back-propagation method and is applied to derive the stable parameter adjustment equations. The performance evaluation of the proposed DRFLNN model is done by comparing it with the multi-layer perceptron (consisting of a single hidden layer), radial basis function network, Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN), nonlinear auto-regressive moving average, and the conventional functional link neural network. Three benchmark systems have been used on which all these models are applied. From the results, it is found that ERNN provided better prediction accuracy as compared to the remaining models and the second-best accuracy is obtained from the proposed model. Further, the ERNN model is more complex and offers more parameters to be tuned as compared to the DRFLNN model. Thus, the training of the ERNN model is quite difficult as compared to the DRFLNN.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the effect of two water-reducer polymers with smooth and rough surfaces on the workability, and the compression strength of concrete from an early age (1 day) up to 28 days of curing was investigated. The polymer contents used in this study varied from 0 to 0.25\% (wt\%). The initial ratio between water and cement ( $$ \frac{w}{c} $$ ) was 60\%, and it slowly reduced to 0.46 by increasing the polymer contents. The compression strength of concrete was increased significantly with increasing the polymer contents by 24–95\% depending on the polymer type, polymer content, $$ \frac{w}{c} $$ , and curing age. Because of a fiber net (netting) in the concrete when the polymers were added which leads to a decrease void between the particles, binding the cement particles, therefore, increased rapidly the viscosity for the fresh concrete and the compression strength of the hardened concrete. This study also aims to establish systematic multiscale models to predict the compression strength of concrete containing polymers and to be used by the construction projects with no theoretical restrictions. For that purpose, 88 concrete samples modified with two types of polymer (44 samples for each modification) has been tested, analyzed, and modeled. Linear, nonlinear regression, M5P-tree, and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches were used for the qualifications. In the modeling process, the most relevant parameters affect the strength of concrete, i.e., polymer incorporation ratio (0–0.25\% of cement’s mass), water-to-cement ratio (0.46–0.6), and curing ages (1–28 days). Among the used approaches and based on the training data set, the model made based on the nonlinear regression, ANN, and M5P-tree models seem to be the most reliable models. The sensitivity investigation concludes that the curing time is the most dominating parameter for the prediction of the maximum stress (compression strength) of concrete with this dataset.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing a large number of features set for the classification process entails cost and complexity. To reduce this burden, dimensionality reduction has been applied to the extracted set of features as a preprocessing step. Among dimensionality reduction algorithms, many methods fail to handle high-dimensional data and they increase information loss and are sensitive to outliers. Therefore, this research proposes a new supervised dimensionality reduction method developed using an improved formation of linear discriminant analysis with diagonal eigenvalues (LDA-DE) that simultaneously preserves the information and addresses the issues of the classification process. The proposed framework focuses on reducing the dimension of extracted features set by computing the scattered matrices from the class labels and the diagonal eigenvalue matrix. Methods to eliminate duplicate rows and columns, to avoid feature overwriting, and to remove outliers are included in the newly developed LDA-DE method. The new LDA-DE method implemented with a fuzzy random forest classifier is tested on two datasets—MIO-TCD and BIT-Vehicle—to classify the moving vehicles. The performance of our LDA-DE method is compared with five state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods. The experimental confusion matrix results show that the LDA-DE method generates the reduced feature vector of the objects to a maximum extent. Further, the newly developed LDA-DE method achieves the best reduction results with optimal performance parameter values (lowest mean and standard deviation and highest f-measure and accuracy) and minimal data processing time than the state-of-the-art methods, promising its application for a fast and effective dimensionality reduction for moving vehicle classification.},

This article presents a nonparametric machine learning algorithm that combines the gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) model and an improved differential evolution algorithm (L-SHADE) for better understanding and control of the algal abnormal proliferation (usually estimated from Chlorophyll-a and Total Phosphorus concentrations) from physicochemical and biological variable values obtained in a northern Spain reservoir. This L-SHADE technique involves the optimization of the GBRT hyperparameters during the training process. Apart from successfully estimating algal atypical growth (coefficients of determination equal to 0.91 and 0.93 for Chlorophyll-a and Total Phosphorus concentrations were obtained, respectively), this hybrid model allows here to establish the ranking of each independent biological and physicochemical variable according to its importance in the algal enhanced growth.},

This is a common protocol when inspecting passenger baggage particularly at airports. Unfortunately, the accuracy of such human inspection is around 80–90\%, under optimal operator conditions. For this reason, it is quite necessary to assist human inspectors with the aid of computer vision algorithms. This work proposes a deep learning-based methodology designed to detect threat objects in (single spectrum) X-ray baggage scan images. For this purpose, our proposed framework simulates a large number of X-ray images, using a combination of PGGAN (Karras et al. in International conference on learning representations, 2018. https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk99zCeAb ) and superimposition (Mery and Katsaggelos in 2017 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops (CVPRW), 2017. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2017.37 ) strategies, that are used to train state-of-the-art detection models such as YOLO (Redmon et al. in You only look once: unified, real-time object detection. CoRR abs/1506.02640, 2015. http://arxiv.org/ abs/1506.02640 ), SSD (Liu et al. in SSD: single shot multibox detector.

Our method has been tested on real X-ray images in the detection of four categories of threat objects: guns, knives, razor blades and shuriken (ninja stars). In our experiments, YOLOv3 (Redmon and Farhadi in Yolov3: An incremental improvement. CoRR abs/1804.02767, 2018. http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767 ) obtained the best mean average precision (mAP) with 96.3\% for guns, 76.2\% for knives, 86.9\% for razor blades and 93.7\% for shuriken, while the average mAP for all threat objects was 80.0\%. We believe the effectiveness of our method in the detection of threat objects makes its use in checkpoints possible. Moreover, our methodology is scalable and can be easily extended to detect other categories automatically.},

  abstract     = {Timing belt rupture, which can develop quickly and cause severe harm to various engine components, usually occurs unexpectedly and without prior warning signs. Due to the rapid occurrence of timing belt rupture, fault diagnosis strategies are not indeed efficient. In this paper, a vibration-based intelligent method has been proposed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the timing belt using data mining techniques and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN). To achieve this goal, two categories of experimental tests were designed and carried out on the timing belt, namely, fault thresholding (FT) and accelerated life (AL) tests. FT test was performed by comparing the defect-free belt vibration signals with those of a faulty belt to determine the failure threshold. This is while, in the AL test, the engine was continuously run with a defect-free timing belt until initiation of rupture or damage was detected. Four feature functions, regarded as timing belt health indicators, were applied to the collected vibration signals, namely, energy, impulse factor, root mean square, and FM4. The extracted features were then fed to the MLP-NN to predict the timing belt RUL by continuously comparing the feature values and the failure threshold. The results showed that the proposed method is able to predict the timing belt RUL with an accuracy of 90\%. In addition, data predicted by the MLP-NN showed high correlation with the actual measured data, which emphasizes the robustness and precision of the proposed method for timing belt RUL prediction.},

To meet this challenge, we propose novel approaches involving quantum genetic algorithm and support vector machines. The first method uses the quantum genetic algorithm to solve a multilevel thresholding problem based on Tsallis entropy. In the second method, the support vector machines are trained, in different ways, on a simulated image in order to be able to detect breast cancer edge.

  abstract     = {Interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets are efficient to denote the hesitant and uncertain judgments of decision makers. To further research the utilization of this type of fuzzy sets, this paper limits to study group decision making (GDM) with interval-valued hesitant fuzzy preference relations (IVHFPRs). First, an additive consistency index is defined for interval fuzzy preference relations, by which we derive a new acceptable additive consistency concept for IVHFPRs. Then, new models based on acceptable additive consistency are built for ascertaining unknown values, and new models for judging the acceptable additive consistency of IVHFPRs are constructed. When the consistency of IVHFPRs is unacceptable, new models based on consistency and uncertain degree are constructed for obtaining acceptable additive consistency IVHFPRs that can ensure the smallest total adjustment and the minimum number of adjusted intervals. For GDM case, a new consensus index is defined to measure the agreement degree of individual judgments. When the consensus level does not satisfy requirement, new models for reaching the additive consistency and consensus requirements are built. Furthermore, a new acceptable additive consistency- and consensus-based algorithm for GDM with incomplete and unacceptable additive consistency IVHFPRs is provided. Finally, an example is given to indicate the utilization of the new algorithm and comparison analysis is made.},

  abstract     = {Automatic modulation classification is an essential and challenging topic in the development of cognitive radios, and it is the cornerstone of adaptive modulation and demodulation abilities to sense and learn surrounding environments and make corresponding decisions. In this paper, we propose a spectrum interference-based two-level data augmentation method in deep learning for automatic modulation classification. Since the frequency variation over time is the most important distinction between radio signals with various modulation schemes, we plan to expand samples by introducing different intensities of interference to the spectrum of radio signals. The original signal is first transformed into the frequency domain by using short-time Fourier transform, and the interference to the spectrum can be realized by bidirectional noise masks that satisfy the specific distribution. The augmented signals can be reconstructed through inverse Fourier transform based on the interfered spectrum, and then, the original and augmented signals are fed into the network. Finally, data augmentation at both training and testing stages can be used to improve the generalization performance of deep neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that radio signals are augmented to help modulation classification by considering the frequency domain information. Moreover, we have proved that data augmentation at the test stage can be interpreted as model ensemble. By comparing with a variety of data augmentation techniques and state-of-the-art modulation classification methods on the public dataset RadioML 2016.10a, experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and advancement of proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial domain adaptation is a powerful approach to transfer the knowledge of the label-rich source domain to the label-scarce target domain by mitigating domain shifts across distributions. Existing domain adaptation methods align either the marginal distribution with a single-domain discriminator or conditional distributions with multiple-domain discriminators. However, aligning both marginal (global) and conditional (local) distributions should be considered for domain adaptation. This paper proposes a novel adversarial distribution adaptation network (ADAN) to jointly reduce both the global and local distribution discrepancies between different domains for learning domain-invariant representations. ADAN utilizes a single-domain discriminator to adapt the global distribution between two domains, and source decision boundaries to align the local distributions between sub-domains. Furthermore, we extend our ADAN as improved ADAN (iADAN), in which we utilize a feature norm term to regularize the task-specific features to improve model generalization. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on Office-Home and ImageCLEF-DA datasets.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition applications focus on local features to prevent detailed information from being omitted while the feature extraction processes. This paper is based on presenting a local pattern-based model to extract more discriminative features that lead to more accurate classification. In local pattern-based feature extraction, the LBP is one of the most important approaches that many variants of this method have been proposed till now. LBP calculation is based on differences between the central pixel and the desired one. In contrast, the information hidden in the selected pixel’s neighborhood pixels is not included in this process. This paper proposes the DR_LBP approach to address this failure by defining distances and using some of them in a ratio form. Successful results have been earned in many experimental results. In LBP, the calculations’ primary flow takes advantage of two pixels in the LBP box, the central and the desired pixel. Contrary to the original LBP, this paper’s proposed approach uses three pixels of LBP box to conduct the feature vector, which leads to employing the information hidden in the relationship between neighboring pixels. This approach applies the experiments on two standard datasets, ORL Yale face and Faces94 dataset. The accuracy percent of the proposed plan is 95.95, 94.09 and 98.01 on ORL, Yale face and Faces94 dataset, respectively, which is the reason to present this model as a new face feature extraction approach.},

In this work, we address this problem, defined here as the estimation of both vertical (tilt/pitch) and horizontal (pan/yaw) angles, through the use of a single Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) model, trying to balance precision and inference speed in order to maximize its usability in real-world applications. Our model is trained over the combination of two datasets: ‘Pointing’04’ (aiming at covering a wide range of poses) and ‘Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild’ (in order to improve robustness of our model for its use on real-world images). Three different partitions of the combined dataset are defined and used for training, validation and testing purposes. As a result of this work, we have obtained a trained ConvNet model, coined RealHePoNet, that given a low-resolution grayscale input image, and without the need of using facial landmarks, is able to estimate with low error both tilt and pan angles ( $$~4.4^{\circ }$$ average error on the test partition). Also, given its low inference time (6 ms per head), we consider our model usable even when paired with medium-spec hardware (i.e. GTX 1060 GPU).

  abstract     = {As the role of blockchain technology in various industries becomes more and more important, the technical limitations of its consensus mechanism, private key management and smart contracts are gradually emerging. However, security events such as blockchain platform applications are emerging one after another. As a new round of transformative power in the network era, it combines the blockchain with existing technologies to generate new formats and new models. Technology applications and existing cybersecurity regulatory policies have brought new challenges. This paper analyzes the typical application architecture of blockchain technology, and analyzes the security risks of blockchain application architecture from key layers such as storage layer, protocol layer, extension layer, and application layer. This article combines the DOC mechanism with IOT application scenarios to propose a blockchain-based confidential IOT service model (Beekeeper 1.0) that supports first-order homomorphic multiplication, and a blockchain-based confidential IOT service model that supports high-order homomorphic multiplication (Beekeeper 2.0), Beekeeper 2.0 significantly improves Beekeeper 1.0 in server capabilities, verification efficiency, verification key length, and device work diversity. This article finds that the chain code call delay basically increases with the increase in the transaction sending rate. When the transaction sending rate reaches 300TPS, the chain code calling delay only increases a little, and when the transaction sending rate reaches 300TPS, the success rate of the transaction on the chain increases. Finally, the average blockchain access delay increases with the increase in the transaction sending rate. The blockchain access delay is affected by less throughput, and the transaction success rate is stable at 98\%.},

This paper figures a predictive model for detecting neurodegenerative diseases like glaucoma, Parkinson’s disease and carcinogenic diseases like breast cancer. The proposed approach focuses on enhancing the efficiency of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using a modified glowworm swarm optimization algorithm (M-GSO). This algorithm is a global optimization wrapper approach that simulates the collective behavior of glowworms in nature during food search. However, it still suffers from being trapped in local minima. Hence in order to improve glowworm swarm optimization algorithm, differential evolution (DE) algorithm is utilized to enhance the behavior of glowworms. The proposed (DE–GSO–ANFIS) approach estimates suitable prediction parameters of ANFIS by employing DE–GSO algorithm. The outcomes of the proposed model are compared with traditional ANFIS model, genetic algorithm-ANFIS (GA-ANFIS), particle swarm optimization-ANFIS (PSO-ANFIS), lion optimization algorithm-ANFIS (LOA-ANFIS), differential evolution-ANFIS (DE-ANFIS) and glowworm swarm optimization (GSO). Experimental results depict better performance and superiority of the DE–GSO–ANFIS over the similar methods in predicting medical disorders.},

These changes affect directly or indirectly the stock market prices which makes forecasting a challenging task. So, the need for reliable, cost-effective, and accurate forecasting models significantly arises to reduce risk and uncertainty in stock market investment. Different time series models have been proposed by data scientists and researchers for accurate prediction of the future with the least errors. Econometric autoregressive time series models such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have established forecasting models capable of generating accurate forecasts. Wavelet methods, being capable of handling nonlinear data, combined with autoregressive models generate more accurate forecasts. In this present study, soft computing models of discreet wavelet transformation and wavelet denoising combined with autoregressive models are developed to forecast the weekly and daily closing prices of the BSE100 S&amp;P Sensex index. Statistical error analysis of the forecasting outcomes of coupled models has been made to evaluate the performance of the prediction of these models. The prediction results reveal that soft computing methods coupled with autoregressive models (wavelet-ARIMA and wavelet denoise-ARIMA) generate considerably accurate forecasts as compared to baseline models (simple regression, ARMA and ARIMA models) and coupled models (wavelet-ARMA and wavelet denoise-ARMA models).},

We use a range of classification methods, and although other methods may have higher overall accuracy, we see that due to our unbalanced dataset, RUS Boosted trees ensemble has the highest sensitivity for this application (highest performance for the late PD class).

The goal of the present paper is in the contribution to this topic by (1) analysis of accelerometric signals recorded by wearable sensors located at specific body positions and by (2) implementation of deep learning methods to classify signal features. This paper uses the general methodology to analysis of accelerometric signals acquired during cycling at different routes followed by the global positioning system. The experimental dataset includes 850 observations that were recorded by a mobile device in the spine area (L3 verterbra) for cycling routes with the different slope. The proposed methodology includes the use of deep learning convolutional neural networks with five layers applied to signal values transformed into the frequency domain without specification of any signal features. The accuracy of discrimination between different motion patterns for the uphill and downhill cycling and recognition of 4 classes associated with different route slopes was 96.6\% with the loss criterion of 0.275 for sigmoidal activation functions. These results were compared with those evaluated for selected sets of features estimated for each observation and classified by the support vector machine, Bayesian methods, and the two-layer neural network. The best cross-validation error of 0.361 was achieved for the two-layer neural network model with the sigmoidal and softmax transfer functions. Our methodology suggests that deep learning neural networks are efficient in the assessment of motion activities for automated data processing and have a wide range of applications, including rehabilitation, early diagnosis of neurological problems, and possible use in engineering as well.},

In our previous work, we experimented with a new type of learning applicable to all convolutional neural networks: classification based on missing (low-impact) features. In the case of partial inputs/image occlusion, we have shown that our new method creates models that are more robust and perform better when compared to traditional models of the same architecture.

  abstract     = {One of the most important problems in teleoperation systems is time delay and packet loss in the communication channel, which can affect transparency and stability. One way to overcome the time delay effects in a teleoperation system is to predict the master-side motion. In this way, when data is received in the slave side, it will be considered as the current position of the master robot and, thus, complete transparency could be achieved. The majority of the previous works regarding operator position prediction have considered known and constant time delay in the system; however, in the real applications, time delay is unknown and variable. In this paper, an adaptive online prediction approach based on artificial neural network (NN) is proposed. The time delay of the communication channel is estimated using an observer based on the dynamics of the master and slave sides. Then an artificial NN predicts the master-side motion based on the current available data of the master robot and the variable time delay estimated by the observer. This adaptive prediction approach is utilized in simulations and experiments on Phantom Omni haptic devices. The simulation results indicate the feasibility of this approach. It is revealed that this approach can predict an alternative human’s hand motion in a teleoperation system with unknown and variable time delay. Finally, the simulation results would be supported by experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The sensing quality is critical for crowdsensing networks. However, it is still challenging to achieve reliable and accurate quantification on sensing quality. As most existing methods only quantify individual-level sensing quality, they cannot be simply extended to measure network-level sensing quality. Meanwhile, there are two critical challenges for the non-trivial quantifications of network-level sensing quality. First, it is quite daunting to accurately measure the sensing quality, due to the uncertainties in crowdsensing, such as random noise in sensing data and complicated inference of information. Second, it is incredibly difficult to conduct repeatable experiments for multiple times, with the natural dynamics of crowdsensing networks as well as the uncontrollable behaviors of crowdsensing participants. To address the above challenges, in this work, we devise a novel quantification metric to measure the uncertain sensing quality of crowdsensing networks. The proposed metric is based on the confidence interval, exploiting the asymptotic normality property of unbiased estimations. We further leverage the Fisher information in crowdsensing data and successfully derive the confidence interval without redundant multiple computations on repeated experiments. The trace-driven evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve remarkably accurate quantifications on the network-level sensing quality, outperforming the existing works.},

  abstract     = {Due to continued growth in both cyberattacks and network data size, organizations need to develop advanced ways to keep their networks and data secure the dynamic nature of evolving malicious attacks. Nowadays, large number of security mechanisms are installed in the network but it opens the possibility for adversaries to conduct malicious activity in the computer network. To detect potential attacks, intrusion detection systems are important security tools that can help to increase the security posture of computer network. In order to identify new malicious or anomalous attacks, this study developed an opposition self-adaptive grasshopper optimization algorithm based on mutation and perceptive concept. Moreover, reinforcement learning is utilized in support vector machine, named gain actor critic with support vector machine to increase the detection capabilities by identifying new cyberattacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on standard intrusion detection datasets such as NSL-KDD, AWID and CIC-IDS 2017 to measure the performance of the proposed method. It can more reliably detect and classify modern attacks with high accuracy and low false-positive rate. The comparative simulation results demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is more capable than basic grasshopper optimization algorithm and other used evolutionary techniques in terms of detection rate, false-positive rate and accuracy for solving IDS problems. The proposed model has provided high detection rate of 99.71\%, accuracy of 99.23\% and low false-positive rate of 0.009 in NSL-KDD with six optimal features; in AWID data, high detection rate of 99.11\%, accuracy of 99.15\% and low false-positive rate of 0.091 with eight optimal features, and high detection rate of 99.61\%, accuracy of 99.35\% and low false-positive rate of 0.052 in CIC-IDS 2017 data with eight optimal features.},

Pairwise distances in this Riemannian space, calculated along geodesic paths, can be used to generate a similarity map of the data. The novelty in the paper is twofold; to improve the methodology for visualisation of data structures in low-dimensional manifolds, and to illustrate the value of inferring the structure from a probabilistic classifier by metric learning, through application to music data. This leads to the discovery of new structures and song similarities beyond the original genre classification labels. These similarities are not directly observable by measuring Euclidean distances between features of the original space, but require the correct metric to reflect similarity based on genre. The results quantify the extent to which music from bands typically associated with one particular genre can, in fact, crossover strongly to another genre.},

Hesitant fuzzy N-soft sets are a functional improvement in hesitant fuzzy sets with the practical spirit of N-soft sets. This analytical model accommodates the hesitant situations with evaluations by grades (e.g., in terms of star ratings) and partial degrees of membership. In this article, we approach the problem of selecting alternatives that are described by this model. We advocate for the use of an adapted form of the ELECTRE-II method, that we describe under the name “hesitant fuzzy N-soft ELECTRE-II method.” With the aim of designing this novel method, we first characterize the notion of hesitant fuzzy N-soft concordance and discordance sets and then construct strong and weak outranking relation, which allow us to rank the objects of the reference set. A practical example concerning the ranking of hotels based on star ratings is fully developed in order to illustrate the applicability of this method. Furthermore, an exhaustive comparison with the hesitant fuzzy N-soft ELECTRE-I and bipolar fuzzy ELECTRE-I methods is performed.},

Traditional insect identification and classification methods are time-consuming and require entomologist experts. Early information about the attack of insects helps farmers to control the crop damage to improve the productivity and reduce the use of pesticides. This research work focuses on the classification of crop insects by applying machine vision and knowledge-based techniques with image processing by using different feature descriptors including texture, color, shape, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and global image descriptor (GIST). A combination of all these features was used in the classification of insects. In this research, several machine learning algorithms including both base classifiers and ensemble classifiers were applied for three different insect datasets and the performances of classification results were evaluated by majority voting. Naive bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) were used as base classifiers. Ensemble classifiers include random forest (RF), bagging and XGBoost were utilized; 10-fold cross-validation test was conducted to achieve a better classification and identification of insects. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy is improved by majority voting with ensemble classifiers in the combination of texture, color, shape, HOG and GIST features.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problem is a key factor for stable and secure operation of the electric power systems. In this paper, a newly explored nature-inspired optimization through artificial ecosystem optimization (AEO) algorithm is proposed to cope with ORPD problem in large-scale and practical power systems. ORPD is a well-known highly complex combinatorial optimization task with nonlinear characteristics, and its complexity increases as a number of decision variables increase, which makes it hard to be solved using conventional optimization techniques. However, it can be efficiently resolved by using nature-inspired optimization algorithms. AEO algorithm is a recently invented optimizer inspired by the energy flocking behavior in a natural ecosystem including non-living elements such as sunlight, water, and air. The main merit of this optimizer is its high flexibility that leads to achieve accurate balance between exploration and exploitation abilities. Another attractive property of AEO is that it does not have specific control parameters to be adjusted. In this work, three-objective version of ORPD problem is considered involving active power losses minimization and voltage deviation and voltage stability index. The proposed optimizer was examined on medium- and large-scale IEEE test systems, including 30 bus, 118 bus, 300 bus and Algerian electricity grid DZA 114 bus (220/60 kV). The results of AEO algorithm are compared with well-known existing optimization techniques. Also, the results of comparison show that the proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms for all examined power systems. Consequently, we confirm the effectiveness of the introducing AEO algorithm to relieve the over losses problem, enhance power system performance, and meet solutions feasibility. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been employed to evaluate the performance and consistency of the proposed AEO algorithm in solving ORPD problem.},

  abstract     = {Radiology plays a vital role in health care by viewing the human body for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of medical problems. In radiology practice, radiologists routinely examine medical images such as chest X-rays and describe their findings in the form of radiology reports. However, this task of reading medical images and summarising its insights is time consuming, tedious, and error-prone, which often represents a bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis process. A computer-aided diagnosis system which can automatically generate radiology reports from medical images can be of great significance in reducing workload, reducing diagnostic errors, speeding up clinical workflow, and helping to alleviate any shortage of radiologists. Existing research in radiology report generation focuses on generating the concatenation of the findings and impression sections. Also, existing work ignores important differences between normal and abnormal radiology reports. The text of normal and abnormal reports differs in style and it is difficult for a single model to learn both the text style and learn to transition from findings to impression. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a Show, Tell and Summarise model that first generates findings from chest X-rays and then summarises them to provide impression section. The proposed work generates the findings and impression sections separately, overcoming the limitation of previous research. Also, we use separate models for generating normal and abnormal radiology reports which provide true insight of model’s performance. Experimental results on the publicly available IU-CXR dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed model. Finally, we highlight limitations in the radiology report generation research and present recommendations for future work.},

  abstract     = {Image-based 3D reconstruction or 3D photogrammetry of small-scale objects including insects and biological specimens is challenging due to the use of a high magnification lens with inherently limited depth of field, and the object’s fine structures. Therefore, the traditional 3D reconstruction techniques cannot be applied without additional image preprocessing. One such preprocessing technique is multifocus stacking/fusion that combines a set of partially focused images captured at different distances from the same viewing angle to create a single in-focus image. We found that the image formation is not properly considered by the traditional multifocus image capture and stacking techniques. The resulting in-focus images contain artifacts that violate the perspective projection. A 3D reconstruction using such images often fails to produce accurate 3D models of the captured objects. This paper shows how this problem can be solved effectively by a new multifocus multiview 3D reconstruction procedure which includes a new Fixed-Lens multifocus image capture and a calibrated image registration technique using analytic homography transformation. The experimental results using the real and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions by showing that both the fixed-lens image capture and multifocus stacking with calibrated image alignment significantly reduce the errors in the camera poses and produce more complete 3D reconstructed models as compared with those by the conventional moving lens image capture and multifocus stacking.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient end-to-end pruning method based on feature stabilization (EPFS), which is feasible to be implemented for structured pruning such as filter pruning and block pruning. For block pruning, we introduce a mask to scale the output of structures and the $$\ell _1$$ -regularization term to sparsify the mask. For filter pruning, a novel $$\ell _2$$ -regularization term is proposed to constraint the mask along with the $$\ell _1$$ -regularization. Besides, we introduce the Center Loss to stabilize the deep feature and fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) to accelerate the convergence of mask. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our EPFS. On CIFAR-10, EPFS saves $$47.5\%$$ FLOPs on VGGNet with $$1.17\%$$ Top-1 accuracy increase. Furthermore, on ImageNet ILSVRC2012, EPFS reduces $$55.2\%$$ FLOPs on ResNet-18 with o.nly $$1.63\%$$ Top-1 accuracy decrease, which promotes the state-of-the-arts.},

However, a major limitation of using machine learning-based segmentation methods is that performance depends on a large quantity of and diversity in the data used to train the models. Due to their demonstrated ability to generate high quality and diverse synthetic images, we propose the application of GANs here to augment data for a patch-based approach to OCT chorio-retinal boundary segmentation. Given the complexity of GAN training, a range of experiments are performed to understand and optimise performance. We show that it is feasible to generate patches that are visually indistinguishable from their real variants and in the best case, the segmentation performance utilising solely synthetic data is nearly comparable to a model trained on real data. The data augmentation capabilities are demonstrated with classification performance improvements realised on a range of sparse datasets. These findings highlight the potential use of GANs for data augmentation in future work with chorio-retinal OCT images. Additionally, this study includes a range of experimental findings and an analysis of techniques which may be useful for developing or improving GAN-based methods that are not necessarily limited to chorio-retinal images, the OCT modality, or data augmentation.},

Existing methods attribute the problem to the ineffective CAM extraction model and pay much attention on enlarging the regions via developing new models for CAM generation, but limited success has been made. Different from the existing methods, this paper attributes such incompleteness extraction to the finite discriminative cues within a single classification model and improves CAM generation by providing more discriminative cues via training multiple classification models with consideration of class relationships. To this end, the similarities between classes are firstly measured, and hierarchical clustering is then implemented to cluster initial clusters into multiple semantic meanings level of clusters. Afterward, multiple classification models are trained on these different levels of clustering, and multiple class activation maps with various and complementary discriminative cues are obtained. Finally, the class activation map is obtained via the combination of these maps. A new orthogonal module and a two-branch network for CAM generating are also proposed to improve CAM generation via making the regions orthogonal and complementary. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show the superior performance of the proposed CAM generation method.},

In this paper, a part-based method is proposed to aggregate local features from video frames. A pre-trained Fast R-CNN model is used to extract local convolutional features from the regions of interest of training images. These features are clustered to locate representative parts. A set cover problem is then formulated to select the discriminative parts, which are further refined by fine-tuning the Fast R-CNN model. Local features from a video segment are extracted at different layers of the fine-tuned Fast R-CNN model and aggregated both spatially and temporally. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is very competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.},

The image binarization problem seeks to separate the original textual content from the image degradations. In this paper, we present a new binarization technique to accurately learn original text patterns from a limited amount of available historical document data. Our approach consists of a cascade of style augmentation and image binarization networks. Our style augmentation network uses a random style transfer approach to improve the variety of training data by generating new style patterns for the existing documents. The binarization network employs an encoder-decoder-based text segmentation approach with atrous convolutions to preserve the spatial details. The resulting segmentations contain a considerably low noise level and smooth texture. Compared to other leading binarization methods available throughout the DIBCO competition, our proposed methods gain top performances across various evaluation measures.},

  abstract     = {A major focus of current research on place recognition is visual localization for autonomous driving. In this scenario, as cameras will be operating continuously, it is realistic to expect videos as an input to visual localization algorithms, as opposed to the single-image querying approach used in other visual localization works. In this paper, we show that exploiting temporal continuity in the testing sequence significantly improves visual localization—qualitatively and quantitatively. Although intuitive, this idea has not been fully explored in recent works. To this end, we propose two filtering approaches to exploit the temporal smoothness of image sequences: (i) filtering on discrete domain with hidden Markov model, and (ii) filtering on continuous domain with Monte Carlo-based visual localization. Our approaches rely on local features with an encoding technique to represent an image as a single vector. The experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that our proposed methods achieve better results than state of the art (i.e., deep learning-based pose regression approaches) for the task on visual localization under significant appearance change.

  abstract     = {Thermal infrared imaging is a promising modality for long-range small target detection. However, low target contrast, high background clutter and sensor noise are some of the key challenges that need to be resolved efficiently for robust detection performance. The spatiotemporal processing in the early stages of the visual pathway of small flying insects has a remarkable ability to simultaneously address such challenges. The first stage of the early visual system corresponds to the adaptive temporal filtering mechanisms of photoreceptor cells. This stage improves the signal-to-noise ratio, enhances target background discrimination and compresses the signal bandwidth. The second stage pertains to the adaptive spatiotemporal filtering in the lamina monopolar cells. This stage removes spatiotemporal redundancy and enhances target contrast. In this paper, we explore such two-stage bio-processing to simultaneously suppress clutter and enhance the contrast of small low-heat-signature targets in real-world infrared imagery. We also propose a simple and efficient spatial contrast operator called center–surround total differential index for target region segmentation. Small moving target detection experiments on real-world high-bit-depth infrared video sequences show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art spatial and spatiotemporal infrared small target detection methods. Specifically, our method resulted in 59\% better detection rate (at 10 $$^{-5}$$ false alarm rate) than the best competing method. Our results show that the bio-inspired spatiotemporal preprocessing is an excellent tool for significantly improving the performance of existing long-range infrared target detection techniques.},

This paper provides a deep learning-based method: DeepUnHide, able to extract demographic information from the users and items factors in collaborative filtering recommender systems. The core of the proposed method is the gradient-based localization used in the image processing literature to highlight the representative areas of each classification class. Validation experiments make use of two public datasets and current baselines.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) have been proven as a promising approach to deal with ever-growing data traffic. Supporting ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is also considered as a new feature of the upcoming wireless networks. Due to the overlapping structure and the mutual interference between cells in HetNets, existing resource allocation approaches cannot be directly applied for real-time applications, especially for URLLC services. As a novel unsupervised algorithm, Deep Q Network (DQN) has already been applied to many online complex optimization models successfully. However, it may perform badly for resource allocation optimization in HetNets, due to the tiny state change and the large-scale action space characteristics. In order to cope with them, we first propose an auto-encoder to disturb the similarity of adjacent states to enhance the features and then divide the whole decision process into two phases. DQN is applied to solve each phase, respectively, and we iterate the whole process to find the joint optimized solution. We implement our algorithm in 6 scenarios with different numbers of user equipment (UE), redundant links, and sub-carriers. Simulations results demonstrate that our algorithm has good convergence for the optimization objective. Moreover, by further optimizing the power allocation, a 1–2 nines of reliability improvement is obtained for bad conditions. Finally, the experiment result shows that our algorithm reaches the reliability of 8-nines in common scenarios. As an online method, the algorithm proposed in this paper takes only 0.32 s on average.},

  abstract     = {The automation of the process of information systems construction is an important and urgent problem, as it allows reducing the negative influence of a person during decision making and developing software, releasing additional time and material resources to solve more complex and creative problems. Most modern information systems are developed on a modular base; therefore, a significant design stage is the implementation of links between system components. The purpose of the study is to automate the organization of intermodular interaction in information systems, which will reduce the complexity, time and cost of this implementing process. In order to achieve the result, a method is proposed for the organization of interaction between modules of information systems based on neural network data channels, realized within the general concept of a neural network architecture. The structure of neural network channels, the principles of their functioning, theoretical substantiation, mathematical and algorithmic support and area of application are considered in detail. A classification of neural network channels is presented, based on two of their characteristics: categories and degrees. As a result of the conducted research, the practical implementation of two neural network data channels is realized (transmission and adaptation), the structure of the program code, the used tools and libraries are analyzed. Based on a set of metrics for the complexity of the program code (Halstead, Jilb), the estimation of the computational complexity of algorithms, time and material costs for implementation, a comparative analysis of neural network data transmission channels and adaptation with classical approaches in the form of a set of network data transmission protocol and the required algorithmic support for data processing is carried out. The obtained experimental results confirm the lower complexity of neural network channels (reduction by at least 20\% according to Halstead metrics and cyclometric complexity), reduction in time (by 12–32\%) and cost (by 36–63\%) of implementation and increase in the accuracy of the problem solving (by 11.8–15.5\%). This demonstrates the effectiveness of using neural network data channels to automate the organization of intermodular interaction in information systems.},

Prevailing feature location (FL) methods have issues in security effectiveness. This paper proposed an effective and safe FL approach in SC utilizing the Jacobian matrix-based clustering (JMC) to trounce these issues. Originally, the requirement-based approach removes the repeated test cases (TC). Subsequently, the weight-based salp swarms algorithm (Ψ-SSA) selects the significant TC attributes. Followed by which, the associations rule mining (ARM) process is implemented. The ARM encompasses the itemset, support, frequent itemset, closed frequent itemset, confidence, in addition to divergence. Subsequently, the affinity is computed by means of the blend of confidence with divergence. In this affinity computation, the MALO optimizes the weight value. Then, the exponent-based elliptic curves cryptographic encrypts the affinity value. Subsequently, the score value is computed for the encrypted affinity value centered on the entropy computation. Finally, the JMC locates the feature centered on the score value. Experimental assessment exhibits that the proposed system’s performance is better than that of the prevailing research methodologies.},

To automatically obtain the required statistics from swimming videos, we need to solve the following four challenging computer vision tasks: swimmer head detection; tracking; stroke detection; and camera calibration. We collectively solve these problems using a two-phased deep learning approach, we call Deep Detector for Actions and Swimmer Heads (DeepDASH). DeepDASH achieves a 20.8\% higher F1 score for swimmer head detection and operates 6 times faster than the popular Faster R-CNN object detector. We also propose a hierarchical tracking algorithm based on the existing SORT algorithm which we call HISORT. HISORT produces significantly longer tracks than SORT by preserving swimmer identities for longer periods of time. Finally, DeepDASH achieves an overall F1 score of 97.5\% for stroke detection across all four swimming stroke styles.},

  abstract     = {In this work, an enhanced moth flame optimization (MFO) algorithm is proposed as a search strategy within a wrapper feature selection (FS) framework. It aims mainly to improve the classification tasks in medical applications. FS is an NP-hard problem because the run time of its procedure grows exponentially. The persistent necessity for a powerful FS system and the promising results of swarming behavior in various optimization scenarios motivated our attempts to develop a new FS approach. This paper uses a recently developed methodology inspired by the moth movement style in searching for a near-optimal feature subset for reliable disease diagnosis. The proposed modification strategy is based on two stages of enhancement. In the first stage, eight binary variants are produced using eight transfer functions. In the second stage, the Levy flight operator is integrated into the structure of MFO in combination with transfer functions. The main target is to increase the diversity of the algorithm and support the exploration of the search space. Twenty-three medical data sets downloaded from UCI, Keel, Kaggle data repositories are used to validate the proposed approaches. It has been demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other well-known wrapper approaches across 83\% of data sets. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms other methods in the literature across 75\% of the data sets. The comparisons with filter-based approach reveal superior performance across 70\% of the data sets. This work also conducts an extensive investigation of the parameters and studies the effects of different settings on the performance of the FS process. The empirical results and various comparisons reveal a remarkable effect of the Levy flight operator and transfer functions on the performance of MFO. This can be achieved through improving the diversity, achieving a greater exploration/exploitation trade-off, and enhancing the convergence trends of the optimizer.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems (RSs) have gained immense popularity due to their capability of dealing with a huge amount of information available in various domains. They are considered to be information filtering systems that make predictions or recommendations to users based on their interests. One of the most common recommender system techniques is user-based collaborative filtering. In this paper, we follow this technique by proposing a new algorithm which is called hybrid crow search and uniform crossover algorithm (HCSUC) to find a set of feasible clusters of similar users to enhance the recommendation process. Invoking the genetic uniform crossover operator in the standard crow search algorithm can increase the diversity of the search and help the algorithm to escape from trapping in local minima. The top-N recommendations are presented for the corresponding user according to the most feasible cluster’s members. The performance of the HCSUC algorithm is evaluated using the Jester dataset. A set of experiments have been conducted to validate the solution quality and accuracy of the HCSUC algorithm against the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), African buffalo optimization (ABO), and the crow search algorithm (CSA). In addition, the proposed algorithm and the other meta-heuristic algorithms are compared against the collaborative filtering recommendation technique (CF). The results indicate that the HCSUC algorithm has obtained superior results in terms of mean absolute error, root means square errors and in minimization of the objective function.},

  abstract     = {The main scope of this study is to propose a novel methodology aiming at enhancing the computational efficiency of the approaches used for solving structural topology optimization (STO) problems. The methodology is based on machine learning combined with the idea of using multiple finite element (FE) models of reduced order. The capability of deep belief networks (DBNs) in discovering multiple representational levels of data nonlinearity in pattern recognition problems recently triggered the development of the DLTOP methodology by the authors Kallioras et al. (Struct Multidiscip Optim, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-020-02545-z ), that is based on DBNs and the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach. In this study, a FE model order upgrading scheme integrated with the DLTOP methodology is proposed for accelerating further the SIMP-based solution procedure of the STO problems with no scalability limitations, labeled as DL-SCALE. The framework of DL-SCALE is based on a combined implementation of DBNs and SIMP into a sequentially implemented “model-optimize-and-order-upgrade” scheme. DL-SCALE efficiency is validated over several benchmark topology optimization test-examples. The results obtained for the test-examples clearly prove its computational advantages; the computing time is reduced by almost one order of magnitude while the corresponding reduction in terms of iterations is more than one order of magnitude compared to the ones originally required by SIMP, without any loss with respect to objective function value. It is also concluded from the results obtained that the proposed methodology can escalate to various finite element mesh discretizations, while optimized layout information transfer is possible, contributing also in accelerating further the STO procedure.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a dual-attention network (DAN) with multitask learning is proposed to solve the short-term prediction problems of traffic speed. The proposed DAN includes a road-type attention module (RAM), which performs accurate short-term speed prediction using road-type attention scores, a low-speed attention module (LAM), which is trained on weighted samples and fits low speed, and a decision support module, which outputs either RAM or LAM by estimating the level of the predicted speed. DAN can improve the transfer in the feature and speed prediction task layers by learning-associated and time-dependent tasks. The Shanghai expressway dataset is used to test and compare the proposed method and 15 other techniques. The results show that DAN with a multitask loss function obtains the smallest mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in most cases. LAM efficiently improves the predictive accuracy of low-speed samples, whereas RAM performs better in terms of the overall error reduction. DAN achieves the largest R-squared of 0.93 with a small reduction in R-squared by 0.12\% from the training data to the test data, thereby illustrating its excellent generalization. DAN outperforms the other models by at least 13.5\% in terms of the MSE and by 5.07\% in terms of the MAPE on different road types. Adding LAM effectively improves the MAPE by at least 21.4\% over RAM without increasing the error of the other speed levels. In terms of the MSE, RAM outperforms DAN by 12.6\% in the best case. This study proved that the short-term speed prediction based on DAN has the ability to improve the accuracy on low-speed level and the generalization on different road types.},

In spite of that, since the output weights are computed by the simple linear regression, there may be an ill-posed problem in the training process for ESN. In order to tackle this issue, a sparse Bayesian ESN (SBESN) is given. The proposed SBESN attempts to estimate the probability of the outputs and trains the network through sparse Bayesian learning, where independent regularization priors should be implied to each weight rather than sharing one prior for all weights. Simulation results illustrate that the SBESN model is insensitivity to reservoir size and completely outperforms other models.},

  abstract     = {The ecological footprint is an excellent tool to better understand the consequences of the human behavior on the environment. The growing need for natural resources emphasizes the necessity of their accurate observation, calculation, and prediction. This paper develops and compares four hybrid machine learning models for predicting the total ecological footprint of consumption based on a set of hyper-parameters predefined by the Bayesian optimization algorithm. In particular, K-nearest neighbor regression (KNNReg), random forest regression (RFR) with 93 trees, and two artificial neural networks (ANNs) with two hidden layers were developed and later compared in terms of their performance. As energy inputs, the primary energy consumption from (1) natural gas sources, (2) coal sources, (3) oil sources, (4) wind sources, (5) solar photovoltaic sources, (6) hydropower sources, (7) nuclear sources, and (8) other renewable sources was used. Additionally, population number has also been used as an input. The models were developed using a set of data that include 1804 instances. The ANNs were modeled using two different activation functions in the hidden layers: ReLU and SPOCU. The performance was evaluated using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute scaled error (MASE), normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). The results show that KNNReg performs the best with MASE of 0.029, followed by the RFR (0.032), ReLU ANN (0.064), and SPOCU ANN (0.089). Moreover, SMOGN was utilized to produce a synthetic test set which was used to additionally test the best performed model. The performance on the SMOGN set demonstrates good performance (MASE=0.022). Lastly, the best performed model was implemented into a GUI that calculates the ecological footprint based on user inputs.},

The efficiency of approached optimiser has also been evaluated for different problems of non-convex, nonlinear and highly constrained engineering optimal complications. To confirm performance of suggested algorithm, consideration was given to 23 standard CEC2005 benchmark issues and nine multidisciplinary engineering design optimization problems. After testing, the efficacy of approaching hHHO-PS optimization algorithm has been found to be much stronger than the traditional Harris hawks optimiser, gray wolf optimiser, ant lion optimiser and moth flame optimization and other currently documented heuristics, metaheuristics and hybrid form optimization approaches, and the suggested methodology endorses its efficacy in problems of multidisciplinary nature and engineering optimization.},

So to overcome such shortcomings, this paper aims in developing a novel chaotic sine–cosine firefly (CSCF) algorithm with numerous variants to solve optimization problems. Here, the chaotic form of two algorithms namely the sine–cosine algorithm and the firefly algorithms is integrated to improve the convergence speed and efficiency thus minimizing several complexity issues. Moreover, the proposed CSCF approach is operated under various chaotic phases and the optimal chaotic variants containing the best chaotic mapping are selected. Then numerous chaotic benchmark functions are utilized to examine the system performance of the CSCF algorithm.

The data used for modeling were attained from the laboratory experiments. The compressive and flexural strengths were experimentally analyzed for specimens containing 0\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, and 25\% of AOD steel slag as a partial replacement of cement at curing ages of 3, 7, 28, 90, 180, and 365 days. The developed model was trained using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The performance of the proposed model during the training and validation has been compared with the well-known prediction models such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function network (RBFN). The DRNN-based prediction model has given much better prediction results when compared to the other two models since the former provided comparatively smaller values of performance indicators such as average mean square error (AMSE) and mean average error (MAE). The reason for DRNN performing better than the other two models is that it contains feedback connections/weights which induce memory property in its structure. This helps DRNN to better model the complex mappings. Such feedback loops are not available in MLP and RBFN. The study conducted in this research concludes that the DRNN-based prediction model should be preferred over the MLP and RBFN models for predicting the compressive and flexural strengths of AOD steel slag added to concrete for pavements.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most signals used for studying and demonstrating the electrical activity of the brain due to the absence of side effects, its noninvasive nature and its well temporal resolution. Indeed, it provides real-time information, so it can be easily suitable for predicting drivers’ vigilance states. The classification of these states through this signal requires sophisticated approaches in order to achieve the best prediction performance. Furthermore, deep learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features of the EEG signal and in resolving classification issues. In this paper, we will predict individuals’ states of vigilance based on the study of their brain activity by analyzing EEG signals using DL architectures. In fact, we propose two types of networks: (i) a 1D-UNet model, which is composed only of deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) layers and (ii) 1D-UNet-long short-term memory (1D-UNet-LSTM) that combines the proposed 1D-UNet architecture with the LSTM recurrent model. The experimental results reveal that the suggested models can stabilize the training model, well recognize the subject vigilance states and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The per-class average of precision and recall can be, respectively, up to 86\% with 1D-UNet and 85\% with 1D-UNet-LSTM, hence the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In order to complete our virtual prototyping and to get a real evaluation of our alert equipment, these proposed DL models are implemented also on a Raspberry Pi3 device allowing measuring the execution time necessary for predicting the state vigilance in real time.},

  abstract     = {The capacity efficiency of load carrying with the accurate serviceability performances of reinforced concrete (RC) structure is an important aspect, which is mainly dependent on the values of the ultimate bond strength between the corroded steel reinforcements and the surrounding concrete. Therefore, the precise determination of the ultimate bond strength degradation is of paramount importance for maintaining the safety levels of RC structures affected by corrosion. In this regard, hybrid intelligence and machine learning techniques are proposed to build a new framework to predict the ultimate bond strength in between the corroded steel reinforcements and the surrounding concrete. The proposed computational techniques include the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the radial basis function neural network and the genetic expression programming methods. In addition to that, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) deterministic approach and two meta-heuristic optimization approaches, namely the artificial bee colony algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, are employed in order to guarantee an optimum selection of the hyper-parameters of the proposed techniques. The latter were implemented based on an experimental published database consisted of 218 experimental tests, which cover various factors related to the ultimate bond strength, such as compressive strength of the concrete, concrete cover, the type steel, steel bar diameter, length of the bond and the level of corrosion. Based on their performance evaluation through several statistical assessment tools, the proposed models were shown to predict the ultimate bond strength accurately; outperforming the existing hybrid artificial intelligence models developed based on the same collected database. More precisely, the MLP-LM model was, by far, the best model with a determination coefficient (R2) as high as 0.97 and 0.96 for the training and the overall data, respectively.},

  abstract     = {How to measure the domain discrepancy is of significant importance in the field of unsupervised domain adaptation. Among them, Correlation Alignment (CORAL), aligning second-order statistics of source and target domains, has become one of the most widely used discrepancy-based methods. However, the performance of CORAL is limited by: (1) aligning covariance with usual Euclidean metric is suboptimal, and (2) second-order statistics have limited expression for the non-Gaussian distribution. To address these limitations, we propose a Robust Correlation Alignment as well as a High-order Correlation Alignment method. The Robust Correlation Alignment exploits the geometric structure of covariance with matrix square-root normalization. To circumvent unstable and time-consuming properties of the Singular Value Decomposition, we employ the variant of Newton iteration to compute the matrix square-root. Besides, we also propose a High-order Correlation Alignment method, which exploits the third-order statistics for domain alignment. We show that the High-order CORAL can be generalized to Maximum Mean Discrepancy, CORAL and arbitrary-order statistics. Specifically, we propose group matching to reduce space complexity and improve the feasibility in real-world application. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform previous methods by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {In natural language, a group of words constitute a phrase and several phrases constitute a sentence. However, existing transformer-based models for sentence-level tasks abstract sentence-level semantics from word-level semantics directly, which override phrase-level semantics so that they may be not favorable for capturing more precise semantics. In order to resolve this problem, we propose a novel multi-granularity semantic representation (MGSR) model for relation extraction. This model can bridge the semantic gap between low-level semantic abstraction and high-level semantic abstraction by learning word-level, phrase-level, and sentence-level multi-granularity semantic representations successively. We segment a sentence into entity chunks and context chunks according to an entity pair. Thus, the sentence is represented as a non-empty segmentation set. The entity chunks are noun phrases, and the context chunks contain the key phrases expressing semantic relations. Then, the MGSR model utilizes inter-word, inner-chunk and inter-chunk three kinds of different self-attention mechanisms, respectively, to learn the multi-granularity semantic representations. The experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate our model outperforms the previous models.},

  abstract     = {In this study, net radiation and temperature data were collected from the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, Lagos, covering a period of 1983–2013. The study uses a multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model of artificial neural network (ANN) with three algorithms namely the Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient, and Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno for the prediction of net radiation using the temperature series as input variables in place of commonly used empirical statistical methods. The investigation is conducted in a tropical region where 16 meteorological stations spatially distributed across the four climatic regions of Nigeria viz semi-arid (SAR), sub-humid dry (SHD), sub-humid humid (SHH), and humid (HUM) regions were used as a case study. Analyses showed that minimum temperature has a greater positive impact on net radiation than maximum temperature. This has been attributed among other factors to have contributed to higher magnitudes of net radiation in humid regions than those of arid regions. Meanwhile, the performance assessment of the ANN models using the refined index (dr) metric showed that among the three models proposed, the MLP-BFGS model performed best having maximum values of 0.91 in the SAR, 0.65 in the SHD, 0.80 in the SHH, and 0.88 in the HUM regions. It also has the lowest error analysis with magnitudes of root mean square error values of 7.92 W/m2 in the SAR, 9.95 W/m2 in the SHD, 12.91 W/m2 in the SHH, and 8.73 W/m2 in the HUM regions. Finally, it can be inferred from the results that MLP neural networks with the BFGS algorithm can predict net radiation accurately better than any empirical statistical methods over Nigeria.},

Structured data are exploited in order to determine nonlinear and linear models. The introduced scheme takes advantage of data graphs at two different levels. First, it incorporates manifold regularization that is naturally encoded by the graph itself. Second, the regression model is built on the convolved data samples that are obtained by the joint use of the data and their associated graph. The proposed semi-supervised embedding can tackle challenges related to over-fitting in image data spaces. The proposed graph convolution-based semi-supervised embedding paves the way to new theoretical and application perspectives related to the nonlinear embedding. Indeed, building flexible models that adopt convolved data samples can enhance both the data representation and the final performance of the learning system. Several experiments are conducted on six image datasets for comparing the introduced scheme with many state-of-art semi-supervised approaches. These experimental results show the effectiveness of the introduced data representation scheme.},

The developed tool is one of the early steps of a machine-learning-based aerodynamic performance prediction tool. Network training and evaluation are performed from a set of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based solutions of the 2-D flow field around a group of known airfoils involving symmetrical, cambered, thick and thin airfoils. Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes-based CFD simulations are performed at a selected single Mach number and for an angle of attack condition. The calculated pressure field, which is the main parameter for lift and drag calculations, is fed to the neural network training algorithm. Pressure data are calculated using CFD methods on high-quality structured computational grids. For the better shape learning, a distance map is generated from airfoil shape and provided to the algorithm at data locations of the pressure points relative to the airfoil shape. Experiments are conducted with unseen airfoil shapes to evaluate the predictive capability of our model. Performance analysis for airfoils with different thicknesses and cambers is conducted. We also investigated the effect of the shock on the performance of our model. Overall, our model achieves 88 $$\%$$ accuracy for unseen airfoil shapes and shows promise to capture the overall flow pattern accurately. Also, significant speed-up is achieved compared to time-consuming CFD simulations. We achieve almost four orders of speed-up with a much cheaper computational resource.},

The artificial intelligent (AI) method called ANFIS is used to train actual data from the river and provide an AI model with artificial data points. This artificial data point can show the occurrence of disaster for a critical day with different flow rates. The changing parameter in the AI model enables us to make a correct decision about critical time for rivers. This study also concentrates on the sensitivity investigation of ANFIS setting parameters on the accurateness of numerical results in order to find the best ANFIS model for rapid oscillation in the data set. The best performance of the ANFIS method is achieved with the trimf membership function, the number of input membership function = 16, and the number of iteration = 1000. The results also showed that the ANFIS model can provide fast computational calculation, and adding more nodes for the prediction cannot change the overall time of calculation due to the meshless behavior of the model. In addition to this model, we used the ant colony method for training of data set, and we found that the ANFIS method is better in learning and prediction of the dataset.},

  abstract     = {Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the most fundamental single/multi-objective, nonlinear, and non-convex optimization problems in modern power systems. Renewable energy sources are integrated into power systems to provide environmental sustainability and to reduce emissions and fuel costs. Therefore, some conventional thermal generators are being replaced with wind power sources. Although wind power is a widely used renewable energy source, it is intermittent in nature and wind speed is uncertain at any given time. For this reason, the Weibull probability density function is one of the important methods used in calculating available wind power. This paper presents an improved method based on the Lévy Coyote optimization algorithm (LCOA) for solving the OPF problem with stochastic wind power. In the proposed LCOA, Lévy Flights were added to the Coyote optimization algorithm to avoid local optima and to improve the ability to focus on optimal solutions. To show the effect of the novel contribution to the algorithm, the LCOA method was tested using the Congress on Evolutionary Computation-2005 benchmark test functions. Subsequently, the solution to the OPF problem with stochastic wind power was tested via the LCOA and other heuristic optimization algorithms in IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus test systems. Eighteen different cases were executed including fuel cost, emissions, active power loss, voltage profile, and voltage stability, in single- and multi-objective optimization. The results showed that the LCOA was more effective than the other optimization methods at reaching an optimal solution to the OPF problem with stochastic wind power.},

This paper aims to solve the OPF where the generation cost is optimized with incorporation of stochastic wind power and several types of FACTS devices such as static VAR compensator, thyristor-controlled series compensator and thyristor-controlled phase shifter. Case studies with both fixed and uncertain load demands are performed. The stochastic wind energy and load demand are modeled using suitable probability density functions. Optimization objective considers cost of thermal generation, direct cost of scheduled wind power, penalty cost for underestimation and reserve cost for overestimation of the wind power. In addition, both locations and ratings of the FACTS devices are optimized to minimize total generation cost of the system. Success history-based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE), a powerful evolutionary algorithm, is adopted to perform the optimization task. The constraints of OPF problem are handled using superiority of feasible solutions (SF) method.

  abstract     = {In this contribution, the problem of multistability control in a simple model of 3D HNNs as well as its application to biomedical image encryption is addressed. The space magnetization is justified by the coexistence of up to six disconnected attractors including both chaotic and periodic. The linear augmentation method is successfully applied to control the multistable HNNs into a monostable network. The control of the coexisting four attractors including a pair of chaotic attractors and a pair of periodic attractors is made through three crises that enable the chaotic attractors to be metamorphosed in a monostable periodic attractor. Also, the control of six coexisting attractors (with two pairs of chaotic attractors and a pair of periodic one) is made through five crises enabling all the chaotic attractors to be metamorphosed in a monostable periodic attractor. Note that this controlled HNN is obtained for higher values of the coupling strength. These interesting results are obtained using nonlinear analysis tools such as the phase portraits, bifurcations diagrams, graph of maximum Lyapunov exponent, and basins of attraction. The obtained results have been perfectly supported using the PSPICE simulation environment. Finally, a simple encryption scheme is designed jointly using the sequences of the proposed HNNs and the sequences of real/imaginary values of the Julia fractals set. The obtained cryptosystem is validated using some well-known metrics. The proposed method achieved entropy of 7.9992, NPCR of 99.6299, and encryption time of 0.21 for the 256*256 sample 1 image.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of smartphones in recent years has led to a significant rise in the sophistication and number of Android malicious applications (apps) targeting smartphone users. Android-based smartphones attract attackers more than other smartphones due to the popularity and open source features of the Android environment. Malware apps pose a potential threat to the security of Android-based smartphones because of the storage of confidential and private information. To improve the classification efficiency of Android malicious apps, this paper proposes a hybrid approach for the classification of Android malware by integrating the fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm with the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). First, the fuzzy clustering method is utilized for generating highly significant clusters of the Android apps’ permissions that reflect the certain characteristics of the Android apps. The primary goal of using fuzzy clustering is to produce new features by gathering Android app permissions with related patterns together in clusters. Second, the LightGBM is employed to take the app’s permissions and their clusters resulting from FCM as inputs and outputs the classification result as a malware or goodware app after the training. The advantages of using LightGBM are its high learning efficiency and precise classification. The significance of the proposed approach is illustrated by conducting several experiments using a well-known dataset containing benign and malware Android apps. The results of the experiments show that the suggested approach outperforms the other approaches and attains the highest accuracy (94.63\%), area under the curve (AUC) (98.74\%) and precision (97.70\%).},

  abstract     = {Spatially consistent and up-to-date maps of human settlements are crucial for addressing policies related to urbanization and sustainability, especially in the era of an increasingly urbanized world. The availability of open and free Sentinel-2 data of the Copernicus Earth Observation program offers a new opportunity for wall-to-wall mapping of human settlements at a global scale. This paper presents a deep-learning-based framework for a fully automated extraction of built-up areas at a spatial resolution of 10 m from a global composite of Sentinel-2 imagery. A multi-neuro modeling methodology building on a simple Convolution Neural Networks architecture for pixel-wise image classification of built-up areas is developed. The core features of the proposed model are the image patch of size 5 × 5 pixels adequate for describing built-up areas from Sentinel-2 imagery and the lightweight topology with a total number of 1,448,578 trainable parameters and 4 2D convolutional layers and 2 flattened layers. The deployment of the model on the global Sentinel-2 image composite provides the most detailed and complete map reporting about built-up areas for reference year 2018. The validation of the results with an independent reference dataset of building footprints covering 277 sites across the world establishes the reliability of the built-up layer produced by the proposed framework and the model robustness. The results of this study contribute to cutting-edge research in the field of automated built-up areas mapping from remote sensing data and establish a new reference layer for the analysis of the spatial distribution of human settlements across the rural–urban continuum.},

However, this particular population of the world is unfortunately overlooked as the majority of the hearing population does not understand sign language. In this paper, an extensive comparative analysis of various gesture recognition techniques involving convolutional neural networks and machine learning algorithms has been discussed and tested for real-time accuracy. Three models: a pre-trained VGG16 with fine-tuning, VGG16 with transfer learning and a hierarchical neural network were analyzed based on a number of trainable parameters. These models were trained on a self-developed dataset consisting images of Indian Sign Language (ISL) representation of all 26 English alphabets. The performance evaluation was based on the practical application of these models, which was simulated by varying lighting and background environments. Out of the three, the hierarchical model outperformed the other two models to give the best accuracy of 98.52\% for one-hand and 97\% for two-hand gestures. Thereafter, a conversation interface was built in Django using this model for the real-time gesture to speech conversion and vice versa. This publicly accessible interface can be used by anyone who wishes to learn or converse in ISL.},

Existing storage systems are not feasible for massive data storage. Fortunately, cloud storage services meet the demand through their properties such as scalability and availability. Cloud computing is encouraged by amazing web innovation and modern electronic contraptions. Medical images can be stored in the cloud area, but most of the cloud service providers keep the client data in the plain text format. Cloud users need to take the responsibility to preserve the medical data with their strategy. Most of the existing image encryption solutions are vulnerable to the chosen-plaintext attack because the increasing power of computers and ingenuity of hackers are opening up more and more cracks in this mathematical armour. This paper proposes Hopfield neural network (HNN)-influenced image encryption technique to withstand against various attacks which optimize and improvise system through continuous learning and updating. These methods provide a critical security feature that adapts itself for day-to-day miracles of the real world. In this scheme, the back propagation neural network has been employed to generate image-specific keys that increase the resiliency against hackers. The generated keys are used as an initial seed for confusion and diffusion sequence generation through HNN.},

Five deep convolutional neural networks were used for this purpose. Four of these deep learning methods are pre-trained models. We used the concept of “ransfer learning” to use pre-trained models.

  abstract     = {One of the most applicable techniques in the inventory management field is inventory classification based on ABC analysis, a well-known method to set the items in a different group, according to their importance and values. In this paper, a bi-objective mathematical model is proposed to improve the inventory grouping based on ABC analysis. The first objective function maximizes the total net profit of the items in the central stock, and the second objective function maximizes the total net profit of items in different wards. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes the service level, the number of inventory groups, and the number of assigned items. To solve the model in small and large dimensions, two exact methods (LP-metric and ε-constraint) and two meta-heuristic methods (NSGA-II and MOPSO) are used. Then, to compare those methods in terms of efficiency, the statistical analysis besides the AHP and VIKOR techniques is implemented. The results show the superiority of the ε-constraint among the exact methods and MOPSO among meta-heuristic methods. Finally, the proposed model has been implemented in two sets of numerical examples to demonstrate its applicability.},

This article expounds a sound and solid nonparametric Bayesian technique known as Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach, based on a set of data collected from different dwellings in an oceanic climate. Firstly, this model introduces the relevance of each predictive variable on energy performance in residential buildings. The second result refers to the statement that we can predict successfully the TPE by using this model. A coefficient of determination equal to 0.9687 was thus established in order to predict the TPE from the observed data, using the GPR approach in combination with the differential evolution (DE) optimiser. The concordance between experimental observed data and the predicted data from the best-proposed novel hybrid DE/GPR-relied model demonstrated here the adequate efficiency of this innovative approach.},

  abstract     = {Medical image fusion techniques can further improve the accuracy and time efficiency of clinical diagnosis by obtaining comprehensive salient features and detail information from medical images of different modalities. We propose a novel medical image fusion algorithm based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network and dense block models, which is used to generate fusion images with rich information. Specifically, this network architecture integrates two modules: an image generator module based on dense block and encoder–decoder and a discriminator module. In this paper, we use the encoder network to extract the image features, process the features using fusion rule based on the Lmax norm, and use it as the input of the decoder network to obtain the final fusion image. This method can overcome the weaknesses of the active layer measurement by manual design in the traditional methods and can process the information of the intermediate layer according to the dense blocks to avoid the loss of information. Besides, this paper uses detail loss and structural similarity loss to construct the loss function, which is used to improve the extraction ability of target information and edge detail information related to images. Experiments on the public clinical diagnostic medical image dataset show that the proposed algorithm not only has excellent detail preserve characteristics but also can suppress the artificial effects. The experiment results are better than other comparison methods in different types of evaluation.},

These components are related in an intricate way and it is difficult to provide a comprehensible analysis of their joint effect.

  abstract     = {In this paper, two optimal operation plans of a cascaded reservoir system with four hydropower plants are studied for reaching the highest power energy of all the power plants. In the first plan, called local optimization plan, optimal water discharge of each upstream hydropower plant is determined first and the optimal discharge is then used as input data for determining optimal water discharge of other downstream hydropower plants. In the second plan, called global optimization plan, optimal water discharge of all hydropower plants is simultaneously determined. For reaching the highest total power energy of the system, nine methods consisting of moth swarm algorithm, Harris hawks optimization, cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), snap drift cuckoo search algorithm (SD-CSA), stochastic fractal search algorithm, parasitism predation algorithm, marine predator algorithm, tunicate swarm algorithm, and the proposed improved cuckoo search algorithm (ICSA) are implemented. Among the methods, the proposed ICSA is first developed by improving the exploitation phase of CSA. The comparisons of power energy from each hydropower plant for the two plans indicate that local optimization plan is more useful for upstream plants but for downstream plants, whereas global optimization plan is more useful for downstream plants. For the purpose of reaching the highest total power energy for the whole system, the global optimization plan is more effective because it reaches higher power energy than local optimization plan. For investigating the improvement of the proposed method over CSA and SD-CSA, the three methods are run for seven benchmark functions and for the global optimization plan with different population sizes and different iteration numbers. As a result, it is recommended that global optimization plan should be applied for all hydropower plants in cascaded systems and downstream plants with higher power energy can share benefit to upstream ones. In addition, one of the most effective methods that should be recommended for implementing global optimization plan is the proposed ICSA.},

Thirdly, a kind of novel controller, state feedback controller, which contains an integral term and delayed term, is proposed. Through these, the problem of finite-time synchronization has been solved very well. Finally, several new conditions ensuring finite-time synchronization of two delayed QVNNs are derived by establishing a new differential inequality and constructing a Lyapunov function.

However, the computational cost of the training procedure scales with the cube of the number of hidden neurons. The paper presents a novel training procedure for random-based neural networks, which combines ensemble techniques and dropout regularization. This limits the computational complexity of the training phase without affecting classification performance significantly; the method best fits Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In the training algorithm, one first generates a pool of random neurons; then, an ensemble of independent sub-networks (each including a fraction of the original pool) is trained; finally, the sub-networks are integrated into one classifier. The experimental validation compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art solutions, by taking into account both generalization performance and computational complexity. To verify the effectiveness in IoT applications, the training procedures were deployed on a pair of commercially available embedded devices. The results showed that the proposed approach overall improved accuracy, with a minor degradation in performance in a few cases. When considering embedded implementations as compared with conventional architectures, the speedup of the proposed method scored up to 20× in IoT devices.},

The search of each individual in the traditional CS is normally performed independently, which may limit the algorithm’s search capability. To address this, a modified CS, information interaction-enhanced CS (IICS), is proposed in this article to enhance the interaction of search information between individuals and thereby the search capability of the algorithm. The performance of the proposed IICS algorithm is first verified by testing on two benchmark sets (including 16 classical benchmark functions and 29 CEC 2017 benchmark functions) and then used in optimizing the parameters in the empirical part of the proposed hybrid prediction model. The proposed hybrid model is applied to actual production data from a 300 t LF at Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd, one of China&#39;s most famous integrated iron and steel enterprises, and the results show that the proposed hybrid prediction model is effective with comparatively high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {For any classification problem, the dimension of the feature vector used for classification has great importance. This is because, in a high-dimensional feature vector, it is found that some are non-informative or even redundant as they do not contribute to the learning process of the classifier. Rather, they may be the reason for low classification accuracy and high training time of the learning model. To address this issue, researchers apply various feature selection (FS) methods as found in the literature. In recent years, meta-heuristic algorithms have been proven to be effective in solving FS problems. The Coral Reefs Optimizer (CRO) which is a cellular type evolutionary algorithms has good tuning between its exploration and exploitation ability. This has motivated us to present an improved version of CRO with the inclusion of adaptive $$\beta $$ -hill climbing to increase the exploitation ability of CRO. The proposed method is assessed on 18 standard UCI-datasets by means of three distinct classifiers, KNN, Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifiers. It is also analyzed with 10 state-of-the-art meta-heuristics FS procedure, and the outputs show an excellent performance of the proposed FS method reaching better results than the previous methods considered here for comparison.

  abstract     = {Existing techniques for Yoga pose recognition build classifiers based on sophisticated handcrafted features computed from the raw inputs captured in a controlled environment. These techniques often fail in complex real-world situations and thus, pose limitations on the practical applicability of existing Yoga pose recognition systems. This paper presents an alternative computationally efficient approach for Yoga pose recognition in complex real-world environments using deep learning. To this end, a Yoga pose dataset was created with the participation of 27 individual (8 males and 19 females), which consists of ten Yoga poses, namely Malasana, Ananda Balasana, Janu Sirsasana, Anjaneyasana, Tadasana, Kumbhakasana, Hasta Uttanasana, Paschimottanasana, Uttanasana, and Dandasana. To capture the videos, we used smartphone cameras having 4 K resolution and 30 fps frame rate. For the recognition of Yoga poses in real time, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) architecture is designed and implemented. The designed architecture is a modified version of the C3D architecture initially introduced for the recognition of human actions. In the proposed modified C3D architecture, the computationally intensive fully connected layers are pruned, and supplementary layers such as the batch normalization and average pooling were introduced for computational efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies, which utilized the inherent spatial–temporal relationship among Yoga poses for their recognition. The designed 3D CNN architecture achieved test recognition accuracy of 91.15\% on the in-house prepared Yoga pose dataset consisting of ten Yoga poses. Furthermore, on the publicly available dataset, the designed architecture achieved competitive test recognition accuracy of 99.39\%, along with multifold improvement in the execution speed compared to the existing state-of-the-art technique. To promote further study, we will make the in-house created Yoga pose dataset publicly available to the research community.},

  abstract     = {Scale variation is one of the major challenges in object detection task. Modern region-based object detection architectures often adopt Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) as feature extraction neck to achieve multi-scale feature representation in solving scale variation problem. However, due to the rough feature selection strategy in Region of Interest (RoI) feature extraction step, these methods might not perform well on object detection under strong scale variation. In this work, we are motivated by the limitations of current FPN-based two-stage object detectors and then present a novel module, namely scale-aware feature selective (SAFS) module, that flexibly and adaptively selects feature levels in two-stage object detectors. Specifically, we firstly build the RoI Pyramid in standard FPN structure to extract RoI features from various scale levels. Next, in order to achieve scale-aware mechanism for solving scale variation issue, we develop a novel weighting gate function containing one set of trainable parameters to automatically learn the fusion weight for each RoI feature level, which relieves the limitation of hard feature selection strategy guided by online instance size. Outputs from the RoI features with the learned weights are fused for classification and bounding box regression. Furthermore, we design a multi-level SAFS architecture to obtain different types of RoI feature combinations that ensures our method is more robust to various instance scales. Experimental results show that our SAFS module is very compatible with most of two-stage object detectors and could achieve state-of-the-art results with Average Precision of 48.3 on COCO test-dev and other popular object detection benchmarks. Our code will be made publicly available.},

In the proposed algorithm, we adopt density estimation strategy to redefine a new fitness value of a solution, which can select solution with good convergence and distribution. In addition, a clustering method is used to classify the non-dominated solutions, and then, an achievement scalarizing function ranking method is designed to layer different frontiers and eliminate redundant solutions in the environment selection stage, thus ensuring the convergence and diversity of non-dominant solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated and compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms on a number of test problems with 3, 5, 8, 10 objectives.

  abstract     = {Optical character recognition for the English text may be considered one of the most important research topics, whether, printed or handwritten. Although excellent results have been reached in the English text, there is a lack of this type of research in the Arabic text. This is because of the nature of the Arabic alphabet, and the multiplicity of forms of the same letter. Arabic handwritten character recognition (AHCR) systems involve several issues, and challenges from finding a suitable, and public Arabic handwritten text dataset phase to recognition, and classification phase passing through segmentation, and feature extraction phases. The paper objectives are: Firstly, a large, and complex Arabic handwritten characters’ dataset (HMBD) is presented for training, testing, and validation phases, as well as, discussing its collection, preparation, cleaning, and preprocessing. Secondly, we introduce a deep learning (DL) system with two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (named HMB1 and HMB2); with the appliance of optimization, regularization, and dropout techniques. This system can serve as a baseline for future research on handwritten Arabic text. Different performance metrics were calculated such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1. 16 experiments were applied to the described system using HMBD, and another two datasets: CMATER, and AIA9k. Experiments’ results were captured and compared to study the effects of weight initializers, optimizers, data augmentation, and regularization on overfitting, and accuracy. He Uniform weight initializer and AdaDelta optimizer reported the highest accuracies. Data augmentation showed an improvement in the accuracies. HMB1 reported testing accuracy of 98.4\% with 865,840 records using augmentation on HMBD. CMATER and AIA9k datasets were used for validating the generalization. Data augmentation was applied, and the best results were 100\%, and 99.0\% for testing accuracies, respectively. A cross-over validation between the described architectures, and a previous state-of-the-art architecture, and dataset was performed in two phases. First, the previous control architecture cannot generalize for the presented dataset in the current study. Second, the study described architectures generalize for the control dataset, with higher accuracies (97.3\%, and 96.8\% for HMB1, and HMB2, respectively), than the reported accuracy in the selected control study.},

  abstract     = {Since medical imaging is a fundamental step in clinical diagnosis and treatment, medical image processing is an attractive field for researchers. Among the different applications of medical image processing, this paper focuses on the segmentation task using a customized deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed network is developed based on the idea of improving a deep network performance and speeding up its learning process while using less parameters. Using the famous U-Net architecture which has proven its effectiveness in the segmentation field, the customization is done here by applying adaptive activation functions. In the proposed network, the U-Net complexity is reduced about 200 times by alleviating some parameters to accelerate the learning process. However, the important modification is the use of adaptive activation functions where each convolution layer learns its own data-adaptive activation function as a linear combination of 16 well-known basic functions. This modification successfully compensates the accuracy drop caused by parameter alleviation and also makes the model capable to be tuned with small amount of training data. Conducting several experiments on five famous retinal image datasets, namely DRIVE, STARE, CHASE, HRF, and ARIA, the proposed customized U-Net achieved 96\%, 97\%, 96\%, 97\%, and 95\% accuracy in segmenting blood vessels, respectively. The proposed network also showed 98\% accuracy on ISIC skin lesion dataset for segmenting the lesion area. The obtained results obviously confirm the high performance of the proposed customized network compared to the previous successful researches in handling the medical segmentation task. They also light the hope that many famous deep networks can benefit from these types of customization to become efficient compact models with the ability to handle lack of sufficient data.},

  abstract     = {Cluster analysis is an essential tool in data mining. Several clustering algorithms have been proposed and implemented, most of which are able to find good quality clustering results. However, the majority of the traditional clustering algorithms, such as the K-means, K-medoids, and Chameleon, still depend on being provided a priori with the number of clusters and may struggle to deal with problems where the number of clusters is unknown. This lack of vital information may impose some additional computational burdens or requirements on the relevant clustering algorithms. In real-world data clustering analysis problems, the number of clusters in data objects cannot easily be preidentified and so determining the optimal amount of clusters for a dataset of high density and dimensionality is quite a difficult task. Therefore, sophisticated automatic clustering techniques are indispensable because of their flexibility and effectiveness. This paper presents a systematic taxonomical overview and bibliometric analysis of the trends and progress in nature-inspired metaheuristic clustering approaches from the early attempts in the 1990s until today’s novel solutions. Finally, key issues with the formulation of metaheuristic algorithms as a clustering problem and major application areas are also covered in this paper.},

In general, subjects wearing a single-channel EEG electrode located at F8 (10–20 international standards) were required to perform mental tasks by mentally visualising the rotation of a star and mind relaxation at a specific time and by robot orientation. The visualisation of a rotating star suggests that the mobile robot is currently oriented towards a target, thus enabling target selection. We showed that proposed classifier obtained the best accuracy of 92.09\% in classifying the subject’s performing mental rotation task or mental relaxation when compared with conventional classification methods such as support vector machine—75.69\%, Kth-nearest neighbour—65.50\% and linear discriminant analysis—65.20\%. Furthermore, different from conventional methods, the use of 1D-CNN enables end-to-end learning, that is the automatic decoding of EEG signals without requiring feature selection or extraction. To validate that the proposed classifier performs better than conventional methods, the extracted kernel weights of proposed 1D-CNN filters were visualised as a temporal plot, and spectral analysis was performed on the extracted weights. The obtained results confirmed that the proposed 1D-CNN was able to generate filters that resemble the EEG wave patterns of different frequencies and spectral analysis confirmed that the filters exploited information from multiple frequency bands (such as alpha band and beta band) that are often associated with a heightened mental state when performing mental tasks.},

However, traditional NMF methods neglect the discriminative information and geometric structure of both the data space and the feature space, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a dual local learning regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (DLLNMF) method, which not only considers the geometric structure of both the data manifold and the feature manifold, simultaneously, but also takes advantage of the discriminative information of both the data space and the feature space. To make full use of the partial label information among samples, we further propose its semi-supervised extension, called dual local learning regularized nonnegative matrix factorization with label constraint (DLLNMF-LC), which imposes the label information as a hard constraint without additional parameters. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an adaptive backstepping control scheme for electrically driven robotic manipulator (EDRM) system with uncertainties and external disturbances by using neural network disturbance observer (NNDO) and dynamic surface control (DSC) design technique. NNDO is employed to estimate the uncertainties and external disturbances such that the priori information of the unknown dynamics will not be needed. To overcome the problem of “explosion of complexity” inherent in the backstepping design method, the DSC technique is integrated into the adaptive backstepping control design framework, where the NNDOs with adaptive composite law are utilized to compensate the uncertainties and external disturbances of EDRM. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it can be proven that the closed-loop system is stable in the sense that all the variables are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The results of simulation and experimental tests demonstrate the approximation capability of NNDO and the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive DSC scheme.},

Often drivers try to multitask which reduces their reaction time leading to accidents which could have been easily avoided if they had been attentive. As such problems are related to the driver’s negligence toward safety, a possible solution is to monitor driver’s behavior and notify if they are distracted. We propose a CapsNet-based approach for detecting the distracted driver which is a novel approach. The proposed method scores perform well on the real-world environment inputs when compared to other famous methods used for the same. Our proposed methods get high scores for all the most commonly used metrics for classification. On the testing set, the proposed method gets an accuracy of 0.90, 0.92 as precision score, 0.90 as recall score and 0.91 as F-measure.},

  abstract     = {Most existing extraction techniques in audio watermarking use conventional techniques in which some sets of special rules based on reverse embedding rules are used for watermark extraction and have many weaknesses, like very low robustness to destructive attacks. To overcome this problem, the use of machine learning-based methods has increased in recent years in this field. The disadvantage of these methods is the high reliance on a unique classifier and lack of proper efficiency when achieving high capacity, which is a major challenge in audio watermarking. The main purpose of this paper is to present a method that covers the weak points of conventional methods and simple intelligent methods and improves system performance using a synergistic combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble-intelligent extraction approach by proposed combination of trained machine learning classifiers. For the embedding operation in the proposed method, the DWT and the difference in energy levels obtained through DWT coefficients are used. In the extraction section, three methods are used in parallel: (a) the trained support vector machine (SVM) classifier with RBF kernel, (b) trained SVM classifier with quadratic kernel and (c) the trained K-nearest neighbor classifier; finally, the majority function is used to vote and make a final decision to create an intelligent-based watermark detector. A training set is required to train the classifiers, whose bit sequence is generated by a proposed 5-bit linear-feedback shift register. The results of various experiments indicate that this ensemble method has achieved the appropriate imperceptibility and high capacity, along with higher robustness compared to conventional techniques and individual learning classifiers.},

Conventional multi-exposure image fusion methods improve their fusion performance by designing sophisticated activity-level measurement and fusion rules. However, these methods have a limited success in complex fusion tasks. Inspired by the recent FusionGAN which firstly utilizes generative adversarial networks (GAN) to fuse infrared and visible images and achieves promising performance, we improve its architecture and customize it in the task of extreme exposure image fusion. To be specific, in order to keep content of extreme exposure image pairs in the fused image, we increase the number of discriminators differentiating between fused image and extreme exposure image pairs. While, a generator network is trained to generate fused images. Through the adversarial relationship between generator and discriminators, the fused image will contain more information from extreme exposure image pairs. Thus, this relationship can realize better performance of fusion. In addition, the method we proposed is an end-to-end and unsupervised learning model, which can avoid designing hand-crafted features and does not require a number of ground truth images for training. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on a public dataset, and the experimental result shows that the proposed model demonstrates better fusion ability than existing multi-exposure image fusion methods in both visual effect and evaluation metrics.},

The approach aims to enhance the generalization ability of ensemble in evolving data stream environment by balancing the accuracy and diversity of ensemble members.

  abstract     = {Social force model is one of the well-known approaches that can successfully simulate pedestrians’ movements realistically. However, it is not suitable to simulate high-density crowd movement realistically due to the model having only three basic crowd characteristics which are goal, attraction, and repulsion. Therefore, it does not satisfy the high-density crowd condition which is complex yet unique, due to its capacity, density, and various demographic backgrounds of the agents. Thus, this research proposes a model that improves the social force model by introducing four new characteristics which are gender, walking speed, intention outlook, and grouping to make simulations more realistic. Besides, the high-density crowd introduces irregular behaviours in the crowd flow, which is stopping motion within the crowd. To handle these scenarios, another model has been proposed that controls each agent with two different states: walking and stopping. Furthermore, the stopping behaviour was categorized into a slow stop and sudden stop. Both of these proposed models were integrated to form a high-density crowd simulation framework. The framework has been validated by using the comparison method and fundamental diagram method. Based on the simulation of 45,000 agents, it shows that the proposed framework has a more accurate average walking speed (0.36 m/s) compared to the conventional social force model (0.61 m/s). Both of these results are compared to the real-world data which is 0.3267 m/s. The findings of this research will contribute to the simulation activities of pedestrians in a highly dense population.},

Besides, it is essential to distinguish the inter-instance relations in input space and inter-label correlation relations in the output space on the multi-label datasets, which is conducive to improve the performance of the multi-label algorithm. However, most current multi-label algorithms aim to capture the mapping between instances and labels, while ignoring the information about instance relations and label correlations in the multi-label data structure. Motivated by these issues, we leverage the deep network to learn the special feature representations for multi-label components without abandoning overlapped features which may belong to other multi-label components. Meanwhile, the Euclidean matrices are leveraged to construct the diagonal matrix for the diffusion function, obtaining the new class latent representation by graph-based diffusion method preserve the inter-instance relations; it ensures that similar features have similar label sets. Further, considering that the contributions of these feature representation are different and have distinct influences on the final multi-label prediction results, the self-attention mechanism is introduced to fusion the other label-specific instance features to build the new joint feature representation, which derives dynamic weights for multi-label prediction.

This co-registration of data allows for robust, pixel-wise, statistical maps to be developed in the domain, leading to new insights regarding disease mechanisms. Deep learning technologies have given way to some impressive discoveries. In some applications, deep learning algorithms have surpassed the abilities of human image readers to classify data. As long as endpoints are clearly defined, and the input data volume is large enough, deep learning networks can often converge and reach prediction, classification and segmentation with success rates as high or higher than human operators. However, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are complex. Interpretability is not always a product of the classifications performed. Visualization techniques have been developed to add a layer of interpretability. The work presented here builds on a framework for augmenting statistical findings in medical imaging workflows with machine learning results. Utilizing the framework, visualization techniques for the machine learning portion are compared in an application, and a novel, lightweight technique for machine learning visualization is proposed as a means of increasing the portability of machine learning interpretability to Internet of Things applications. The novel visualization, hierarchical occlusion, can improve time to visualization by three orders of magnitude over a traditional occlusion sensitivity algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a general AMR parsing model which utilizes a two-stack-based transition algorithm for both Chinese and English datasets. It can incrementally parse sentences to AMR graphs in linear time. Experimental results demonstrate that it is superior in recovering reentrancy and handling arcs while is competitive with other transition-based neural network models on both English and Chinese datasets.},

Very few human-related metaheuristic algorithms were developed and solved this type of problem. It motivated us to check the performance of recently developed gaining–sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm (GSK), which is based on the concept of gaining and sharing knowledge of humans throughout their lifespan. It depends on two stages: beginners–intermediate gaining and sharing stage and intermediate–experts gaining and sharing stage. In this study, two approaches are proposed to solve feature selection problems: FS-BGSK: a novel binary version of GSK algorithm that relies on these two stages with knowledge factor 1 and FS-pBGSK: a population reduction technique that is employed on BGSK algorithm to enhance the exploration and exploitation quality of FS-BGSK. The proposed approaches are checked on twenty two feature selection benchmark datasets from UCI repository that contains small, medium and large dimensions datasets. The obtained results are compared with seven state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms; binary differential evolution, binary particle swarm optimization algorithm, binary bat algorithm, binary grey wolf optimizer, binary ant lion optimizer, binary dragonfly algorithm and binary salp swarm algorithm. It concludes that FS-pBGSK and FS-BGSK outperform other algorithms in terms of accuracy, convergence and robustness in most of the datasets.},

  abstract     = {Financial analysis of the stock market using the historical data is the exigent demand in business and academia. This work explores the efficiency of three deep learning (Dl) techniques, namely Bayesian regularization (BE), Levenberg–Marquardt (lM), and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), for training nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARX) for predicting specifically the closing price of the Egyptian Stock Exchange indices (EGX-30, EGX-30-Capped, EGX-50-EWI, EGX-70, EGX-100, and NIlE). An empirical comparison is established among the experimented prediction models considering all techniques for the time horizon of 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 5 days and 30 days in advance, applying on all the datasets used in this study. For performance evaluation, statistical measures such as mean squared error (MSE) and correlation R are used. From the simulation result, it can be clearly suggested that BR outperforms other models for short-term prediction especially for 3 days ahead. On the other hand, lM generates better prediction accuracy than BR- and SCG-based models for long-term prediction, especially for 7-day prediction.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) facilitates 3D face reconstruction, which takes a single image as an input and demonstrates significant performance in generating a detailed face geometry. The dependence of the extensive scale of labelled data works as a key to making CNN-based techniques significantly successful. However, no such datasets are publicly available that provide an across-the-board quantity of face images with correspondingly explained 3D face geometry. State-of-the-art learning-based 3D face reconstruction methods synthesize the training data by using a coarse morphable model of a face having non-photo-realistic synthesized face images. In this article, by using a learning-based inverse face rendering, we propose a novel data-generation technique by rendering a large number of face images that are photo-realistic and possess distinct properties. Based on the real-time fine-scale textured 3D face reconstruction comprising decently constructed datasets, we can train two cascaded CNNs in a coarse-to-fine manner. The networks are trained for actual detailed 3D face reconstruction from a single image. Experimental results demonstrate that the reconstruction of 3D face shapes with geometry details from only one input image can efficiently be performed by our method. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the efficiency of our technique to pose, expression and lighting dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Pathological color image segmentation is an exigent procedure due to the existence of imperceptibly correlated, and indistinct multiple regions of concern. Multi-level thresholding has been introduced as one of the most significant image segmentation procedures for pathological analysis. However, finding an optimal set of threshold values is an extremely time-consuming task, and crucially depends on the objective function criterion. In order to solve these problems, this paper presents a multi-level hematology color image thresholding approach with the assistance of a two-stage strategy called Eagle Strategy coupled with Whale Optimization Algorithm (ES-WOA), analyzing the performance over five well-known objective functions, namely; Kapur’s entropy, Fuzzy entropy, Tsallis’ entropy, Otsu’s method, and Cross entropy. A rigorous comparative study is performed among classical WOA and existing eagle strategy based optimization algorithms, considering a set of hematology color images, and common performance indexes evaluated by each objective function tested. Experimental results indicate that proposed ES-WOA in combination with Tsallis’ entropy outperforms the rest of tested algorithms in terms of computational effort, image segmentation quality, and robustness. For example, ES-WOA with Tsallis’ produces segmented images with average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values 16.0371, 17.9975, 21.1353, and 23.0759 for threshold values 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, which are superior to other tested methods. Additionally, the numerical results are statistically validated using a nonparametric approach to eliminate the random effect in the obtained results.},

The system incorporates ultrasonic sensor inputs coupled with image processing using OpenCV and deep learning algorithms to classify the surface faults detected. The proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model fared better compared to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), random forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms based on accuracy, R-squared value, F1 score, and Mean-Squared Error (MSE). To eliminate manual inspection, the location and status of the fault can be conveyed to a central location enabling immediate attention by utilizing GSM, GPS, and cloud storage-based technologies. The system is extended to a multi-robot framework designed to optimize energy utilization, increase the lifetime of individual robots, and improve the overall network throughput. Thus, the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is simulated using 100 robot nodes, and the corresponding performance metrics are obtained.},

  abstract     = {In an object detection system, the main objective during training is to maintain the detection and false positive rates under acceptable levels when the model is run over the test set. However, this typically translates into an unacceptable rate of false alarms when the system is deployed in a real surveillance scenario. To deal with this situation, which often leads to system shutdown, we propose to add a filter step to discard part of the new false positive detections that are typical of the new scenario. This step consists of a deep autoencoder trained with the false alarm detections generated after running the detector over a period of time in the new scenario. Therefore, this step will be in charge of determining whether the detection is a typical false alarm of that scenario or whether it is something anomalous for the autoencoder and, therefore, a true detection. In order to decide whether a detection must be filtered, three different approaches have been tested. The first one uses the autoencoder reconstruction error measured with the mean squared error to make the decision. The other two use the k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) and one-class SVMs (support vector machines) classifiers trained with the autoencoder vector representation. In addition, a synthetic scenario has been generated with Unreal Engine 4 to test the proposed methods in addition to a dataset with real images. The results obtained show a reduction in the number of false positives between 22.5\% and 87.2\% and an increase in the system’s precision of 1.2\% $$-47$$\% when the autoencoder is applied.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a new method for modeling human reasoning about objects’ similarities. We assume that similarity depends on perceived intensities of objects’ attributes expressed by natural language expressions such as low, medium, and high. We show how to find the underlying structure of the matrix with intensities of objects’ similarities in the factor-analysis-like manner. The demonstrated approach is based on fuzzy logic and set theory principles, and it uses only maximum and minimum operators. Similarly to classic eigenvector decomposition, we aim at representing the initial linguistic ordinal-scale (LOS) matrix as a max–min product of other LOS matrix and its transpose. We call this reconstructing matrix a neuromatrix because we assume that such a process takes place at the neural level in our brain. We show and discuss on simple, illustrative examples, how the presented way of modeling grasps natural way of reasoning about similarities. The unique characteristics of our approach are treating smaller attribute intensities as less important in making decisions about similarities. This feature is consistent with how the human brain is functioning at a biological level. A neuron fires and passes information further only if input signals are strong enough. The proposal of the heuristic algorithm for finding the decomposition in practice is also introduced and applied to exemplary data from classic psychological studies on perceived similarities between colors and between nations. Finally, we perform a series of simulation experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic.},

Recently, safety enhancement plays a significant role in construction site layout planning. This paper aims in developing an optimal construction site layout planning by fulfilling three main objectives, namely minimum cost facility, minimum risk of safety facility and minimum noise pollution. In addition to this, this paper also proposes a fuzzy-based bee colony optimization (FBCO) algorithm for tuning ρ and τ parameters so as to obtain a feasible and optimal solution. Also, this FBCO algorithm is employed to solve the construction site layout problem by satisfying the multi-objective function. Then, an FBCO-CLP approach is employed in obtaining a final optimal construction site layout plan. Moreover, the performance analysis of FBCO employs five benchmark functions to examine the effectiveness of the system for numerous aspects. Finally, a case study utilizes a residential building for verifying the proposed approach containing 13 temporary facilities. The experimental result reveals that the proposed FBCO-CSLP approach provides an optimal layout plan with minimum cost, noise pollution and safety risk facilities. Moreover, the comparative analysis is done by comparing the proposed approach with various other approaches such as ANN, GA, PSO, ABC and DE for three different types of facilities, namely cost facility, safety facility risk and noise facility. The experimental analysis reveals that the proposed approach provides better performances when compared with all other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Event Detection (ED) is an essential and challenging task in Information Extraction (IE). Recent advances in neural networks make it possible to build reliable models without complicated feature engineering. Neural network-based models commonly regard event detection as a char-wise or word-wise labeling task, which suffers from the problems of long-distance information miss-capturing, discontinuous labeling errors, etc., between characters/words and event triggers, especially in languages without natural word delimiters such as Chinese. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-layer Residual and Gated-Based Atrous Convolution Neural Network (RG-ACNN) framework, which attempts to alleviate above-mentioned problems. Specifically, the ACNN is introduced in our model to expand the receptive field to obtain multi-scale context information to capture dependencies between long-distance information. While gated and residual mechanisms are both imported to ACNN to improve our networks’ capability of the information filtering and aggregation. Besides, RG-ACNN performs event detection in a char-wise paradigm, where a novel “head-tail dual-pointer” labeled strategy is used to overcome the incomplete continuous labeling problem. Experiments on the ACE2005-CN and several standard benchmark datasets show that RG-ACNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

Then, we utilize spatial frequency, a gradient-based method to measure sharp variation from these deep features, to reflect activity levels. We apply some consistency verification methods to adjust the decision map and draw out the fused result. Our method analyzes sharp appearances in deep features instead of original images, which can be seen as another success story of unsupervised learning in image processing.

To cope with constrained communication resources, an event-triggered mechanism using switched thresholds is devised without involving input-to-state stability assumption, such that a better design flexibility and freedom can be provided. In addition, a minimum-learning-parameter-based state observer is developed to online estimate the unavailable states and uncertainties at the same time, which effectively eliminates the issue of learning explosion without sacrificing the identification precision. Furthermore, in pursuit of making a compromise between sampling cost and tracking performance, a modified barrier Lyapunov function based on a time-varying finite-time behavior boundary is constructed in the controller design, which can guarantee that the tracking error converges to a predetermined region within a specified time. Then by introducing the Nussbaum gain technique to handle the unknown control direction, an event-triggered neural output feedback control strategy is synthesized within the framework of dynamic surface control. Meanwhile, with the aid of Lyapunov synthesis, all the signals involved in the closed-loop system are proved to be bounded while Zeno phenomena is circumvented, and system outputs are well within the predefined region. Finally, an application on control design for a micro-electro-mechanical system gyroscope is given to validate the efficiency and superiority of proposed intelligent control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Phishing websites are on the rise and are hosted on compromised domains such that legitimate behavior is embedded into the designed phishing site to overcome the detection. The traditional heuristic techniques using HTTPS, search engine, Page Ranking and WHOIS information may fail in detecting phishing sites hosted on the compromised domain. Moreover, list-based techniques fail to detect phishing sites when the target website is not in the whitelisted data. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic technique using TWSVM to detect malicious registered phishing sites and also sites which are hosted on compromised servers, to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Our technique detects the phishing websites hosted on compromised domains by comparing the log-in page and home page of the visiting website. The hyperlink and URL-based features are used to detect phishing sites which are maliciously registered. We have used different versions of support vector machines (SVMs) for the classification of phishing websites. We found that twin support vector machine classifier (TWSVM) outperformed the other versions with a significant accuracy of 98.05\% and recall of 98.33\%.},

Usually, a significant amount of annotated data is required for neural network-based named entity recognition techniques. A semi-supervised approach is used to overcome the lack of large annotated data. We trained a deep neural network model on an initial (seed) set of resume education sections. This model is used to predict entities of unlabeled education sections and is rectified using a correction module. The education sections containing the rectified entities are augmented to the seed set. The updated seed set is used for retraining, leading to better accuracy than the previously trained model. This way, it can provide a high overall accuracy without the need of large annotated data. Our model has achieved an accuracy of 92.06\% on the named entity recognition task.},

These methods are designed to overcome the flaws and shortcomings of traditional crisp risk priority numbers and fuzzy FMEA techniques in risk rankings. The proposed methods consider subjective as well as objective weight values of all factors in risk rankings of identified failures. The FMEA experts team are allowed to submit their information by linguistic terms using Pythagorean fuzzy numbers. Both techniques use a Pythagorean fuzzy weighted averaging operator to aggregate their independent evaluations into group assessments. Subsequent steps are different. The PFH-TOPSIS approach computes the distances of failure modes from the Pythagorean fuzzy positive ideal solution and Pythagorean fuzzy negative ideal solution. To evaluate failure modes, the PFH-ELECTRE I approach produces Pythagorean fuzzy concordance and Pythagorean fuzzy discordance matrices. We illustrate the structure of both techniques with the help of flowcharts. The effectiveness of the methods that we develop is described by a numerical example, namely a case study of 1.8-in. color super-twisted nematic (CSTN). To validate their effectiveness and accuracy, we provide a comprehensive comparative analysis with existing techniques of risk evaluation, including intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid TOPSIS, intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS, IWF-TOPSIS, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods.},

  abstract     = {The design of networked nonlinear control system is a very challenging problem due to the coupling of the system uncertainties (e.g., model accuracy, noise, nonlinearity) and network effects (e.g., packet dropouts, time delay). In this paper, a deep representation-based predictive compensation method is proposed for networked nonlinear systems with packet-dropouts in the feedback and forward channel. Different from the existing compensation methods based on open-loop prediction, the proposed method is based on feedback compensation and does not require a nominal system model, so that it can avoid the coupling of system uncertainties and network effects as well as the occupation of network bandwidth. Specifically, a deep sequence to sequence learning scheme is firstly employed to encode the correlations of state and control sequences into deep feature representations. Furthermore, within the embedding space spanned by the learned features, according to the state-control sequence of each sampling step, a prediction of the next control command is generated as compensation for packet dropout. The stability of the overall system is rigorously proved by the Lyapunov theory, which reveals that the control errors for the networked control systems with packet dropouts asymptotic converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. We further evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy on a wheeled mobile robots simulation platform, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve high compensation accuracy and robustness concerning packet dropouts, even in the case of the maximum continuous packet dropouts specified by the network communication protocol.},

  abstract     = {Obfuscating an iris recognition system through forged iris samples has been a major security threat in iris-based authentication. Therefore, a detection mechanism is essential that may explicitly discriminate between the live iris and forged (attack) patterns. The majority of existing methods analyze the eye image as a whole to find discriminatory features for fake and real iris. However, many attacks do not alter the entire eye image, instead merely the iris region is affected. It infers that the iris embodies the region of interest (RoI) for an exhaustive search towards identifying forged iris patterns. This paper introduces a novel framework that locates RoI using the YOLO approach and performs selective image enhancement to enrich the core textural details. The YOLO approach tightly bounds the iris region without any pattern loss, where the textural analysis through local and global descriptors is expected to be efficacious. Afterward, various handcrafted and CNN based methods are employed to extract the discriminative textural features from the RoI. Later, the best-k features are identified through the Friedman test as the optimal feature set and combined using score-level fusion. Further, the proposed approach is assessed on six different iris databases using predefined intra-dataset, cross-dataset, and combined-dataset validation protocols. The experimental outcomes exhibit that the proposed method results in significant error reduction with the state of the arts.},

By training a homogeneous network and particular network separately, new forcing functions are able to be approximated quickly without the burden of retraining the full network. The network is demonstrated on several numerical examples including a nonlinear elasticity problem. In addition to providing meshfree approximations to strong form partial differential equations directly, this technique could also provide a foundation for deep learning methods to be used as preconditioners to traditional methods, where the deep learning method will get close to a solution and traditional solvers can finish the solution.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and efficient models for rainfall–runoff (RR) simulations are crucial for flood risk management. Recently, the success of the recurrent neural network (RNN) applied to sequential models has motivated groups to pursue RR modeling using RNN. Existing RNN based methods generally use either sequence input single output or unsynced sequence input and output architectures. In this paper, we propose a synced sequence input and output long short-term memory (LSTM) network architecture for hydrologic analysis and compare it to existing methods (sequence input single output LSTM). We expect the model will improve RR prediction in terms of accuracy, calibration training time, and computational cost. The key idea is to efficiently learn the long term dependency of runoff on past rainfall history. To be more specific, we use the indigenous ability of the LSTM network to preserve long term memory instead of artificially setting a time window for input data. In this way, we can avoid losing long term memory of the input, the calibration of the time window length, and excessive computation. The whole procedure mimics the traditional process-driven methods and is closer to the physics interpretation of the RR process. We conducted experiments on real-world hydrologic data from the Brays Bayou in Houston, Texas. Extensive experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of various statistical and hydrological related evaluation metrics. Notably, our experiment shows that some rainfall events could affect the runoff process in the test watershed for at least a week. For fine temporal resolution prediction, this long term effect needs to be carefully handled, and our proposed method is superior in this case.},

A precise model of PEMFC for accurate identification of its polarization curve and in-depth understanding of all its operating characteristics attracted the interest of many researchers. In this paper, novel meta-heuristic optimization methods have been successfully applied to evaluate the unknown parameters of PEMFC models, particularly Harris Hawks’ optimization (HHO) and atom search optimization (ASO) techniques. The proposed optimization algorithms have been tested on three different commercial PEMFC stacks, namely BCS 500-W PEM, 500W SR-12PEM and 250W stack, under various operating conditions. The sum of square errors (SSE) between the results obtained by the application of the estimated parameters and the experimentally measured results of the fuel cell stacks was considered as the objective function of the optimization problem. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the results are compared with that obtained in studies. Moreover, the I/V curves obtained by the application of HHO and ASO showed a clear matching with data sheet curves for all the studied cases. Finally, PEMFC model based on HHO technique surpasses all compared algorithms in terms of the solution accuracy and the convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {MRI is a broadly used imaging method to determine glioma-based tumors. During image processing, MRI provides large image information, and therefore, an accurate image processing must be carried out in clinical practices. Therefore, automatic and consistent methods are requisite for knowing the precise details of the image. The automated segmentation method inheres obstacles like inconsistency in tracing out the large spatial and structural inconsistency of brain tumors. In this work, a semantic-based U-NET-convolutional neural networks exploring a 3∗3 kernel’s size is proposed. Small kernels have an effect against overfitting in the deeper architecture and provide only a smaller number of weights in this network. Multiscale multimodal convolutional neural network (MSMCNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep learning semantic segmentation technique is used for multimodalities of magnetic resonance images (MRI). The proposed methodology aims to identify and segregate the classes of tumors by analyzing every pixel in the image. Further, the performance of semantic segmentation is enhanced by applying a patch-wise classification technique. In this work, multiscale U-NET-based deep convolution network is used for classifying the multimodal convolutions into three different scale patches based on a pixel level. In order to identify the tumor classes, all three pathways are combined in the LSTM network. The proposed methodology is validated by a fivefold cross-validation scheme from MRI BRATS’15 dataset. The experiment outcomes show that the MSMCNN model outperforms the CNN-based models over the Dice coefficient and positive predictive value and obtains 0.9214 sensitivity and 0.9636 accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays an essential role in detecting and understanding epileptic seizures. It is known that seizure processes are nonlinear and non-stationary, discriminating between rhythmic discharges and dynamic change is a challenging task in EEG-based seizure detection. In this paper, a new time-varying (TV) modeling framework, based on an autoregressive (AR) model structure, is proposed to characterize and analyze EEG signals. The TV parameters of the AR model are approximated through a multi-wavelet basis function expansion (MWBF) approach. An effective ultra-regularized orthogonal forward regression (UROFR) algorithm is employed to significantly reduce and refine the resulting expanded model. Given a time-varying process, the proposed TVAR–MWBF–UROFR method can generate a parsimonious TVAR model, based on which a high-resolution power spectrum density (PSD) estimation can be obtained. Informative features are then defined and extracted from the PSD estimation. The TVAR–MWBF–UROFR method is applied to a number of real EEG datasets; features obtained from these datasets are then used for seizure detection and classification. To make the results more accurate and reliable, a PCA algorithm is adopted to select the optimal feature subset, and a Bayesian optimization technique based on the Gaussian process is performed to determine the coefficients associated with each of the classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two benchmark datasets, and the experimental results indicate that TVAR–MWBF–UROFR outperforms the compared state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Random Weight Networks have been extensively used in many applications in the last decade because it has many strong features such as fast learning and good generalization performance. Most of the traditional training techniques for Random Weight Networks randomly select the connection weights and hidden biases and thus suffer from local optima stagnation and degraded convergence. The literature shows that stochastic population-based optimization techniques are well regarded and reliable alternative for Random Weight Networks optimization because of high local optima avoidance and flexibility. In addition, many practitioners and non-expert users find it difficult to set the other parameters of the network like the number of hidden neurons, the activation function, and the regularization factor. In this paper, an approach for training Random Weight Networks is proposed based on a recent variant of particle swarm optimization called competitive swarm optimization. Unlike most of Random Weight Networks training techniques, which are used to optimize only the input weights and hidden biases, the proposed approach will automatically tune the weights, biases, the number of hidden neurons, and regularization factor as well as the embedded activation function in the network, simultaneously. The goal is to help users to effectively identify a proper structure and hyperparameter values to their applications while obtaining reasonable prediction results. Twenty benchmark classification datasets are used to compare the proposed approach with different types of basic and hybrid Random Weight Network-based models. The experimental results on the benchmark datasets show that the reasonable classification results can be obtained by automatically tuning the hyperparameters using the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In graph theory, a vertex covering set $$V_\mathrm{C}$$ is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one of the vertices of the set $$V_\mathrm{C}$$ . The problems related to vertex covering are called vertex covering problems. Many real-life problems contain a lot of uncertainties. To handle such uncertainties, concept of fuzzy set/graph is used. Here, we consider the covering problems of fuzzy graph to model some real-life problems. In this paper, a vertex covering problem is modeled as a series of linear and nonlinear programming problems with the help of basic graph-theoretic concept. In this model, the following objectives are considered: (1) the total number of facilities, the coverage area and total efficiency of all facilities are maximized, whereas (2) the total cost for the covering problem is minimized. Some new sets are defined and determined to make best decision on the basis of the features of facilities of the fuzzy system. An illustration is given to describe the whole model. Application of the said vertex covering problem to make a suitable decision for the placement of CCTVs in a city with the help of the developed formulations is given in a systematic way. To find the solutions, some algorithms are designed and the mathematical software ‘LINGO’ is used to keep the fuzziness of the parameters involved in the problems.},

  abstract     = {Color face recognition has more attention recently since it considered one of the most popular biometric pattern recognitions. With a considerable development in multimedia technologies, finding a suitable color information extraction from color images becomes a hard problem. Several color face recognition methods have been developed. However, these methods still suffer from some limitations, such as increasing the number of extracted features, which leads to an increase in computational time. Besides, among those features some of them are redundant and irrelevant that will influence the quality of the recognition. Therefore, this paper presents a novel color face recognition method that depends on a new family of fractional-order orthogonal functions, which is called orthogonal fractional-order exponent functions. Then, using these functions as the basis functions of novel multi-channel orthogonal fractional-order exponent moments (FrMEMs), these novel descriptors are defined in polar coordinates over the unit circle and have many characteristics. A set of experimental series are performed using a set of well-known color face recognition and compared with other CFR techniques. Besides, a group of feature selection methods with different classifiers used to evaluate the number of extracted features is suitable or needs to be enhanced. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method based on FrMEMs outperforms other CFR methods. As well as, the recognition rate doesn’t influence by reducing the number of features using different FS methods.},

Aiming at the few-shot issue and multi-label attributes of single-point faults, a novel fault diagnosis method of rolling bearing based on time–frequency signature matrix (T–FSM) feature and multi-label convolutional neural network with meta-learning (MLCML) is proposed in this paper. At the beginning, the T–FSM features sensitive to few-shot fault diagnosis of measured vibration signal are extracted. Subsequently, a designed multi-label convolutional neural network (MLCNN) with a specific architecture is employed to identify faults. Crucially, the meta-learning strategy of learning initial network parameters susceptive to task changes is incorporated to MLCNN for addressing the few-shot problem. Ultimately, the publicly available rolling bearing dataset is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results exhibit that the trained MLCML has the capability of learning to learn few-shot fault attributes with outstanding diagnosis accuracy and generalization. More concretely, the model can adapt to new fault categories rapidly owing to that only a few samples and update steps are required to fine-tune the network.},

Vehicle detection techniques have made great strides in the past decades; however, there are still some challenges, such as the classification of tiny vehicles. The images of distant vehicles are generally blurred and lack detailed information due to their low resolutions. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method to generate high-resolution (HR) images from fuzzy images by employing a generative adversarial network (GAN). In addition, the dataset used for training standard GAN is generally constructed by down-sampling from the neutral HR images. Unfortunately, the effect of reconstruction is more modest. To cope with this trouble, we first construct our dataset by using three fuzzy kernels. Then, the exposure of the low-resolution (LR) image is adjusted randomly. Furthermore, a hybrid objective function is designed to guide the model to restore image details. The experimental results on the KITTI data set verify the effectiveness of our method for tiny vehicle classification.},

Several direct and indirect methods exist for identification of crop water stress, but they are time consuming, tedious and require highly sophisticated sensors or equipment. Image processing is one of the techniques which can help in the assessment of water stress directly. Machine learning techniques combined with image processing can aid in identifying water stress beyond the limitations of traditional image processing. Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained momentum recently for image classification and the convolutional neural network based on DL is being applied widely. In present study, comparative assessment of three DL models: AlexNet, GoogLeNet and Inception V3 are applied for identification of water stress in maize (Zea mays), okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and soybean (Glycine max) crops. A total of 1200 digital images were acquired for each crop to form the input dataset for the deep learning models. Among the three models, performance of GoogLeNet was found to be superior with an accuracy of 98.3, 97.5 and 94.1\% for maize, okra and soybean, respectively. The onset of convergence in GoogLeNet models commenced after 8 epochs with 22 (maize), 31 (okra) and 15 (soybean) iterations per epoch with error rate of less than 7.5\%.},

SPP is discerned mitigating the problem found in conventional pooling by having multi-level pooling stacked together to extend the features being fed into a fully connected layer. Provided with inputs of varying sizes, SPP also yields a fixed-length feature representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted to scrutinize the CNN–SPP performance on two well-known American sign language (ASL) datasets and one NUS hand gesture dataset.

In particular, the Z-type neural dynamics (ZND) that has emerged in recent years shows that it can completely converge to the ideal solution for the real-time-dependent QP in the ideal situation, i.e., without noise. It is worth noting that noise substantially influences the accuracy of neural-dynamics models in the process of solving the problems. Nevertheless, the existing neural-dynamics methods show limited capacity of noise tolerance, which may seriously affect their application in practical problems. By exploiting the Z-type design formula and two nonlinear activation functions, this work proposes a prescribed-time convergent and noise-tolerant ZND (PTCNTZND) model for calculating real-time-dependent QPs under noisy environments. Theoretical analyses of the PTCNTZND model show that it can be accelerated to prescribed-time convergence to the time-dependent optimal solution, and has natural anti-noise ability. The upper bound of the convergence time is also derived theoretically. Finally, the performance of the PTCNTZND model was verified by experiments, and the results substantiate the excellent robustness and convergence characteristics of the proposed PTCNTZND model for calculating real-time-dependent QPs, as compared with the existing ZND models.},

  abstract     = {Most zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods aim to learn a mapping from visual feature space to semantic feature space or from both visual and semantic feature spaces to a common joint space and align them. However, in these methods the visual and semantic information are not utilized sufficiently and the useless information is not excluded. Moreover, there exists a strong bias problem that the instances from unseen classes always tend to be predicted as some seen classes in most ZSL methods. In this paper, combining the advantages of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a method based on bidirectional projections between the visual and semantic feature spaces is proposed. GANs are used to perform bidirectional generations and alignments between the visual and semantic features. In addition, cycle mapping structure ensures that the important information are kept in the alignments. Furthermore, in order to better solve the bias problem, pseudo-labels are generated for unseen instances and the model is adjusted along with them iteratively. We conduct extensive experiments at traditional ZSL and generalized ZSL settings, respectively. Experiment results confirm that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performances on the popular datasets AWA2, aPY and SUN.},

  abstract     = {The ride comfort of bus passengers is a critical factor that is recognised to attract greater ridership towards a sustainable public transport system. However, it is challenging to estimate bus passenger comfort onboard while travelling due to the complex non-linear interaction among various factors. A practicable method to collect real-time comfort ratings by passengers is also not readily available. This study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model with three layers to precisely estimate real-time ride comfort of bus passengers. The inputs are vehicle-related parameters (speed, acceleration and jerk), passenger-related features (posture, location, facing, gender, age, weight and height), ride comfort index in ISO 2631-1997 (vibration dose value and maximum transient vibration value), and output is passenger rating (collected from a specialised mobile application). The ANN model provided a satisfactory performance and good correlation between inputs and output with an average MSE = 0.03 and R-value = 0.83, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to quantify the relative contribution of each variable in the ANN model, revealing similar contributions among all influencing factors in the range of 4–6\%. On average, passenger-related factors contribute slightly higher than vehicle-related factors to the ride comfort estimation based on the connection weight approach. The development of ANN model which can precisely estimate bus ride comfort is important as a considerable amount of machine learning and artificial intelligence are utilised to guide autonomous bus (AB). The present findings can help AB designers and engineers in improving AB technology to achieve a higher level of passengers’ onboard comfort.},

The problem with such a recognition system is the huge dimensions of the feature vectors. Many of these features are irrelevant to the classification mechanism. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a novel feature selection (FS) model called cooperative genetic algorithm (CGA) to select some of the most important and discriminating features from the entire feature set to improve the classification accuracy as well as the time requirement of the activity recognition mechanism. In CGA, we have made an effort to embed the concepts of cooperative game theory in GA to create a both-way reinforcement mechanism to improve the solution of the FS model. The proposed FS model is tested on four benchmark video datasets named Weizmann, KTH, UCF11, HMDB51, and two sensor-based UCI HAR datasets. The experiments are conducted using four state-of-the-art feature descriptors, namely HOG, GLCM, SURF, and GIST. It is found that there is a significant improvement in the overall classification accuracy while considering very small fraction of the original feature vector.},

The existing 3D CNN-based action recognition methods mainly perform 3D convolutions on individual cues (e.g. appearance and motion cues) and rely on the design of subsequent networks to fuse these cues together. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-cue 3D convolutional neural network (M3D), which integrates three individual cues (i.e. an appearance cue, a direct motion cue, and a salient motion cue) directly. Different from the existing methods, the proposed M3D model directly performs 3D convolutions on multiple cues instead of a single cue. Compared with the previous methods, this model can obtain more discriminative and robust features by integrating three different cues as a whole. Further, we propose a novel residual multi-cue 3D convolution model (R-M3D) to improve the representation ability to obtain representative video features. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of proposed M3D model, and the proposed R-M3D model (pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset) achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art models on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.},

However, it is still challenging to design MOEAs for overlapping community detection on large-scale complex networks due to the curse of dimensionality. Along this avenue, this paper proposes a local-to-global scheme-based MOEA named LG-MOEA for overlapping community detection on large-scale complex networks, which mainly consists of two stages: a local community structure detection stage and a global community structure determination stage. To be specific, in the local community structure detection stage, the key nodes that are central to community and essential to the connectedness of community are firstly identified. Then for each key node, an MOEA with the proposed community boundary control strategy is suggested to detect a set of local overlapping communities through local expansion around the key node. In the global community structure determination stage, a single objective evolutionary algorithm is adopted to search for a suitable local overlapping community for each key node and combine them as one global community partition of the whole network. The proposed LG-MOEA is compared with several competitive overlapping community detection algorithms on both real-world small-scale and large-scale networks, and the experimental results show its superiority for overlapping community detection in terms of the generalized normalized mutual information gNMI and the extended modularity $$Q_{ov}$$ , especially has competitive superiority for large-scale complex networks.},

First, the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) was improved using these maps. Then, the new chaotic S-boxes were designed based on the ergodic maps. After that, the improved PSO was used for optimization to obtain the best S-boxes. This optimization was performed once by selecting nonlinearity as a fitness function. At the second optimization, the entropy source was selected as a fitness function for optimization by examining the P-value of the mono-test frequency. Finally, the related results for the introduced chaotic S-boxes were compared to the optimized chaotic S-boxes with two types of fitness functions.

First, a recurrent mechanism, based on wavelet transform fuzzy Markov chain algorithm, is introduced to obtain adaptive recurrent values and accelerate convergence speed of the network. Second, a self-organization mechanism, based on weighted dynamic time warping algorithm and sensitivity analysis algorithm, is presented to optimize the network structure. Third, the convergence of SORFNN-MTSA is theoretically analyzed to show the efficiency in both fixed structure and self-organizing structure cases. Finally, several benchmark nonlinear systems and a real application of wastewater treatment are used to verify the effectiveness of SORFNN-MTSA.

  abstract     = {Skills extraction is a critical task when creating job recommender systems. It is also useful for building skills profiles and skills knowledge bases for organizations. The aim of skills extraction is to identify the skills expressed in documents such as resumes or job postings. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem. These methods already perform well when it comes to extracting explicitly mentioned skills from resumes. But skills have different levels of abstraction: high-level skills can be determined by low-level ones. Instead of just extracting skill-related terms, we propose a multi-label classification architecture model based on convolutional neural networks to predict high-level skills from resumes even if they are not explicitly mentioned in these resumes. Experiments carried out on a set of anonymous IT resumes collected from the Internet have shown the effectiveness of our method reaching 98.79\% of recall and 91.34\% of precision. In addition, features (terms) detected by convolutional filters are projected on the input resumes in order to present to the user, the terms which contributed to the model decision.},

  abstract     = {Dispatching rules (DRs) represent heuristic methods designed for solving various scheduling problems. Since it is hard to manually design new DRs, genetic programming is used to design them automatically. Most DRs are designed in a way that they can be applied under dynamic conditions. On the other hand, static problems are usually solved using various metaheuristic methods. However, situations exist in which metaheuristics might not be the best choice for static problems. Such situations can occur when the schedule needs to be constructed quickly so that the system starts executing as soon as possible, or when it is possible that certain changes happen during the execution of the system. For these cases, DRs are more suitable since they execute faster and can adapt to dynamic changes in the system. However, as most research is focused on developing DRs for dynamic conditions, they would perform poorly under static conditions, since they would not use all the information that is available. Therefore, there is a need to enable automatic development of DRs suitable for static and offline conditions. The objective of this paper is to analyse several methods by which automatically generated DRs can be adapted for static and offline scheduling conditions. In addition to look-ahead and iterative DRs which were studied previously, this paper proposes new terminal nodes, as well as the application of the rollout algorithm to adapt DRs for static conditions. The performance and execution time of all methods are compared with the results achieved by automatically generated DRs for dynamic conditions and genetic algorithms. The tested methods obtain a wide range of results and prove to be competitive both in their performance and execution speed with other approaches. As such, they are a viable alternative to metaheuristics since they can be used in situations where metaheuristics could not, but can offer either a better execution time or even competitive results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new nature-inspired human-based optimization algorithm is proposed which is called coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO). The inspiration of CHIO is originated from the herd immunity concept as a way to tackle coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The speed of spreading coronavirus infection depends on how the infected individuals directly contact with other society members. In order to protect other members of society from the disease, social distancing is suggested by health experts. Herd immunity is a state the population reaches when most of the population is immune which results in the prevention of disease transmission. These concepts are modeled in terms of optimization concepts. CHIO mimics the herd immunity strategy as well as the social distancing concepts. Three types of individual cases are utilized for herd immunity: susceptible, infected, and immuned. This is to determine how the newly generated solution updates its genes with social distancing strategies. CHIO is evaluated using 23 well-known benchmark functions. Initially, the sensitivity of CHIO to its parameters is studied. Thereafter, the comparative evaluation against seven state-of-the-art methods is conducted. The comparative analysis verifies that CHIO is able to yield very competitive results compared to those obtained by other well-established methods. For more validations, three real-world engineering optimization problems extracted from IEEE-CEC 2011 are used. Again, CHIO is proved to be efficient. In conclusion, CHIO is a very powerful optimization algorithm that can be used to tackle many optimization problems across a wide variety of optimization domains.},

  abstract     = {Echo state network belongs to a kind of recurrent neural networks that have been extensively employed to model time-series datasets. The function of reservoir in echo state network is expected to extract the feature context from time-series datasets. However, generalization of echo state networks is limited in real-world application because the architectures of the network are fixed and the hyper-parameters are hard to be automatically determined. In the present study, the ensemble Bayesian deep echo network (EBDEN) model with deep and flexible architecture is proposed. Such networks with deep architecture progressively extract more dynamic echo states through multiple reservoirs than those with the shallow reservoir. To enhance the flexibility of the configuration for the network, this study investigates the Bayesian optimization procedure of hyper-parameters and ensures the suitable hyper-parameters to activate the network. In addition, when dealing with more complex time-series datasets, ensemble mechanism of EBDEN can measure the redundancy for the channels of the time series without sacrificing the algorithm’s performance. In this paper, the deep, optimization and ensemble architectures of EBDEN are verified by experiments benchmarked on multivariate time-series repositories and realistic tasks such as chaotic series representation and Dansgaard–Oeschger estimation tasks. According to the results, EBDEN achieves high level of the goodness-of-fit and classification performance in comparison with state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Mitigation of power quality events (PQEs) needs an accurate, faster, and efficient detection and classification technique for designing the compensating devices as a remedial measure to the problem. This study motivates on this issue to formulate a better technique based on fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) and extreme learning machine (ELM). FRFT is considered for relevant feature extraction due to its characteristics like enhanced order control and capability to provide time, frequency, and intermediate time–frequency depictions for any non-stationary power signals. The possibility of multi-domain feature extraction capability due to its easy order control arrives at a robust feature matrix, which makes the classification more accurate. An optimal ELM-based classifier is designed by tuning its system parameters applying modified teaching–learning-based optimization (MTLBO). This optimal ELM is implemented in this study along with FRFT to formulate the proposed approach denoted as FRFT–MTLBO–ELM. To give a good reason for the enhanced performance of the proposed technique, noisy and hybrid synthetic signals of ten PQEs are generated and tested considering fully all real-time condition cases. At last, a comparative result is presented with other applied signal processing-based approaches and it is found that the proposed FRFT–MTLBO–ELM approach is very effective and comparatively better justifying its real-time implementation in the monitoring systems.},

The essence of our model is two innovative differentiable modules, determination network and parameterized division, which perform the spatial division in feature maps of classification networks. After training, the learned parameters of the spatial division would correspond to a set of predicted bounding box coordinates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for multi-label classification and weakly supervised detection, we conduct extensive experiments on the multi-MNIST dataset. Experimental results show our spatial division networks can (1) help improve the accuracy of multi-label classification, (2) implement in an end-to-end way only with the image-level annotations, and (3) output accurate bounding box coordinate, thereby achieving multi-digits detection.},

An automatic recognition of performed hand signs facilitates a number of applications, especially for people with speech impairment to communication with normal people. This framework which is called ASLNN proposes a new hand posture recognition technique for the American sign language alphabet based on the neural network which works on the geometrical feature extraction of hands. A user’s hand is captured by a three-dimensional depth-based sensor camera; consequently, the hand is segmented according to the depth analysis features. The proposed system is called depth-based geometrical sign language recognition as named DGSLR. The DGSLR adopted in easier hand segmentation approach, which is further used in segmentation applications. The proposed geometrical feature extraction framework improves the accuracy of recognition due to unchangeable features against hand orientation compared to discrete cosine transform and moment invariant. The findings of the iterations demonstrate the combination of the extracted features resulted to improved accuracy rates. Then, an artificial neural network is used to drive desired outcomes. ASLNN is proficient to hand posture recognition and provides accuracy up to 96.78\% which will be discussed on the additional paper of this authors in this journal.},

In this paper, we propose a novel two-model local search algorithm with a self-adaptive parameter (TMLS $$\_$$ SA) to solve CPP. First, a simple solution is presented, that is, one vertex per group is used. Then, we present a two-model local search that is used to improve the solution which comprises a move operator model and an exchange operator model. In the local search phase, a gain function is used to guide the search toward a possible best solution, and a lock mechanism is also applied to prevent the local search from immediately returning to visited solutions. Finally, we execute a perturbation procedure to increase the diversity. The perturbation strength is updated self-adaptively according to the solutions obtained. Our algorithm TMLS $$\_$$ SA is compared with several representative algorithms, and the experimental results show that TMLS $$\_$$ SA is superior to competitors on almost all test instances with respect to the solution quality.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to propose a useful likelihood measure for determining scalar function order relations and developing a novel likelihood-based optimization ordering model for solving multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems based on Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets. This paper scrutinizes PF order relations based on scalar functions to compare sophisticated uncertain information and establish a precedence order. By way of scalar function order relations, this paper utilizes scalar functions that are associated with Pythagorean membership grades and admissible upper approximations to present a novel likelihood measure in PF contexts. With the aid of useful concepts, such as levels of agreement and disagreement and comprehensive performance values, this paper originates a PF likelihood-based optimization ordering model to acquire the optimal group consensus solution for addressing MCGDM problems. Practical applications and several comparative studies are performed to reveal the practicality and strong points of the proposed methodology in tackling real-world MCGDM issues within uncertain environments of PF sets. This paper finds that the new scalar function-based likelihood measure is more flexible and beneficial than the current probability distribution approach. Furthermore, an easy-to-use algorithmic procedure can realize the proposed methodology to efficaciously process sophisticated PF information and improve the understandability of a decision model via a likelihood comparison approach. The originality and main contributions of this work are fourfold: (1) A PF likelihood measure is introduced as a basis for scalar function order relations; (2) the PF likelihood-based optimization ordering model is established for consensus ranking; (3) a predominant procedure is constructed for addressing PF information; and (4) the likelihood-based decision models are enriched under complex uncertainty.},

In this paper, a boosting attention fusion generative adversarial network (BAF-GAN) was proposed, which allows boosting idea and attention mechanism modeling for high-quality image denoising. Specifically, several boosting module groups (BMGs) with group skip connection were employed to form denoiser. Each BMG contains some boosting attention fusion blocks (BAFBs). Each BAFB consists of parallel spatial attention unit and channel attention unit interleaved connection. Moreover, the multi-dimensional inner skip connection within BAFB can carry abundant informative features. Besides, spatial and channel attention mechanisms were also embedded in the discriminator to enhance its ability of discriminating various dimensional information. Meanwhile, a new loss function was given to assist the training process of the model. BAF-GAN can be applied to remove image noise, e.g., Gaussian noise and mixed noise. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the BAF-GAN has the state-of-the-art performance.},

In this research, based on the problem associated with the analysis on time-series economic data, efficient handling method and model are put forward in the face of multi-series analysis task. Also, combined with the association rules, trend correlation and self-trend correlation among multiple series, a trend and correlation deep neural network model (TC-DNM) is established and then tested and verified by using three kinds of economic datasets with representativeness based on the trend analysis task handed by multi-series analysis. The results show that the model proposed in this research is effective than a number of baseline models, can be employed to achieve precision–recall balance and also possesses strong reusability.

  abstract     = {Upper extremity (UE) neuromuscular dysfunction critically affects post-stroke patients from performing activities of daily life. In this regard, various rehabilitation robotics have been developed for providing assistive and/or resistive forces that allow stroke survivors to train their arms towards regaining the lost arm function. However, most of the rehabilitation systems function in a passively such that they only allow patients navigate already-defined trajectories that often does not align with their UE movement intention, thus hindering adequate motor function recovery. One possible way to address this problem is to use a decoded UE motion intent to trigger active and intuitive motor training for the patients, which would help restore their UE arm functions. In this study, a new approach based on spatiotemporal neuromuscular descriptor and adaptive filtering technique (STD-AFT) is proposed to optimally characterize multiple patterns of UE movements in post-stroke patients towards providing inputs for intelligently driven motor training in the rehabilitation robotic systems. The proposed STD-AFT performance was systematically investigated and assessed in comparison with commonly adopted methods via high-density surface electromyogram recordings obtained from post-stroke survivors who performed 21 distinct classes of pre-defined limb movements. Furthermore, the movement intent decoding was done using four different classification algorithms. The experimental results showed that the proposed STD-AFT achieved significant improvement of up to 13.36\% (p &lt; 0.05) in characterizing the multiple patterns of movement intents with relatively lower standard-error value even in the presence of the external interference in form of noise compared to the existing benchmark methods. Also, the STD-AFT showed obvious pattern seperability for individual movement class in a two-dimensional space. The outcomes of this study suggest that the proposed STD-AFT could provide potential inputs for active and intuitive motor training in robotic systems targeted towards stroke-rehabilitation.},

Therefore, a new method of CT-LSTM is proposed in this paper, in which the prediction model is established by combining chi-square test (CT) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network model. CT is used to determine the influencing factors of air quality. The hourly air quality data and meteorological data from Jan. 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2018 are used to train the LSTM network model. The data from Jan. 1, 2019 to Dec. 31, 2019 are used to evaluate the LSTM network model. The AQI level of Shijiazhuang of Hebei Province of China from Jan. 1, 2019 to Dec. 31, 2019 is predicted with five methods (SVR, MLP, BP neural network, Simple RNN and this paper&#39;s new method). Then, a contrastive analysis of the five prediction results is made. The experimental results show that the accuracy of this new method reaches 93.7\%, which is the highest in the five methods and the maximum error of this new method is 1. The correct number of days predicted by this new method is also the highest among the five methods, which is 342 days. The new method also shows good characteristics in MAE, MSE and RMSE, which makes it more accurate for people to predict the AQI level.},

However, these researches mainly focus on the time distribution of tweets related to a given query. And this single time characteristics might not be sufficient to reflect time characteristics of microblog. Inspired by the recent success of time-based language models for microblog retrieval, this paper proposes a time segment language model (TSLM) to model the time characteristics of microblog. Briefly, TSLM constructs the language model of each time segment to model the probability distribution over sequences of words for each different time segment. Based on TSLM, the time distribution of terms (tDT), the time distribution of queries (tDQ) and the time distribution of documents (tDD) are proposed. Furthermore, TSLM is exploited to estimate the query model, the document model and compute the similarity between query and document. The experimental results on the Tweets2011 corpus show that the proposed approaches outperform several state-of-the-art baselines.},

The Cobb angle quantifying the degree of spinal curvature is the gold standard for a scoliosis assessment.

However, we notice that these methods utilize segmentation and landmark information separately. In this light, we propose an automated architecture that uses combined segmentation with landmark information to estimate 68 landmarks of 17 vertebrae. In addition, we consider spinal curvature described by 68 landmarks as a constraint to estimate the Cobb angle. Extensive experiment results which test on 240 X-rays demonstrate that our method improves the landmark estimation performance effectively and reduces the Cobb angle error.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid development of the economy, more and more people begin to invest into the stock market. Accurately predicting the change of stock price can reduce the investment risk of stock investors and effectively improve the investment return. Due to the volatility characteristics of the stock market, stock price prediction is often a nonlinear time series prediction. Stock price is affected by many factors. It is difficult to predict through a simple model. Therefore, this paper proposes a CNN-BiLSTM-AM method to predict the stock closing price of the next day. This method is composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN), bi-directional long short-term Memory (BiLSTM), and attention mechanism (AM). CNN is used to extract the features of the input data. BiLSTM uses the extracted feature data to predict stock closing price of the next day. AM is used to capture the influence of feature states on the stock closing price at different times in the past to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, this method and other seven methods are used to predict the stock closing price of the next day for 1000 trading days of the Shanghai Composite Index. The results show that the performance of this method is the best, MAE and RMSE are the smallest (which are 21.952 and 31.694). R2 is the largest (its value is 0.9804). Compared with other methods, the CNN-BiLSTM-AM method is more suitable for the prediction of stock price and for providing a reliable way for investors’ to make stock investment decisions.},

The source of economic data can be the data related to economy held by the National Bureau of statistics and a various software. These multi-source and heterogeneous data have important value for economic analysis and forecasting. Taking into account the limitations of existing methods such as low accuracy and complex calculations, this paper proposes an economic data analysis and prediction method based on machine learning. We use machine learning to solve the data fusion problem in the process of multi-source data analysis and prediction in the economic field. Specifically, we proposes an economic data analysis and forecasting method combining convolutional auto-encoder and extreme gradient boosting algorithms. This method uses a convolutional auto-encoder to extract the data characteristics of the normalized parameter sequence and uses it to train an extreme gradient boosting model to predict the level of economic development and evaluate the importance of each influencing factor. Finally, through a case study, this paper integrates the data of labor force, education and population to forecast GDP. Through the verification of this case, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is higher than the AE-XGBoost method and CAE-1D-XGBoost method used in this experiment, and the error is kept below 11.7\%.},

This problem, together with the ease of distributing information through the Internet (blogs, social networks, etc.), has led to a tendency for information to be accepted as true without its veracity being questioned. Image counterfeiting has become a major threat to the credibility of the information. To deal with this threat, forensic image analysis is aimed at detecting and locating image forgeries using multiple clues that allows it to determine the veracity or otherwise of an image. In this paper, we present a method for the authentication of images. The proposed method performs detection of copy-move alterations within an image, using the discrete cosine transform. The characteristics obtained from these coefficients allow us to obtain transfer vectors, which are grouped together. Through the use of a tolerance threshold, it is possible to determine whether there are regions copied and pasted within the analysed image. The results obtained from the experiments reported in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For the evaluation of the proposed methods, experiments were carried out with public databases of falsified images that are widely used in the literature.},

To solve the privacy leakage problem of deep learning in robot systems and fill the gap in robotics deep learning privacy research, in this paper a novel privacy-preserving image multi-classification deep-learning (PIDL) model in robot systems is presented. In PIDL, two schemes are proposed that adopt two groups of encrypted activation and cost functions—sigmoid plus cross-entropy function (PIDLSC) and softmax plus log-likelihood function (PIDLSL)—with secure calculation protocols, which are applied in a fog control center (FCC) with a non-colluding honest server by homomorphic encryption to improve the training efficiency, solve the encryption computation questions, and protect data and model privacy in robot systems. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed schemes realize security, correctness, and efficiency with low communication and computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Given that the traditional image restoration algorithm cannot generate high-quality false images and the restoration accuracy for the large-area damaged images is low, this study proposed the restoration algorithm of large-area damaged images based on the generative adversarial network. First of all, this study extracted multi-scale edge detailed information in image damage area through building the smooth function. Secondly, this study built the generative adversarial network model by using the multi-scale edge detailed information as the original information of large-area damaged images and then trained the model to generate the best false images through the continuous game between the generator and discriminator. Finally, this study obtained the existing information of the false images by combining the contextual information and the perceptual information, calculated the priority of information and restored the information according to the optimal sequencing results and continuously updated the damaged edge information until the large-area damaged image restoration is completed. The results show that the accuracy of extracting the detailed information with the proposed algorithm is high, and peak signal-to-noise ratio of the false images generated by the generative adversarial network model is high, the structural similarity index with the real image is not less than 0.93, the quality of the false images is high, the accuracy rate of priority calculation of the restoration information is high, and the restoration accuracy for large-area damaged images is far ahead of other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As an important part of modern marine monitoring systems, ship target identification has important significance in maintaining marine rights and monitoring maritime traffic. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, image detection and recognition based on deep learning methods have become the most popular and practical method. In this paper, two deep learning algorithms, the Mask R-CNN algorithm and the Faster R-CNN algorithm, are used to build ship target feature extraction and recognition models based on deep convolutional neural networks. The established models were compared and analyzed to verify the feasibility of target detection algorithms. In this study, 5748 remote sensing maps were selected as the dataset for experiments, and two algorithms were used to classify and extract warships and civilian ships. Experiments showed that for the accuracy of ship identification, Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN reached 95.21\% and 92.76\%, respectively. These results demonstrated that the Mask R-CNN algorithm achieves pixel-level segmentation. Compared with the Faster R-CNN algorithm, the obtained target detection effect is more accurate, and the performance in target detection and classification is better, which reflects the great advantage of pixel-level recognition.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the Internet has become a trend in the development of the global automotive industry. Numerous Internet companies have joined the automobile manufacturing industry. At the same time, people generally search for information about cars on the Internet as an important reference to purchase decisions before buying them. As a high-value commodity, almost all consumers use search engines to find out the price, reputation and other information about their favorite models before they buy. On the other hand, online reviews contain a large amount of information about what consumers are saying about products, and they influence the purchasing decisions of potential consumers. It is observed that current reviews of automobiles can include several dimensions: corporate brand attention, corporate development and user reputation. In order to provide reference for users and car manufacturers, this paper established a systematic model of Internet car evaluation system based on topic feature extraction, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and the deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). Firstly, the model uses feature extraction and LSTM for sentiment analysis of user evaluations; secondly, considering anomalies in the sample processing, which makes it difficult to cover the distribution of the entire review sample, we proposed a way to train without using too many anomalous samples using DCGAN. The results show that this method can achieve an effective systematic evaluation of Internet cars using only a large sample of normal review events. The results can be used as a reference for people to buy a car and for car companies to optimize their products.},

Finally, ATP-DenseNet makes the final prediction combining the two pathways. Experimental results show the efficiency of ATP-DenseNet, and the proposed method performs better than other researches.

Moreover, the determination of health normality in respect to the management of hypertension patients is possible, but it is essentially important to incorporate preventive healthcare. Thus, further studies on deep learning-based prediction technology using previous data are needed. This paper proposes the development of an intelligent healthcare management system that can help to manage the health of hypertensive patients.

  abstract     = {Neurocomputing studies on consumer attitudes have recently made a significant contribution to branding psychology. This study investigates consumer decisions for a branded stimulus using advanced machine learning algorithms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded during experiments in which ten branded and ten unbranded smartphones were shown to the subjects as stimuli. Then, EEG signals were classified using a methodological approximation consisting of four stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, channel selection, and classification. This is the first time a four-stage methodology has been applied in a neuromarketing study. The analysis study employed autoregressive (AR), principal component analysis (PCA), and piecewise constant modeling (PCM) in the feature extraction stage; artificial bee colony (ABC) and independent component analysis (ICA) in the channel selection stage; and artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) in the classification stage. By comparing the successes of the methods in each stage, the methodological combination that gives the best classification performance was determined. According to the results, 72\% accuracy was obtained in the average classification and an 85\% accuracy on an individual basis. In the classification that achieved the best success, PCA in feature extraction, ABC in channel selection, and ANN in classification were used. In addition, the AF3-F7 (frontal brain regions) channels were observed to be the best-decomposed channel pair for different classes. The results also showed that stimulation within the brain for a branded product occurred at about 200 ms after the stimulus onset.},

To solve the task, we improve U-Net architecture by ResNeXt cells firstly. Further, we focus on the reasonability of features in neural networks with cardinality dimension and propose the cascaded way of re-using the features among blocks in particular cardinal dimensions. The reuse of the already trained features leads to composing more robust features and more efficient usage of neural network parameters. We test our cascaded cells together with three various U-Net versions for four different settings of hyperparameters with the conclusion that the system of cascaded features leads to higher accuracy than the other versions with the same number of parameters. Also, the cascaded cells are more robust to overfitting the dataset. The obtained results are confirmed on two additional public datasets.},

Moreover, the lack of a sufficient number of N-grams for the Kurdish language, for instance, five-grams, is the reason for the rare use of next Kurdish word prediction. Furthermore, the improper display of several Kurdish letters in the RStudio software is another problem. This paper provides a Kurdish corpus, creates five, and presents a unique research work on next word prediction for Kurdish Sorani and Kurmanji. The N-gram model has been used for next word prediction to reduce the amount of time while typing in the Kurdish language.

This limitation is due to the highly nonlinear relation between the mortar’s compressive strength and the mixed components. In this paper, the application of artificial intelligence techniques toward the prediction of the compressive strength of cement-based mortar materials with or without metakaolin has been investigated. Specifically, surrogate models (such as artificial neural network, ANN and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, ANFIS models) have been developed to the prediction of the compressive strength of mortars trained using experimental data available in the literature. The comparison of the derived results with the experimental findings demonstrates the ability of both ANN and ANFIS models to approximate the compressive strength of mortars in a reliable and robust manner. Although ANFIS was able to obtain higher performance prediction to estimate the compressive strength of mortars compared to ANN model, it was found through the verification process of some other additional data, the ANFIS model has overfitted the data. Therefore, the developed ANN model has been introduced as the best predictive technique for solving problem of the compressive strength of mortars. Furthermore, using the optimum developed model an ambitious attempt to reveal the nature of mortar materials has been made.},

  abstract     = {With the accumulation of data, the intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings has achieved fruitful results, but it is costly to acquire and label data for industrial application. A series of studies achieve the reuse of knowledge from bearings in scientific test rigs (BSTRs) to bearings in industrial applications (BIAs) via transfer learning. Nevertheless, most of the cases ignore a constraint: the industrial datasets suffers from class imbalance. In general, industrial datasets lack data samples of fault states. To this end, we propose a pseudo-categorized maximum mean discrepancy (PCMMD), and use it to drive the multi-input multi-output convolutional network (MIMOCN) to narrow the cross-domain distribution discrepancy of various categories in the deep feature space. Firstly, the domain-shared encoder and classifier are pre-trained based on the source-domain labeled dataset. Then, the labeled source-domain data and unlabeled target-domain data are jointly used to train the MIMOCN. The pseudo-labels enable the PCMMD to measure the intra-class cross-domain distribution discrepancy. The target-domain reconstruction object function improves the credibility of target-domain deep feature. The transfer cases from artificial damaged BSTRs to real damage BSTRs verify the stability of the proposed PCMMD. In the case of transfer learning from balanced BSTRs to BIAs lacking fault samples, the diagnosis accuracy of BIAs is higher than that of existing methods.},

One of these factors is the overlapping problem which plays an even larger role in the classification performance deterioration but is always ignored in previous study. In this paper, we propose a density-based adaptive k nearest neighbor method, namely DBANN, which can handle imbalanced and overlapping problems simultaneously. To do so, a simple but effective distance adjustment strategy is developed to adaptively find the most reliable query neighbors. Concretely, we first partition training data into six parts by density-based method. Next, for each part, we modify distance metric by considering both local and global distribution. Finally, output is made by the query neighbors selected in the new distance metric. Noticeably, the query neighbors of DBANN are adaptively changed according to the degree of imbalance and overlap. To show the validity of our proposed method, experiments are carried out on 16 synthetic datasets and 41 real-world datasets. The results supported by the proper statistical tests show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a novel method for the detection of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) from a multi-lead ECG signal. Left Ventricle walls become thick due to prolonged hypertension which may fail to pump heart effectively. The imaging techniques can be used as an alternative diagnose LVH; however, they are more expensive and time-consuming than proposed LVH. To overcome this issue, an algorithm to the diagnosis of LVH using ECG signal based on machine learning techniques were designed. In LVH detection, the pathological attributes such as R wave, S wave, inversion of QRS complex, changes in ST segment noticed in the ECG signal. This clinical information extracted as a feature by applying continuous wavelet transform. The signals were reconstructed with the frequency between 10 and 50 Hz from the wavelet. This followed by the detection of R wave and S wave peaks to obtain the relevant LVH diagnostic features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Ensemble of Bagged Tree, AdaBoost classifiers were employed and the results are compared with four neural network classifiers including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Scaled Conjugate Gradient Backpropagation Neural Network (SCG NN), Levenberg–Marquardt Neural Network (LMNN) and Resilient Backpropagation Neural network (RPROP). The data source includes Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and healthy ECG signal from PTB diagnostic ECG database and St Petersburg INCART 12-Lead Arrhythmia Database. The results revealed that the proposed work can diagnose LVH successfully using neural network classifiers. The accuracy in detecting LVH is 86.6\%, 84.4\%, 93.3\%,75.6\%, 95.6\%, 97.8\%, 97.8\%, 88.9\% using SVM, KNN, Ensemble of Bagged Tree, AdaBoost, MLP, SCG NN, LMNN and RPROP classifiers, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Selective manipulation of data attributes using deep generative models is an active area of research. In this paper, we present a novel method to structure the latent space of a variational auto-encoder to encode different continuous-valued attributes explicitly. This is accomplished by using an attribute regularization loss which enforces a monotonic relationship between the attribute values and the latent code of the dimension along which the attribute is to be encoded. Consequently, post training, the model can be used to manipulate the attribute by simply changing the latent code of the corresponding regularized dimension. The results obtained from several quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the proposed method leads to disentangled and interpretable latent spaces which can be used to effectively manipulate a wide range of data attributes spanning image and symbolic music domains.},

In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of five typical MTL methods with deep learning architectures for a broad range of representative NLP tasks.

  abstract     = {The multi-offspring method has been recognized as an efficient approach to enhance the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. However, some pre-screening strategies should be used when a multi-offspring-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to solve computationally expensive problems. So far, there is no any reported comprehensive study that compares the effects of different pre-screening strategies on the performance of the multi-offspring-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, four pre-screening strategies (convergence-based, maximin distance-based expected improvement matrix (EIM-based), diversity-based and random-based strategies) for the multi-offspring-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm are compared. The convergence-based strategy gives more priority to non-dominated solutions, and it is vital for exploiting the current promising areas. The diversity-based strategy gives more priority to solutions with greater uncertainties, and it is important for exploring the sparse areas. The EIM-based strategy considers the exploration and exploitation simultaneously, and the random-based strategy gives no priority to any solution. A series of benchmark problems whose dimensions vary from 8 to 30 and a reactive power optimization problem are used to test the multi-offspring-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm under the four pre-screening strategies. The experimental results show that the convergence-based strategy performs best on most of the simple problems, while the EIM-based strategy performs best on most of the complex problems. The diversity-based strategy can produce positive effects on some problems, while the random-based strategy cannot improve the performance of its basic algorithm.},

Wind speed forecasting plays a fundamental role in overcoming such challenging issues and, thus, assisting the power utility manager in optimizing the supply–demand balancing through wind energy generation. This paper suggests a new hybrid scheme WNN, based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) combined with artificial neural network (ANN), for wind speed forecasting. More specifically, this work aims at designing the most appropriate discrete wavelet filters, best adapted to a one day ahead wind speed forecasting. The optimized DWT filters are intended to effectively preprocess the wind speed time series data in order to enhance the prediction accuracy. Using wind speed data collected from three different locations in the Magherbian region, the obtained simulation results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other conventional wavelet-based forecasting structures regarding the wind speed prediction precision. Moreover, compared to the standard wavelet ‘db4’ based approach, the optimized wavelet filter-based structure leads to a forecasting accuracy improvement, in terms of RMSE and MAPE index errors, that amounts to nearly 13\% and 19\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel effective optimization algorithm called enhanced coyote optimization algorithm (ECOA). This proposed method is applied to optimally select the position and capacity of distributed generators (DGs) in radial distribution networks. It is a multi-objective optimization problem where properly installing DGs should simultaneously reduce the power loss, operating costs as well as improve voltage stability. Based on the original coyote optimization algorithm (COA), ECOA is developed to be able to expand the search area and retain a good solution group in each generation. It includes two modifications to improve the efficiency of the original COA approach where the first one is replacing the central solution by the best current solution in the first new solution generation technique and the second focuses on reducing the computation burden and process time in the second new solution generation step. In this research, various experiments have been implemented by applying ECOA, COA as well as salp swarm algorithm (SSA), Sunflower optimization (SOA) for three IEEE radial distribution power networks with 33, 69 and 85 buses. Obtained results have been statistically analyzed to investigate the appropriate control parameters and to verify the performance of the proposed ECOA method. In addition, the performance of ECOA is also compared to various similar meta-heuristic methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (HGA-PSO), simulated annealing, bacterial foraging optimization algorithm, backtracking search optimization algorithm, harmony search algorithm, whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and combined power loss index-whale optimization algorithm (PLI-WOA). Detailed comparisons show that ECOA can determine more effective location and size of DGs with faster speed than other methods. Specifically, the improvement levels of the proposed method over compared to SFO, SSA, and COA can be up to 2.1978\%, 0.7858\% and 0.2348\%. Furthermore, as compared to other existing methods in references, ECOA achieves the significant improvements which are up to 31.7491\%, 20.2143\% and 22.7213\% for the three test systems, respectively. Thus, the proposed method is a favorable method in solving the optimal determination of DGs in radial distribution networks.},

Based on the MEC, the content and services provided by information system are closer to users to increase mobile network speed, reduce latency and improve connection reliability. In this paper, we propose an interactive data information system based on mobile edge detection, which is divided into client and server. The server mainly provides services such as content and user login and rights management for the client. The client needs to log into the server to run normally. Among them, the interactive data server is a favorable support and guarantee for the client. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher efficiency and fault tolerance.},

Considering the importance of scene and semantic information for visual recognition, in this paper, the improvement of the object detection algorithm is realized from three parts. Firstly, the basic residual convolution module is fused with the separable convolution module to construct a depth-wise separable convolution network (D_SCNet-127 R-CNN). Then, the feature map is sent to the scene-level region proposal self-attention network to re-identify the candidate area. This part is composed of three parallel branches: semantic segmentation module, region proposal network, and region proposal self-attention module. Finally, this paper uses deep reinforcement learning combined with a border regression network to achieve precise location of the object, and improve the calculation speed of the entire model through a light-weight head network. This model can effectively solve the limitation of feature extraction in traditional object detection and obtain more comprehensive detailed features. The experimental on MSCOCO17, Pascal VOC07, and Cityscapes datasets shows that the proposed method has good validity and scalability.},

Nowadays, human biometric techniques are the most secure methods for authentication purposes that cover the problems of older types of authentication like passwords and pins. There are many advantages of recent biometrics in terms of security; however, they still have some disadvantages. Progresses in technology made some specific devices, which make it possible to copy and make a fake human biometric because they are all visible and touchable. According to this matter, there is a need for a new biometric to cover the issues of other types. Brainwave is human data, which uses them as a new type of security authentication that has engaged many researchers. There are some research and experiments, which are investigating and testing EEG signals to find the uniqueness of human brainwave. Some researchers achieved high accuracy rates in this area by applying different signal acquisition techniques, feature extraction and classifications using Brain–Computer Interface (BCI). One of the important parts of any BCI processes is the way that brainwaves could be acquired and recorded. A new Signal Acquisition Strategy is presented in this paper for the process of authorization and authentication of brain signals specifically. This is to predict image memorability from the user’s brain to use mental imagery as a visualization pattern for security authentication. Therefore, users can authenticate themselves with visualizing a specific picture in their minds. In conclusion, we can see that brainwaves can be different according to the mental tasks, which it would make it harder using them for authentication process. There are many signal acquisition strategies and signal processing for brain-based authentication that by using the right methods, a higher level of accuracy rate could be achieved which is suitable for using brain signal as another biometric security authentication.},

Firstly, a type-2 fuzzy multigranulation system has been designed for the classification task dealing with noisy and nonlinear microarray gene expression patterns. Thereafter, the fuzzy if–then rules have been devised on the feature vectors of microarray to enable accurate bilinear classification process. The fuzzy if–then rules in the domain of type-2 fuzzy multigranulation system are able to identify efficient expression patterns that have been deferentially expressed from normal state to carcinogenic state. The proposed method reduces the structural complexity of the fuzzy if–then rules (type 1) since it works on upper and lower membership functions instead of a single membership function. In addition, a fuzzy rough approximation has been utilized in the model to reduce the computational cost. Lastly, the association among genes consisting of significantly different expression patterns from normal state to malignant state has been recognized with respect to their nature. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been implemented on eight microarray gene expression datasets for human breast cancer patients. Moreover, we have validated the results by F-score and NCBI database which signify that the proposed model performs better in comparison with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {In real-world binary classification problems, the entirety of samples belonging to each class varies. These types of problems where the majority class is notably bigger than the minority class can be called as class imbalance learning (CIL) problem. Due to the CIL problem, model performance may degrade. This paper presents a new support vector machine (SVM) model based on density weight for binary CIL (DSVM-CIL) problem. Additionally, an improved 2-norm-based density-weighted least squares SVM for binary CIL (IDLSSVM-CIL) is also proposed to increase the training speed of DSVM-CIL. In IDLSSVM-CIL, the least squares solution is obtained by considering 2-norm of slack variables and solving the primal problem of DSVM-CIL with equality constraints instead of inequality constraints. The basic ideas behind the algorithms are that the training datapoints are given weights during the training phase based on their class distributions. The weights are generated by using a density-weighted technique (Cha et al. in Expert Syst Appl 41(7):3343–3350, 2014) to reduce the effects of CIL. Experimental analyses are performed on some interesting imbalanced artificial and real-world datasets, and their performances are measured using the area under the curve and geometric mean (G-mean). The results are compared with SVM, least squares SVM, fuzzy SVM, improved fuzzy least squares SVM, affinity and class probability-based fuzzy SVM and entropy-based fuzzy least squares SVM. Similar or better generalization results indicate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {A method to predict time series using multiple deep learners and a Bayesian network is proposed. In this study, the input explanatory variables are Bayesian network nodes that are associated with learners. Training data are divided using K-means clustering, and multiple deep learners are trained depending on the cluster. A Bayesian network is used to determine which deep learner is in charge of predicting a time series. We determine a threshold value and select learners with a posterior probability equal to or greater than the threshold value, which could facilitate more robust prediction. The proposed method is applied to financial time-series data, and the predicted results for the Nikkei 225 index are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Source localization with a network of low-cost motes with limited processing, memory, and energy resources is considered in this paper. The state-of-the-art methods are mostly based on complicated signal processing approaches in which motes send their (processed) data to a fusion center (FC) wherein the source is localized. These methods are resource-demanding and mostly do not meet the limitations of motes and network. In this paper, we consider distributed detection where each mote performs a binary hypothesis test to detect locally the existence of a desired source and sends its (potentially erroneous) decision to FC during just one bit (1 indicates source existence and 0 otherwise). Hence, both processing and bandwidth constraints are met. We propose to use an artificial neural network (ANN) to correct erroneous local decisions. After error correction, the region affected by the source is specified by nodes with decision 1. Moreover, we propose to localize the source by deep learning in FC which converts the network of decisions 1 and 0 to a black and white image with white pixels in the locations of motes with decision 1. The proposed schemes of error correction by ANN (ECANN) and source localization with deep learning (SoLDeL) were evaluated in a fire detection application. We showed that SoLDeL performs appropriately and scales well into large networks. Moreover, the applicability of ECANN in delineation of farm management zones was illustrated.},

In this study, the abilities for accuracy and agreement of Kriging model-based nonlinear interpolation strategy are investigated in terms of predicting the shear strength of rock joints. Totally 84 datasets were used to construct the Kriging models; the datasets were divided into two main parts: training and testing. The prepared database was applied to the training phase in the Kriging model; this way, several nonlinear basic functions were introduced to enhance the predictions of the Kriging model. The examined functions in this paper were linear, 2-order, 3-order, exponential, logarithmic, logistic, hyperbolic tangent, and hyperbolic sine. The sigmoid forms of the basic functions, including logistic and hyperbolic tangent, provide the superior predictions compared to other mathematical functions, while the 2-order and 3-order forms provide the worst performances than the linear, exponential, and logarithmic functions. According to the obtained results, the logistic-based model with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.916 was found the optimal model that can be successfully applied to estimating the shear strength of rock joints.},

Most diabetes complications may be avoided by controlling the blood glucose levels exhaustively. Moreover, a prediction of future glucose levels has shown to be fundamental in helping patients to plan and modify their treatment in real-time. In this paper, a glucose predictor based on long short-term memory neural networks is designed. Three input parameters are fed to the predictor: past glucose levels obtained from a continuous glucose monitoring sensor, the insulin units administered by an insulin pump and the patient’s carbohydrates intake. Different prediction times and input dimensions have been evaluated in order to provide the best prediction to patients. Results encourage the use of glucose predictions to avoid the occurrence of hypoglycemias, anticipate correction actions, and to increase the quality of life of these patients.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven mathematical models are powerful prediction tools, which are utilized to approximate solution responses obtained using numerical saltwater intrusion simulation models. Employing data-driven prediction models as a replacement of the complex groundwater flow and transport models enables prediction of future scenarios. Most important, it also helps save computational time, effort and requirements when developing optimal coastal aquifer management methodologies using complex and large-scale coupled simulation–optimization models. In this study, a new data-driven mathematical model, namely group method of data handling (GMDH)-based prediction models, is developed and utilized to predict salinity concentration in a coastal aquifer by mimicking the responses of a variable-density flow and solute transport numerical simulation model. For comparison and evaluation purpose, the prediction performances of GMDH models were compared with well-established support vector machine regression and genetic programming based models. In addition, one important characteristic of the GMDH models is explored and evaluated, i.e. the ability to identify a set of most influential input predictor variables (pumping rates) that had the most significant impact on the outcomes (salinity concentration at monitoring locations). To confirm variable importance, 3 tests are conducted in which new GMDH models are constructed using subsets of the original datasets. In TEST 1, new GMDH models are constructed using a set of most influential variables (consisting of pumping rates at selected locations) only. In TEST 2, a subset of 20 variables (10 most and least influential variables) is used to develop new GMDH models. In TEST 3, a subset of the least influential variables is used to develop GMDH models. The performance evaluation results demonstrate that GMDH models developed using the entire dataset had reasonable prediction accuracy and efficiency. The comparison performance evaluation results for the three test scenarios highlighted the importance of the appropriate selection of relevant input pumping rates when developing accurate prediction models. The results suggested that incorporating the least influential variables deteriorate the accuracy of the prediction models; thus, considering the most influential pumping rates it is possible to develop more accurate and efficient salinity prediction models. Overall, the evaluation results from this study establish that the GMDH models and the inherent input variable ranking capability can be utilized as accurate and efficient coastal saltwater intrusion prediction models. Hence, GMDH models are viable saltwater intrusion modelling tools, which can be employed in future regional-scale saltwater intrusion prediction and management investigations.},

In this sense, the k-fold validation technique selected for the selection of the testing and validation purposes. Also, the variables of the ANFIS algorithm (i.e., the number of clusters), and the PSO algorithm (the population size were optimized using a series of trial and error process. The second main objective of the current study was to assess the applicability of PSO–ANFIS in estimating the ultimate bearing capacity of the strip footing resting on a single cohesionless slope when it was subjected to an external vertical applied stress. The input parameters were the soil properties (Stype) (classified into five different classes from the weakest, shown as S1, to the strongest type, displayed in higher order), slope angle (β), setback distance ratio (b/B) (the distance of the footing from the slope crest to the footing width), and vertical settlement (Uy) of the footing, while the main output was the applied vertical stresses (Fy) that can be applied on the footing. Note that the ultimate bearing capacity (Fult) is the maximum vertical stress when Uy = 0.1 B. A thorough comparison between the measured FEM simulations, the proposed ANFIS and PSO–ANFIS models were carried out to demonstrate their effectiveness in predicting a reliable Fult resting on cohesionless slopes.},

  abstract     = {Existing methods of well logging interpretation often contain uncertainties in the exploration and evaluation of carbonate reservoirs due to the complex pore types. Based on the time–frequency analysis of array acoustic logging data, the identification of pore types based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was established. The continuous wavelet transform was first used to transform the 1-D acoustic wave data into 2-D time–frequency spectra as the input data of the CNN based on the pore aspect ratios. According to the acoustic logging data obtained from numerical simulations, a three-type (vug, interparticle-pores, and crack) prediction was established to validate the identification method. The noise-sensitivity analyses demonstrate that our method is stable for noise mixed signals. The CNN-based identification method was used to analyze the field acoustic logging data in a carbonate reservoir. According to the description of the pore structures from the core analysis, the formation pores were divided into two types (cracks and interparticle-pores). The accuracy of the method using field acoustic logging data can reach 90\%. This work provides promising means for pore type identification from complex acoustic logging data by applying deep learning technologies, which can be easily extended into other similar neighboring carbonate reservoirs.},

Due to the influence of factors such as changes in the state of object in actual scene, occlusion and background changes, object detection method of deep learning still has following problems: features extracted by backbone network are noisy and not representative, the positive and negative samples are not balanced, and labeled object is inaccurate due to occlusion. Therefore, this paper proposes an object detection method based on global feature augmentation and adaptive regression. HRFPN extracts more representative high-resolution features and performs global augmentation, which can effectively distinguish feature differences between object and background. In training phase, uniform sampling is introduced to mine hard samples, and the positive and negative samples in RPN phase are balanced to improve detection performance, and adaptive bounding box regression loss is proposed to reduce the influence of object occlusion and boundary blur. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO2017 datasets show that the proposed detection method is superior to the latest methods such as Cascade RCNN, CornerNet and Mask RCNN, which has better robustness and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of economic globalization, the trade of various countries has become increasingly close and thus the rapid growth of container transportation business. The rational choice of transportation routes and intermodal transportation methods has become a hot topic in this field. In order to improve the efficiency of intermodal transportation and reduce the cost of intermodal transportation, this paper studies the evaluation of the synergy effect of container multimodal transportation based on the BP neural network algorithm. First, it is determined that the multi-attribute decision-making method is used to comprehensively evaluate the synergy effect of container multimodal transportation, and the data are normalized. Select the appropriate hidden layer nodes, use Matlab to determine the learning rate, select the logsig function for the network transfer function, select Traingdx as the training function, and establish a container multimodal transport synergy evaluation model based on BP neural network. Secondly, the model is solved, and the problem is transformed into finding the shortest route from Q to P without exceeding the cost and time constraints. Then carry on the simulation experiment, use Matlab to solve the transportation time and total cost between cities. Experimental data show that when the number of iterations is 800, the algorithm begins to converge; at the fifth training, the error between the actual output and the expected output is only 0.0004; in route B, the time of multimodal transportation is 48.18\% less than that of single transportation, and the cost is saved by 50.02\%. This shows that the container multimodal transport synergy evaluation model based on BP neural network can accurately evaluate the effects, and container multimodal transport can indeed improve transportation efficiency and save costs.},

It is very necessary to study the adaptive motion control of the manipulator based on machine learning. The robot with the adaptive motion of the manipulator can carry out logistics express sorting, operate in the doors and windows outside the building, and pick fruits in the orchard, which can ensure the effective implementation of hard work. Therefore, this paper proposes a mechanical adaptive control method based on a neural network. According to the motion model of the manipulator, the RBF neural network model is used to judge the stability of the system according to the Lyapunov function. The related algorithms of machine learning and multi-degree of freedom manipulator are studied and improved. The RBF neural network model approximates the unknown function infinitely and then establishes the complex motion model. Aiming at the adaptive neural network of a manipulator, a network adaptive terminal control method is proposed. Firstly, a stable manipulator motion system is designed by using a neural network, and then the terminal synovial controller is designed by using backstepping control technology. The stability of the method is proved by using the approximation virtual control technology of the neural network. The adaptive control is realized by using the learning and self-adaptability of the neural network; thus, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is realized.},

  abstract     = {Some scholars have shown that the machine learning methods based on a single-source data can successfully monitor the risks of formal financial activities, but not those of informal financial activities. This is because the data generated by formal financial activities, whether it is the structured or unstructured data, are of high quality and quantity, while the data generated by informal financial activities are not. Therefore, multi-source data are the key to monitor the risks of informal financial activities through machine learning. Although a few studies attempted to use multi-source data for financial risk prediction, they simply stack the obtained multi-source data, but ignore the original sources, heterogeneity, mutual redundancy and other characteristics of the data, so that the improvement of the prediction effect is not obvious. Therefore, TSAIB_RS method based on the two-stage adaptive integration of multi-source heterogeneous data was constructed in the paper, in which the data with different sources and different distributions were adaptively integrated. In order to test the reliability of TSAIB_RS method, the paper takes the default risk of microcredit in China as the test target and compares the prediction results of various test methods. It concludes that TSAIB_RS method can significantly improve the prediction effects.},

  abstract     = {During different periods of rock fracture engineering, the surrounding rock is subject to intermittent and periodic vibration disturbances of different degrees. This disturbance has a great influence on the permeability characteristics of bedrock fissures. The permeability characteristics of bedrock fissure permeability are the most important hydrogeological element of underground water-containing medium, and determining the stratum permeability is an important link to evaluate the hydrogeological conditions of the mining area. Therefore, this paper studies the permeability characteristics of bedrock fissures based on the disturbance of neural network. First, use the basic structure of the neural network to understand the method applied to the study of permeability characteristics of bedrock cracks; secondly, put forward the rock permeability model driven by coal mining to help the subsequent experimental design of various relevant factors after the bedrock cracks Finally, the stress intensity factor method at the tip of the fracture is used to calculate the permeability of the bedrock fracture. The experimental data shows that the infiltration rate tested in the first minute of the experiment is 5.5 * 10−4 cm/s, which is equivalent to 12 times the stable infiltration rate. At 50 min after the start of the test, the infiltration rate dropped to 4.6 * 10−4 cm/s, which was close to the stable infiltration rate. The experimental results show that under the disturbance condition of neural network, the infiltration rate of bedrock fissures is accelerated and the permeability is increased.},

For the moment, some of the solutions are concentrating on reducing data distribution discrepancy in different domains, but they ignore unlabeled samples in the target domain. To address this problem, we propose the cross-view similarity exploration (CVSE) method, which combines style-transferred samples to optimize the CNN model and the relationship between samples. It mainly includes two stages. In stage-I, we use starGAN to train a style transfer model, which generates images of multiple camera styles for increasing the quantity and diversity of samples. In stage-II, we propose incremental optimization learning, which iterates between similarity grouping and CNN model optimization to progressively explore the potential similarities of all training samples. Furthermore, with the purpose of reducing the impact of label noise on performance, we propose a new ranking-guided triplet loss, which is on the basis of similarity and does not require any label to select reliable triple samples. We perform a mass of experiments on Market-1501, and DukeMTMC-reID datasets prove that the proposed CVSE is competitive to the most advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {In the context of the rapid development of computer technology, communication between various languages has become increasingly important. Among the research methods of named entities, the research on named entity translation methods based on machine translation is one of the research hotspots. Named entity translation is to realize the switching between entities in two languages, which can be used by browsers, translators, etc., and can greatly reduce the cost of communication between people from all over the world. Due to the immaturity of the existing translation model technology and the lack of integration, the translation of bilingual named entities with unique composition is very challenging. Based on this, this paper proposes a fusion method of bilingual entity class named entity translation based on chunk symmetry strategy and English–Chinese transliteration model based on machine learning strategy. According to the bilingual corpus, a more standard candidate entity translation pair is generated through bilingual named entity alignment. The transliteration model is used to reorder and correct the candidate translation results, so as to achieve the correct selection of translation pairs. Experiments show that the model based on the translation of named entity translations based on chunks and transliteration models based on machine learning strategies not only effectively solves the problem of difficulty in word ordering and selection in bilingual translation, but also makes extraction to a certain extent. The accuracy of the translation results has been improved.},

The work selected the multiple financial indicators based on big data mining in Internet of Things. The rules between all financial indicators were found to choose more representative financial risk indicators. Then the frequent fuzzy option set was determined by FCM (fuzzy cluster method), parallel rules, and parallel mining algorithm, thus obtaining the fuzzy association rules that satisfy the minimum fuzzy credibility. Finally, the relevant data of listed companies were selected to analyze the corporate financial risks, which verified the method proposed in the work.},

Mobile video transmission faces complex environments, and the quality of service (QoS) of mobile video networks is very important for mobile entertainment applications. To evaluate the QoS of mobile video networks, outage probability (OP) is an important criterion. However, the mobile video networks gradually become complex, dynamic, and variable, which make it increasingly more difficult to predict the OP performance. In this paper, we investigate the OP performance analysis and prediction. The OP expressions are derived in exact closed-form. Then, based on the characteristics of mobile data, we have established a prediction model based on generalized regression (GR) neural network. A GR-based OP performance intelligent prediction algorithm is proposed. Compared with other methods, our proposed approach can obtain a better prediction effect. The prediction accuracy of the proposed approach can be increased by 64\% and 58\%, respectively. The running time is also the shortest.},

The purpose of protecting people’s privacy is achieved by interfering with the Top-N recommendation algorithm on the Internet signal. In response to people’s concerns, the Top-N recommendation algorithm with integrated neural network was used during the experiment. The experimenters were randomly selected from netizens who frequently used computers to measure the privacy and security of each group of researchers and the signal of the Top-N recommendation algorithm. Interference level. The use of the Top-N recommendation algorithm is divided into six levels, and the experimentally measured information protection rate is 88\% when the use level of the Top-N recommendation algorithm is F level. In the case of signal interference, the interference intensity is divided into five levels. Similarly, when the signal interference intensity is 5, the information leakage rate is at least 10\%. The selection of personnel throughout the experiment is random and the interference during the experiment and the use of the Top-N recommendation algorithm with integrated neural network are divided according to levels. The research results show that when the signal interference intensity is 5 and the recommended algorithm is F, the privacy protection of netizens is the best.

Thus it may be translated in a large number of fully different but equally correct ways. In the absence of multiple references, reference-dependent evaluations like Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) cannot identify potentially correct translation results. The explore on automatic evaluation of Ancient-Modern Chinese Translation is completely lacking. In this paper, we proposed an automatic evaluation metric for Ancient-Modern Chinese Translation called DTE (Dual-based Translation Evaluation), which can be used to evaluate one-to-many alignment in the absence of multiple references. When using DTE to evaluate, we found that the proper nouns often could not be correctly translated. Hence, we designed a new word segmentation method to improve the translation of proper nouns without increasing the size of the model vocabulary. Experiments show that DTE outperforms several general evaluations in terms of similarity to the evaluation of human experts. Meanwhile, the new word segmentation method promotes the Ancient-Modern Chinese translation models perform better on proper nouns’ translation, and get higher scores on both BLEU and DTE.},

  abstract     = {The spelling error is a mistake occurred while typing the text document. The applications like search engines, information retrieval, emails, etc., require user typing. In such applications, good spell-checker is essential to rectify the misspelling. Spell-checkers for western languages like English are very powerful and can handle any type of spelling errors, whereas in the case of Indian languages like Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Kannada, Assamese, etc., the available spell-checkers are very basic ones. These spell-checkers are developed using traditional methods like statistical methods and rule-based methods. This article presents a novel model HINDIA to handle the spelling errors of the Hindi language, one of the most spoken languages in India. It utilizes a deep-learning method for spelling error detection and correction. The proposed spell-checking model works in two phases. In the first phase model identifies the erroneous words in the input sample and in the second phase it replaces the wrong words with the most probable correct words. Model HINDIA is developed using the attention-based encoder–decoder bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) which uses long short-term memory cells. Several modifications in the BiRNN have been made and network is fine-tuned to process the spelling errors of Hindi language. It uses publicly available dataset ‘monolingual corpus’ developed by IIT Mumbai for training and testing. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in two scenarios. In the first scenario where the testing dataset is generated using split function. HINDIA performs significantly well with precision 0.86, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.78 and accuracy 0.80. Further, in the second scenario, where a dataset is manually generated its performance is fairly good with precision 0.81, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.76 and accuracy 0.74. Model HINDIA gives better performance than the deep-learning-based Malayalam spell-checker and some other deep-learning-based correction models present in the literature.},

The proposed TPin-TSVM has the following characteristics. Firstly, it can preserve both sparsity and feature noise insensitivity simultaneously, because it deals with the quantile distance which makes it less sensitive to noises, and most of the correctly classified samples are given equal penalties which makes it have the precious sparsity. Secondly, it is a non-differentiable non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the popular and effective concave–convex procedure (CCCP) to solve it. In each iteration of CCCP, the TPMSVM is utilized as a core of our TPin-TSVM, because it determines two nonparallel hyperplanes by solving two smaller sized quadratic programming problems, which greatly improves the computational speed. Thirdly, we investigate its theoretical properties of noise insensitivity and sparsity, and the proposed TPin-TSVM realizes the between-class distance maximization, within-class scatter and misclassification error minimization together. The experiments on two artificial datasets also verify the properties. We perform numerical experiments on thirty-five benchmark datasets to investigate the validity of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm yields the comparable generalization performance compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, previous studies regarded them as two independent tasks and solve them, respectively, which has limitations for practical application. In this paper, we combine the requirements of two subtasks to propose a new aspect-based sentiment analysis framework based on span, which is a simple and effective joint model to generate all aspects and corresponding sentiment polarities of the input sentences. Specifically, dual gated recurrent units which are used to extract the respective representation of each task can process sequence information better, and an interaction layer which is used to consider the relationship between the representations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Word embedding refers to mapping words or phrases to vectors of real numbers. This is the precondition of text classification, sentiment analysis and text mining in natural language processing using deep neural networks. Taking English as an example, most of current word embedding algorithms obtain the vectors by learning the distribution of word’s prefix, suffix, etyma and the entire word itself. Unlike English, Chinese words are composed of components and strokes. Furthermore, those components and strokes usually hint the meaning of the word. Thus, components and strokes distribution must be fully considered and learnt when one’s doing Chinese word embedding. In this paper, we propose a component-based cascade n-gram (CBC n-gram) model and a stroke-based cascade n-gram (SBC n-gram) model. By overlaying component and stroke n-gram vectors on word vectors, we successfully improve Chinese word embedding so as to preserve as more morphological information as possible at different granularity levels. We evaluate our models on word similarity, word analogy and text classification tasks using wordsim-240, wordsim-296, Chinese word analogy dataset and Fudan Corpus, respectively. Experimental and comparison results show that our models outperform other state-of-the-art methods.},

Here, we present an approach based on Dynamic Neural Fields that apply brain-like computations to endow a robot with these cognitive functions. A neural integrator is used to model the gradual accumulation of sensory and other evidence as time-varying persistent activity of neural populations. The decision to act is modeled by a competitive dynamics between neural populations linked to different motor behaviors. They receive the persistent activation pattern of the integrators as input. In the first experiment, a robot learns rapidly by observation the sequential order of object transfers between an assistant and an operator to subsequently substitute the assistant in the joint task. The results show that the robot is able to proactively plan the series of handovers in the correct order. In the second experiment, a mobile robot searches at two different workbenches for a specific object to deliver it to an operator. The object may appear at the two locations in a certain time period with independent probabilities unknown to the robot. The trial-by-trial decision under uncertainty is biased by the accumulated evidence of past successes and choices. The choice behavior over a longer period reveals that the robot achieves a high search efficiency in stationary as well as dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Structural prediction and analysis of sub-industrial energy consumption with economic data across three industrial sectors are an important basis for reflecting the coordinated development relationship between energy consumption and industrial development. Empirically, the sub-industrial energy consumption and economic structure have numerous compositional data. The multivariate compositional data’s fractional gray multivariate model on the basis of the Simplex space and its algebraic system is proposed in this study aiming at the multi-dimensional small sample size with high uncertainties. First, the fractional accumulative generation operation sequence of multivariate compositional data is defined according to Aitchison geometry. Then, the novel model with the form of the compositional data vector is obtained. Second, the least square parameter estimation of the model is studied. A derived model is deduced and selected as the time-response expression of the model solution. Moreover, the gray wolf optimizer is introduced and designed to determine the optimal value of the fractional order. Detailed modeling procedures, including the computational steps and the intelligent optimization algorithm, have been clearly presented. Furthermore, 10-year economic structural data of 14 provinces in China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The validation presents that the proposed model performs better in fitting, prediction, stability, and applicability, in comparison with the two other models in the Simplex space. Last, from the updated real-time datasets from 2008 to 2018, the proposed model is applied to analyze and forecast the sub-industrial energy consumption structure and industrial structure of Beijing. Results show that the proposed model presents high accuracy and is efficient in addressing the multivariate compositional data in some structural energy and economic issues.},

In conjunction with high-quality time-lapse microscopy (TLM), OOCs allow for the visualization of reconstituted complex biological processes, such as multi-cell-type migration and cell–cell interactions. In this context, increasing the frame rate is desirable to reconstruct accurately cell-interaction dynamics. However, a trade-off between high resolution and carried information content is required to reduce the overall data volume. Moreover, high frame rates increase photobleaching and phototoxicity. As a possible solution for these problems, we report a new hybrid-imaging paradigm based on the integration of OOC/TLMs with a Multi-scale Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicting interleaved video frames with the aim to provide high-throughput videos. We tested the performance of the predictive capability of GAN on synthetic videos, as well as on real OOC experiments dealing with tumor–immune cell interactions.

  abstract     = {Camera model identification (CMI) has gained significant importance in image forensics as digitally altered images are becoming increasingly commonplace. In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed for CMI with emphasis given on the preprocessing task considered to be inevitable for removing the scene content that heavily obscures the camera model fingerprints. Unlike the conventional approaches where fixed filters are used for preprocessing, the proposed remnant blocks, when coupled with a classification block and trained end-to-end minimizing the classification loss, learn to suppress the unnecessary image contents dynamically. This helps the classification block extract more robust camera model-specific features for CMI from the remnant of the image. The whole network, called RemNet, consisting of a preprocessing block and a shallow classification block, when trained on 18 models from the Dresden database, shows 100\% accuracy for 16 camera models with an overall accuracy of 97.59\% on test images from unseen devices, outperforming the state-of-the-art deep CNNs used in CMI. Furthermore, the proposed remnant blocks, when cascaded with the existing deep CNNs, e.g., ResNet, DenseNet, boost their performances by a large margin. The proposed approach proves to be very robust in identifying the source camera models, even if the original images are post-processed. It also achieves an overall accuracy of 95.11\% on the IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2018 dataset, which indicates its generalizability.},

  abstract     = {Marine object detection is an appealing but challengeable task in computer vision. Even though recent popular object detection algorithms perform well on common classes, they cannot acquire satisfied detection performance on marine objects because underwater images are affected by color cast and blur, and scales of the target in underwater images are usually small. These phenomena aggravate the difficulty of detection. Thus, it is urgent to design a proper structure to settle marine object detection issues. To this end, this paper proposes a novel scale-aware feature pyramid architecture named SA-FPN to extract abundant robust features on underwater images and improve the performance on marine object detection. Specifically, we design a special backbone subnetwork to improve the ability of feature extraction, which could provide richer fine-grained features for small object detection. What is more, this paper proposes a multi-scale feature pyramid to enrich the semantic features for prediction. Each feature map is enhanced by the higher level layer with context information through a top-down upsampling pathway. Through obtaining ample feature maps on underwater images, our algorithm could generate multiple bounding boxes for each target. To mitigate the reduplicative boxes and avoid miss suppression, we replace the non-maximum suppression method with soft non-maximum suppression. In this paper, we evaluate our algorithm on underwater image datasets and achieve 76.27\% mAP. Meanwhile, we conduct experiments on PASCAL VOC datasets and smart unmanned vending machines datasets and get 79.13\% mAP and 91.81\% mAP, respectively. The experimental results reveal that our approach achieves best performance not only on marine object detection, but also on common classes.},

  abstract     = {The reinforced concrete (RC) infrastructure can be retrofitted by adhesively bonding fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) to the tension face. In the FRP-to-concrete bonding system, the debonding of the FRP plate from the member is the most common failure type. Predicting the bond strength of FRP-to-concrete joints using traditional predictive models is far from being satisfactory because of the highly nonlinear relationships between the bond strength and a large number of influencing variables. To address this issue, this study proposes a metaheuristic-optimized least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) model to predict the bond strength of FRP-to-concrete joints. The hyperparameters of the LSSVR model are tuned using a recently proposed beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm. In addition, the Levy flight is incorporated in the BAS algorithm to improve its searching efficiency. The proposed model is then trained on a dataset collected from internationally published literature. To understand the importance of each input variable on the bond strength, the variable importance is calculated using the random forest algorithm. The results show that the proposed LBAS-LSSVR model has comparatively high prediction accuracy, as indicated by a high correlation coefficient (0.983) and low root mean square error (1.99 MPa) on the test set. Width of FRP is the most sensitive variable to the bond strength. The proposed model can be extended to solve other regression problems in structural engineering.},

  abstract     = {The tremendous growth of services available on the Internet makes user profiling an increasing important topic in web personalization. While profiling a user, one of the main challenges is that user preferences and interests usually change over time. It would be much appreciated, if the user profile could describe these changes. Such user profile is defined as time-aware user profile (TUP) in this paper. The TUP can delineate both dynamic user preferences and interests and evolutions of them, which illustrates that it can represent users more clearly and accurately. A TUP consists of a set of time slot-specific user profiles, which is defined as sub-time-aware user profile (sTUP). And a TUP is special for a user; then, its sTUPs separately represent preferences and interests of this user for different time slots. Constructing a TUP needs the constructions of its sTUPs. While constructing a sTUP from the user behavior logs for a time slot, in this paper, we present a novel learning model called personal service ecosystem (PSE) to delineate user preferences and interests naturally. Different from PSE, sTUP is the representation model. For a time slot, the sTUP is constructed based on the PSE recovered from the user behavior logs of this time slot. In terms of a TUP, two main approaches to analyze the evolutions of sTUPs in this TUP are further discussed. They are the evolution analysis of various margins between every two neighboring sTUPs called EA-VM and the evolution analysis of different sTUPs on raw data defined as EA-RD. EA-VM mainly focuses on the fine-grained evolution between two neighboring time slots by analyzing these various margins. It can be further divided into the clustering method and the distribution analysis approach. EA-RD chiefly pays attentions to the overall evolution of such sTUPs. By a comprehensive survey on the raw data of sTUPs, we summarize six interesting overall evolution patterns, including refugee pattern, periodic pattern, stable pattern, fluctuant pattern, emergency pattern and zombie pattern. Eventually, a systematic empirical study based on our collection data has been conducted, where smartphone users are taken as examples to illustrate our proposed models and approaches. And experimental results highlight the superiority of these approaches.},

  abstract     = {Single-shot multibox detector (SSD), one of the top-performing object detection algorithms, has achieved both high accuracy and fast speed. However, its performance is limited by two factors: (1) anchors are generated uniformly over the image by predefined manners, and (2) multiscale features from the feature pyramid are used to detect objects independently. In this paper, we propose a single-shot augmentation detector, called SSADet, that significantly improves the detection accuracy of the original SSD with a slight decrease in speed. SSADet mainly consists of two modules, namely the anchor prediction module and the feature fusion module. These two modules aim to generate anchors with any scale and aspect ratio and fuse multiscale features from different layers, respectively. Specifically, we define an anchor generator whose parameter weights are predicted dynamically by a small neural network and then use the anchor generator to generate optimal anchors over the image in the anchor prediction module. In the feature fusion module, multiscale features from the feature pyramid are concatenated to generate a new feature pyramid through a set of downsampling and upsampling operations. The new feature pyramid takes the generated anchors as the input from the anchor prediction module to predict the final detection results. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSADet on the PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO detection datasets. The experimental results show that SSADet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with high efficiency.},

Since it is a $$\Delta $$ -dynamic system on time-space scales, the results obtained in our work are new and attractive. The main difficulty in our theoretical work is the construction of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and the application of the Banach’s fixed-point theorem. By fabricating an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii Functional (LKF), some new sufficient conditions are obtained in terms of linear algebraic equations to guarantee the convergence to the Stepanov-like WPAA on time-space scales solution for the labeled neural networks solutions. The obtained conditions are expressed in terms of algebraic equations whose feasibility can be checked easily by a simple calculus. Furthermore, we have collated our effort with foregoing one in the available literatures and showed that it is less conserved. Finally, two numerical examples show the feasibility of our theoretical outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation can effectively transfer knowledge between domains with different distributions. Most existing methods use distribution alignment to mitigate the domain shift. But they typically align the marginal and conditional distributions with equal weights. This neglects the relative importance of different distribution alignments. In this paper, we propose a double weighted domain adaptation (DWDA) method, which employs new distribution alignment weighting and sample reweighting strategies. Specifically, the distribution alignment weighting strategy explores the relative importance of marginal and conditional distribution alignments, based on the maximum mean discrepancy; the sample reweighting strategy weights the source and target samples separately based on k-means clustering. The two strategies reinforce each other in the iterative optimization procedure, thus improving the overall performance. In addition, our method also considers the geometry structure preservation. The closed-form solution of the objective function is presented, and the computational complexity and convergence analysis are given. Experimental results demonstrate that DWDA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on several public datasets, and it also has good performance on an imbalanced dataset. Besides, DWDA is robust to a wide range of parameters. Moreover, the convergence curves show that DWDA generally converges rapidly within five iterations. We also evaluate the components of DWDA and show that each component is necessary. Finally, we compare the computational time with the methods of the recent three years to demonstrate the efficiency of DWDA.},

  abstract     = {Large capacity shovels are matched with large capacity dump trucks for gaining economic advantage in surface mining operations. These high impact shovel loading operations (HISLO) result in large dynamic impact force at truck bed surface. This impact force generates high-frequency shockwaves which expose the operator to whole body vibrations (WBVs). These WBVs cause serious injuries and fatalities to operators in mining operations. The present work focuses on developing solution technology for minimizing impact force on truck bed surface, which is the cause of these WBVs. The proposed technology involves modifying the truck bed structural design through the addition of synthetic rubber. Detailed experiments, with the technology implementation, showed a reduction of impact force by 22.60\% and 23.83\%, during the first and second shovel passes, respectively, which in turn reduced the WBV levels by 25.56\% and 26.95\% during the first and second shovel passes, respectively, at the operator’s seat. To make the smart implementation of the technology feasible, a novel state-of-the-art deep learning model, ‘DeepImpact,’ is designed and developed for impact force real-time monitoring during a HISLO operation. DeepImpact showed an exceptional performance, giving an R2, RMSE, and MAE values of 0.9948, 10.750, and 6.33, respectively, during the model validation. This smart and intelligent real-time monitoring system with design and process optimization would minimize the impact force on truck surface, which in turn would reduce the level of vibration on the operator, thus leading to a safer and healthier working environment at mining sites.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new soft computing model (artificial intelligence model) for modeling rock fragmentation (i.e., the size distribution of rock (SDR)) with high accuracy, based on a boosted generalized additive model (BGAM) and a firefly algorithm (FFA), called FFA-BGAM. Accordingly, the FFA was used as a robust optimization algorithm/meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the BGAM model. A split-desktop environment was used to analyze and calculate the size of rock from 136 images, which were captured from 136 blasts. To this end, blast designs were collected and extracted as the input parameters. Subsequently, the proposed FFA-BGAM model was evaluated and compared through previous well-developed soft computing models, such as FFA-ANN (artificial neural network), FFA-ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) based on three performance indicators (MAE, RMSE, and R2). The results indicated that the new intelligent technique (i.e., FFA-BGAM) provided the highest accuracy in predicting the SDR with an MAE of 0.920, RMSE of 1.213, and R2 of 0.980. In contrast, the remaining models (i.e., FFA-ANN, FFA-ANFIS, SVM, GPR, and KNN) yielded lower accuracies in predicting the SDR, i.e., MAEs of 1.248, 1.661, 1.096, 1.573, 1.237; RMSEs of 1.598, 2.068, 1.402, 2.137, 1.717; and R2 of 0.967, 0.968, 0.972, 0.940, 0.963, respectively.},

  abstract     = {A method that has recently been mentioned as information encoding brain is cross-frequency coupling (CFC). It is generally assumed that CFC can play a crucial role in perception, memory, and attention. In this study, two new indices for evaluating frequency–amplitude coupling (FAC) through generalized linear model (GLM) and linear regression method were introduced and investigated along with other CFC indices. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded during covert visual attention tasks to find out the CFC index capability so as to distinguish different states in the mentioned tasks. To this end, machine learning algorithms were used and four various types of CFC, phase–amplitude coupling (PAC), phase–phase coupling (PPC), amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC), and frequency–amplitude coupling (FAC) in recorded signals were considered as inputs for classifiers. The results demonstrated that the proposed method used for evaluating FAC through linear regression can provide more information about the different states in two covert attention tasks using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) by classification performance of 94.21\% and 90.54\% in color and direction tasks, respectively. Also, FAC that used a GLM model and PAC had a higher performance compared with PPC and AAC in color task (90.74 and 92.24\% against 83.21 and 86.22). We can conclude that CFC can encompass useful information about semantic category of stimuli in covert attention tasks and can be used as an acceptable alternative for the time–frequency features of brain signals.},

  abstract     = {The permutation flow shop scheduling problem has been investigated by researchers for more than 40 years due to its complexity and lots of real-life examples of the problem. Many exact or approximate solution approaches have been presented for the problem. Among solution approaches in the literature, iterated greedy algorithm and its variants are the most effective solution methods for the problem. This paper proposes a hybrid solution algorithm that uses the best components such as local search operators and destruction/construction operators of the variants of iterated greedy algorithm in an artificial bee colony algorithm. An ANOVA is made for determining the most proper components of iterated greedy algorithm. Then, these components are combined with artificial bee colony algorithm. Furthermore, a design of experiment is made for determining the best parameter setting for the proposed hybrid artificial bee colony. The experimental results of the proposed algorithm compared with variants of iterated greedy algorithms in the literature show that the proposed algorithm produces better solutions that deviate less from the optimum or lower-bound solutions for permutation flow shop scheduling problems with the makespan performance criterion.},

  abstract     = {In this work, Markov chains are used to model the statistical behavior of the pixels on the image of the forehead of a person in order to detect intoxication. It is the first time that second-order statistics are used for this purpose. The images were obtained in the thermal infrared region. Intoxication affects blood vessels activity and thus the temperature distribution on the face having a significant effect on the corresponding pixels statistics. The pixels of the forehead images are quantized to 32 Gy levels so that Markov chain models are structured using 32 states. The feature vectors used are the eigenvalues obtained from the first-order transition matrices of the Markov chain models. Since for each person a frame sequence of 50 views is acquired, a cluster of 50 vectors is formed in the 32-dimensional feature space. The feature space is firstly analyzed using projections of the clusters in 3D subspaces of the original 32D feature space. After that, the capability of a simple feed forward neural network to separate the clusters belonging to sober persons from those corresponding to intoxicated persons is investigated. A simple three-layer neural structure has a 98\% vector separability success and a 100\% cluster separability if the majority voting is considered. Furthermore, the classification problem is faced by excluding from the training procedure either one or five persons and using them in the testing phase. Accordingly, a neural network is trained using all except the excluded data. The obtained neural structure tested with the features of the persons in which it was not trained presents high drunk identification success if the majority voting is considered.},

In particular, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with various metaheuristic optimization methods, such as the biogeography-based optimization (ANFIS-BBO), the particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO), and the genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), have been employed taking into account the variability of input parameters. Commonly used statistical criteria, such as the coefficient of determination (R2), the a20-index, and the root mean squared error (RMSE), were utilized to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the proposed AI models. The Monte Carlo approach was used to propagate the variability in the input space to the predicted output. The results showed that the ANFIS system, optimized by PSO, was the most effective and robust model with respect to three considered criteria (a20-index = 0.881, R2 = 0.942 and RMSE = 185.631). Sensitivity analysis was performed, indicating that the minor axis length and thickness of the steel tube exhibited the highest contribution to the axial compression load-carrying capacity of the CFST.},

  abstract     = {With the development of data science, more and more data are presented in the form of multi-view. Compared with single-view feature learning, multi-view feature learning is more effective, and it has been successfully applied in many fields. Clustering is a core technology of computer science. Thus, many researchers start to study multi-view clustering. Recently, combining with multi-view feature learning techniques, some multi-view clustering methods have been presented. These methods mainly focus on the multiple features fusion, while most of them ignore the correlations among multiple views. Therefore, it cannot make full use of the advantages of multiple view features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named multi-view clustering via neighbor domain correlation learning (MCNDCL) approach. Specifically, MCNDCL learns a discriminant common space for multiple view features. Under the learned common space, the correlations of the consistent neighbor domain are maximized, and the correlations of specific neighbor domain are minimized at the same time. Extensive experimental results on four typical benchmarks, i.e., UCI Digits, Caltech7, BBCSport and CCV, validate the high effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Moreover, we show that SPOCU can overcome already introduced activation functions with good properties, e.g., SELU and ReLU, on generic problems. In order to explain the good properties of SPOCU, we provide several theoretical and practical motivations, including tissue growth model and memristive cellular nonlinear networks. We also provide estimation strategy for SPOCU parameters and its relation to generation of random type of Sierpinski carpet, related to the [pppq] model. One of the attractive properties of SPOCU is its genuine normalization of the output of layers. We illustrate SPOCU methodology on cancer discrimination, including mammary and prostate cancer and data from Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.

Among these techniques, the neural networks (NN), apart from their use in classification problems, can be used to approximate the behaviour of functions and their derivatives. Towards this direction, NN solution of differential equations (DEs), in both theoretical and technical point of view, is an active scientific field for the last two decades. NN solutions for DEs, once trained, have low computational cost and can be very useful as parts of more complex algorithms where needed, as well. Among the various classes of DEs, the stiff initial value problems (IVP) reveal difficulties in their numerical treatment by classical methodologies, whereas NN solutions of stiff DEs do not seem to do so. Moreover, their continuous nature and ability to be trained to solve classes of problems makes them an interesting tool. In this study, we investigate the NN solution of Inhomogeneous Linear IVPs. We incorporate to the NN a parameter that influences problem’s stiffness and train the network for a range of this. Therefore, the trained NN solution can solve different problems than the one training for. In order to reveal the good generalization properties of the NNs solution regarding the stiffness parameter, we compare them to the solutions of standard Matlab stiff solvers. The proposed solutions perform very well, similarly and in many cases better to their competitors.},

  abstract     = {Real-time object tracking for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an essential and challenging research topic for computer vision. However, the scenarios that UAVs deal with are complicated, and the UAV tracking targets are small. Therefore, general trackers often fail to take full advantage of their performance in UAV scenarios. In this paper, we propose a tracking method for UAV scenes, which utilizes background cues and aberrances response suppression mechanism to track in 4 degrees-of-freedom. Firstly, we consider the tracking task as a similarity measurement problem. In this study, we decompose this problem into two subproblems for optimization. Secondly, to alleviate the problem of small targets in UAV scenes, we utilize background cues fully. Also, to reduce interference by background information, we employ an aberrance response suppression mechanism. Then, to obtain accurate target state information, we introduce a logarithmic polar coordinate system. We perform phase correlation calculations in logarithmic polar coordinates to obtain the rotation and scale changes of the target. Finally, target states are obtained through response fusion, which includes displacement, scale, and rotation angle. Our approach is carried out in a large number of experiments on various UAV datasets, such as UAV123, DBT70, and UAVDT2019. Compared with the current advanced trackers, our method is superior on UAV small target tracking.},

Not only is the proposed approach applied to the two-area reheat thermal power system, but it is also elongated to two-interconnected multi-source areas comprising thermal, hydro and gas units, two-area nonlinear non-reheat thermal power system with governor dead band in addition to three-area nonlinear reheat thermal power system with generation rate constraints. Comparison with other modern heuristic optimization strategies recently published proves the effectiveness and superiority of this method. The simulation results show that this robust approach can greatly shorten the stabilization time of the power system and meet the requirements of LFC with minimum transient deviation as well as steady-state performance indicators, which is worthy of application and promotion.},

  abstract     = {Optimal traffic control and signal planning can significantly reduce traffic congestion and potential delays at intersections. However, a major challenge to optimize traffic signal timing is to accurately predict traffic before commencing the next cycle. An optimal strategy cannot be achieved with a poor prediction of future traffic. In this study, using a deep learning approach, we develop a data-driven real-time queue length prediction technique. We consider a connected corridor where information from vehicle detectors (located at the intersection) will be shared to consecutive intersections. We assume that the queue length of an intersection in the next cycle will depend on the queue length of the target and two upstream intersections in the current cycle. We use InSync adaptive traffic control system data to train a long short-term memory neural network model capturing time-dependent patterns of a queue of a signal. To avoid overfitting and select the best combination of hyperparameters, we use sequential model-based optimization technique. Our experiment results show that the proposed model performs very well to predict the queue length. Although we run our experiments predicting the queue length for a single movement, the proposed method can be applied for other movements as well.},

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions. In fMRI studies, including most machine learning studies seeking to distinguish ASD from typical developing (TD) samples, cohorts differing in gender and symptom severity composition are often treated statistically as one ‘ASD group.’ Using resting-state functional connectivity (FC) data, we implemented random forest to build diagnostic classifiers in four ASD samples including a total of 656 participants (NASD = 306, NTD = 350, ages 6–18). Groups were manipulated to titrate heterogeneity of gender and symptom severity and partially overlapped. Each sample differed on inclusionary criteria: (1) all genders, unrestricted severity range; (2) only male participants, unrestricted severity; (3) all genders, higher severity only; and (4) only male participants, higher severity. Each set consisted of 200 participants per group (ASD, TD; matched on age and head motion): 160 for training and 40 for validation. FMRI time series from 237 regions of interest (ROIs) were Pearson correlated in a 237 × 237 FC matrix, and classifiers were built using random forest in training samples. Classification accuracies in validation samples were 62.5\%, 65\%, 70\%, and 73.75\%, respectively, for samples 1–4. Connectivity within cingulo-opercular task control (COTC) network, and between COTC ROIs and default mode and dorsal attention network contributed overall most informative features, but features differed across sets. Findings suggest that diagnostic classifiers vary depending on ASD sample composition. Specifically, greater homogeneity of samples regarding gender and symptom severity enhances classifier performance. However, given the true heterogeneity of ASDs, performance metrics alone may not adequately reflect classifier utility.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic configuration network (SCN) has great potential in developing fast learning model with sound generalization capability and can be easily extended to the distributed computing framework. This paper aims to develop a distributed regularized stochastic configuration network to solve the limitations of traditional centralized learning on the scalability and efficiency in computing and storage resources for massive datasets. The local models are constructed using a classical stochastic configuration network, and the global unified model is built by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Elastic net regularization term combining the LASSO and ridge methods is added into loss function of the ADMM optimization to prevent the model from overfitting when the data has high-dimensional collinearity. Each layer of the local regularized SCN model of a node in the topology network is constructed incrementally; its input weights and biases are broadcast to all other nodes under the inequality constraints. Output weights and the Lagrange multipliers of each node are calculated alternately through the decomposition–coordination procedure of the ADMM optimization algorithm until it finally converges to a unified model. A comprehensive study on five benchmark datasets and the ball mill experimental data has been carried out to evaluate the proposed method. The experiment results show that the proposed distributed regularized stochastic configuration network has relative advantages in terms of accuracy and stability compared with the distributed random vector functional link network.},

Data collected from IoT devices are continuously increasing, and many approaches have been proposed to deal with the big data that is now generated. Multiple artificial intelligent techniques have been proposed and used to extract knowledge out of these continuously growing datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate that a better understanding of data can be achieved through dynamic modeling. This dynamic behavior is observed in many practical scenarios and needs to be taken into account to have a higher accuracy in prediction and analysis for policy making and business-related decisions. We propose and test a novel methodology to detect the dynamic nature of data over time.

  abstract     = {The human attention span is continuously decreasing, and the amount of time a person wants to spend on reading is declining at an alarming rate. Therefore, it is imperative to provide a quick glance of important news by generating a concise summary of the prominent news article, along with the most intuitive headline in line with the summary. When humans produce summaries of documents, they not only extract phrases and concatenate them but also produce new grammatical phrases or sentences that coincide with each other and capture the most significant information of the original article. Humans have an incredible ability to create abstractions; however, automatic summarization is a challenging problem. This paper aims to develop an end-to-end methodology that can generate brief summaries and crisp headlines that can capture the attention of readers and convey a significant amount of relevant information. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology known as SHEG, which is designed as a hybrid model. It works by integrating both extractive and abstractive mechanisms using a pipelined approach to produce a concise summary, which is then used for headline generation. Experiments were performed on publicly available datasets, viz. CNN/Daily Mail, Gigaword, and NEWSROOM. The results obtained validate our approach and demonstrate that the proposed SHEG model is effectively producing a concise summary as well as a captivating and fitting headline.},

A deep autoencoder is adopted to effectively estimate the complex flight responses from historical flight datasets and capture potential upset precursors. Key sensing variables highly relevant to upset primary factors are selected based on aircraft accident reports. The variables are then preprocessed using decimation and Savitzky–Golay filter for sampling frequency synchronization and denoising. Statistical detection baselines are employed to extract statistically unusual operation patterns that highly correlate with upset precursors. The performance of the developed methodology is evaluated by demonstrating real-time detection of upset precursors in flight datasets. An actual accident scenario is introduced to validate detection robustness. The results show that the proposed aircraft upset detector technique can enhance pilots’ situational awareness by providing early safety alert for more effective flight safety management.},

In general, the majority of the researchers emphasize forecasting on single output for a river system. The present study investigates the applicability and capability of coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) for simultaneous river flow forecasting for a Barak river system in Assam, India. Besides, two other hybrid model approaches were developed by optimizing the parameters of CANFIS to adopt model’s consistency toward achieving more precise and sensitive result which includes the combination of the CANFIS using genetic algorithm (CANFIS-GA) and CANFIS using firefly algorithm (CANFIS-FA). In total, 19,728 sets of recorded hourly concurrent flows data have been collected from different gauging sites pertaining to monsoon seasons. The results of the models (CANFIS, CANFIS-GA and CANFIS-FA) are evaluated, and the best-fit forecasting model(s) is determined using various statistical performance criterions. Also, this study witnessed the significant improvement in the quality of flow forecasting of traditional CANFIS when integrated using metaheuristics algorithms GA and FA. Besides, performance comparisons of the models are made using the artificial neural networks and probabilistics neural networks. In overall, results suggested that CANFIS-FA considerably improved upon other models and provides more better and accurate results for simultaneous flow forecasting in a river system.},

Specifically, we use a feature refinement module to adaptively discriminate and recalibrate feature, which can integrate local features with their global dependencies to capture rich contextual relationships. Given a monocular video, our network firstly calculates rigid optical flow by estimating depth and camera pose. Then, we design an auxiliary flow network for inferring non-rigid flow field. In addition, a forward–backward consistency check is adopted for occlusion reasoning. Extensive analyses on KITTI dataset are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results show that our proposed network can produce sharper, clearer and detailed depth and flow maps.

This failure is induced by interlaminate tension and shear that is developed due to a variety of factors such as fatigue. Composites are known for excellent structural performance, which can be significantly affected by delamination. Such damages are not always visible on the surface and can lead to sudden catastrophic failures. To ensure a structural performance and integrity, accurate methods to monitor damages are required. This work presents a methodology for damage detection and identification on laminated composite plates using artificial neural networks fed with modal data obtained by finite element analysis. The proposed neural network to quantify damage severity achieved up to 95\% success rate. A comparative study was done to evaluate the effect of boundary conditions on damage location. With the comparative study results, another neural network was proposed to locate damage position, achieving excellent results by successfully locating or by significantly reducing the search area. Both proposed ANNs use only frequency variation values as inputs, an easily obtainable quantity that requires few equipment to be acquired. The obtained results from these numerical examples indicate that the proposed approach can detect true damage locations and estimate damage magnitudes with satisfactory accuracy for this particular geometry, even under high measurement noise.},

In a study conducted by National Sleep Foundation, it has been found that about 20\% of drivers feel drowsy during driving. These statistics paint a very scary picture. This paper proposes a system for driver drowsiness detection, in which the architecture detects sleepiness of driver. The proposed architecture consists of four deep learning models: AlexNet, VGG-FaceNet, FlowImageNet and ResNet, which use RGB videos of drivers as input and help in detecting drowsiness. Also, these models consider four types of different features such as hand gestures, facial expressions, behavioral features and head movements for the implementation. The AlexNet model is used for various background and environmental changes like indoor, outdoor, day and night. VGG-FaceNet is used to extract facial characteristics like gender ethnicities. FlowImageNet is used for behavioral features and head gestures, and ResNet is used for hand gestures. Hand gestures detection provides a precise and accurate result. These models classify these features into four classes: non-drowsiness, drowsiness with eye blinking, yawning and nodding. The output of these models is provided to ensemble algorithm to obtain a final output by putting them through a SoftMax classifier that gives us a positive (drowsy) or negative answer. The accuracy obtained from this system came out to be 85\%.},

Two types of image-based features have been extracted and used to train six machine learning classifiers including Random Forest, K-nearest neighbour, Decision trees, Bagging, AdaBoost and Gradient Boost classifiers. The first type of the extracted features is local features including Scale-Invariant Feature Transform, Speeded Up Robust Features, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) and KAZE features. The second type of the extracted features is global features including Colour Histogram, Hu Moments and Haralick Texture. Furthermore, a hybridized ensemble voting classifier has been proposed to test the efficiency of using a number of machine learning classifiers trained using local and global features as voters to make a decision in an ensemble voting classifier. Moreover, two well-known deep learning model, i.e. Residual Neural Network and Inception-v3 have been tested using some of the constructed image datasets. Furthermore, when the results of the proposed model have been compared with the results of some state-of-art works it has been revealed that the proposed model outperforms the compared previous models in term of classification accuracy, computational time, generality and classification mode.},

  abstract     = {In the circuit of two thermally coupled VO2 oscillators, we studied a higher-order synchronization effect, which can be used in object classification techniques to increase the number of possible synchronous states of the oscillator system. We developed the phase-locking estimation method to determine the values of subharmonic ratio and synchronization effectiveness. In our experiment, the number of possible synchronous states of the oscillator system was twelve, and subharmonic ratio distributions were shaped as Arnold’s tongues. In the model, the number of states may reach the maximum value of 150 at certain levels of coupling strength and noise. The long-range synchronization effect in a one-dimensional chain of oscillators occurs even at low values of synchronization effectiveness for intermediate links. We demonstrate a technique for storing and recognizing vector images, which can used for reservoir computing. In addition, we present the implementation of analog operation of multiplication, the synchronization-based logic for binary computations and the possibility to develop the interface between spike neural network and a computer. Based on the universal physical effects, the high-order synchronization can be applied to any spiking oscillators with any coupling type, enhancing the practical value of the presented results to expand spike neural network capabilities.},

In this paper, a new deep neural network (DNN), multichannel one-dimensional convolutional neural network (MC1-DCNN), is proposed to investigate feature learning from high-dimensional process signals. Wavelet transform is used to extract multiscale components with fault features from process signals. MC1-DCNN is able to learn discriminative time–frequency features from these multiscale process signals. Tennessee Eastman process and fed-batch fermentation penicillin process are adopted to verify performance of the proposed method.

The distinctive feature of the mathematical model is the ability to take into account and recognize normal and abnormal situations at the protected object and develop control actions. To localize vehicles and recognize their license plates, the composition of traditional methods of image processing and two-pass classification performed by the developed modified architecture of convolutional neural network MobileNet is offered. The composition allows to define additional identification features of the object. The proposed adaptations allow to recognize the situation in real time with low computational costs and high accuracy. The natural experiment has shown that the integration of the modern hardware means and algorithms of object detection and recognition, even in the rough conditions of street closed-circuit television monitoring, provides not less than 96\% accuracy, and the processing time of one frame is not more than 0.094 s based on the Nvidia GeForce 1080Ti graphic processor.

  abstract     = {Daily streamflow forecasting through data-driven approaches is traditionally performed using a single machine learning algorithm. Existing applications are mostly restricted to examination of few case studies, not allowing accurate assessment of the predictive performance of the algorithms involved. Here, we propose super learning (a type of ensemble learning) by combining 10 machine learning algorithms. We apply the proposed algorithm in one-step-ahead forecasting mode. For the application, we exploit a big dataset consisting of 10-year long time series of daily streamflow, precipitation and temperature from 511 basins. The super ensemble learner improves over the performance of the linear regression algorithm by 20.06\%, outperforming the “hard to beat in practice” equal weight combiner. The latter improves over the performance of the linear regression algorithm by 19.21\%. The best performing individual machine learning algorithm is neural networks, which improves over the performance of the linear regression algorithm by 16.73\%, followed by extremely randomized trees (16.40\%), XGBoost (15.92\%), loess (15.36\%), random forests (12.75\%), polyMARS (12.36\%), MARS (4.74\%), lasso (0.11\%) and support vector regression (− 0.45\%). Furthermore, the super ensemble learner outperforms exponential smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). These latter two models improve over the performance of the linear regression algorithm by 13.89\% and 8.77\%, respectively. Based on the obtained large-scale results, we propose super ensemble learning for daily streamflow forecasting.},

In coarse classification, CNN is applied to classify the input image into a specific category and obtain a relevant weight. After that, geometric projections of 3D face landmarks projected into three planes, x–y, x–z and y–z, of 3D coordinate systems are used to perform the fine estimation of face pose, which can get the offset angles of the face in the three directions of roll, yaw, and pitch. Finally, the final score of face pose is obtained by combining the results of two stages. Experiments on standard datasets show that the proposed method can get better results than some competitive algorithms, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The general procedures of the GSO algorithm are explained alongside with the algorithm variants such as basic versions, discrete versions, and modified versions. Moreover, the applications of the GSO algorithm are given in detail such as benchmark function, classification, networking, engineering, and other problems.

However, the public’s concern by now is to find answers for two questions; (1) When this COVID-19 pandemic will be over? and (2) After coming to its end, will COVID-19 return again in what is known as a second rebound of the pandemic? In this work, we developed a predictive model that can estimate the expected period that the virus can be stopped and the risk of the second rebound of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have considered the SARIMA model to predict the spread of the virus on several selected countries and used it for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle and its end. The study can be applied to predict the same for other countries as the nature of the virus is the same everywhere. The proposed model investigates the statistical estimation of the slowdown period of the pandemic which is extracted based on the concept of normal distribution. The advantages of this study are that it can help governments to act and make sound decisions and plan for future so that the anxiety of the people can be minimized and prepare the mentality of people for the next phases of the pandemic. Based on the experimental results and simulation, the most striking finding is that the proposed algorithm shows the expected COVID-19 infections for the top countries of the highest number of confirmed cases will be manifested between Dec-2020 and  Apr-2021. Moreover, our study forecasts that there may be a second rebound of the pandemic in a year time if the currently taken precautions are eased completely. We have to consider the uncertain nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the growing inter-connected and complex world, that are ultimately demanding flexibility, robustness and resilience to cope with the unexpected future events and scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, digital businesses with diverse deployment models such as cloud, mobile and edge devices for the internet of things will impact traffic, in both volume and dynamicity, at unprecedented rates. Moreover, due to the recent advances in optical networks and systems, the complexity of provisioning lightpaths is growing dramatically. Hence, optical network operators are forced to change their insight and move toward intent-based and self-driven networking, to cost-efficiently accommodate these challenging requirements. In this regard, knowledge-defined networking (KDN) promises to play a paramount role in realizing flexible and self-driven optical networks. In this work, we focus on one of the key aspects in this environment, i.e., prediction of quality of service for unestablished lightpaths. KDN is a solution that introduces machine learning techniques into the control plane of the network, to cope with inevitable complexities that arise in enabling network to operate autonomously and faster. For this, five machine learning models are evaluated for the classification and regression approaches. Multilayer perceptron, radial basis function and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are used for both of the regression and classification approaches, while support-vector machine and probabilistic neural network (PNN) models are used only for the classification scenario. Also, to discard the redundant features (among the considered experimental features) in the classification approach, input features are selected using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The proposed models can accelerate and handle a significant part of operations in the closed-loop architecture of knowledge-defined optical networks, as a paradigm for designing self-driven optical networks. The best accuracies of quality of transmission prediction (classification approach) and optical signal-to-noise ratio estimation (regression approach) are achieved using PNN (with average accuracy of 99.6 ± 0.5\%) and GRNN (with R-squared value of 0.957), respectively.},

The CSO is applied to produce the best values of the gains of the adapted standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and required parameters of AVICs. Various scenarios are addressed in this study such as applications of sudden step load disturbances and severe variations in the inertia of the system. In addition, realistic conditions such as uncertainties of tidal power source and random load disturbances are demonstrated. Compulsory assessments with subsequent discussions to evaluate the results of the CSO are made. The proposed CSO–AVIC based control method is verified by comparisons with well-matured interesting algorithms such as differential evolution and particle swarm optimizers. Various quality specifications of the dynamic responses and the demonstrated results indicate clearly the viability of the proposed CSO–AVIC based on control scheme. It can be emphasized that the utilization of AVIC along with PID controllers are significantly improved the system dynamic performances and their dynamic response specifications meet the terms of standard acceptable criteria’s.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep convolutional features have been applied to discriminative correlation filters-based methods, which have achieved impressive performance in tracking. Most of them utilize hierarchical features from a certain layer. However, this is not always sufficient to learn target appearance changes and to suppress the background interference in complicated interfering factors (e.g., deformation, fast motion, low resolution, and rotations). In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-branch correlation filter tracking method, by constructing multi-branch models and using an adaptive selection strategy to improve the accuracy and robustness of visual tracking. Specially, the multi-branch models are introduced to tolerate temporal changes of the object, which can serve different circumstances. In addition, the adaptive selection strategy incorporates both foreground and background information to learn background suppression. To further improve the tracking performance, we propose a measurement method to handle tracking failures from unreliable samples. Extensive experiments on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, and VOT-2016 datasets show that the proposed tracker has comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art tracking methods. Especially, on the OTB-2015, our method significantly improves the baseline with a gain of 5.5\% in overlap precision.},

  abstract     = {Accurate estimation of streamflow has a vital importance in water resources engineering, management and planning. In the present study, the abilities of group method of data handling-neural networks (GMDH-NN), dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) methods are investigated for monthly streamflow prediction. Precipitation, temperature and streamflows from Kalam and Chakdara stations at Swat River basin (mountainous basin), Pakistan, are used as inputs to the applied models in the form of different input scenarios, and models’ performances are evaluated on the basis of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and combined accuracy (CA) indexes. Test results of the Kalam Station show that the DENFIS model provides more accurate prediction results in comparison of GMDH-NN and MARS models with the lowest RMSE (18.9 m3/s), MAE (13.1 m3/s), CA (10.6 m3/s) and the highest NSE (0.941). For the Chakdara Station, the MARS outperforms the GMDH-NN and DENFIS models with the lowest RMSE (47.5 m3/s), MAE (31.6 m3/s), CA (26.1 m3/s) and the highest NSE (0.905). Periodicity (month number of the year) effect on models’ accuracies in predicting monthly streamflow is also examined. Obtained results demonstrate that the periodicity improves the models’ accuracies in general but not necessarily in every case. In addition, the results also show that the monthly streamflow could be successfully predicted using only precipitation and temperature variables as inputs.},

The dominance of majority class instances (negative class) often results in biased learning models, and therefore, classifying such datasets requires employing some methods to compact the problem. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach aiming at reducing the dominance of the majority class instances using class decomposition and increasing the minority class instances using an oversampling method. Unlike other undersampling methods, which suffer data loss, our method preserves the majority class instances, yet significantly reduces its dominance, resulting in a more balanced dataset and hence improving the results. A large-scale experiment using 60 public datasets was carried out to validate the proposed methods. The results across three standard evaluation metrics show the comparable and superior results with other common and state-of-the-art techniques.},

The collaborative filtering is one of the most widely adopted recommendation techniques which is usually applied to the explicit data, e.g., rating scores. However, the implicit data, e.g., click data, is believed to be able to discover user’s latent preferences. Consequently, a number of research attempts have been made toward this issue. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to adapt the Wasserstein autoencoders to collaborative filtering problem. Particularly, we propose a new loss function by introducing an $$L_1$$ regularization term to learn a sparse low-rank representation form to represent latent variables. Then, we carefully design (1) a new cost function to minimize the data reconstruction error, and (2) the appropriate distance metrics for the calculation of KL divergence between the learned distribution of latent variables and the underlying true data distribution. Rigorous experiments are performed on three widely adopted datasets. Both the state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., Mult-VAE and Mult-DAE, and the baseline models are evaluated on these datasets. The promising experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the compared approaches with respect to evaluation criteria Recall@R and NDCG@R.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer worldwide. Patients with HCC have rare chances of survival. The chances of survival increase, if the cancer is diagnosed early. Hence, different machine learning-based methods have been developed by researchers for the accurate detection of HCC. However, high dimensionality (curse of dimensionality) and lower prediction accuracy are the problems in the automated detection of HCC. Dimensionality reduction-based methods have shown state-of-the-art performance on many disease detection problems, which motivates the development of machine learning models based on reduced features dimension. This paper proposes a new hybrid intelligent system that hybridizes three algorithms, i.e., linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, support vector machine (SVM) for classification and genetic algorithm (GA) for SVM optimization. Consequently, the three models are hybridized and one black box model, namely LDA–GA–SVM, is constructed. Experimental results on publicly available HCC dataset show improvement in the HCC prediction accuracy. Apart from performance improvement, the proposed method also shows lower complexity from two aspects, i.e., reduced processing time in terms of hyperparameters optimization and training time. The proposed method achieved accuracy of 90.30\%, sensitivity of 82.25\%, specificity of 96.07\% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.804.},

  abstract     = {To detect the targets of different sizes, multi-scale output is used by target detectors such as YOLO V3 and DSSD. To improve the detection performance, YOLO V3 and DSSD perform feature fusion by combining two adjacent scales. However, the feature fusion only between the adjacent scales is not sufficient. It hasn’t made advantage of the features at other scales. What is more, as a common operation for feature fusion, concatenating can’t provide a mechanism to learn the importance and correlation of the features at different scales. In this paper, we propose adaptive feature fusion with attention mechanism (AFFAM) for multi-scale target detection. AFFAM utilizes pathway layer and subpixel convolution layer to resize the feature maps, which is helpful to learn better and complex feature mapping. In addition, AFFAM utilizes global attention mechanism and spatial position attention mechanism, respectively, to learn the correlation of the channel features and the importance of the spatial features at different scales adaptively. Finally, we combine AFFAM with YOLO V3 to build an efficient multi-scale target detector. The comparative experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC dataset, KITTI dataset and Smart UVM dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art target detectors, YOLO V3 with AFFAM achieved 84.34\% mean average precision (mAP) at 19.9 FPS on PASCAL VOC dataset, 87.2\% mAP at 21 FPS on KITTI dataset and 99.22\% mAP at 20.6 FPS on Smart UVM dataset which outperforms other advanced target detectors.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has received more and more attention due to its efficiency and accuracy. Label propagation is a critical step in GSSL that propagates label information to unlabeled data through the structure of graph. However, the traditional label propagation algorithms treat all unlabeled samples as equivalent and blindly propagate label information to all neighbors without considering their reliabilities. In this case, some unreliable samples may mislead the process of label propagation, thus greatly reducing the accuracy of classification. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel label propagation algorithm called node influence-based label propagation (NILP). Based on the structure of graph, the NILP algorithm measures the influences of nodes by calculating their degrees and local densities. In the process of label propagation, the label information is preferentially transmitted to the influential neighbors to control the propagation sequence and prevent wrong propagation. Moreover, our algorithm improves the transition matrix by integrating label information and feature information. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is superior to some existing label propagation algorithms. Especially when the number of labeled samples is very small, the advantage of NILP algorithm is more obvious.},

In the fine-tuning step, Delta rule is used to update the coordinates of reference points based on the wireless environment represented in the training dataset. The combination of the coarse estimation and the proposed fine-tuning makes the coarse-to-fine algorithm. The algorithms used for coarse estimation are weighted sum and k-nearest neighbour, with three weight calculation algorithms that are compared in this experiment: Minkowski distance, k-means Gaussian mixture model, and autoencoder. Two subject rooms are used in order to measure the performance of the algorithms. The experiment showed that the fine-tuning algorithm improves the accuracy of the positioning throughout all combination of methods in both rooms, which shows its versatility. It reduces the mean positioning error by up to 11.3\% and depends on what algorithm used in the weight calculation. Another benefit from the fine-tuning model is that it does not increase the complexity of the algorithm in the online phase. Overall, the best result is achieved by the combination of weighted sum and k-nearest neighbour with Minkowski distance weight calculation, together with the proposed fine-tuning. Its mean positioning error is 0.8740 m for Room 1 and 1.5385 for Room 2. The average computing time for a single online query is 0.4 ms for Room 1 and 0.7 ms for Room 2.},

  abstract     = {Misclassification is a critical problem in many machine learning applications. Since even the classifier models with high accuracy (e.g., &gt; 95\%) still introduce some misclassification error, it may not be possible to rely on the output of a classifier. In this paper, we introduce trustable learning, which prompts the learning model to yield only the true output, thus avoiding misclassifications. Whenever the model cannot decide the output accurately, the learning model should indicate that there could be a misclassification error if it is forced to classify, and hence, it should reject to make a decision or defer it to a human expert. Therefore, we develop a methodology for trustable learning and apply it to artificial neural networks and show that it is possible to develop a classifier with 0\% misclassification error. We propose a novel neural network architecture named WisdomNet that could provide zero prediction error by introducing an additional neuron named as conjugate neuron that would indicate whether the network is able to classify the data correctly or not. The WisdomNet architecture can be applied to any previously built model, and we have evaluated WisdomNet with several network architectures such as multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network, and deep network on different data sets. The results show that the WisdomNet is able to reduce the classification error rate to 0\%, while labeling the data is difficult to classify as ‘reject’ at a low percentage of within around 10\%.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a method for training Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems using sparse regressions and particle swarm optimization. The fuzzy system is considered with Gaussian fuzzy sets in the antecedents and high-order polynomials in the consequents of the inference rules. The proposed method can be applied in two variants: without or with particle swarm optimization. In the first variant, ordinary least squares, ridge regression, or sparse regressions (forward selection, least angle regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and elastic net regression) determine the polynomials in the fuzzy system in which the fuzzy sets are known. In the second variant, we have a hybrid method in which particle swarm optimization determines the fuzzy sets, while ordinary least squares, ridge regression, or sparse regressions determine the polynomials. The first variant is simpler to implement but less accurate, the second variant is more complex, but gives better results. A new quality criterion is proposed in which the goal is to make the validation error and the model density as small as possible. Experiments showed that: (a) the use of sparse regression and/or particle swarm optimization can reduce the validation error and (b) the use of sparse regression may simplify the model by zeroing some of the coefficients.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition in conversation aims to identify the emotion of each consistent utterance in a conversation from several pre-defined emotions. The task has recently become a new popular research frontier in natural language processing because of the increase in open conversational data and its application in opinion mining. However, most existing methods for the task cannot capture the long-range contextual information in an utterance and a conversation effectively. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel hierarchical attention network with residual gated recurrent unit framework. Firstly, we adopt the pre-trained BERT-Large model to obtain context-dependent representation for each token of each utterance in a conversation. Then, a hierarchical attention network is proposed to capture long-range contextual information about the conversation structure. Besides, in order to better model position information of the utterances in a conversation, we add position embedding to the input of the multi-head attention. Experiments on two textual dialogue emotion datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

This study formulates training of a NN forecaster as a dynamic optimization problem, to investigate the application of a dynamic PSO algorithm to train NNs in forecasting time series in non-stationary environments. For this purpose, a set of experiments were conducted on three simulated and seven real-life time series forecasting problems under four different dynamic scenarios. Results obtained are compared to the results of NNs trained using a standard PSO and resilient backpropagation (Rprop). The results show that the NNs trained using dynamic PSO algorithms outperform the NNs trained using PSO and Rprop.

In this paper, we utilize the Hilbert space-filling curve for the generation of image representations of sEMG signals, which allows the application of typical image processing pipelines such as CNNs on sequence data. The proposed method is evaluated on different state-of-the-art network architectures and yields a significant classification improvement over the approach without the Hilbert curve.

However, optimization-based energy saving of the rotary turning has not presented because of expensive implementation. This study addresses a parameter optimization to enhance the machining rate (MR) and decrease the energy consumption (ET) as well as the machined roughness (R) for a hard turning using SPRT. The process inputs are the inclined angle (α), depth of cut (a), feed rate (f), and cutting speed (V). The hard turning runs were performed using the experimental plan generated by the Taguchi approach. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to construct the correlations between the process inputs and responses. The analytic hierarchy process technique was adopted to explore the weight values of the outputs, and the optimum solution was obtained utilizing the adaptive simulated annealing. Moreover, an integrative approach using the response surface method and utilizing the desirability approach was employed to select the optimal outcomes and compare with the proposed technique. The findings revealed that the proposed ANFIS models minimize the predictive error in comparison with the traditional one. The accurate weights may help to select reliable optimal results. The optimal values of the α, a, f, and V are 18°, 0.15 mm, 0.40 mm/rev, and 200 mm/min, respectively. Moreover, ET and roughness are decreased by 50.29\% and 19.77\%, while the MR is enhanced by 33.16\%, respectively, as compared to the general process.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable forecasting of total cloud cover (TCC) is vital for many areas such as astronomy, energy demand and production, or agriculture. Most meteorological centres issue ensemble forecasts of TCC; however, these forecasts are often uncalibrated and exhibit worse forecast skill than ensemble forecasts of other weather variables. Hence, some form of post-processing is strongly required to improve predictive performance. As TCC observations are usually reported on a discrete scale taking just nine different values called oktas, statistical calibration of TCC ensemble forecasts can be considered a classification problem with outputs given by the probabilities of the oktas. This is a classical area where machine learning methods are applied. We investigate the performance of post-processing using multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random forest (RF) methods. Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global TCC ensemble forecasts for 2002–2014, we compare these approaches with the proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) and multiclass logistic regression (MLR) models, as well as the raw TCC ensemble forecasts. We further assess whether improvements in forecast skill can be obtained by incorporating ensemble forecasts of precipitation as additional predictor. Compared to the raw ensemble, all calibration methods result in a significant improvement in forecast skill. RF models provide the smallest increase in predictive performance, while MLP, POLR and GBM approaches perform best. The use of precipitation forecast data leads to further improvements in forecast skill, and except for very short lead times the extended MLP model shows the best overall performance.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have emerged as hot topics in the research community. Despite the success of ANNs, it is challenging to train and deploy modern ANNs on commodity hardware due to the ever-increasing model size and the unprecedented growth in the data volumes. Particularly for microarray data, the very high dimensionality and the small number of samples make it difficult for machine learning techniques to handle. Furthermore, specialized hardware such as graphics processing unit (GPU) is expensive. Sparse neural networks are the leading approaches to address these challenges. However, off-the-shelf sparsity-inducing techniques either operate from a pretrained model or enforce the sparse structure via binary masks. The training efficiency of sparse neural networks cannot be obtained practically. In this paper, we introduce a technique allowing us to train truly sparse neural networks with fixed parameter count throughout training. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can be applied directly to handle high-dimensional data, while achieving higher accuracy than the traditional two-phase approaches. Moreover, we have been able to create truly sparse multilayer perceptron models with over one million neurons and to train them on a typical laptop without GPU ( https://github.com/dcmocanu/sparse-evolutionary-artificial-neural-networks/tree/master/SET-MLP-Sparse-Python-Data-Structures ), this being way beyond what is possible with any state-of-the-art technique.},

  abstract     = {The backpropagation (BP) algorithm is a gradient-based algorithm used for training a feedforward neural network (FNN). Despite the fact that BP is still used today when FNNs are trained, it has some disadvantages, including the following: (i) it fails when non-differentiable functions are addressed, (ii) it can become trapped in local minima, and (iii) it has slow convergence. In order to solve some of these problems, metaheuristic algorithms have been used to train FNN. Although they have good exploration skills, they are not as good as gradient-based algorithms at exploitation tasks. The main contribution of this article lies in its application of novel memetic approaches based on the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Chaotic Gravitational Search Algorithm (CGSA) algorithms, called respectively Memetic Gravitational Search Algorithm (MGSA) and Memetic Chaotic Gravitational Search Algorithm (MCGSA), to train FNNs in three classical benchmark problems: the XOR problem, the approximation of a continuous function, and classification tasks. The results show that both approaches constitute suitable alternatives for training FNNs, even improving on the performance of other state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as ParticleSwarm Optimization (PSO), the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm with Repaired crossover rate (Rcr-JADE), and the Covariance matrix learning and Bimodal distribution parameter setting Differential Evolution (COBIDE) algorithm.

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristic search algorithms were successfully used to solve a variety of problems in engineering, science, business, and finance. Meta-heuristic algorithms share common features since they are population-based approaches that use a set of tuning parameters to evolve new solutions based on the natural behavior of creatures. In this paper, we present a novel nature-inspired search optimization algorithm called the capuchin search algorithm (CapSA) for solving constrained and global optimization problems. The key inspiration of CapSA is the dynamic behavior of capuchin monkeys. The basic optimization characteristics of this new algorithm are designed by modeling the social actions of capuchins during wandering and foraging over trees and riverbanks in forests while searching for food sources. Some of the common behaviors of capuchins during foraging that are implemented in this algorithm are leaping, swinging, and climbing. Jumping is an effective mechanism used by capuchins to jump from tree to tree. The other foraging mechanisms exercised by capuchins, known as swinging and climbing, allow the capuchins to move small distances over trees, tree branches, and the extremities of the tree branches. These locomotion mechanisms eventually lead to feasible solutions of global optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked on 23 well-known benchmark functions, as well as solving several challenging and computationally costly engineering problems. A broad comparative study is conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of CapSA over several prominent meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of optimization precision and statistical test analysis. Overall results show that CapSA renders more precise solutions with a high convergence rate compared to competitive meta-heuristic methods.},

  abstract     = {Water has been used as an injected fluid for decades to improve oil recovery, commonly known as waterflooding. Simulating this process is very expensive, especially for the post-water breakthrough analysis in stratified oil reservoirs. The existing correlations do not predict waterflooding performance in heterogeneous reservoirs accurately. Most of the methods do not account for pattern flooding and consider piston-like displacement with non-communicative layers. In this study, a model has been developed using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting the recovery performance of a layered reservoir undergoing a five-spot-pattern waterflood. In addition to the ANN model, a mathematical equation is presented based on ANN to predict the oil recovery in pattern waterflooding with and without crossflow between the layers for different rock wettabilities. A novel parameter—wettability indicator (WI)—has also been introduced that can be used to quantify the rock’s wettability based only on the relative permeability curves. The results showed that the introduction of the new term (WI) significantly decreased the simulation runs in comparison with existing relative permeability models. ANN approach was compared with non-linear regression (NLR) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The ANN model outperformed NRL and ANFIS in terms of least mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and highest coefficient of determination (R2). The new correlation was tested with an unseen data set, two different real field cases, an analytical model, and a semi-analytical model. The training and testing data show good match and accuracy with R2 of 0.9973 and 0.997, respectively. MAPE of the predicted recovery efficiency using a blind data set was around 7\%. The developed correlation can be a useful tool for a quick estimate of the waterflood oil recovery before a large simulation model is built and ran.},

It still remains a research gap to handle this problem from Geometry-Aware perspective and interpret the mechanism of collaborative representation on nonlinear manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel method named probabilistic collaborative representation on Grassmann manifold for image set classification, which is interpreted from a probabilistic viewpoint. Specifically, we regard each image set as a point on Grassmann manifold inspired by its non-Euclidean geometry and then perform collaborative representation on the space of symmetric matrices, which enables us to explain the internal mechanism of classification and derive a closed form solution. Moreover, classification criterion is designed to further improve the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results on four databases (i.e. Honda/UCSD, YaleB, Youtube Celebrities and ETH-80) for face recognition task and object recognition task demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Once the Pareto Front (or a good approximation of it) has been found, then providing the decision maker with a smaller set of “interesting solutions” is a key step. Here, the focus is on how to select such a set of solutions of interest which, in contrast to previous approaches that relied on geometrical features, is carried out considering the decision maker’s preferences. The proposed a posteriori approach consists in assigning an interval of potential scores to every solution, where such scores depend on the decision maker’s preferences. The solutions are then compared and filtered according to their corresponding intervals, using a recently proposed possibility degree formula. Three examples, with two, three and many objectives are used to show the benefits of the proposal.},

  abstract     = {This briefly investigates the bipartite finite time synchronization in fractional-order impulsive signed networks (FISNs), where there exist antagonistic communication links between neighboring nodes. Firstly, some new judgment conditions about finite time stability of FISNs are given on generalized Caputo fractional-order derivative. Secondly, by using Dirac function and the grapy theory, FISNs are transformed to fractional-order impulsive differential equations, which shows that the impulsive effect on signed networks is dependent on the order of the addressed networks and impulsive function. Thirdly, to provide novel criteria for bipartite finite time synchronization of FISNs by using a low-dimensional linear matrix inequality, pinning impulsive control strategy is designed. Fourthly, an upper bound on setting time for synchronization is obtained, and the influence of order on setting time is analyzed. Finally, numerical simulation is provided for illustration.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims at presenting a new decision framework under an interval-valued probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (IVPHFS) context with fully unknown weight information. At first, the weights of the attributes are determined by using the interval-valued probabilistic hesitant deviation method. Later, the DMs’ weights are determined by using a recently proposed evidence theory-based Bayesian approximation method under the IVPHFS context. The preferences are aggregated by using a newly extended generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean operator under the IVPHFS context. Further, the alternatives are prioritized by using an interval-valued probabilistic hesitant complex proportional assessment method. From the proposed framework, the following significances are inferred; for example, it uses a generalized preference structure that provides ease and flexibility to the decision-makers (DMs) during preference elicitation; weights are calculated systematically to mitigate inaccuracies and subjective randomness; interrelationship among attributes are effectively captured; and alternatives are prioritized from different angles by properly considering the nature of the attributes. Finally, the applicability of the framework is validated by using green supplier selection for a leading bakery company, and from the comparison, it is observed that the framework is useful, practical and systematic for rational decision-making and robust and consistent from sensitivity analysis of weights and Spearman correlation of rank values, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Multilabel classification deals with the problem where each instance belongs to multiple labels simultaneously. The algorithm based on large margin loss with k nearest neighbor constraints (LM-kNN) is one of the most prominent multilabel classification algorithms. However, due to the use of square hinge loss, LM-kNN needs to iteratively solve a constrained quadratic programming at a high computational cost. To address this issue, we propose a novel metric learning-guided k nearest neighbor approach (MLG-kNN) for multilabel classification. Specifically, we first transform the original instance into the label space by least square regression. Then, we learn a metric matrix in the label space, which makes the predictions of an instance in the learned metric space close to its true class values while far away from others. Since our MLG-kNN can be formulated as an unconstrained strictly (geodesically) convex optimization problem and yield a closed-form solution, the computational complexity is reduced. An analysis of generalization error bound indicates that our MLG-kNN converges to the optimal solutions. Experimental results verify that the proposed approach is more effective than the existing ones for multilabel classification across many benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Building data-driven intelligent transportation is a significant task for establishing data-centric smart cities, and exceptionally efficient and accurate traffic flow prediction (TFP) is a crucial technology in constructing intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To address the computation and storage problems of processing traffic flow big data with the centralized model on a traditional mining platform, we propose a distributed long short-term memory weighted model combined with a time window and normal distribution based on a MapReduce parallel processing framework in this paper, named as WND-LSTM. More specifically, under the Hadoop distributed computing platform, a distributed modeling framework of forecasting traffic flow on MapReduce is developed to solve the existing issues of storage and calculation in handling large-scale traffic flow data with the stand-alone learning model. Moreover, a distributed WND-LSTM model is presented on the MapReduce-based distributed modeling framework to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of short-term TFP. Finally, we forecast the traffic flow on the Sanlihe East Road of Beijing in China using the proposed WND-LSTM model with the real-world taxi trajectory big data. In particular, the extensively experimental results from a case study demonstrate that the MAPE value of WND-LSTM is 88.48\%, 65.79\%, 70.46\%, 68.21\%, 66.95\%, 68.43\%, and 70.41\% lower than that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), logistical regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), stacked autoencoders (SAEs), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM), respectively, and achieves 71.25\% accuracy improvement on average.},

  abstract     = {Accurate wind speed prediction is critical for many tasks, especially for air pollution modelling. Data-driven approaches are particularly interesting but the stochastic nature of wind renders prediction tasks difficult. Therefore, a combination of methods could be useful to obtain better results. To overcome this difficulty, a hybrid wind speed forecasting approach is proposed in this work. The Bay of Algeciras, Spain, was used as a case study, and the database was collected from a weather monitoring station. The study consists of combining a pre-processing method, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), an information-based method, the permutation entropy (PE), and a machine learning technique (artificial neural networks, ANNs), using an ensemble learning methodology. Different prediction horizons were considered: ph-hours (ph = 1, 2, 8, 24) ahead and 8-h and 24-h average. The introduction of PE significantly reduces the computational cost and the predictive risk in comparison with traditional EMD methodology, by reducing the number of the decomposed components to be predicted. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrated that the EMD–PE–ANN approach outperforms the prediction performance of the single ANN models in all the prediction horizons tested. The EMD–PE–ANN model is capable to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.981 and 0.807 for short-term (1 h) and medium-term (24 h) predictions, respectively, significantly overcoming those obtained by a single ANN model (0.929 and 0.503). These results show that the proposed model reaches significant improvements when the prediction horizon increases, where forecasting models tend to worsen their prediction performance. Therefore, the proposed EMD–PE–ANN approach may become a powerful tool for wind speed forecasting.},

Firstly, an adaptive temporal scale selection approach is introduced to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ESN modeling, due to the importance of proper temporal scale selection in relation to the sound prediction performance of ESNs. Also, a random weight scaling mechanism is employed to enhance the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method, as the learning ability of ESNs lies in the constrained random connection weights. Furthermore, several conditions for the stability of the closed-loop control system are given.

The demand for BCI-based applications is growing tremendously, and efforts are in progress to deploy BCI devices for real-world applications. One of the widely known applications of BCI technology is rehabilitation in which BCI devices can provide various types of assistance to specially abled persons. In this paper, the effect of hand actions on objects is analyzed for motor-related mental task. The proposed approach analyzes electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain activity which was captured for images shown with different gripping actions on objects. The EEG recordings are first pre-processed, followed by extraction of epochs and frequency bands using discrete wavelet transform; afterward, feature extraction followed by training and classification steps is performed for classifying the grip action into congruent (correct) and incongruent (incorrect) grip categories. The proposed work makes use of average power and relative wavelet energy as discriminating features which are then fed to train an artificial neural network for automatically classifying the incoming EEG patterns into correct or incorrect object hand grips. The performance evaluation of the proposed system is done on real EEG dataset obtained from 14 subjects. Experimental results have shown an accuracy of 75\%. Also, to evaluate the effectiveness of our work, a comparison of our work with other state-of-the-art works reported by different authors is presented at the end. The results show the effectiveness of proposed approach and suggest further that the system can be used to analyze and train subjects having motor-related disabilities for perceiving correct or incorrect hand grips on objects.},

  abstract     = {Whenever we are addressing a specific object or refer to a certain spatial location, we are using referential or deictic gestures usually accompanied by some verbal description. Particularly, pointing gestures are necessary to dissolve ambiguities in a scene and they are of crucial importance when verbal communication may fail due to environmental conditions or when two persons simply do not speak the same language. With the currently increasing advances of humanoid robots and their future integration in domestic domains, the development of gesture interfaces complementing human–robot interaction scenarios is of substantial interest. The implementation of an intuitive gesture scenario is still challenging because both the pointing intention and the corresponding object have to be correctly recognized in real time. The demand increases when considering pointing gestures in a cluttered environment, as is the case in households. Also, humans perform pointing in many different ways and those variations have to be captured. Research in this field often proposes a set of geometrical computations which do not scale well with the number of gestures and objects and use specific markers or a predefined set of pointing directions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach to model the distribution of pointing gestures using a growing-when-required (GWR) network. We introduce an interaction scenario with a humanoid robot and define the so-called ambiguity classes. Our implementation for the hand and object detection is independent of any markers or skeleton models; thus, it can be easily reproduced. Our evaluation comparing a baseline computer vision approach with our GWR model shows that the pointing-object association is well learned even in cases of ambiguities resulting from close object proximity.},

  abstract     = {Project management has been proven to be an effective tool to manage sophisticated activities. Various techniques of project management have played an essential role for successful project implementation in different areas. Managing projects, especially in a multi-project environment, involves a complex situation because of its distinguishing feature in which a number of projects are being executed simultaneously, that is, they are followed in parallel. Therefore, applying human resources will be more effective and more idle time will be eliminated as well. More so, it can enable people to share their lessons learned from one project to another. With respect to handling a number of projects at the same time by most firms, it is sophisticated for contractors to cope with financial issues of projects, which involve different project cash inflows and outflows. Thus, taking an accurate cash flow prediction into account for projects has been changed into a crucial matter for firms, and lack of this consideration may result in the failure of projects as well. Moreover, there is a desperate need for uncertainties to be addressed thoroughly regarding their vital role for suitable project management. With these in mind, an innovative approach is proposed in this paper to anticipate the cash flow of project by considering type-2 fuzzy extension of both critical chain project management (CCM) for project scheduling and TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making) method for selecting the best scenario in a multi-project environment.

  abstract     = {Automatic handwriting recognition is an important component for many applications in various fields. It is a challenging problem that has received a lot of attention in the past three decades. Research has focused on the recognition of Latin languages’ handwriting. Fewer studies have been done for the Arabic language. In this paper, we present a new dataset of Arabic letters written exclusively by children aged 7–12 which we call Hijja. Our dataset contains 47,434 characters written by 591 participants. In addition, we propose an automatic handwriting recognition model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). We train our model on Hijja, as well as the Arabic Handwritten Character Dataset (AHCD) dataset. Results show that our model’s performance is promising, achieving accuracies of 97\% and 88\% on the AHCD dataset and the Hijja dataset, respectively, outperforming other models in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Several datasets for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) visual tracking research have been released in recent years. Despite their usefulness, whether they are sufficient for understanding the strengths and weakness of different resolution videos tracking remains questionable. Tracking in low resolution videos is a critical problem in UAV tracking. To address this issue, we construct a group of low resolution tracking datasets and study the performance of different trackers on these datasets. We find that some trackers suffered more performance degradation than others, which brings to light a previously unexplored aspect of the tracking methods. The relative rank of these trackers based on their tracking results on the datasets may change in the presence of low resolution. Based on these findings, we develop a multiple feature tracking framework which takes advantage of image enhancement scheme to improve image quality. In addition, we utilize the forward and backward tracking to evaluate multiple feature tracking results. Experimental results demonstrate that our tracker is competitive in performance to state-of-the-art methods in different resolutions scenarios. We believe our studies can provide a solid baseline when conducting experiments for low resolution UAV tracking research.},

Recent developments in time-lapse microscopy (TLM) have allowed us to observe cell divisions in much greater detail than previously possible. However, it is a time-consuming process that relies on a highly trained staff and subjective observations. We describe an automated method based on a convolutional neural network to detect and classify cell divisions from original (unprocessed) TLM images. Here, we used two embryo TLM image datasets to evaluate our method: a public dataset with mouse embryos up to the 4-cell stage and a private dataset with human embryos up to the 8-cell stage. Compared to embryologists’ annotations, our results were almost 100\% accurate for the mouse embryo images and accurate within five frames in 93.9\% of cell stage transitions for the human embryos. Our approach can be used to improve the consistency and quality of the existing annotations or as part of a platform for fully automated embryo assessment.

Experimental data sets were acquired from 25 individuals diagnosed as healthy controls and ataxic patients. The proposed method includes the application of the discrete Fourier transform for the estimation of the mean power in selected frequency bands and the use of these features for data segments classification. The study includes a comparison of results obtained from signals recorded at different positions. Evaluations are based on classification accuracy and cross-validation errors estimated by support vector machine, Bayesian, nearest neighbours (k-NN], and neural network (NN) methods. Results show that highest accuracies of 77.1\%, 78.9\%, 89.9\%, 98.0\%, and 98.5\% were achieved by NN method for signals acquired from the sensors on the feet, legs, uplegs, shoulders, and head/spine, respectively, recorded in 201 signal segments.

Deep learning model is created by assuming the field values as outputs, and the geometrical dimensions of the waveguide as inputs. The correlation between the field values in the adjacent pixels is established by mean of feedback using a recurrent neural network.

The IVHFSs could help the IS-decision makers (DMs) by appointing interval-valued membership degrees for IS-outsourcing&#39; exercises among the conflict factors by regarding a set to the margin of errors. For a reason, preferences judgments of IS-experts are communicated by linguistic terms, which they are changed over to IVHF-elements. In the proposed model, the weights of evaluation factors or criteria and experts are figured in light of IVHF-preference evaluation technique and IVHF-utility degree strategy. Then, criteria and IS-DMs&#39; weights are given in the method of proposed assessing and ranking approach to decrease the errors. Furthermore, the judgments are amassed in the last step of the presented model to prevent the loss of information. At last, the proposed IVHF-group decision model is implemented to a case study to demonstrate its suitability along with comparative analysis from different aspects.},

  abstract     = {Recovering the 3D human pose from a single image with 2D joints is a challenging task in computer vision applications. The sparse representation (SR) model has been successfully adopted in 3D pose estimation approaches. However, since existing available training 3D data are often collected in a constrained environment (i.e., indoor) with limited diversity of subjects and actions, most SR-based approaches would have a lower generalization to real-world scenarios that may contain more complex cases. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes SDM3d, a novel shape decomposition using multiple geometric priors for 3D pose estimation. SDM3d makes a new attempt by separating a 3D pose into the global structure and body deformations that are encoded explicitly via different priors constraints. Furthermore, a joint learning strategy is designed to learn two over-complete dictionaries from training data to capture more geometric priors information. We have evaluated SDM3d on four well-recognized benchmarks, i.e., Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, CMU MoCap, and MPII. The experiment results show the effectiveness of SDM3d.},

It is a truth criterion related to the traditional personality conception, transcending gnoseological dualism of subjective and objective reality that is a characteristic of the modern humanities. The signal processing model developed in accordance with the criterion concerns neuroaesthetics indicating an opportunity of its computational foundation. Fechner’s law reproduced by statistical properties of the model, that relates the outer phychophysical scaling of a stimulus to the inner psychophysical sensation scale, is a confirmation of its adequacy.

Therein, we present a novel framework for defining and detecting anomalies in dynamic attributed graphs, where communities and outliers are mined in succession. Specifically, we propose a community detection model that combines dynamic graph clustering with learning of latent network structures into a unified optimization problem. The latent network is inferred from cascade data, and our model can sufficiently incorporate time-dependent attribute information for identifying dynamic changes. We then rank all the graph nodes according to their deviance from both their closest community centers and historical behaviors. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our model.},

  abstract     = {Outlier detection is an essential task in data mining applications which include, military surveillance, tax fraud detection, telecommunication, etc. In recent years, outlier detection received significant attention compared to other problem of discoveries. The focus on this has resulted in the growth of several outlier detection algorithms, mostly concerning the strategy based on distance or density. However, each strategy has intrinsic weaknesses. The distance-based techniques have the problem of local density, while the density-based method is recognized as having an issue of a low-density pattern. Also, most of the existing outlier detection algorithms have a parameter selection problem, which leads to poor detection results. In this article, we present an unsupervised density-based outlier detection algorithm to deal with these shortcomings. The proposed algorithm uses a Natural Neighbour (NaN) concept, to obtain a parameter called Natural Value (NV) adaptively, and a Weighted Kernel Density Estimation (WKDE) method to estimate the density at the location of an object. Besides, our proposed algorithm employed two different categories of nearest neighbours, k Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Reverse Nearest Neighbours (RNN), which make our system flexible in modelling different data patterns. A Gaussian kernel function is adopted to achieve smoothness in the measure. Further, we use an adaptive kernel width concept to enhance the discrimination power between normal and outlier samples. The formal analysis and extensive experiments carried out on both artificial and real datasets demonstrate that this technique can achieve better outlier detection performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper contributes to the expanding literature on VIKOR, a well-known multi-criteria decision-making technique. It is abundantly used to find the compromise solution regarding some significant criteria under different models. The general VIKOR methodology implements the principle that a recommended response must be a feasible solution which is nearest to positive ideal solution having maximum group utility and minimum individual regret. In this article, we propose a new strategy to address multi-criteria group decision-making problems named complex Pythagorean fuzzy VIKOR (CPF-VIKOR) method. It is designed to handle a great deal of vagueness and hesitation which are often present in human decisions. The CPF-VIKOR method allows the linguistic terms to express individual opinions of experts about the performance of alternatives and the weights of the criteria. We combine the individual judgments of experts with the help of complex Pythagorean fuzzy weighted averaging operator. Further, we compute the ranking measure with the help of group utility and regret measures by adjusting the weight of strategy of maximum group utility within the unit interval. We sort the alternatives in an ascending order relative to group utility measure and individual regret measure. Moreover, we demonstrate our proposed method with the help of a flow chart and two numerical examples: one for the selection of the most beneficial renewable energy project in Spain and another for the selection of the most suitable logistic village location in Turkey. Finally, we present the comparative analysis of our proposed method with the CPF-TOPSIS method to prove its validity.},

  abstract     = {A semi-supervised, one-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) approach called RVS has been proposed in this paper for video salient object detection. The proposed RVS approach involves the processing of each frame independently without explicitly considering temporal information. The RNN is trained using one-dimensional superpixel features to classify the salient object regions into salient foreground and non-salient background superpixels. Deep learning algorithms generally exhibit heavy dependence on training data size and often take extremely long time for training. On the contrary, the proposed RVS approach involves the training of an RNN using a small data which results in significant reduction in training time. The RVS approach has been extensively evaluated and its results are compared with those of several state-of-the-art methods using the public-domain VideoSeg, SegTrack v1 and SegTrack v2 benchmark video datasets. Further, the RVS approach has been tested using the authors’ own video dataset and the complex DAVIS and video object segmentation datasets to evaluate the impact of motion and blur on its performance. The RVS approach delivers results superior to those of several approaches that strongly rely upon spatio-temporal features in detecting the salient objects from the video sequences.},

  abstract     = {In view of the small number of categories and the relatively little amount of labeled data, it is challenging to apply the fusion of deep convolution features directly to remote sensing images. To address this issue, we propose a pyramid multi-subset feature fusion method, which can effectively fuse the deep features extracted from different pre-trained convolutional neural networks and integrate the global and local information of the deep features, thereby obtaining stronger discriminative and low-dimensional features. By introducing the idea of weighting the difference between different categories, the weight discriminant correlation analysis method is designed to make it pay more attention to those categories that are not easy to distinguish. In order to mine global and local feature information, the pyramid method is employed to divide feature fusion into several layers. Each layer divides the features into several subsets and then performs feature fusion on the corresponding feature subsets, and the number of subsets from top to bottom gradually increases. Feature fusion at the top of the pyramid obtains a global representation, while feature fusion at the bottom obtains a local detail representation. Our experiment results on three public remote sensing image data sets demonstrate that the proposed multi-deep features fusion method produces improvements over other state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

The proposed model is capable of modeling both the global degradation and local degradation of lithium-ion battery aging process. The global degradation process is regarded as the ideal aging profile without any interference by regeneration phenomenon. However, the regeneration phenomenon inevitably occurs in practical usage of lithium-ion battery and affects the local degradation significantly. Therefore, we separate the local degradation process from the global degradation process to represent the local battery aging process affected by regeneration phenomenon. We unify the modeling method for the global and local degradation process by exponential functions with cleverly designing of the corresponding cycles. The particle filter framework is employed to estimate the model parameters with measurement data. The future capacity is predicted after the identification, and the remaining useful life is extracted by calculating the difference between the predicted capacity and failure threshold. Model comparisons on benchmark battery datasets have been conducted. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of capturing the degradation and regeneration phenomena, and the remaining useful life prediction performance of our proposed model is better than state-of-the-art modeling methods.},

This motivates the need for flexible, autonomous and powerful decision-making mobile robots. These systems need to be able to learn through fusing data from multiple sources. Until very recently, they have been task specific. In this paper, we describe a generic navigation algorithm that uses data from sensors on-board the drone to guide the drone to the site of the problem. In hazardous and safety-critical situations, locating problems accurately and rapidly is vital. We use the proximal policy optimisation deep reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with incremental curriculum learning and long short-term memory neural networks to implement our generic and adaptable navigation algorithm. We evaluate different configurations against a heuristic technique to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we consider how safety of the drone could be assured by assessing how safely the drone would perform using our navigation algorithm in real-world scenarios.},

The main problem in the sensitivity analysis is the evaluation of total sensitivity indices. The mathematical formulation of this problem is represented by a set of multidimensional integrals. In this work, some new stochastic approaches for evaluating Sobol’ sensitivity indices of the unified Danish Eulerian model have been presented. For the first time, a special type of digital nets and lattice rules are applied for multidimensional sensitivity analysis and their advantages are discussed. A comparison of accuracy of eight stochastic approaches for evaluating Sobol’ sensitivity indices is performed. The obtained results will be important and useful for the surveyed scientists (physicists, chemicals, meteorologists) to make a comparative classification of the input parameters with respect to their influence on the concentration of the pollutants of interest.},

The feature engineering on attributes, especially on rich text information, could capture the global semantic concepts, while the relationship information could encode local structural proximity in multiple academic networks. To bridge the gap between semantic and relationship information in author name disambiguation, this paper presents a joint representation learning approach, which could encode both semantic and relationship information into a common low dimensional space. Specifically, the proposed method consists of four modules: (1) semantic embedding module; (2) relationship embedding module; (3) semantic and relationship joint embedding module; and (4) clustering module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed joint representation learning approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks.},

The modified HHO algorithm is tested via some benchmark test functions. Results are compared with each other and with classical HHO solutions. Then, the HHO and its modified versions are applied to optimum power flow (OPF), which is an important problem for power system engineering for decades. The algorithms are applied to IEEE 30-bus test system to minimize total fuel cost of the power system, active/reactive power losses, and emission, by comparing with recent OPF researches. Considering the applicability of the proposed approach and the results achieved, one can confirm that it might be a different alternative method for solving OPF problems. One of the important results of the paper in the IEEE 30-bus test system is that the cost of fuel is calculated as 798.9105 $/h with classical HHO, while it is calculated as 798.66 $/h with the HHO modified with SD function.},

As a consequence, investigating whether CMSDAEs can improve the MSDAEs imputation processes has an obvious practical importance. In this correspondence, two types of imputation mechanisms with CMSDAEs are considered. The first is a direct procedure in which the CMSDAE output is just the target. The second mechanism is suggested by the presence of the targets in the vectors to be autoencoded, and it uses the well-known multitask learning (MTL) ideas, including the observations as a secondary task. Experimental results show that these CMSDAE structures increase the quality of the missing value imputations, in particular the MTL versions.

Nonetheless, designing ML models remains a challenge and requires further research as most procedures adopt a trial and error strategy. In this study, we present a methodology to optimize the architecture and the feature configurations of ML models considering a supervised learning process. The proposed approach employs genetic algorithm (GA)-based integer-valued optimization for two ML models, namely deep neural networks (DNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The selected variables in the DNN optimization problems are the number of hidden layers, their number of neurons and their activation function, while the type and the number of membership functions are the design variables in the ANFIS optimization problem. The mean squared error (MSE) between the predictions and the target outputs is minimized as the optimization fitness function. The proposed scheme is validated through a case study of computational material design. We apply the method to predict the fracture energy of polymer/nanoparticles composites (PNCs) with a database gathered from the literature. The optimized DNN model shows superior prediction accuracy compared to the classical one-hidden layer network. Also, it outperforms ANFIS with significantly lower number of generations in GA.

Additionally, this methodology is instantiated in a method that is used to simultaneously segment the optic disc (OD) and fovea in retinal images. The OD and fovea are important anatomical structures that must be previously identified in any image-based computer-aided diagnosis system dedicated to diagnosing retinal pathologies that cause vision problems. Basically, the simultaneous segmentation method uses an OD-fovea model and an evolutionary algorithm. On the one hand, the model is built using the intra-structure relational knowledge, associated with each structure, and the inter-structure relational knowledge existing between both and other retinal structures. On the other hand, the evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution) allows us to automatically adjust the instance parameters that best approximate the OD-fovea model in a given retinal image. The method is evaluated in the MESSIDOR public database. Compared with other recent segmentation methods in the related literature, competitive segmentation results are achieved. In particular, a sensitivity and specificity of 0.9072 and 0.9995 are respectively obtained for the OD. Considering a success when the distance between the detected and actual center is less than or equal to $$\eta$$ times the OD radius, the success rates obtained for the fovea are 97.3\% and 99.0\% for $$\eta =1/2$$ and $$\eta =1$$ , respectively.

By using machine learning to label e-mails, the system can set up queues containing e-mails of a specific category.

This study aims to improve a manually defined rule-based algorithm, currently implemented at a large telecom company, by using machine learning. The proposed model should have higher $$F_1$$ -score and classification rate. Integrating or migrating from a manually defined rule-based model to a machine learning model should also reduce the administrative and maintenance work. It should also make the model more flexible. By using the frameworks, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn and Gensim, the authors conduct a number of experiments to test the performance of several common machine learning algorithms, text-representations, word embeddings to investigate how they work together. A long short-term memory network showed best classification performance with an $$F_1$$ -score of 0.91. The authors conclude that long short-term memory networks outperform other non-sequential models such as support vector machines and AdaBoost when predicting labels for e-mails. Further, the study also presents a Web-based interface that were implemented around the LSTM network, which can classify e-mails into 33 different labels.},

  abstract     = {Latency and reliability are essential parameters for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Therefore, an approach for node identification that satisfies the requirements of latency and reliability for URLLC based on the formation of swarms by dragonflies, called dragonfly node identification algorithm (DNIA), is proposed. This method maps bio-natural systems and legacy communication into metrics of URLLC, i.e., latency and reliability, for node identification. A performance analysis demonstrates that the new paradigm for mapping the metrics, i.e., latency and reliability, in terms of nodes (food source) and noise (predators) provides another dimension for URLLC. A comparative analysis proves that DNIA demonstrates significant impact on the improvement of latency, reliability, packet loss rate, as well as throughput. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed DNIA are evaluated using statistical analysis, convergence rate analysis, Wilcoxon test, Friedman rank test, and analysis of variance on classical as well as modern IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2014 benchmark functions. Moreover, simulation results show that DNIA outperforms other bioinspired optimization algorithms in terms of cumulative distributive function and average node identification errors. The conflicting objectives in the tradeoff between low latency and high reliability in URLLC are discussed on a Pareto front, which shows the improved and accurate approximation for DNIA on a true Pareto front. Further, DNIA is benchmarked against standard functions on the Pareto front, providing significantly superior results in terms of coverage as well as convergence.},

  abstract     = {Undoubtedly, one of the greatest issues nowadays is congestion. To face such problem, forecasting of traffic is required. Bayesian combined neural network (BCNN) is applied to four different locations in Kuwait (Cairo Street, Riyadh Street, Maghreb Road and Istiqlal Road) to predict the short-term traffic volume at the middle section due to traffic flow from adjacent intersections. All data were collected for a period of 1 week over 15-min observation intervals using loop detectors. In addition to time-series responses and regression plots, mean square error (MSE) has been used to validate the network performance after data normalization. In comparison with MSE and R values, both values were slightly less precise during weekdays compared to weekends. After standardizing, the average MSE during weekdays was 0.003468 and regression (R) was 0.98113 for the four streets. For weekends model, the average MSE was 0.003563 and regression (R) was 0.97374 for the four streets. Istiqlal Street weekday model was the best model that fits the information among all the four models; as it has the smallest MSE value equivalent to 0.0010087 and the highest R value of 0.9959. BCNN model has achieved outstanding prediction performance with great potential to be generalized for various locations at different times of the day. These results can allow transportation planners to forecast traffic congestions and take prior measures to avoid them. Further modeling can assist in studying factors causing intersection congestions.},

  abstract     = {To better learn the dependency relationship between nodes, we address the relationship extraction task by capturing rich contextual dependencies based on the attention mechanism, and using distributional reinforcement learning to generate optimal relation information representation. This method is called Dual Attention Graph Convolutional Network (DAGCN), to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on top of GCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in spatial and relational dimensions, respectively. The position attention module selectively aggregates the feature at each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions of nodes internal features. Meanwhile, the relation attention module selectively emphasizes interdependent node relations by integrating associated features among all nodes. We sum the outputs of the two attention modules and use reinforcement learning to predict the classification of nodes relationship to further improve feature representation which contributes to more precise extraction results. The results on the TACRED and SemEval datasets show that the model can obtain more useful information for relational extraction tasks, and achieve better performances on various evaluation indexes.},

Three renewable type DG units (such as wind turbine, solar photovoltaic and biomass system) have been integrated in the RDS. In this regard, an optimization problem is formulated considering multiple technical and economic objectives of the DG planning. A new metaheuristic, namely multi-objective modified symbiotic organisms search (MOMSOS), is proposed to solve this optimal DG allocation problem. A chaos-based cross-over operator is introduced in the parasitism phase of the proposed MOMSOS to enhance diversity in the population. The proposed MOMSOS is equipped with hierarchical non-dominated sorting technique which is superior to the existing fast non-dominated sorting strategy in terms of computational complexity. An adaptive penalty function is utilized for constraint handling. The proposed algorithm is tested on some CEC 2009 benchmark test problems to ensure its global optimization capability. Furthermore, performance of the proposed MOMSOS is validated on 69-node RDS and the obtained results are compared with other well-established multi-objective optimization algorithms.},

Conventionally, crop growth stage determination is performed manually by means of visual inspection. This paper investigates wheat and barley growth stage estimation by classification of proximal images using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). A dataset consisting of 138,000 images captured prior to the crop canopy closure stage was acquired from 4 sites (7 different fields) in Ireland. The dataset includes images of 12 growth stages of wheat and 11 growth stages of barley captured for a number of crop varieties, seed rates and brightness levels. A camera was held at 2 m from the ground and two camera poses were used—downward-looking and declined to $$45^\circ$$ below the horizon. Classification was carried out using three different machine learning approaches: (1) a 5-layer ConvNet model, including three convolutional layers, which was trained from scratch on our crop dataset; (2) transfer learning based on a VGG19 network pre-trained on ImageNet with an additional four fully connected layers, and (3) a support vector machine with conventional feature extraction. The classification accuracies of the aforementioned models were found to be (1) 91.1–94.2\% for the ConvNet model, (2) 99.7–100\% for the transfer learning model and (3) 63.6–65.1\% for the SVM. For both crops, the best accuracy was obtained using the $$45^\circ$$ camera pose and the transfer learning ConvNet model. For the growth stage classification task, the transfer learning ConvNet has the advantage of significantly reduced training time when compared with the built-from-scratch ConvNet model.},

Nonetheless, ABC has some similar drawbacks to the optimization algorithms in terms of the unbalanced search behavior. The original ABC algorithm shows strong exploration capability with ineffective exploitation due to the unbalanced search model. In this paper, a new ABC algorithm called MeanABC is introduced to achieve the search behavior balance via a modified search equation based on the information of the mean of the previous best solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments were divided into two parts: First, the proposed algorithm was tested on a comprehensive set of 14 benchmark functions. The results show that the proposed MeanABC enhances the performance of the original ABC in terms of faster global convergence speed, solution quality, and better robustness when compared to other ABC variants. Secondly, the proposed algorithm was applied as a hybrid with the FCM algorithm as a segmentation technique to a set of 20 volumes of real brain MRI images with 20 images for each volume. All of these images have several characteristics, levels of difficulty, and cover different domains. The obtained results are promising, especially when the performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation techniques.},

The DNN modelling method has stronger prediction capability than traditional NN and can deal with the modelling problem in the complex ICE data. The developed NN models were compared with the relative error analysis to verify the effectiveness of the deep NN modelling method. The activation function, the number of neurons, learning rate and backpropagation optimization method were considered as algorithm performance parameters for the design of optimum network by using the searching method. R2, MSE, MAE and RAE are used to evaluate the output performance of the deep and traditional NN model. Then, the autonomous and independent EGR cooling system is designed apart from the main cooling system of the engine with electric pump and fan components, unlike conventional systems. PID controllers are designed for these components, and the parameters of the controller are determined by pattern search optimization method. In this way, the exhaust gas temperature entering the intake manifold and EGR ratio are set to the desired value according to the BSFC and NOx output parameters under different operating conditions of the engine. Experimental results showed that the designed DNN controller-based autonomous EGR cooling system outperforms compared to the conventional system in terms of reducing the NOx and BSFC, with a 5.751\% and 2.997\% reduction, respectively.},

In order to improve the real-time forecasting of floods, this paper proposes a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference system termed as flood model Sugeno. A total of 12 input parameters were used to develop two fuzzy flood models—Mamdani and Sugeno. Whereas Sugeno FIS performed exceptionally well in predicting the river discharge, the Mamdani FIS failed to deliver the accurate results. The river Jhelum flowing through the Kashmir Valley in the northern Himalayas, India, was hit in September 2014 by a major flood and has been chosen as the case study to apply the fuzzy flood models. With a total of 24 rules in the rule base and five levels of linguistic variables, the flood model Sugeno predicted the river discharge with Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency of 0.887, coefficient of correlation (R2) of 90.74\%, mean square error of 0.00122, root mean square error of 0.0349, mean absolute error of 0.0139 and combined accuracy of 0.0466.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an effective network reconfiguration (NR) method in the presence of distributed generations (DGs) for energy loss. The proposed method uses average load and average power of DGs instead of the load and DGs’ generation curves. For finding the optimal network configuration, pathfinder algorithm (PFA) is used to solve the NR problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated on two distribution network systems without and with DGs placement. The obtained results show that the proposed method has a good ability to determine the optimal configuration similar to the method based on the graphs of loads and DGs with much shorter calculated time and PFA can reach optimal solution with a much higher success rate and better obtained solution compared with particle swarm optimization and sunflower optimization algorithms. As a result, the proposed method is an effective and reliable method for solving the NR problem for energy loss reduction considering time-varying condition of loads and DGs.},

These recommendations usually match the personal user preferences and assist them in the decision-making process. With the ever-expanding growth of information on the web, online education systems, e-commerce, and, eventually, the emergence of social networks, the necessity of developing such systems is unavoidable. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are among the most important techniques used in recommender systems. Meanwhile, with the significant advances in deep learning in recent years, the use of this technology has been widely observed in recommender systems. In this study, a hybrid social recommender system utilizing a deep autoencoder network is introduced. The proposed approach employs collaborative and content-based filtering, as well as users’ social influence. The social influence of each user is calculated based on his/her social characteristics and behaviors on Twitter. For the evaluation purpose, the required datasets have been collected from MovieTweetings and Open Movie Database.

  abstract     = {While conventional scheduling researches take production efficiency, cost and quality as objectives, increasingly serious ecological problems and energy shortage have turned scholars’ attention to energy-efficient scheduling. Meanwhile, maintenance activities are of great importance to equipment availability and production continuity. This paper addresses an energy-efficient multi-objective scheduling problem of a serial production line (SPSP) integrating production and maintenance, with the criteria of minimizing the makespan and the total energy consumption simultaneously. The impact of integrating preventive maintenance (PM) is analyzed, and the better interval mode is picked out. An energy-saving strategy combining shutdown windows of PM and energy-saving windows on idle machines is designed to cut down the total energy consumption. In order to tackle this NP-hard problem, a hybrid multi-objective opposite-based learning evolutionary algorithm (HMOLEA) is developed, in which the opposite-based learning and IGD indicator-based evolutionary mechanism are combined together and a special rank assignment is designed to improve the computational efficiency. Furthermore, a self-adaptive weighted mutation operator is fused into the framework of HMOLEA to enhance the exploration of the algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and superiority of HMOLEA in solving the SPSP.},

The proposed hybrid framework uses principal component analysis (PCA), 3D-CNN, 2D-CNN and SPP. The proposed CNN-based model is applied on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets, and subsequently the performance is compared with state-of-the-art methods in the same field.

The purpose of scheduling open shops problem is to provide a timetable for implementation of the entire operation so that the total execution time is reduced. The tasks scheduling problem in open shops is important in many applications due to the arbitrariness of the processing sequence of each job and lack of a prioritization of its operations. This is an NP-hard problem and obtaining an optimal solution to this problem requires a high time complexity. Therefore, heuristic techniques are used to solve these problems. In this paper, we investigate the tasks scheduling problem in open shops using the Bat Algorithm (BA) based on ColReuse and substitution meta-heuristic functions. The heuristic functions are designed to increase the rate of convergence to the optimal solution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, standard open shop benchmarks were used. The results obtained in each benchmark are compared with those of the previous methods. Finally, after analyzing the results, it was found that the proposed BA had a better performance and was able to generate the best solution in all cases.},

Models based on artificial neural networks nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARX), Elman’s neural network, and vector autoregression model were implemented. A special algorithm based on the analysis and prediction of the model residuals, which significantly improves the accuracy of the forecast, was proposed. For the prediction, we used the data of the main greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and water vapor (H2O) concentrations measured in summer 2016 in the surface layer of the atmospheric air on the Arctic island Belyy, Russia. The time interval of 192 h was chosen. The time interval was characterized by the significant daily variations in the CH4 concentration; the H2O concentrations did not have a pronounced trend. Values corresponding to the first 168 h of the interval were used for ANN training, and then, concentrations were predicted for the next 24 h. The accuracy of the prediction was determined by the set of errors and indices. The NARX model was more accurate than models based on Elman network and the VAR. The accuracy gain was from 16.5 to 40\% for the models, which predicted the CH4 concentration, and from 21 to 58\% for the models, which predicted the H2O concentration. The application of the proposed combined approach made it possible to increase the accuracy of the base model from 1.5 to 20\% for the CH4 and from 4 to 20\% for the H2O (depending on the corresponding errors and indices). The presented Taylor diagram was also showed the advantage of the proposed approach.},

Although several machine learning models achieve good prediction accuracy on their particular datasets, they may not perform well in other liquefaction datasets.

The applied base classifiers include back propagation neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, multiple linear regression and naïve Bayes. The hyperparameters and weights of the base classifiers were tuned using the genetic algorithm. To verify the robustness of the classifier ensemble, its performance was tested on three datasets collected from previous published researches. The results show that the proposed classifier ensemble outperforms the base classifiers in terms of a variety of performance metrics including accuracy, Kappa, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC and ROC on the three datasets. In addition, the importance of influencing variables was achieved by the classifier ensemble on the three datasets to facilitate the future data collecting work. This robust ensemble method can be extended to solve other classification problems in civil engineering.},

The proposed FFNNDLC is able to respond the effect of the system uncertainties and external disturbances compared with other existing schemes as shown in simulation results section. To show the ability of the proposed controller to deal with a real system, it is implemented practically using an ARDUNIO DUE kit microcontroller for controlling an electromechanical system. It is proved that the proposed FFNNDLC is faster than other FFNNCs in which the parameters are learned using the backpropagation method.

Most of the real-world applications, however, accept complex structure inputs containing data surrounded by meta-data which is processed in several stages comprising of the parsing and rendering (execution). The complex structure of some input files makes it difficult to generate efficient test data automatically. The success of deep learning to cope with complex tasks, specifically generative tasks, has motivated us to exploit it in the context of test data generation for complicated structures such as PDF files. In this respect, a neural language model (NLM) based on deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is used to learn the structure of complex inputs. To target both the parsing and rendering steps of the software under test (SUT), our approach generates new test data while distinguishing between data and meta-data that significantly improve the input fuzzing. To assess the proposed approach, we have developed a modular file format fuzzer, IUST-DeepFuzz. Our experimental results demonstrate the relatively high coverage of MuPDF code by our proposed fuzzer, IUST-DeepFuzz, in comparison with the state-of-the-art tools such as learn&amp;fuzz, AFL, Augmented-AFL, and random fuzzing.

  abstract     = {The different CNN models use many layers that typically include a stack of linear convolution layers combined with pooling and normalization layers to extract the characteristics of the images. Unlike these models, and instead of using a linear filter for convolution, the network in network (NiN) model uses a multilayer perception (MLP), a nonlinear function, to replace the linear filter. This article presents a new deep network in network (DNIN) model based on the NiN structure, NiN drag a universal approximator, (MLP) with rectified linear unit (ReLU) to improve classification performance. The use of MLP leads to an increase in the density of the connection. This makes learning more difficult and time learning slower. In this article, instead of ReLU, we use the linear exponential unit (eLU) to solve the vanishing gradient problem that can occur when using ReLU and to speed up the learning process. In addition, a reduction in the convolution filters size by increasing the depth is used in order to reduce the number of parameters. Finally, a batch normalization layer is applied to reduce the saturation of the eLUs and the dropout layer is applied to avoid overfitting. The experimental results on the CIFAR-10 database show that the DNIN can reduce the complexity of implementation due to the reduction in the adjustable parameters. Also the reduction in the filters size shows an improvement in the recognition accuracy of the model.},

The harmonic problems are mainly evolved because of extensive use of nonlinear loads in industry and domestic sectors. There are some adverse effects of harmonics such as: malfunctioning of sensitive equipment, resonance issues, conductors heating, power losses and reduced efficiency in distribution system. To mitigate harmonics issues passive, filters are used but when the harmonic component increases the design of passive filters is complex and becomes bulky. With the advancement in power electronic, the active power filter has been designed. Generally, the rating of the active filter is very high for some applications; hence hybrid shunt active power filter (HSAPF) is proposed by low-rated shunt active power filter (SAPF) and low-cost shunt passive filter. Proportional-integral or fuzzy logic controller is used to estimate the reference current and to regulate the dc capacitor voltage. To generate the switching pulse for the voltage source inverter of the SAPF, a novel adaptive fuzzy hysteresis current controller (A-F-HCC) is adopted. The performance of the proposed A-F-HCC-HSAPF is investigated during steady-state and transient conditions using MATLAB/Simulink and real-time environments.},

However, the current supply chain efficiency management cannot effectively control the risk caused by the inefficient supply chain management. In order to study the improvement in supply chain efficiency management, supported by machine learning and neural network technology, this study builds a supply chain risk management model based on learning and neural network. Moreover, this study evaluates the risk indicator system based on the current status of supply chain management. In addition, the model simulation research is carried out in the MATLAB platform, and the validity analysis of the model is performed with examples. Finally, after training the data through the training model, the risk assessment value is output, and strategies for coping with the risk are given. The research shows that the model proposed in this paper has a certain practical effect and can be considered for application.},

  abstract     = {Motor fault diagnosis is critical to predictive maintenance of electrical motor condition monitoring, whereas the conventional motor fault diagnosis method cannot effectively diagnose conditions caused by motors’ complex structure, non-stationary signals and mechanical big data. To solve the mentioned problems and enhance the fault diagnostic accuracy and generalization performance under different actual motor conditions, this study proposes an efficient, noise-resistant, end-to-end deep learning algorithm based on a novel capsule network with gate-structure dilated convolutions (GDCCN) for motor fault diagnosis; such algorithm is subtly incorporated with the input gate structure of long short-term memory network (LSTM), the dilated convolutions, as well as the capsule network. In the GDCCN model, the raw vibration signals are directly fed into the input gate structure of LSTM, which are employed to effectively remove noise and harvest more valuable information from the input sample. The dilated convolution is exploited in the output denoising feature maps to exponentially expand the receptive field of convolution kernel, so more redundant information can be acquired to reduce the effect of randomness. The capsule network is introduced to generate a set of vector neurons to represent an entity existing in the feature maps; as a result, more specific feature representations can be extracted, and the feature can be comprehended, thereby enhancing the diagnostic accuracy. As revealed from the experimental results, the GDCCN-based intelligent motor fault diagnosis method outperforms the other classical DL algorithms in diagnosis accuracy, noise resistance, generalization and transfer-learning performance of different workloads.},

The regression problems are treated here as multiclass classification tasks, and unsupervised learning tasks are considered as clustering problems. The proposed framework is tested on a number of regression and unsupervised learning benchmark problems and has shown promising results to handle regression as classification. The framework attains an overall average accuracy of 70\% for regression and clustering data sets. Deja-Vu+ is knowledge-rich hyper-heuristic framework, which is capable enough to transfer knowledge successfully. This knowledge transfer improves the performance of learning by avoiding the extensive heuristic search process.

This is the first attempt to implement H∞ guaranteed cost control for switched T–S fuzzy stochastic systems with intermittent actuator and sensor faults which allows more kinds of faults. Thus, the method has a wider application range. A dynamic output feedback controller is designed. Then, a closed-loop system is constructed.

Also, a pseudocode for the application of our solution is provided. $$\mathrm{(iv)}$$ The proposed algorithm is numerically evaluated on a transmission network to prove its practicality and efficiency.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a content-based image retrieval technique that focuses on extraction and reduction in multiple features. To obtain multi-level decomposition of the image by extracting approximation and correct coefficients, discrete wavelet transformation is applied to the RGB channels initially. Therefore, both approximation and correct coefficients are applied to the dominant rotated local binary pattern termed as texture descriptor which is computationally effective and rotationally invariant. For a local neighbor patch, a rotation invariance function image is obtained by measuring the descriptor relative to the reference. The proposed approach contains the complete structural information extracted from the local binary patterns and also extracts the additional information using the information of magnitude, thereby achieving extra discriminative power. Then, GLCM description is used by obtaining the dominant rotated local binary pattern image to extract the statistical characteristics for texture image classification. The proposed technique is applied to CORAL dataset with the help of particle swarm optimization-based feature selector to minimize the number of features that can be used during the classification process. The three classifiers, i.e., support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, and decision tree, are trained and tested. The comparison is based in terms of Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure performance metrics for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure values for most of the CORAL dataset classes.},

Automated continuous condition monitoring of industrial machines to identify these faults has become one of the key areas in research for the past decade. Among various faults, early-stage identification of insulation failure in stator winding is of significant demand as it is often occurring and accounts for 37\% of the overall machine failures. Also, this fault, if identified at its incipient stage, can predominantly improvise machine downtime and maintenance cost. In the proposed work, stator current signal data in the time domain from the experimental setup of both healthy and faulty induction machines are used to train the artificial neural-network models in order to identify the machine’s condition. Reducing the time required to train the neural network, features are extracted from the raw current signal data and then fed to the classifiers. Various performance characteristics of eleven neural-network models such as the number of features, number of epoch runs, training time, activation functions, learning rate, model loss function, and accuracy concerning each model are quantified. Only a few neural networks could classify a healthy and a faulty induction machine with 94.73\% efficiency on generalization the neural-network model with the raw data, whereas 98.43\% efficiency with the statistical featured data.},

Edge computing being a realm of cloud technology is orchestrated with server farms to enhance network efficiency. Edge computing increases the availability of cloud resources and Internet services. The higher availability of services and their ease of access deeply affect the user’s requesting behavior. The anomalous requesting behavior is creating malicious traffic, and enormous amount of such traffics at server farm denies the services to the legitimate users. Categorizing the incoming traffic into malicious and non-malicious traffic at server farm is the foremost criteria to eliminate the attacks, which in turn improves the QoS of the server farm. In the light of preventing the biased usage of the server farm, this paper proposes a SVM classifier based on requesting statistics. The proposed classifier discovers the attacks that deny services to legitimate users in two levels, based on the user’s request behavior. The pattern of arrival, its statistical characteristics and security misbehaviors are investigated at both levels. An incremental learning algorithm is proposed to enhance the learning plasticity of the proposed classifier. The experimental results illustrate that the performance of the proposed two-level classifier with respect to classification accuracy is competently improved with incremental learning.},

Most rainfall models in use today are process-driven; i.e., they solve either simplified empirical formulas or some variation of the St. Venant (shallow water) equations. With the development of machine-learning techniques, we may now be able to emulate rainfall models using, for example, neural networks. In this study, a data-driven RR model using a sequence-to-sequence long-short-term-memory (LSTM) network was constructed. The model was tested for a watershed in Houston, TX, known for severe flood events. The LSTM network’s capability in learning long-term dependencies between the input and output of the network allowed modeling RR with high resolution in time (15 min). Using 10-year precipitation from 153 rainfall gages and river channel discharge data (more than 5.3 million data points), and by designing several numerical tests, the developed model performance in predicting river discharge was tested. The model results were also compared with the output of a process-driven model gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (GSSHA). Moreover, physical consistency of the LSTM model was explored. The model results showed that the LSTM model was able to efficiently predict discharge and achieve good model performance. When compared to GSSHA, the data-driven model was more efficient and robust in terms of prediction and calibration. Interestingly, the performance of the LSTM model improved (test Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency from 0.666 to 0.942) when a selected subset of rainfall gages based on the model performance, were used as input instead of all rainfall gages.},

To automate TFD, we propose a transfer learning approach that uses freely labeled news titles to train diverse one-class and two-class classification methods. These include different text handling transforms, adaptations of statistical measures and modern machine learning methods, including support vector machines (SVM), deep autoencoders and multilayer perceptrons. As a case study, we analyzed the domain of alloy steel prices, collecting a recent Twitter dataset. Overall, the best results were achieved by a two-class SVM fed with TFD statistical measures and topic model features, obtaining an 80\% and 71\% discrimination level when tested with 11,081 and 3000 manually labeled tweets. The best one-class performance (78\% and 69\% for the same test tweets) was obtained by a term frequency-inverse document frequency classifier (TF-IDFC). These models were further used to generate a Financial User Relevance rank (FUR) score, aiming to filter relevant users. The SVM and TF-IDFC FUR models obtained a predictive user discrimination level of 80\% and 75\% when tested with a manually labeled test sample of 418 users. These results confirm the proposed joint TFD-FUR approach as a valuable tool for the selection of Twitter texts and users for financial social media analytics (e.g., sentiment analysis, detection of influential users).},

The challenge herein is not only due to the complication in increasing information in videos but also the requirement of an efficient method to retain information over a longer-term where human action would take to perform. This paper proposes a novel framework, named as long-term video action recognition (LVAR) to perform generic action classification in the continuous video. The idea of LVAR is introducing a partial recurrence connection to propagate information within every layer of a spatial-temporal network, such as the well-known C3D. Empirically, we show that this addition allows the C3D network to access long-term information, and subsequently improves action recognition performance with videos of different length selected from both UCF101 and miniKinetics datasets. Further confirmation of our approach is strengthened with experiments on untrimmed video from the Thumos14 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is frequently used as a preprocessing step to data mining and is attracting growing attention due to the increasing amounts of data emerging from different domains. The large data dimensionality increases the noise and thus the error of learning algorithms. Filter methods for feature selection are specially very fast and useful for high-dimensional datasets. Existing methods focus on producing feature subsets that improve predictive performance, but they often suffer from instability. Instance-based filters, for example, are considered as one of the most effective methods that rank features based on instances neighborhood. However, as the feature weight fluctuates with the instances, small changes in training data result in a different selected subset of features. By another hand, some other filters generate stable results but lead to a modest predictive performance. The absence of a trade-off between stability and classification accuracy decreases the reliability of the feature selection results. In order to deal with this issue, we propose filter methods that improve stability of feature selection while preserving an optimal predictive accuracy and without increasing the complexity of the feature selection algorithms. The proposed approaches first use the strength of instance learning to identify initial sets of relevant features, and the advantage of aggregation techniques to increase the stability of the final set in a second stage. Two classification algorithms are used to evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed instance-based filters compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. The obtained results show the efficiency of our methods in improving both classification accuracy and feature selection stability for high-dimensional datasets.},

  abstract     = {Human action recognition (HAR) is a topic widely studied in computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite the success of recent models for this issue, most of them approach HAR from the closed-set perspective. The closed-set recognition works under the assumption that all classes are known a priori and they appear during the training and test phase. Unlike most previous works, we approach HAR from the open-set perspective, that is, previously unknown classes are considered in the model. Additionally, feature extraction for HAR in the context of open set is still underexplored in the recent literature, since one needs to represent known classes with a low intra-class variance to reject unknown examples. To achieve this task, we propose a deep metric learning model named triplet inflated 3D convolutional neural network (TI3D), which builds upon the well-known I3D model. TI3D is a representation learning model that takes as input video sequences and outputs 256-dimensional representations. We perform extensive experiments and statistical comparisons on the UCF-101 dataset using a 30-fold cross-validation procedure in 25 different scenarios with varying degrees of openness and a varying number of training and test classes. Results reveal that the proposed TI3D achieves better performance than non-metric learning models in terms of $$F_1$$ score and Youdens index, indicating a promising approach for open-set video action recognition.},

This study used segmentation-type anomaly detection, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm, and multiphase exponential regression (MER) model to determine SOH of the Li+ batteries. By determining the changepoint boundaries using the characteristic values such as voltage transition rate (VTR), temperature transition rate (TTR), and charge capacities of the Li+ battery at the changepoint timestamps, we determined the parametric values of the biphasic MER. The characteristic transition rate values, which depend on the transition probabilities of the rolling standard deviations of the measured voltage and temperature, were later utilized with the matching charge capacities to model various training–testing dataset combinations. This helped to estimate the SOH of the battery at different life-cycle phases. This study also developed a technique for real-time estimation of the remaining useful life of the battery by using the MER model parameters, VTR, and TTR which were previously unseen parametric values of the Li+ battery. The result obtained from the proposed model indicates that our technique will be effective for online SOH estimation of Li+ batteries.},

Our model takes two steps: (1) in the first step, an asynchronous decoder model with a no ground truth guiding backward decoder that explicitly produces and exploits the future information is trained. (2) in the inference process, in addition to the joint probability of the generated sequence, an enriched-information decoding method is proposed to further take future ROUGE reward of the un-generated words into account. Furthermore, the future ROUGE reward is predicted by a novel reward-predict model, and it takes the hidden states of the pre-trained asynchronous decoder model as input.

In this paper, a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, named BRO (battle royale optimization), is proposed. The proposed method is inspired by a genre of digital games knowns as “battle royale.” BRO is a population-based algorithm in which each individual is represented by a soldier/player that would like to move toward the safest (best) place and ultimately survive. The proposed scheme has been compared with the well-known PSO algorithm and six recent proposed optimization algorithms on nineteen benchmark optimization functions. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on real-world engineering problems, the inverse kinematics problem of the 6-DOF PUMA 560 robot arm is considered.

  abstract     = {Interpretabilty is one of the desired characteristics in various classification task. Rule-based system and fuzzy logic can be used for interpretation in classification. The main drawback of rule-based system is that it may contain large complex rules for classification and sometimes it becomes very difficult in interpretation. Rule reduction is also difficult for various reasons. Removing important rules may effect in classification accuracy. This paper proposes a hybrid fuzzy-rough set approach named RS-HeRR for the generation of effective, interpretable and compact rule set. It combines a powerful rule generation and reduction fuzzy system, called Hebbian-based rule reduction algorithm (HeRR) and a novel rough-set-based attribute selection algorithm for rule reduction. The proposed hybridization leverages upon rule reduction through reduction in partial dependency as well as improvement in system performance to significantly reduce the problem of redundancy in HeRR, even while providing similar or better accuracy. RS-HeRR demonstrates these characteristics repeatedly over four diverse practical classification problems, such as diabetes identification, urban water treatment monitoring, sonar target classification, and detection of ovarian cancer. It also demonstrates excellent performance for highly biased datasets. In addition, it competes very well with established non-fuzzy classifiers and outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use rough sets for rule reduction in fuzzy systems.},

The relative error between the results of experimental and numerical model varies from 0.055 to 0.422, which indicates a good agreement. In the second part, after having validated the numerical model, we have created a database relating the deflection of pile to their contributory parameters.

The algorithm begins with the extraction of attribute-related information from autoencoder’s latent representation of an input image, by means of supervised principal component analysis. Next, appearance alteration is performed in the derived feature space (referred to as ‘attribute-space’), based on appropriately identified mappings between quantitative descriptors of image attributes and attribute-space features. Finally, modified attribute vectors are transformed back to latent representation, and output image is reconstructed in the decoding part of an autoencoder. The method has been evaluated using two datasets: images of simple objects—digits from MNIST handwritten-digit dataset and images of complex objects—faces from CelebA dataset. In the former case, two qualitative visual attributes of digit images have been selected for modifications: slant and aspect ratio, whereas in the latter case, aspect ratio of face oval was subject to alterations. Evaluation results prove, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, that the proposed framework offers a promising tool for visual object editing.},

When poor tracking occurs, the target is relocated according to the stored template.

  abstract     = {Given the rapid development of dehazing image algorithms, selecting the optimal algorithm based on multiple criteria is crucial in determining the efficiency of an algorithm. However, a sufficient number of criteria must be considered when selecting an algorithm in multiple foggy scenes, including inhomogeneous, homogenous and dark foggy scenes. However, the selection of an optimal real-time image dehazing algorithm based on standardised criteria presents a challenge. According to previous studies, a standardisation and selection framework for real-time image dehazing algorithms based on multi-foggy scenes is not yet available. To address this gap, this study proposes a new standardisation and selection framework based on fuzzy Delphi (FDM) and hybrid multi-criteria analysis methods. Experiments are also conducted in three phases. Firstly, the image dehazing criteria are standardised based on FDM. Secondly, an evaluation experiment is conducted based on standardised criteria and nine real-time image dehazing algorithms to obtain a multi-perspective matrix. Third, entropy and VIKOR methods are hybridised to determine the weight of the standardised criteria and to rank the algorithms. Three rules are applied in the standardisation process to determine the criteria. To objectively validate the selection results, mean is applied for this purpose.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the design of social software UI has become a design research focus in the field of design. Color affects many factors in UI design. However, there is currently no suitable method for effectively selecting colors in social software. In this paper, the color of social software UI design based on BP neural network is selected. The traditional BP neural network (BP), genetic algorithm improved BP neural network (GA-BP) and Mind Evolution Algorithm improved BP neural network (MEA-BP) are analyzed and summarized. Finally, the strong predictor and thought evolution method are used to improve MEA-BP-Adaboost. The experiment proves that the training results of the MEA-BP-Adaboost neural network are very good, and the color difference is reduced by about 30, 26.5 and 35.3\%, respectively, compared to the three different BP neural networks. The color selection method based on MEA-BP-Adaboost can more effectively improve the accuracy of color selection in the UI design of social software, while reducing the number of experiments. In the color selection algorithm, the color accuracy rate and recall rate of the seven different colors are basically between 90 and 95\%, which can basically achieve the desired effect. This also proves that the usability of BP neural network in social software UI design is very high. The methods involved in this article can be applied to other color space conversion and other image acquisition, display, processing and output devices. It is believed that these research works have certain theoretical guiding significance and practical application value to promote the development of color image color restoration technology.},

Because the knee joint has the characteristics of complex structure and large load, it is also vulnerable to damage. An effective diagnosis in the early stage of injury or lesion of the knee joint is of great help to the later treatment. At present, the commonly used knee joint examination methods have the problems of large trauma and high cost. Therefore, this paper uses machine learning technology to study the classification algorithm of knee joint vibration signal. The research results of this paper were verified by selecting the subjects to form a healthy group and a disease injury group. The experimental results show that the proposed signal denoising algorithm is superior to the traditional denoising algorithm. After analyzing several classification algorithms, the multi-classifier fusion algorithm has excellent performance in signal classification.

In this paper, according to the Cournot oligopoly game, the Nash equilibrium point between the power generation company and power generation user of the MG operating in island mode is obtained. According to the obtained Nash equilibrium point, the optimal ratio of power generated by the power generation company and by the power generation user in the model is calculated. At the same time, to achieve the maximum benefit and stable operation of the MG, a distributed cooperative control algorithm based on consensus theory is proposed. This control algorithm can cause each DG to generate power according to the total consumption load. The optimal power generation ratio distribution based on the Nash equilibrium point eliminates the steady-state frequency deviation of each DG in the MG, thereby ensuring the user’s power quality. The simulation results show that the control algorithm can achieve the above research goals.},

  abstract     = {To elude from the camera, suspects often hide behind other things or persons, leading to a series of occlusion patterns. These suspects are notoriously hard to search due to the substantially various appearance in the intricate occlusion patterns. Existing methods solving occlusion problem depend on learning several frequent patterns separately. It brings not only high consumption but also less coverage of patterns in real application scenarios. Different from the current researches which only concern certain patterns that do not synthesize the occlusion patterns in practical applications, we consider a wide range of occlusion patterns which conform the real application scenarios in one coherent model with less interference of both the occlusion and background areas and without redundant computation. Consequently, we propose a channel-guided mechanism (CGM) for occluded suspect search in this paper. The core idea is that different body areas have been activated via different channels in convolutional neural networks. By suppressing the effects of the interference areas, such as occlusion and background areas, we can filter out the visible areas which are the essential elements for the occlusion patterns. Channel-aware attention is introduced to learn the relation between areas and channels. Furthermore, we can identify suspects using a rule which focuses more on the visible area and focuses less on the occluded area in the specific occlusion pattern. Extensive evaluations on two challenging datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CGM.},

This paper presents a feedback control model based on a large number of real-time bottom-hole data, historical data and GA-BP neural network prediction. Through the intelligent control of throttle valve opening in the process of well killing operation, the fast, accurate and stable self-feedback control of bottom-hole pressure prediction and prediction output is realized.

The fashion retailer has been operating retail stores and warehouses in a major Asian city for decades. The volume of daily sales of each stock keeping unit in this city needs to be determined to develop an effective and efficient inventory and logistics system for the retailer. Based on complicated real sales data sets, we use a minimum description length neural network (MDL-NN) which searches for the optimal model size to predict this value. In order to address the problem of intermittent sales data and zero actual sales, we propose a revised mean absolute percentage error (RMAPE) measurement for performance evaluation. Our experimental results show that for most test data sets, the evaluation results based on RMAPE are consistent with those based on two other established measurements, the symmetric mean average percentage error and mean absolute scaled error. Specifically, on all three performance indicators, the MDL-NN method achieves a smaller error than almost all other commonly used sales forecasting methods on almost all test data sets. Finally, we examine the gap between the performance indicators between the forecasting result values in decimal format, which are directly generated by the forecasting methods, and the forecasting result values in integer format, which are rounded off from the decimal numbers. Our findings indicate that this gap is not trivial and should not be ignored.},

It is noticed that seismic mitigation efficiency for the variable friction coefficient is close to that for the high friction coefficient, but with notable disadvantages to the lower friction coefficient. As RFPS slipper transits from the low- to the high-friction area, the structural system could exhibit noticeable whipping effect, which will amplify story accelerations.

The purpose of this article is to study the protection methods of commercial confidential information, using the security relationship between data information in edge technology computing and the technical characteristics of data privacy information protection. This paper proposes a theoretical system and technical architecture centered on the use of data security technology.

Based on the image recognition theory, this study uses the differential projection method to define the boundary of the bill. The horizontal projection gradation of the boundary area of the bill character line is significantly reduced from large to small, and the horizontal difference projection of the grayscale image can be performed to locate the boundary of the bill image. The word height of bills studied in this paper is constant, the character line spacing is equal, and the horizontal differential projection is used to realize row positioning. The main process of the system is to first select the check image, and then the software part realizes the process of image analysis, preprocessing, character segmentation, feature extraction, character recognition, etc. Finally, the recognized amount is output to the interface. It is proved by experiments that the recognition rate of this algorithm is high, which can provide theoretical reference for subsequent related research.},

Different from the traditional steganography method, this method can encode the hidden data and send the interval value by embedding the data packet, thereby hiding and transmitting the hidden data. In this technology, the operation of hidden data does not affect the user&#39;s access request for real network data, and it can perform processes such as hidden data transfer and secondary authentication without the user being able to detect it. Through experimental verification and evaluation, our method improves the concealment of the steganographic channel, is not easy to attract attention and has no obvious statistical characteristics of the traffic, and can improve the concealment and robustness of the steganography technology based on network data streams.},

  abstract     = {Electricity, a kind of clean energy, has been widely used in people’s production and daily life. However, it is very difficult to estimate the electricity energy production in advance and store the rest of the electric energy due to the climate, environment, population and other factors. Based on data preprocessing and artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, this paper introduces a combined forecasting method. The proposed method contains six individual methods, and each individual method has its own usage. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is adopted to reduce noise from the original data; three individual forecasting methods, Jordan neural network, the echo state network, least squares support vector machine, are applied to obtain the intermediate forecasting results; two optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, are used to optimize the parameters of the combined model. This paper not only validates the superiority of the combined model compared to the single predictive model through the simulation experiments of power load data and electricity price data. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of the combined power load and electricity price forecast results are 1.14\% and 7.58\%, respectively, which are higher than the MAPE error of the corresponding single models prediction results. It has also been verified that the process of eliminating noise by the SSA plays a positive role in the accuracy of the combined forecasting model. In addition, two series of experiments on the power load data lead to two very interesting conclusions. One of the conclusions is that as the size of the test data increases, the prediction accuracy of the model decreases; the other is that the predicted result calculated through the optimized combined weight is better than the combined result calculated using the average weight, and the average weight is used. Weighted combination does not improve the prediction accuracy of a single model.},

In view of the characteristics of classification and heterogeneous data in volcanic ash cloud monitoring, a monitoring method of volcanic ash cloud using feature fusion, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) (FF–CNN–LSTM) is presented in this paper. In this method, firstly, the target features in image are identified by CNN and the time sequence information in text is extracted by LSTM. Secondly, the mapping relationship between text information and image features is learned by fusing image target and text high-level features, and then the identification and diffusion of volcanic ash cloud from heterogeneous data containing only image and text were performed. Finally, the presented FF–CNN–LSTM method is tested by the simulation experiment and the true heterogeneous data of Enta volcanic ash cloud case. The experimental results show that compared with the single CNN, LSTM and the simple combination between CNN and LSTM (CNN–LSTM), the presented FF–CNN–LSTM method in this paper can be fitted with less training steps and has high accuracy and low loss rate; the obtained distribution of volcanic ash cloud is clear and intuitive and has the characteristics with fewer model parameters, simple calculation and high accuracy. It also shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented method in volcanic ash cloud monitoring to some extent. The results reveal that the presented method can potentially contribute the monitoring of volcanic ash cloud and disaster prevention and mitigation.},

  abstract     = {Traditional network security detection models are trained offline using attack samples of known types. Although such models have high detection rates for known attack types, they cannot identify new attack types in the network layer. At present, these detection systems have the disadvantages of slow system construction and a high cost of model updating. Facing the increasing expansion of networks and endless attacks, these detection systems lack self-adaptability and expansibility, so it is difficult to detect complex and changeable attack events in networks. In this paper, the integrated use of immunology theory, complex adaptive system theory, and computational experiment technology is proposed to develop an Internet network layer security detection model based on an artificial immune system as an improvement over existing models of Internet network layer security. On the basis of testing knowledge, when a new type of attack is encountered, the online detection and learning process enables the dynamic extension of the network security detection model. Experimental calculations and an example analysis are presented to verify the scientific validity and feasibility of the model.},

When clients want to know the correctness of data anytime, they have to verify the data. In this paper, we focus on the validation of outsourced data. We propose a data correctness verification scheme to verify the correctness of cloud storage data. By calculating the validation data, when the user queries the data, it is easy to determine whether the cloud server returns the correct data. In addition, clients can update outsourced data. When updating the database, the clients can verify the correctness of the updated file by calculating and producing a new proof. The efficiency of data validation is very high, and the computational overhead on the client side is very low. This scheme is suitable for the resource-constrained devices, such as wearable devices.

With student&#39;s population of over 600,000, Chinese-foreign cooperation in running schools (CFCRS) has become one of the booming higher education forms in China. Compared with students in the non-cooperatively running programs, CFCRS students&#39; academic performances are weaker on average. To predict the academic-at-risk students and provide efficient supports to the students, a precise and prompt academic prediction is in great need. Therefore, this research aims at representing a more efficient and accurate model to predict academic performance of CFCRS students which will be based on graph convolutional network. In this research, student&#39;s similarity is measured on academic performance by Pearson correlation coefficient. An undirected graph in which similar students are connected is conducted. Feature matrix is composed of students&#39; previous grades. In addition, graph convolutional network is trained based on the undirected graph and feature matrix. In the experiment, it shows that this model predicts certain student&#39;s performance on certain course from the final exam results in previous semesters, which might improve learning efficiency and teaching quality. With an average accuracy of 81.5\%, graph convolutional network outperforms support vector machine and random forest models.},

However, no effective method for predicting the demand for museum tourism has yet emerged. In order to be able to build a prediction model that can perceive the needs of museum tourists, this article uses advanced algorithms based on neural network integration and calls different algorithms: QPSO-BPNN, QPSO, PSO, PSO-BPNN, and BPNN. When the training ratio increases to 90\%, the prediction accuracy of the three algorithms, BPNN, PSO, and PSO-BPNN, is less than 80\%, and the prediction accuracy of the QPSO-BPNN algorithm has reached 92.5\%. Under the condition of equal training set ratio, the prediction accuracy of QPSO-BPNN algorithm is always significantly higher than that of PSO-BPNN algorithm. When the training set proportions are 50\%, 70\%, and 90\%, the changes in population size parameters have little effect on the prediction accuracy of the algorithm. Based on the above experiments, it is known that the QPSO-BPNN algorithm is less sensitive to the size of the population, and the algorithm has good robustness. With the increase in the number of initial classifiers, the prediction accuracy of the QPSO-BPNN algorithm has improved significantly. The experimental results are consistent with the previous theoretical derivation analysis, and the accuracy of the algorithm has a positive correlation with the number of classifiers.},

  abstract     = {With the development of human society, the shortcomings of the existing transportation system become increasingly prominent, so people hope to use advanced technology to achieve intelligent transportation. However, the recognition rate of most methods of detecting video vehicles is too low and the process is complicated. This paper uses machine learning theory to design a variety of pattern classifiers, including Adaboost, SVM, RF, and SVR algorithms, to classify vehicles. Support vector regression (SVR) is a support vector regression algorithm based on the basic principles of support vector machine (SVM) and then generalized to the regression problem. This paper proposes a short-term traffic flow prediction model based on SVR and optimizes SVM parameters to form an improved SVR short-term traffic flow prediction model. It can be obtained from experiments that the classification error rate of support vector regression (SVR) is the lowest (3.22\%). According to the prediction of morning and night peak hours, this paper concludes that the MAPE of SVR is reduced by 19.94\% and 42.86\%, respectively, and the RMSE is reduced by 29.71\% and 47.22\%, respectively. Experiments show that the improved algorithm can obtain the optimal parameter combination of SVR faster and better and can effectively improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction. The target tracking pedestrian counting method proposed in this paper has significantly improved the counting accuracy. The calculation of HOG features can be further expanded, such as the selection of neighborhoods when calculating HOG features, and finally a more efficient pedestrian counting framework is implemented.},

  abstract     = {Based on the BP neural network model of machine learning method, the corresponding random input parameters are generated by Monte Carlo method, and the prediction of TBM driving speed is studied. In this study, the machine learning method is applied to the prediction of TBM penetration rate, and the established empirical model has higher accuracy and practicability. After selecting the predictive control type of BP neural network, according to the control requirements of TBM, system composition and the characteristics of different geological tunneling, the appropriate data are selected to train the neural network, and the predictive control model of neural network for TBM with high convergence and real-time performance is established. Monte Carlo method has strong optimization and control functions in the realistic planning of many complex problems. In the process of TBM velocity prediction, the random input of parameters is realized by Monte Carlo method, which makes the prediction more accurate. BP neural network is used to predict the penetration rate of TBM. Its accuracy mainly depends on the accuracy of input parameters. The actual measured and predicted values of TBM driving speed are basically near the straight line x = y as the horizontal and vertical coordinates, and the correlation coefficient R = 0.9789. Therefore, the BP neural network combined with genetic algorithm has a high reference value for the prediction of TBM driving speed. When the TBM type is the same and the system equipment is the same, four factors, namely uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, peak slope index, and distance between planes of weakness, are taken as input parameters of BP network by calculating the weight of influencing factors. In the specific operation, the genetic algorithm is used to iterate continuously to find the optimal solution of the initial weight parameters of BP neural network. In this study, this prediction method is applied to practical prediction. The feasibility of this method is verified by comparing with the final actual measurement result, which is of great practical significance to the evaluation of engineering, design scheme and cost control.},

However, the existing geological hazard danger zoning is slightly insufficient in accuracy and operating efficiency, and the effect in practical application needs to be further improved. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a study on the application of GIS-based artificial neural network models in the geological disaster risk zoning. This article first expounds the related concepts of geological hazards zoning and gives the principles to be followed. Then, the calculation of evaluation factors and risk level probabilities are proposed, and a hierarchical model is constructed using the analytic hierarchy process. The weight of each evaluation factor is multiplied with the information to obtain the weighted information. Calculate the probability based on the topographic features, stratigraphic lithology, and terrain slope. Combine the artificial neural network with BP neural network to predict the results. Through the simulation experiments on the geological data of the low-mountain and hilly areas in Wanli District, Nanchang, the results show that the proportion of high-probability-prone areas and medium-probability-prone areas predicted by this paper is as high as 91.87\%, and the evaluation results are consistent with the actual disaster occurrence better. The area under the ROC curve was 87.3\%, which also verified the effectiveness of the method in this paper.},

The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem of insufficient individual intelligence in evolutionary algorithms for assembly sequence planning, and a evolutionary algorithm for assembly sequence planning is designed. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the hybrid assembly sequence planning and assembly line balance problems. According to the assembly sequence problem, the number of assembly tool changes and the number of assembly orientation changes are transformed into the operation time of the assembly line. At the same time, the transportation of heavy parts in the assembly balance problem is considered. Then, by extracting the connection relationship and information of the parts, the disassembly method is used to inversely obtain the disassembly support matrix, and then, it is used to obtain the priority relationship diagram of the assembly operation tasks that indicate the order constraints of the job tasks on the assembly line. Aiming at the shortcoming that particle swarm optimization algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum, a various population strategy is adopted to shorten the evolution stagnation time, improve the evolution efficiency of particle swarm optimization algorithm, and enhance the optimization ability of the algorithm. Combined with the three evaluation indicators of assembly geometric feasibility, assembly process continuity, and assembly tool change times, a fitness function is constructed to achieve multi-objective optimization. Finally, experiments show that the multi-agent evolutionary algorithm is incorporated into the planning process to obtain an accurate solution through the various population strategy–particle swarm optimization algorithm, which proves the feasibility of the compound algorithm and has better performance in solving assembly sequence planning problems.},

  abstract     = {The meteorological data, measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM2.5 concentration from 2016 to 2017 in Fuling District of Chongqing were selected to study their correlation. The back propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) was used to build a PM2.5 prediction model with the meteorological factors as input, and the predicted PM2.5 values were compared with the measured ones. The results show that PM2.5 concentration has a piecewise linear relationship with temperature attributed to diffusion rate and premise conversion rate, a positive correlation with relative humidity, and a significant inverse correlation with wind speed, but no apparent linear relationship with rainfall, although rainfall has a significant purification effect on PM2.5. The similarity in the influence mechanism of AOD and PM2.5 concentration leads to a certain positive correlation between them. The predicted PM2.5 by the BP ANN model shows a similar trend with the measured one, but has some significant differences in numerical values. Therefore, it is feasible to establish BP artificial neural network to predict PM2.5 by using meteorological data.},

Applying BP neural network algorithms (NNA) to the IOT system will help improve the performance of the IOT system. The research purpose of this paper is to solve the problems of long-parameter measurement cycle and untimely feedback of the existing IOT online measurement system. In this paper, a multi-parameter (MP) IOT online measurement system based on BP NNA is designed, and a simulation test experiment is performed. The MP online measurement IOT system based on the BP NNA completes the parameter collection, analysis, and display through the perception layer, network transmission layer, and application layer. The core is that the system application layer adds the BP NNA to optimize real-time acquisition parameters, processing to reduce parameter measurement time. It can be known from algorithm simulation experiments that the online measurement system based on the BP NNA proposed in this paper uses the BP NNA to predict the absolute error value of the final moisture content and the measured moisture content within 0.3, and the absolute error of the moisture content value in actual production. It is acceptable in the range of 0.5, which speeds up data collection time. This system has a very good effect on improving the feedback adjustment speed of the manufacturing process system.},

  abstract     = {Lately, robot swarm has widely employed in many applications like search and rescue missions, fire forest detection and navigation in hazard environments. Each robot in a swarm is supposed to move without collision and avoid obstacles while performing the assigned job. Therefore, a formation control is required to achieve the robot swarm three tasks. In this article, we introduce a decentralized formation control algorithm based on the potential field method for robot swarm. Our formation control algorithm is proposed to achieve the three tasks: avoid obstacles in the environment, keep a fixed distance among robots to maintain a formation and perform an assigned task. An artificial neural network is engaged in the online optimization of the parameters of the potential force. Then, real-time experiments are conducted to confirm the reliability and applicability of our proposed decentralized formation control algorithm. The real-time experiment results prove that the proposed decentralized formation control algorithm enables the swarm to avoid obstacles and maintain formation while performing a certain task. The swarm manages to reach a certain goal and tracks a given trajectory. Moreover, the proposed decentralized formation control algorithm enables the swarm to escape from local minima, to pass through two narrow placed obstacles without oscillation near them. From a comparison between the proposed decentralized formation control algorithm and the traditional PFM, we obtained that NN-swarm successes to reach its goal with average accuracy 0.14 m compared to 0.22 m for the T-swarm. The NN-swarm also keeps a fixed distance between robots with a higher swarming error reaches 34.83\%, while the T-swarm reaches 23.59\%. Also, the NN-swarm is more accurate in tracking a trajectory with a higher tracking error reaches 0.0086 m compared to min. error of T-swarm equals to 0.01 m. Besides, the NN-swarm maintains formation much longer than T-swarm while tracking trajectory reaches 94.31\% while the T-swarm reaches 81.07\% from the execution time, in environments with different numbers of obstacles.},

It is gaining more attention due to the numerous applications in real life, for example smart surveillance system, human–computer interaction, sports action analysis, elderly healthcare, etc. Recent days, the acquisition and interface of multimodal data are straightforward due to the invention of low-cost depth devices. Several approaches have been developed based on RGB-D (depth) evidence at the cost of additional equipment’s setup and high complexity. Contrarily, the methods that utilize RGB frames provide inferior performance due to the absence of depth evidence and these approaches require to less hardware, simple and easy to generalize using only color cameras. In this work, a deeply coupled ConvNet for human activity recognition proposed that utilizes the RGB frames at the top layer with bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). At the bottom layer, the CNN model is trained with a single dynamic motion image. For the RGB frames, the CNN-Bi-LSTM model is trained end-to-end learning to refine the feature of the pre-trained CNN, while dynamic images stream is fine-tuned with the top layers of the pre-trained model to extract temporal information in videos. The features obtained from both the data streams are fused at decision level after the softmax layer with different late fusion techniques and achieved high accuracy with max fusion. The performance accuracy of the model is assessed using four standard single as well as multiple person activities RGB-D (depth) datasets. The highest classification accuracies achieved on human action datasets are compared with similar state of the art and found significantly higher margin such as 2\% on SBU Interaction, 4\% on MIVIA Action, 1\% on MSR Action Pair, and 4\% on MSR Daily Activity.},

  abstract     = {Recognition of unconstrained handwritten word images is an interesting research problem which gets more challenging when lexicon-free words are considered. Prerequisite for developing a lexicon-free handwritten word recognition technique is the segmentation of a word image into its constituent character set. Therefore, a competent character segmentation technique is required to design a comprehensive word recognition module. However, the literature study reveals that there is no standard word image database with ground truth information. As a result, most character segmentation algorithms found in the literature rely on self-made databases with manual evaluation. To fill the research need, in the present scope of the work, a comprehensive database consisting of handwritten Bangla word images is prepared primarily for evaluating any character segmentation algorithms. Additionally, the present work also provides two types of ground truth images related to segmented character shapes of the word images. Besides, an evaluation tool is developed for assessing the performance of any character segmentation algorithm on the developed benchmark database. The benchmark result, as found here, is 0.9212 (F-score) which outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.},

In real-world applications, the dynamic information happens simultaneously with the plan being carried out. In order to effectively solve dynamic VRP (DVRP), many optimization strategies have been introduced in the literature. A new variant of vehicle routing problem is proposed which combines DVRP with time windows and capacity constraints, named capacitated DVRP with time windows (CDVRPTW). Apart from the traditional way of handling the problem, this paper proposes a novel strategy that incorporates improved firefly algorithm (IFA) into the framework of spiking neural P (SN P) systems, named spiking neural firefly optimization (SFO). A mathematical model of the problem is formulated, and the solution scheme is designed by associating a number of SN P systems that work in parallel to find optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Additionally, the parameters in the IFA are optimized by adjusting the rule probabilities using SN P systems. Being a NP-hard problem with real-world applications, the benefits of this study are far-reaching. The proposed scheme has been tested on benchmark instances and proved novelty, feasibility, and potentiality of the system.},

  abstract     = {Appearance-based gender classification is one of the key areas in pedestrian analysis, and it has many useful applications such as visual surveillance, predict demographics statistics, population prediction, and human–computer interaction. For pedestrian gender classification, traditional and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches are employed individually. However, they are facing issues, for instance, discriminative feature representations, lower classification accuracy, and small sample size for model learning. To address these issues, this article proposes a framework that considers the combination of both traditional and deep CNN approaches for gender classification. To realize it, HOG- and LOMO-assisted low-level features are extracted to handle rotation, viewpoint and illumination variances in the images. Simultaneously, VGG19- and ResNet101-based standard deep CNN architectures are employed to acquire the deep features which are robust against pose variations. To avoid the ambiguous and unnecessary feature representations, the entropy-controlled features are picked from both low-level and deep representations of features that reduce the dimension of computed features. By merging the selected low-level features with deep features, we obtain a robust joint feature representation. The extensive experiments are conducted on PETA and MIT datasets, and computed results suggest that using the integration of both low-level and deep feature representations can improve the performance as compared to using these feature representations, individually. The proposed framework achieves AU-ROC of 96\% and accuracy of 89.3\% on the PETA dataset, and AU-ROC of 86\% and accuracy of 82\% on the MIT dataset. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed J-LDFR framework outperformed the existing gender classification methods.},

Early detection of the disease is important for the treatment. In this study, dynamic spiral test (DST) and static spiral test (SST) of PD patients were analyzed with pre-trained deep learning algorithms for early detection of PD. Fuzzy recurrence plot (FRP) technique was used to convert time-series signals to grayscale texture images. Several time-series signals were tested to observe the performances. The deep learning algorithms were employed as classifiers and feature extractors. Drawing and signal types’ performances for classifying PD were comprehensively investigated.

In addition, after constructing about 200 m from the inlet and outlet sides of the tunnel, using the field-observed data of these sectors in the tools, all the previously forecasted results were updated for unconstructed parts. Fivefold cross-validation has been applied to assess the performance of each model. The obtained models are used to predict construction time and cost in real scenarios, and the accuracy of each model was investigated through different statistical evaluation criteria. Finally, it turns out that all the models provide relatively high performance and reduce the uncertainties of tunnel geology. However, the GPR provides more accurate results compared to the SVR and DT tools.

  abstract     = {Electricity demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the operation of electrical power systems because it can provide management decisions related to load switching and power grid. Thus, there have been models developed to estimate the electricity demand. However, inaccurate demand forecasting may raise the operating cost of electric power sector, which means that it would waste considerable money. In this paper, a novel modeling framework was proposed for forecasting electricity demand. Sample entropy was developed to identify the nonlinearity and uncertainty in the original time series, after that redundant noise was removed through a decomposition technique. Besides, the most optimal modes of original series and the optimal input form of the model were determined by the feature selection method. Finally, electricity demand series can be conducted forecasting through least squares support vector machine tuned by multi-objective sine cosine optimization algorithm. The case studies of Australia demonstrated that the proposed framework can ensure high accuracy and strong stability. Thus, it can be considered as a useful tool for electricity demand forecasting.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we have proposed a fusion-based context-sensitive Masi energy curve model for multi-level thresholding exploiting cuttlefish algorithm (CFA). The proposed algorithm is simple and very efficient for the task of color image segmentation. Although Masi entropy exploits the additive/non-extensive information with the aid of a concordant entropic parameter, the performance is observed to be poor in the case of color image segmentation. Improved results can be obtained by using the concept of energy curve with Masi entropy at the cost of increased computational cost while selecting the suitable thresholds. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks as well as to increase the quality of the segmented image, a simple multi-level thresholding method is proposed in this paper. The proposed color image segmentation scheme exploits the concept of local contrast fusion along with CFA to resolve the aforementioned issues. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, experimental evaluations on standard daily-life color images have been reported in this paper. The experimental outputs demonstrate that fusion-based multi-level thresholding is better than the existing dominant segmentation methods.},

Segmentation of hippocampus (HC) is a very hectic process due to its anatomical structure of the brain. This work has been recommended for different optimization techniques such as lion optimization algorithm (LOA), genetic algorithm, BAT algorithm, particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony optimization to segment HC region from the brain subregions. The comparison of these optimization methods has been evaluated, and it showed better performance in LOA due to its individualities of escaping from local optima. From the obtained results, it is witnessed that the LOA has ability to segment HC region with high accuracy of 95\%. The LOA method showed the best classification accuracy compared to all other methods. Finally, the mini-mental state examination score validation has been attempted to reach the clinical targets as HC region is a major hallmarks for diagnosing AD.

The supervision and treatment of water resources have become a big problem of urban development. Water quality monitoring is not timely, flood warning is not timely is directly related to the livelihood of the people. And the development of smart water utilities can solve problems timely and accurately. By placing water quality sensors in the urban water supply network, real-time monitoring of water quality can be performed to prevent incidents of drinking water pollution. After an incident of drinking water pollution occurs, reverse locating the pollution source through the information detected by the water quality sensors represents a challenging problem because in the actual water supply network, the direction and speed of the water flow will change with the water demand of the residents, thus leading to uncertainty in this problem. In conventional studies of pollution source location problems, it is often assumed that the water demand is fixed. However, due to the variability of the water demand of residents, this problem is actually a dynamic change problem and thus can be considered as a dynamic optimization problem. In this study, a Poisson distribution model was used to simulate the change of water demand among urban residents. On this basis, we proposed an improved genetic algorithm to solve the pollution source location problem and implemented two different water supply networks to perform the simulation experiments, which could accurately locate the pollution sources. The simulation results were compared with the standard genetic algorithm to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Dispersing methane to a safer level is crucial for mines safety as methane has been the greatest contributor of explosion hazard in underground coal mines worldwide. Methane dispersion is affected by several geo-mining factors. This study is first of its kind, which makes an attempt to develop a model for predicting methane concentration in underground coal mines based on seven different geo-mining factors using multi-layered artificial neural networks. The main objective is to quantify the relative influences of these factors on methane dispersion in underground coal mines and identify the significant factors through sensitivity analysis. Three different architectures of neural networks were trained using the methane dispersion data generated through computational fluid dynamics simulations conducted at varied geo-mining conditions. Principal component analysis on the input set was done for dimensionality reduction, which reduced the number of variables to seven from eight while maintaining a variance of 99\%. All the models performed very well, and the best model yielded mean square error of 0.0304 and R2 of 0.942. The study unveiled some new facts on the relative effects of ventilation type and surface roughness on methane dispersion. It established that air velocity is the most significant and surface roughness of mine galley is the least significant factor affecting methane dispersion in underground coal mines with relative importance of 0.25 and 0.01, respectively. The outcome of this study will be useful in design of mine ventilation system for effective coal mine methane management and enhancing mines safety.},

  abstract     = {Groundwater flow in the Grasberg open-pit mine is governed by fractured flow media. Groundwater modeling in fractured media requires detailed hydraulic conductivity (K) value distribution to illustrate hydrogeological conditions of the Grasberg open-pit mine properly. The value of K is estimated by using the hydraulic conductivity (HC) system method based on rock quality designation (RQD), lithology permeability index (LPI), depth index (DI), and gouge content designation (GCD) data. Accordingly, all parameters must be available, but in this case, this information are only partially available. This paper proposes a method to solve this problem with artificial neural network (ANN) through a five approach scenario to find the K value with a model of incomplete empirical parameters. The artificial neural network back propagation (ANNBP) method is used to estimate the distributed K value based on the distributed observed RQD and LPI, as shown in the block model. This paper uses five optimum architectural schemes consisting of learning rate selection, momentum coefficient, number of nodes, number of hidden layers, activation method (sigmoid, tangent hyperbolic and Gaussian). Verification of the results of the K value is approached by the statistical approaches determination coefficient (R2), correlation coefficient (R), standard error of estimate (SEE), root-mean-squared (RMS), and normal root mean square (NRMS). ANNBP modeling used data for training and testing based on packer test and slug test as many as 49 points. Through five scenarios, it was found that scenario with learning rates of 10–5, momentum coefficient 0.1, number of nodes 10, number of hidden layer 5, with hyperbolic tangent activation methods is the most optimum result with R2 = 0.822, the accuracy of predicting/validating results is expressed by using R2 = 0.863, with R = 0.929, and the error percentage = 3.67\%. The K value prediction results are used as an input for groundwater modeling. The modeling results show a significant correlation with high validity between the data extracted from the model and field observation. In a 3D model, the K value distribution is similar to the field RQD data distribution. Furthermore, the K value distribution results are clustered in order to understand the relationship between geological as well as geotechnical data. The highest K values are found in volcanic breccia rocks (DLMVB), volcanic sediments (DLMVS), volcanic andesite (DLMVA) and quaternary glacial till. The geological condition is confirmed by the average rock RQD value between 12.4 and 39.6\%.},

  abstract     = {Fly ash-based geopolymer has been studied extensively in recent years due to its comparable properties to Portland cement and its environmental benefits. However, the uncertainty and complexity of design parameters, such as the SiO2/Na2O mole ratio in alkaline solution, the alkaline solution concentration in liquid phase, and the liquid-to-fly ash mass ratio (L/F), have made it very difficult to create a systematic approach for geopolymer mix design. These mix design parameters, along with fly ash properties and curing conditions (temperature and time), significantly influence key properties of the material, such as setting time and compressive strength. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to develop models for predicting the key properties of high-calcium fly ash-based geopolymer according to its mix design parameters. The correlations between experimental measurements and ANN model predictions of setting time, compressive strength, and heat of geopolymerization were established based on the results of tests on 36, 273, and 72 geopolymer mixes, respectively. The results show that the correlations between the experimental measurements and ANN model predictions of the properties studied are all strong. ANN modeling was found to be a suitable computing method to analyze the effects of design parameters on geopolymer properties and showed that L/F exhibited the greatest effect on setting time, alkaline solution concentration had the greatest influence on compressive strength, and a mole ratio larger than 1.5 significantly impacted heat at the geopolymerization peak. The developed ANN models can be used as guidance for mix design of high-calcium fly ash geopolymer in engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {The current wave of deep learning (the hyper-vitamined return of artificial neural networks) applies not only to traditional statistical machine learning tasks: prediction and classification (e.g., for weather prediction and pattern recognition), but has already conquered other areas, such as translation. A growing area of application is the generation of creative content, notably the case of music, the topic of this article. The motivation is in using the capacity of modern deep learning techniques to automatically learn musical styles from arbitrary musical corpora and then to generate musical samples from the estimated distribution, with some degree of control over the generation. This article provides a tutorial on music generation based on deep learning techniques. After a short introduction to the topic illustrated by a recent example, the article analyzes some early works from the late 1980s using artificial neural networks for music generation and how their pioneering contributions foreshadowed current techniques. Then, we introduce some conceptual framework to analyze various concepts and dimensions involved. Various examples of recent systems are introduced and analyzed to illustrate the variety of concerns and of techniques.},

  abstract     = {Procedural content generation in video games has a long history. Existing procedural content generation methods, such as search-based, solver-based, rule-based and grammar-based methods have been applied to various content types such as levels, maps, character models, and textures. A research field centered on content generation in games has existed for more than a decade. More recently, deep learning has powered a remarkable range of inventions in content production, which are applicable to games. While some cutting-edge deep learning methods are applied on their own, others are applied in combination with more traditional methods, or in an interactive setting. This article surveys the various deep learning methods that have been applied to generate game content directly or indirectly, discusses deep learning methods that could be used for content generation purposes but are rarely used today, and envisages some limitations and potential future directions of deep learning for procedural content generation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate evaluation of human aesthetic preferences represents a major challenge for creative evolutionary and generative systems research. Prior work has tended to focus on feature measures of the artefact, such as symmetry, complexity and coherence. However, research models from psychology suggest that human aesthetic experiences encapsulate factors beyond the artefact, making accurate computational models very difficult to design. The interactive genetic algorithm circumvents the problem through human-in-the-loop, subjective evaluation of aesthetics, but is limited due to user fatigue and small population sizes. In this paper, we look at how recent advances in deep learning can assist in automating personal aesthetic judgement. Using a leading artist’s computer art dataset, we investigate the relationship between image measures, such as complexity, and human aesthetic evaluation. We use dimension reduction methods to visualise both genotype and phenotype space in order to support the exploration of new territory in a generative system. Convolutional neural networks trained on the artist’s prior aesthetic evaluations are used to suggest new possibilities similar or between known high-quality genotype-phenotype mappings. We integrate this classification and discovery system into a software tool for evolving complex generative art and design.},
