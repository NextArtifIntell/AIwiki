  abstract     = {In collective foraging, interactions between conspecifics can be exploited to increase foraging efficiencies. Many collective systems exhibit short interaction ranges, making information about patches rich in resources only locally available. In environments wherein these patches are difficult to locate, collective systems might exhibit altruistic traits that increase average resource intake compared to non-interacting systems. In this work, we show that resource ephemerality and availability highly influence the benefits of altruistic behavior. We study an agent-based model wherein foragers can recruit others to feed on patches, instead of exploiting these individually. We show that the net gain by recruiting conspecifics can be estimated, effectively reducing the decision on patch detection to one based on a threshold. Patches with qualities above this threshold are expected to increase foraging efficiencies and should therefore induce recruiting of others. By letting foragers assume Lévy searches, we show that recruitment strategies with contrasting diffusion characteristics optimize conspecific encounter rates. Our results further indicate that active recruitment is only beneficial when patches are scarce and persistent. Most interestingly, the effect of choosing suboptimal threshold values is small over a wide range of resource ephemeralities. This suggests that the decision of whether to recruit others is more impactful than fine-tuning the recruitment decision. Finally, we show that the advantages of active recruitment depend greatly on both forager density and their interaction radius, as we observe passive strategies to be more efficient, but only when forager densities or interaction ranges are large.},

  abstract     = {The electrical energy grid is currently experiencing a paradigm shift in control. In the future, small and decentralized energy resources will have to responsibly perform control tasks like frequency or voltage control. For many use cases, scheduling of energy resources is necessary. In the multi-dimensional discrete case–e.g.,  for step-controlled devices–this is an NP-hard problem if some sort of intermediate energy buffer is involved. Systematically constructing feasible solutions during optimization, hence, becomes a difficult task. We prove the NP-hardness for the example of co-generation plants and demonstrate the multi-modality of systematically designing feasible solutions. For the example of day-ahead scheduling, a model-integrated solution based on ant colony optimization has already been proposed. By using a simulation model for deciding on feasible branches, artificial ants construct the feasible search graphs on demand. Thus, the exponential growth of the graph in this combinatorial problem is avoided. We present in this extended work additional insight into the complexity and structure of the underlying the feasibility landscape and additional simulation results.},

In this paper, we extend the problem of collective perception from simple binary decision-making of choosing the color in majority to estimating the most likely fill ratio from a series of discrete fill ratio hypotheses. We have applied direct comparison (DC) and direct modulation of voter-based decisions (DMVD) to this scenario to observe their performances in a discrete collective estimation problem. We have also compared their performances against an Individual Exploration baseline. Additionally, we propose a novel collective decision-making strategy called distributed Bayesian belief sharing (DBBS) and apply it to the above discrete collective estimation problem. In the experiments, we explore the performances of considered collective decision-making algorithms in various parameter settings to determine the trade-off among accuracy, speed, message transfer and reliability in the decision-making process. Our results show that both DC and DMVD outperform the Individual Exploration baseline, but both algorithms exhibit different trade-offs with respect to accuracy and decision speed. On the other hand, DBBS exceeds the performances of all other considered algorithms in all four metrics, at the cost of higher communication complexity.},

In our considered scenario, specialization is encouraged through a bi-objective composite fitness function for the genomes, which is the weighted sum of a local and a global fitness function. The former depends only on the behavior of an agent itself, while the latter depends on the effectiveness of cooperation among all nearby agents. We have tested two existing variants of embodied evolution on this scenario and compared their performances against those of an individual random walk baseline algorithm. We have found out that those two embodied evolutionary algorithms have good performances at the extreme cases of weight configurations, but are not adequate when the two objective functions interact. We thus propose a novel bi-objective embodied evolutionary algorithm, which handles the aforementioned scenario by controlling the proportion of specialized behaviors via a dynamic reproductive isolation mechanism. Its performances are compared against those of other considered algorithms, as well as the theoretical Pareto frontier produced by NSGA-II.},

  abstract     = {Interest in collective robotic systems has increased rapidly due to the potential benefits that can be offered to operators, such as increased safety and support, who perform challenging tasks in high-risk environments. The limited human-collective transparency research has focused on how the design of the models (i.e., algorithms), visualizations, and control mechanisms influence human-collective behaviors. Traditional collective visualizations have shown all of the individual entities composing a collective, which may become problematic as collectives scale in size and heterogeneity, and tasks become more demanding. Human operators can become overloaded with information, which will negatively affect their understanding of the collective’s current state and overall behaviors, which can cause poor teaming performance. This manuscript contributes to the human-collective domain by analyzing how visualization transparency influences remote supervision of collectives. The visualization transparency analysis expands traditional transparency assessments by focusing on how operators with different individual capabilities are impacted, their comprehension, the interface usability, and the human-collective team’s performance. Metrics that effectively assess visualization transparency of collectives are identified, and design guidance can inform future real-world human-collective systems designs. The individual agent and abstract screen-based visualizations were analyzed while remotely supervising sequential best-of-n decision-making tasks involving four collectives, composed of 200 entities each, 800 in total. The abstract visualization provided better transparency by enabling operators with different individual differences and capabilities to perform relatively the same and promoted higher human-collective performance.},

It permits to protect a restricted area from intruders using a concentric circles model where simulated UAVs evolve in these so-called security rings. Having UAVs arranged in rings fosters an early detection (outer ring) while increases the reliability of the surveillance system featuring a last detection barrier (inner ring). Using the first return map from a chaotic attractor (an unpredictable sequence of real numbers) and a dynamic pheromone map, the UAV swarm members make a collective decision about their trajectories evaluating the options of a best-of-n problem. As a result, routes are unpredictable and detection rates are optimised. The parameters of each UAV, i.e. amount of pheromones and ring assignation, has been tuned using a specifically designed evolutionary algorithm. The performance of CONSOLE has been compared to five state-of-the-art mobility models on 20 case studies comprising 30 different scenarios each. Empirical results obtained via simulations demonstrate the better performance of CONSOLE in terms of amount of intruder detected and detection time.},

  abstract     = {Quorum sensing (QS) is ubiquitous in distributed, multi-agent systems in nature—from bacteria to arthropods to primates—and has been proposed as a useful distributed algorithm in engineered systems—from multi-robot systems to Internet server farms. Achieving QS requires groups to collectively integrate information about their numbers and reach consensus on an action contingent upon those numbers. In nest-site selection tasks that employ QS in ants, sensitivity to encounter rate has been implicated as a mechanism for how individuals sense that quorum has been reached. However, little is known about how individual ants estimate proximity to the critical rate. Ant-inspired QS algorithms proposed by computer scientists either heavily depend on communication between agents or the ability for individual agents to accumulate information over many encounters with others. Both communication and significant memory storage may be beyond the simple capabilities of small-scale robots in large collectives. Alternatively, if cognition was embodied across the group of agents and their physical environment, cognitive abilities could far exceed the abilities of each individual. Toward this end, we propose a novel bio-inspired algorithm for QS on mobile agents within a confined space. Our approach does not require individuals to communicate or count over long sequences of encounters; instead, QS emerges from the random interaction of mobile excitable agents with each other and the physical cavity. We validate theoretical predictions for our algorithm’s performance in simulation, and we also show that it has good qualitative agreement with accuracy and response-time data from real ants. More broadly, our algorithm provides a new, concrete example of how ants can serve as conceptual models for hypothetical dynamic networks of mobile neurons.},

  abstract     = {Decentralised autonomous systems rely on distributed learning to make decisions and to collaborate in pursuit of a shared objective. For example, in swarm robotics the best-of-n problem is a well-known collective decision-making problem in which agents attempt to learn the best option out of n possible alternatives based on local feedback from the environment. This typically involves gathering information about all n alternatives while then systematically discarding information about all but the best option. However, for applications such as search and rescue in which learning the ranking of options is useful or crucial, best-of-n decision-making can be wasteful and costly. Instead, we investigate a more general distributed learning process in which agents learn a preference ordering over all of the n options. More specifically, we introduce a distributed rank learning algorithm based on three-valued logic. We then use agent-based simulation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this model. In this context, we show that a population of agents are able to learn a total ordering over the n options and furthermore the learning process is robust to evidential noise. To demonstrate the practicality of our model, we restrict the communication bandwidth between the agents and show that this model is also robust to limited communications whilst outperforming a comparable probabilistic model under the same communication conditions.},

Any system deployed for real-world applications will have to perform well in complex and uncertain environments, and a component of this is the limited reliability and accuracy of evidence sources. In particular, in swarm robotics there is an emphasis on small and inexpensive robots which are often equipped with low-cost sensors more prone to suffer from noisy readings. This paper presents an exploratory investigation into the robustness of a negative updating approach to the best-of-n problem which utilises negative feedback from direct pairwise comparison of options and opinion pooling. A site selection task is conducted with a small-scale swarm of five e-puck robots choosing between $$n=7$$ options in a semi-virtual environment with varying levels of sensor noise. Simulation experiments are then used to investigate the scalability of the approach. We now vary the swarm size and observe the behaviour as the number of options n increases for different error levels with different pooling regimes. Preliminary results suggest that the approach is robust to noise in the form of noisy sensor readings for even small populations by supporting self-correction within the population.},

  abstract     = {Collective perception allows sparsely distributed agents to form a global view on a common spatially distributed problem without any direct access to global knowledge and only based on a combination of locally perceived information. However, the evidence gathered from the environment is often subject to spatial correlations and depends on the movements of the agents. The latter is not always easy to control and the main question is how to share and to combine the estimated information to achieve the most precise global estimate in the least possible time. The current article aims at answering this question with the help of evidence theory, also known as Dempster–Shafer theory, applied to the collective perception scenario as a collective decision-making problem. We study eight most common belief combination operators to address the arising conflict between different sources of evidence in a highly dynamic multi-agent setting, driven by modulation of positive feedback. In comparison with existing approaches, such as voter models, the presented framework operates on quantitative belief assignments of the agents based on the observation time of the options according to the agents’ opinions. The evaluated results on an extended benchmark set for multiple options ( $$n&gt;2$$ ) indicate that the proportional conflict redistribution (PCR) principle allows a collective of small size ( $$N=20$$ ), occupying $$3.5\%$$ of the surface, to successfully resolve the conflict between clustered areas of features and reach a consensus with almost $$100\%$$ certainty up to $$n=5$$ .},

  abstract     = {We introduce and analyze a continuous time and state-space model of opinion cascades on networks of large numbers of agents that form opinions about two or more options. By leveraging our recent results on the emergence of agreement and disagreement states, we introduce novel tools to analyze and control agreement and disagreement opinion cascades. New notions of agreement and disagreement centrality, which depend only on network structure, are shown to be key to characterizing the nonlinear behavior of agreement and disagreement opinion formation and cascades. Our results are relevant for the analysis and control of opinion cascades in real-world networks, including biological, social, and artificial networks, and for the design of opinion-forming behaviors in robotic swarms. We illustrate an application of our model to a multi-robot task-allocation problem and discuss extensions and future directions opened by our modeling framework.},

  abstract     = {We propose an agent-based model of collective opinion formation to study the wisdom of crowds under social influence. The opinion of an agent is a continuous positive value, denoting its subjective answer to a factual question. The wisdom of crowds states that the average of all opinions is close to the truth, i.e., the correct answer. But if agents have the chance to adjust their opinion in response to the opinions of others, this effect can be destroyed. Our model investigates this scenario by evaluating two competing effects: (1) agents tend to keep their own opinion (individual conviction), (2) they tend to adjust their opinion if they have information about the opinions of others (social influence). For the latter, two different regimes (full information vs. aggregated information) are compared. Our simulations show that social influence only in rare cases enhances the wisdom of crowds. Most often, we find that agents converge to a collective opinion that is even farther away from the true answer. Therefore, under social influence the wisdom of crowds can be systematically wrong.},

  abstract     = {Biological transportation networks must balance competing functional priorities. The self-organizing mechanisms used to generate such networks have inspired scalable algorithms to construct and maintain low-cost and efficient human-designed transport networks. The pheromone-based trail networks of ants have been especially valuable in this regard. Here, we use turtle ants as our focal system: In contrast to the ant species usually used as models for self-organized networks, these ants live in a spatially constrained arboreal environment where both nesting options and connecting pathways are limited. Thus, they must solve a distinct set of challenges which resemble those faced by human transport engineers constrained by existing infrastructure. Here, we ask how a turtle ant colony’s choice of which nests to include in a network may be influenced by their potential to create connections to other nests. In laboratory experiments with Cephalotes varians and Cephalotes texanus, we show that nest choice is influenced by spatial constraints, but in unexpected ways. Under one spatial configuration, colonies preferentially occupied more connected nest sites; however, under another spatial configuration, this preference disappeared. Comparing the results of these experiments to an agent-based model, we demonstrate that this apparently idiosyncratic relationship between nest connectivity and nest choice can emerge without nest preferences via a combination of self-reinforcing random movement along constrained pathways and density-dependent aggregation at nests. While this mechanism does not consistently lead to the de-novo construction of low-cost, efficient transport networks, it may be an effective way to expand a network, when coupled with processes of pruning and restructuring.},
