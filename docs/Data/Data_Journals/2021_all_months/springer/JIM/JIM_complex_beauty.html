  abstract     = {There is an increasing need for the use of additive manufacturing (AM) to produce improved critical application engineering components. However, the materials manufactured using AM perform well below their traditionally manufactured counterparts, particularly for creep and fatigue. Research has shown that this difference in performance is due to the complex relationships between AM process parameters which affect the material microstructure and consequently the mechanical performance as well. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the impact of different AM build parameters on the mechanical performance of parts. Machine learning (ML) models are able to find hidden relationships in data using iterative statistical analyses and have the potential to develop process–structure–property–performance relationships for manufacturing processes, including AM. The aim of this work is to apply ML techniques to materials testing data in order to understand the effect of AM process parameters on the creep rate of additively built nickel-based superalloy and to predict the creep rate of the material from these process parameters. In this work, the predictive capabilities of ML and its ability to develop process–structure–property relationships are applied to the creep properties of laser powder bed fused alloy 718. The input data for the ML model included the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) build parameters used—build orientation, scan strategy and number of lasers—and geometrical material descriptors which were extracted from optical microscope porosity images using image analysis techniques. The ML model was used to predict the minimum creep rate of the Laser Powder Bed Fused alloy 718 samples, which had been creep tested at $$650\,^\circ $$ C and 600 MPa. The ML model was also used to identify the most relevant material descriptors affecting the minimum creep rate of the material (determined by using an ensemble feature importance framework). The creep rate was accurately predicted with a percentage error of $$1.40\%$$ in the best case. The most important material descriptors were found to be part density, number of pores, build orientation and scan strategy. These findings show the applicability and potential of using ML to determine and predict the mechanical properties of materials fabricated via different manufacturing processes, and to find process–structure–property relationships in AM. This increases the readiness of AM for use in critical applications.},

  abstract     = {EU regulations on $$\textit{CO}_2$$ limits and the trend of individualization are pushing the automotive industry towards greater flexibility and robustness in production. One approach to address these challenges is modular production, where workstations are decoupled by automated guided vehicles, requiring new control concepts. Modular production control aims at throughput-optimal coordination of products, workstations, and vehicles. For this np-hard problem, conventional control approaches lack in computing efficiency, do not find optimal solutions, or are not generalizable. In contrast, Deep Reinforcement Learning offers powerful and generalizable algorithms, able to deal with varying environments and high complexity. One of these algorithms is Proximal Policy Optimization, which is used in this article to address modular production control. Experiments in several modular production control settings demonstrate stable, reliable, optimal, and generalizable learning behavior. The agent successfully adapts its strategies with respect to the given problem configuration. We explain how to get to this learning behavior, especially focusing on the agent’s action, state, and reward design.},

Although these driving technologies have the capacity to advance the state of the art in manufacturing, it is not trivial to do so. Current benchmarks of quality, conformance, productivity, and innovation in industrial manufacturing have set a very high bar for machine learning algorithms. A new concept has recently appeared to address this challenge: Quality 4.0. This name was derived from the pursuit of performance excellence during these times of potentially disruptive digital transformation. The hype surrounding artificial intelligence has influenced many quality leaders take an interest in deploying a Quality 4.0 initiative. According to recent surveys, however, 80–87% of the big data projects never generate a sustainable solution. Moreover, surveys have indicated that most quality leaders do not have a clear vision about how to create value of out these technologies. In this manuscript, the process monitoring for quality initiative, Quality 4.0, is reviewed. Then four relevant issues are identified (paradigm, project selection, process redesign and relearning problems) that must be understood and addressed for successful implementation. Based on this study, a novel 7-step problem solving strategy is introduced. The proposed strategy increases the likelihood of successfully deploying this Quality 4.0 initiative.},

  abstract     = {With the big success of the Cloud Computing, or the Cloud, new research areas appeared. Edge Computing (EC) is one of the recent paradigms that is expected to overcome the Quality of Service (QoS) and latency issues caused by the best-effort behaviour of the Cloud. EC aims to bring the computation power close to the end devices as much as possible and reduce the dependency to the Cloud. Bringing computing power close to the source also enables real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel software reference architecture for Edge Servers, which is operating system (OS) and hardware-agnostic. Edge Servers can collaborate and execute (near) real-time tasks on time, either by downscaling or scheduling them according to their deadlines or offloading them to other Edge Servers in the network. Decision making for offloading, resource planning, and task scheduling are challenging problems in decentralized systems. The paper explains how resource planning and task scheduling can be overcome with software approach. Finally, the article realises the architecture as a framework, called Real-Time Edge Framework (RTEF) and validates its correctness with a use case.},

  abstract     = {Early cost estimation of machined parts is difficult as it requires detailed process information that is not usually available during product design. Parametric methods address this issue by estimating machining time from predictors related to design choices. One of them is complexity, defined as a function of dimensions and tolerances from an analogy with information theory. However, complexity has only a limited correlation with machining time unless restrictive assumptions are made on part types and machining processes. The objective of the paper is to improve the estimation of machining time by combining complexity with additional parameters. For this purpose, it is first shown that three factors that influence machining time (part size, area of machined features, work material) are not fully captured by complexity alone. Then an optimal set of predictors is selected by regression analysis of time estimates made on sample parts using an existing feature-based method. The proposed parametric model is shown to predict machining time with an average percentage error of 25% compared to the baseline method, over a wide range of part geometries and machining processes. Therefore, the model is accurate enough to support comparison of design alternatives as well as bidding and make-or-buy decisions.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high processing quality for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) in semiconductor manufacturing is difficult due to the distinct process variations associated with this method, such as drift and shift. Run-to-run control aims to maintain the targeted process quality by reducing the effect of process variations. The goal of controller learning is to infer an underlying output–input reverse mapping based on input–output samples considering the process variations. Existing controllers learn reverse mapping by minimizing the total mapping error for sample data. However, this approach often fails to generate inputs for unseen target outputs because conditional input distributions on target outputs are not captured in the learning. In this study, we propose a controller based on a least squares generative adversarial network (LSGAN) that can capture the input distributions. GANs are deep-learning architectures composed of two neural nets: a generator and a discriminator. In the proposed model, the generator attempts to produce fake input distributions that are similar to the real input distributions considering the process variation features extracted using convolutional layers, while the discriminator attempts to detect the fake distributions. Competition in this game drives both networks to improve their performance until the generated input distributions are indistinguishable from the real distributions. An experiment using the data obtained from a work-site CMP tool verified that the proposed model outperformed the comparison models in terms of control accuracy and computation time.},

An intelligent scheduling method combines Milk-run collection with drop and pull delivery together. Moreover, the LNG vehicles are simultaneously used in the whole process. With AJ company’s auto-parts inbound logistics as a case, the IIL mode is formulated with a mixed integer mathematical model. The genetic algorithm coded with Matlab is used to find the optimal solution. The results show that when compared with the original Milk-run mode, the IIL mode brings massive reductions in driving mileage, wait time and waste gas emission. It can make significant benefits in both economic and social sense. Therefore, it is entirely reasonable for management of industries to believe that the IIL mode will be a feasible and promising alternative for inbound logistics.},

  abstract     = {In the frame of the process monitoring domain, traceability in environments with non-exhaustive event logs remains as a challenge. In these scenarios, the discovery of the route followed by a particular item along the entire process is a difficult task since it is not possible to access all the required pieces of information from processes under monitorization. To tackle this issue, the concept of fuzzy traceability is brought into the scene. The gist of the latter is to use contextual information derived from the domain of interest itself to infer the most probable route followed. To carry out this task, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of additional sources of machine readable information that describes in a more detailed manner the process models under study. This information is included in the process models using the advanced features supported by the BPMN-E2 (Business Process Model and Notation - Enhanced Expressiveness) specification, an extension of the well-known BPMN notation. In this way , it is possible to properly use as inputs: time restrictions of the activities included in the process; decision-making and monitoring points included; and the effects derived from the activities undergone. As a consequence, a probabilistic estimation of the route followed is generated by combining this information according to the presented algorithm. After the validation and simulation of the fuzzy traceability algorithm using real-world models, the results obtained are positive and show that, as the contextual information included grows, the route estimation gets more acurated. This high success rate suggests that the fuzzy traceability proposal is useful for the analysis of processes with poor quality of monitoring information, and outdoes the application of more conventional traceability techniques.},

Based on the central composite experimental design, tests were carried out with three levels of process parameters for spot-welded titanium alloy sheets. Multiple quality characteristics, namely nugget diameter, maximum displacement, tensile shear load, and failure energy, were converted into a comprehensive welding quality index. The weight for each quality index to obtain the comprehensive welding quality index was determined based on the grey entropy method. The welding heat input for each welding joints was calculated based on the dynamic power signal in the welding process. The mathematical model correlating process parameters and the comprehensive welding quality index was established on the basis of regression analysis. The relationship between the welding process parameters and welding heat was also quantified using a regression model. The effects of welding process parameters on welding quality and welding heat were also discussed. To optimize multi-performance characteristics, the desirability function was employed. The verification test results proved that the method proposed in this paper effectively optimized the welding parameters and kept the welding heat input as low as possible at the same time. Welding current is the most significant parameter affecting the welding quality followed by welding time. This can be owing to its direct influence on the amount of heat supplied to the welding zone during the welding process. The method proposed in this study can serve as a guidance and recommendation for resistance spot welding welders to guarantee welding quality and meet the needs of high production and effective energy saving.},

  abstract     = {Wire plus arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique to produce large-scale metal parts with low cost. However, techniques to achieve accurate geometry control and high process stability have not yet been perfectly developed. Although implementing vision sensing and closed-loop control can contribute to promoting the levels of process automation and stability, it is difficult to markedly improve the geometry precision of parts by only performing the current layer detection due to a large detection lag with vision-based sensors. To deal with this issue, this study proposes a novel strategy of introducing the previous layer information into the current deposition height to increase the response speed of the control system. The previous and current layer heights are monitored by a passive vision sensor. The height features are extracted by image processing algorithms mainly including edge detection, threshold division, and line fitting. Deviations in deposition height are automatically compensated via controlling the wire feed speed based on a PID controller. A helpful software interface is implemented in the Visual C++ environment to study the automatic detection and control system. In comparison to the closed-loop control using only the current layer detection, the deposition height of thin-walled parts can be excellently controlled by the proposed control system using the visual inspection of previous and current layers, significantly increasing the process stability and achieving accurate height control in WAAM.},

The DyS algorithm dynamically determines the training set after oversampling the minority class, while the IENN can effectively suppress the oscillation in the iterative process of the DyS algorithm and improve the overall classification accuracy by removing the redundant and ineffective networks from the ensemble neural network.

  abstract     = {Statistical process monitoring (SPM) methods have been adopted and studied to detect variations in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process in recent years. The FDM process that builds parts layer-by-layer is accomplished in a specified manufacturing period (number of layers) without interruption or suspension. Thus, traditional SPM methods, where the average run length is used for the calculation of the control limits and the measurement of the performance, are no longer applicable to the FDM process. In this paper, an SPM method is proposed based on the surface image data of FDM parts with consistent layers and a specified period. The probability of alarm in a specified period (PASP) and the cumulative PASP are introduced to determine the control limits and evaluate the monitoring performance. Regions of interest are determined in a fixed way to cover the sizes and locations of different defects. The statistics are calculated based on the generalized likelihood ratio. The control limit is determined based on the specified period and the nominal in-control PASP. A simulation study for different locations, sizes and magnitudes of the mean shift of defects is presented. In the case study, the proposed SPM method is applied to monitor the FDM process of a cuboid, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel incremental model for acquiring skills and using them in Intrinsically Motivated Reinforcement Learning (IMRL). In this model, the learning process is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the agent explores the environment and acquires task-independent skills by using different intrinsic motivation mechanisms. We present two intrinsic motivation factors for acquiring skills by detecting states that can lead to other states (being a cause) and by detecting states that help the agent to transition to a different region (discounted relative novelty). In the second phase, the agent evaluates the acquired skills to find suitable ones for accomplishing a specific task. Despite the importance of assessing task-independent skills to perform a task, the idea of evaluating skills and pruning them has not been considered in IMRL literature. In this article, two methods are presented for evaluating previously learned skills based on the value function of the assigned task. Using such a two-phase learning model and the skill evaluation capability helps the agent to acquire task-independent skills that can be transferred to other similar tasks. Experimental results in four domains show that the proposed method significantly increases learning speed.},

Selective laser sintering, a RP technique, is used to produce the tool electrode made of AlSi10Mg. The performance of rapid tool is compared with conventional solid copper and graphite tool electrodes. The machining performance measures considered in this study are material removal rate, tool wear rate and surface integrity of the machined surface measured in terms of average surface roughness (Ra), white layer thickness, surface crack density and micro-hardness on white layer. Since the machining process is a complex one, potentiality of application of a predictive tool such as least square support vector machine has been explored to provide guidelines for the practitioners to predict various machining performance measures before actual machining. The predictive model is said to be robust one as root mean square error in the range of 0.11–0.34 is obtained for various performance measures. A hybrid optimization technique known as desirability based grey relational analysis in combination with firefly algorithm is adopted for simultaneously optimizing the performance measures. It is observed that peak current and tool type are the significant parameters influencing all the performance measures.},

  abstract     = {The aerospace industry has established the Automated Fiber Placement process as a common technique for manufacturing fibre reinforced components. In this process multiple composite tows are placed simultaneously onto a tool. Currently in such processes manual testing requires often up to 50% of the manufacturing duration. Moreover, the accuracy of quality assurance varies significantly with the inspector in charge. Thus, inspection automation provides an effective way to increase efficiency. However, to achieve a proper inspection performance, the segmentation of layup defects need to be examined. In order to improve such defect detection systems, this paper performs a comprehensive ranking of segmentation techniques. Thus, 29 statistical, spectral and structural algorithms from related work were evaluated based on nine substantial criteria as assessed from literature and process requirements. For reasons of determinism and easy technology transferability without the need of much training data, the development of new Machine Learning algorithms is not part of this paper. Afterwards, seven of the most auspicious algorithms were studied experimentally. Therefore, laser line scan sensor depth maps from fibre placement defects were utilised. Furthermore noisy images were generated and applied for testing algorithm robustness. The test data contained five defect categories with 50 samples per class. It was concluded that Adaptive Thresholding and Cell Wise Standard Deviation Thresholding work best yielding detection accuracies mostly $$&gt; 97$$ %. Noteworthy is that influenced input data can affect the detection results. Feasible algorithms with sensible parameter settings were able to perform reliable defect segmentation for layed material.},

  abstract     = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) brings together new disruptive technologies, increasing future factories’ productivity. Indeed, the control of production processes is fast becoming a key driver for manufacturing operations. Manufacturing control systems have recently been developed for distributed or semi-heterarchical architectures, e.g., holonic systems improving global efficiency and manufacturing operations’ reactiveness. So far, previous studies and applications have not dealt with continuous production processes, such as applications for Water Supply System (WSS), oil refining, or electric power plants. The complexity of continuous production is that a single fault can degrade extensively and even cause service disruption. Therefore, this paper proposes the Holonic Production Unit (HPU) architecture as a solution to control continuous production processes. An HPU is created as a holon unit depicting resources in a continuous process. This unit can detect events within the environment, evaluate several courses of action, and change the parameters aligned to a mission. The proposed approach was tested using a simulated model of WSS. The experiments described in this paper were conducted using a traditional WSS, where the communication and decision-making features allow the application of HPU. The results suggest that constructing a holarchy with different holons can fulfill I4.0 requirements for continuous production processes.},

  abstract     = {In the era of Industry 4.0, the ease of access to precise measurements in real-time and the existence of machine-learning (ML) techniques will play a vital role in building practical tools to isolate inefficiencies in energy-intensive processes. This paper aims at developing an abnormal event diagnosis (AED) tool based on ML techniques for monitoring the operation of industrial processes. This tool makes it easier for operators to accomplish their tasks and to make quick and accurate decisions to ensure highly efficient processes. One of the most popular ML techniques for AED is the multivariate statistical control (MSC) method; it only requires the dataset of the normal operating conditions (NOC) to detect and identify the variables that contribute to abnormal events (AEs). Despite the popularity of MSC, it is challenging to select the appropriate method for detecting and isolating all possible abnormalities a complex industrial process can experience. To address this limitation and improve efficiency, we have developed a generic methodology that integrates different ML techniques into a unified multiagent based approach, the selected ML techniques are supposed to be built using only the normal operating condition. For the sake of demonstration, we chose a combination of two ML methods: principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The k-NN was integrated into the proposed multiagent to take into account the nonlinearity and multimodality that frequently occur in industrial processes. In addition, we modified a k-NN method proposed in the literature to reduce computation time during real-time detection and isolation. Finally, the proposed methodology was successfully validated to monitor the energy efficiency of a reboiler located in a thermomechanical pulp mill.},

The CPPS is known as a trend of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) focusing on flexibility regarding new products and adaptability to new requirements. This paper focuses on two I4.0 scenarios described by the Platform Industrie 4.0 that describe challenges for the industry towards its digital future. First, it looks at the Order Controlled Production (OCP) scenario that deals with flexible and self-configuring production networks. It describes the dynamic organization of production resources required to execute a production order. Second, the Adaptable Factory (AF) application scenario is discussed, which focuses on the configuration of production resources and describes the adaptability of an individual facility through (physical) modification. This paper first provides a detailed analysis of the requirements from these scenarios. Furthermore, it analyses the current Multi-Agent System (MAS) architectures and agent-based planning and decision support systems requirements. MAS can be used to create application-independent I4.0 systems with arbitrary hardware automation platforms. To create a scalable communication network that also supports application independence and enables the semantically machine-readable description of the exchanged data, the OPC UA standard was adopted. As a result of the study, the concept shows how different and independent automation platforms can be seamlessly connected via OPC UA. The proposed MAS concept has been evaluated in different use cases, namely OCP and AF.},

However, due to the nonlinear and dynamic characteristics of industrial process data, the accuracy and efficiency of fault detection and diagnosis methods have always been an urgent problem in industry and academia. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive fault detection and root-cause analysis scheme for complex industrial processes using moving window kernel principle component analysis (KPCA) and information geometric causal inference (IGCI). The proposed scheme has three main contributions. Firstly, a research scheme combining moving window KPCA with adaptive threshold is presented to handle the nonlinear and dynamic characteristics of complex industrial processes. Then, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is employed to select the optimal hyperparameters for fault detection, which not only avoids the blindness of hyperparameters selection, but also maximize model accuracy. Finally, the IGCI-based fault root-cause analysis method can help field operators to take corrective measures in time to resume the normal process. The proposed scheme is tested by the Tennessee Eastman platform. Its results show that this scheme has a good performance in reducing the faulty false alarms and missed detection rates and locating fault root-cause.},

To this end, we propose a novel approach for RUL estimation in this paper, based on deep neural architecture due to its great success in sequence learning. Specifically, we take the Transformer encoder as the backbone of our model to capture short- and long-term dependencies in a time sequence. Compared with convolutional neural network based methods, there is no limitation from the kernel size for a complete receptive field of all time steps. While compared with recurrent neural network based methods, we develop our model based on dot-product self-attention, enabling it to fully exploit parallel computation. Moreover, we further propose a gated convolutional unit to facilitate the model’s ability of incorporating local contexts at each time step, for the attention mechanism used in the Transformer encoder makes the output high-level features insensitive to local contexts. We conduct experiments on the C-MAPSS datasets and show that, the performance of our model is superior or comparable to those of other existing methods. We also carry out ablation studies and demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of each component used in the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a smart supervisory framework for a single process controller, designed for Industry 4.0 shop floors. This digitization of a full supervisory suite for a single process controller enables self-awareness, self-diagnosis, self-prognosis, and self-healing (by definition, these &quot;self&quot; elements are missing from other supervisory frameworks diagnosing numerous controllers in parallel). The proposed framework is aligned with the concept of a Cyber Physical System (CPS), since its implementation generates a rich cyber physical entity of the controlled process. This CPS entity can either be considered as the process digital twin, or can provide a solid basis for generating it. Finally, the framework includes the main characteristics of Industry 4.0, such as advanced use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analysis. The framework is based on four modules: (1) Control and Awareness module—performing both continuous process control and adjustments, as well as machine learning (ML) and statistical process control (SPC) for identifying abnormalities that require further diagnosis; (2) Process -diagnosis module—performing continual (recurrent) analysis of the process state and trends; (3) Prognosis and Healing module—performing prognosis and automated intervention via parameter changes, re-configurations, and automated maintenance; (4) External Interaction Platform—an interactive module for interfacing with experts, presenting them with the process analysis information and obtaining feedback from them as part of a learning process. Using an implementation showcase to illustrate the methodological framework’s applicability, we demonstrate its real-world potential. The proposed framework could serve as a guide for implementing smart process control and maintenance systems in Industry 4.0 shop floors. It could also provide a firm basis for comparison with future suggested frameworks. Future research directions could include pursuing improvements to the proposed process control framework and validating the framework by case studies of its implementation.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) in the industry is a topic that has been largely studied in the literature. Many authors focused on reliability-based approaches to optimize O&amp;M, but little attention has been given to study the influence of macroeconomic variables on the long-term maintenance policy. This work aims to optimize time-based maintenance (TBM) policy in the mining industry. The mine environment is reproduced employing a virtual model that resembles a digital twin (DT) of the system. The effect of maintenance decisions is replicated by a discrete event simulation (DES), whereas a model of the financial operability of the mine is realized through System Dynamics (SD). The simultaneous use of DES and the SD allows us to reproduce the environment with high-fidelity and to minimize the cost of O&amp;M. The selected illustrative case example demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible. The issues of using high dimensional simulation data from DT-models in managerial decision making is identified and discussed.},

A fixture for thermo-mechanical treatment of long low-rigidity shafts was designed and used in tests which involved axial straightening of shafts combined with a quenching operation (performed to increase the corrosion resistance of the steel used as stock material). The study showed that an analysis of the initial deflections of semi-finished shafts of different dimensions and determination of the maximum corrective deflection in the device could be used as a basis for performing axial straightening of shaft workpieces with simultaneous heat treatment and correction of the initial deflection of the workpiece. The deflection is corrected by stretching the fibers of the stock material, at any cross-section of the shaft, up to the yield point and generating residual stresses symmetrical to the axis of the workpiece. These processes allow to increase the accuracy and stability of the geometric shape of the shaft.},

This research is based on the idea to achieve great cost and operational benefits especially in the field of tool making for injection molding by combining traditional and additive manufacturing in one process chain. Special attention is given to the surface quality in terms of surface roughness and its optimization directly in the Selective Laser Melting process. This article presents the possibility for a remelting process of the SLM parts as a way to optimize the surfaces of the produced parts. The influence of laser remelting on the surface roughness of the parts is analyzed while varying machine parameters like laser power and scan settings. Laser remelting with optimized parameter settings considerably improves the surface quality of SLM parts and is a great starting point for further post-processing techniques, which require a low initial value of surface roughness.},

The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system’s performance.},

  abstract     = {Successful products are those presenting the highest quality at a fair cost. Although different approaches can be used to define the concept of quality, functional reliability is always a major requirement, due to implications such as safety and user losses regarding maintenance expenses, and product availability. Intelligent designs are robust and result in a fair cost. Robust designs are those insensitive to sources of variation occurring during the product life, keeping their performance under variable use conditions, like thermal and stress effects. The robustness approach is a function of two main design criteria: low complexity and tolerance design. Design for manufacture and assembly is closely related to decreasing complexity. Tolerance design is a tool in which the unavoidable manufacturing variations are considered during product development. This work presents a proposal for an intelligent design in an actual application by considering design simplification through the reduction of parts for an automotive water pump. The tolerance analysis is performed by means of a powerful statistical approach—a Monte Carlo simulation—in which process behavior is randomly simulated representing a high production volume. Additionally, service thermal effects are also contemplated, and assembly tests are proposed for automatic rejection of non-conforming parts, assuring high reliability and full compliance with functional requirements. This is an example of integrated design–manufacturing work aiming at both cost saving and improved reliability.},

The proposed model makes a joint transportation process and crane maintenance scheduling, relevant to assure more robust performances in stochastic environments, as well as to assess and optimize performances at different levels, from components and transport device to production systems (container terminal). The crane operation risk is estimated with a sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation model and the optimization model behind of IMDMM is supported through the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms because the objective function a non-linear stochastics problem with bounded constrains.

Firstly, a features correlation and redundancy measure method based on mutual information (MI) and conditional MI is proposed, unsupervised feature reduction is completed based on the principle of maximum correlation-minimum redundancy. Secondly, a DP-WFCM based clustering model is established to identify clusters with fewer samples to detect production anomalies. DP is used to obtain the initial clustering centers to solve the problem that FCM is sensitive to the initial centers and the clusters number needs to be determined manually in advance. MI-based similarities are introduced as weight coefficients to guide the clustering process, which improves convergence speed and clustering quality. Finally, a real case from an IoT enabled machining workshop is carried out to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method in anomaly detection of manufacturing process.},

We focus on applying advanced object detection techniques to surface defect inspection algorithm for sheet steel. In the proposed steel surface defect inspection model, a deformable convolution enhanced backbone network firstly extracts complex features from multi-shape steel surface defects. Then the feature fusion network with balanced feature pyramid generates high-quality multi-resolution feature maps for the inspection of multi-size defects. Finally, detector network achieves the localization and classification of steel surface defects. The proposed model is evaluated on a typical steel surface defect dataset. Our model achieves 0.805 mAP, 0.144 higher than baseline models, and our model shows high efficiency in inference.

The welding current and the voltage between the upper and lower electrodes were obtained using the Rogowski coil and a line voltage sensor. And then the variations of the dynamic resistance curve and the effects of the welding current and welding time on the dynamic resistance signals were investigated. The principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to eliminate the redundant information in the dynamic resistance curve and characterize the shape information of the entire dynamic resistance. A linear regression model quantifying the relationship between the nugget diameter and the principal components was established. The results of the analysis of variance indicated that the performance of this regression equation was very good. Some statistical characteristics of the dynamic resistance signal were also extracted to investigate the relationship between the nugget diameter and dynamic resistance. The results indicated that the regression model established based on the PCA technique was much more robust than the model developed on the basis of the features manually extracted from the dynamic resistance signal. The neural network model was also used to predict the nugget diameter of the welding joints utilizing the extracted features. The performances of the three established prediction models were compared and their behavioral discrepancies were also investigated. The PCA technique not only can minimize the prior assumptions about the certain shape of the dynamic resistance curve and remove the subjective factors caused by the manual extraction method, but it also can assess and monitor the welding quality with a good level of reliability.},

  abstract     = {In the aerospace industry, the Automated Fiber Placement process is an established method for producing composite parts. Nowadays the required visual inspection, subsequent to this process, typically takes up to 50% of the total manufacturing time and the inspection quality strongly depends on the inspector. A Deep Learning based classification of manufacturing defects is a possibility to improve the process efficiency and accuracy. However, these techniques require several hundreds or thousands of training data samples. Acquiring this huge amount of data is difficult and time consuming in a real world manufacturing process. Thus, an approach for augmenting a smaller number of defect images for the training of a neural network classifier is presented. Five traditional methods and eight deep learning approaches are theoretically assessed according to the literature. The selected conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network and Geometrical Transformation techniques are investigated in detail, with regard to the diversity and realism of the synthetic images. Between 22 and 166 laser line scan sensor images per defect class from six common fiber placement inspection cases are utilised for tests. The GAN-Train GAN-Test method was applied for the validation. The studies demonstrated that a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network combined with a previous Geometrical Transformation is well suited to generate a large realistic data set from less than 50 actual input images. The presented network architecture and the associated training weights can serve as a basis for applying the demonstrated approach to other fibre layup inspection images.},

Although there have been many studies conducted on monitoring the health of cutting tools under a specific cutting condition, the monitoring of tool wear across multi-cutting conditions still remains a challenging proposition. In addressing this, this paper presents a framework for monitoring the health of the cutting tool, operating under multi-cutting conditions. A predictive model, using advanced machine learning methods with multi-feature multi-model ensemble and dynamic smoothing scheme, is developed. The applicability of the framework is that it takes into account machining parameters, including depth of cut, cutting speed and feed rate, as inputs into the model, thus generating the key features for the predictions. Real data from the machining experiments were collected, investigated and analysed, with prediction results showing high agreement with the experiments in terms of the trends of the predictions as well as the accuracy of the averaged root mean squared error values.},

  abstract     = {Non-metallic inclusions are unavoidably produced during steel casting resulting in lower mechanical strength and other detrimental effects. This study was aimed at developing a machine learning algorithm to classify castings of steel for tire reinforcement depending on the number and properties of inclusions, experimentally determined. 855 observations were available for training, validation and testing the algorithms, obtained from the quality control of the steel. 140 parameters are monitored during fabrication, which are the features of the analysis; the output is 1 or 0 depending on whether the casting is rejected or not. The following algorithms have been employed: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier (linear and RBF kernels), Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Networks. The reduced value of the rejection rate implies that classification must be carried out on an imbalanced dataset. Resampling methods and specific scores for imbalanced datasets (recall, precision and AUC rather than accuracy) were used. Random Forest was the most successful algorithm providing an AUC in the test set of 0.85. No significant improvements were detected after resampling. The optimized Random Forest allows the samples with a higher probability of being rejected to be selected, thus improving the effectiveness of the quality control. In addition, the optimized Random Forest has enabled to identify the most important features, which have been satisfactorily interpreted on a metallurgical basis.},

Research on the efficiency of S&amp;T resource allocation is helpful to judge the potential of Intelligent Manufacturing in a specific region. S&amp;T performance evaluation and resource allocation are critical administrative activities for a country or region. Due to resource scarcity, it is necessary to consider the constraint of limited total resources in the process of evaluation and allocation. Thus, the zero sum gains data envelopment analysis models and the associated uniform frontier (UF) method are more suitable for this issue. Comparing with the existing methods, we propose a new algorithm for solving the UF method in this article, which simplifies the procedure of calculation and extends from single to multiple resource allocation. In the empirical application, we evaluate the S&amp;T performances and allocate R&amp;D personnel and intramural expenditure among 31 administrative regions in China.

  abstract     = {Time series data is pervasive in many applications and the anomaly detection about it is important, which will provide the early warning of some unexpected patterns. In this paper, we propose a multiple similarity based anomalous subsequences detection method, which is unsupervised and domain knowledge free. Firstly, to improve the time efficiency, an anomaly candidates selection scheme is introduced based on the locality sensitive hashing (LSH), which considers a subsequence that does not collide with the others as a potential anomaly. However, if the raw time series is noisy and the anomaly is subtle, the performance of LSH will be degraded. In order to address this problem, we present a smoothing method to remove the noise and highlight the anomalous part in a time series, which can help to decrease the collision probability between an anomaly and the other subsequences. Secondly, we employ Pareto analysis to incorporate multiple similarity measures since there are different types of anomalies in real applications. It is unlikely that a single similarity measure can perform consistently well on different types of anomalies. Thirdly a new anomaly score scheme is provided to evaluate each anomaly candidate, which is based on the number of non-dominated vectors. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from diverse domains and compare our method with the state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that our method can reach higher accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In nowadays manufacturing, each technical assistance operation is digitally tracked. This results in a huge amount of textual data that can be exploited as a knowledge base to improve these operations. For instance, an ongoing problem can be addressed by retrieving potential solutions among the ones used to cope with similar problems during past operations. To be effective, most of the approaches for semantic textual similarity need to be supported by a structured semantic context (e.g. industry-specific ontology), resulting in high development and management costs. We overcome this limitation with a textual similarity approach featuring three functional modules. The data preparation module provides punctuation and stop-words removal, and word lemmatization. The pre-processed sentences undergo the sentence embedding module, based on Sentence-BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and aimed at transforming the sentences into fixed-length vectors. Their cosine similarity is processed by the scoring module to match the expected similarity between the two original sentences. Finally, this similarity measure is employed to retrieve the most suitable recorded solutions for the ongoing problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested (i) against a state-of-the-art competitor and two well-known textual similarity approaches, and (ii) with two case studies, i.e. private company technical assistance reports and a benchmark dataset for semantic textual similarity. With respect to the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach results in comparable retrieval performance and significantly lower management cost: 30-min questionnaires are sufficient to obtain the semantic context knowledge to be injected into our textual search engine.},

  abstract     = {Digitalization is an opportunity for manufacturing SMEs to transform, not only for the flexibility and agility, but also for improved responsiveness in meeting customer requirements. Quality, being an integral part of customer-orientation, needs to be at the forefront of transformation under digitalization. Also, the digitalization is the need of the hour for continuous improvement to avoid disparity between paper-based quality practices and the digitalized engineering value chain. In this research article, authors intend to address the digitalization priorities of quality practices for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in perspective of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. From the literature survey, authors observed that, there is extensive literature available regarding quality and its relevance for continuous improvement, while research insights regarding integration of quality practices in a digital environment are limited and even if considered, they have not been studied holistically. Authors have examined the available research to assimilate the effect of current market trends on quality practices. They have undertaken a survey of prevailing quality maturity in manufacturing SMEs. In current study, authors have understood the need of digitalization of quality processes and propose the priority digital approaches that can guide SMEs with a holistic view of transformation including quality. The key findings based on proposed approaches for adopting digital quality processes are: Firstly, to address the challenges of shorter time-to-market, increased complexity, flexibility and innovation, SMEs need to adopt digitalization across the PDCA quality cycle. Secondly, digitalization of quality practices needs to be considered holistically across value chain. Thirdly, five processes have been prioritized for digitalization based on their adoption maturity i.e. design for quality, compliance, incoming &amp; outgoing goods control, statistical process control and complaint management. Based on finding of this study authors recommend that manufacturing SMEs take cognizance of these findings and adopt digital quality to successfully thrive in the emerging global market.},

To ensure the reliability of the results, we carried out worst-case sensitivity analyses and found the most critical parameters.

A statistical analysis was conducted in the signal processing, by extracting the gap sensor signal associates from each tool condition, using the skewness and kurtosis features. Multi-class classification was conducted using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) feed forward neural network (FF-NN) model to classify and predict the tool condition based on the skewness and kurtosis data. The architectures of the MLP FF-NN models were varied to optimize the classification accuracy. This study found that the tool condition was correlated to the displacement of the drill machine spindle because the runout occurred when the sensor signal displayed fluctuation and irregularity trends. The peak intensity of the gap sensor signals increased with increasing wear severity of the twist drill. An ideal MLP FF-NN structure was achieved when the classification performance was optimized to be consistent with the learning curve.},

Accurate demand forecasting is an important information for many organizations. It provides information for each stage of inventory management. In this study, multiple linear regression analysis, multiple nonlinear regression analysis, artificial neural networks and support vector regression were applied in a production facility that produces spare parts of construction machinery. The aim of the study is to forecast the number of spare parts requested in the future period by the customer as close as possible. As the input variables in the developed models, the sales amounts of the past years belonging to the manifold product group, which is one of the important spare parts of the construction machinery, number of construction machines sold in the world, USD exchange rate and monthly impact rate are used as input variables. The inputs of the model are designed according to construction machinery sector. In the model, monthly impact rate enables us to create more robust model. In addition, the estimation results have high accuracy by systematic parameter design of artificial intelligence methods. The data of the 9 years (from 2010 to 2018) were used in the application. Demand forecasts were conducted for 2018 to compare actual values. In forecasts, artificial neural network and support vector regression produced better results than regression methods. In addition, it was found that support vector regression forecasting produced better results in comparison to artificial neural network. __________________________________________________________________________________________},

Due to the large size of combinations for product design and supplier choices; descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics are needed to design, control and then improve a supply chain network. Current study is the first instance in the supply network management field using linguistic summarization (LS), a descriptive analytics tool generating natural language-based summaries of raw data with the help of fuzzy sets. This study has developed a LS method for revealing information from a realistic complex network of a bike supply chain, and it produces network description phrases by using fuzzy set theory to model linguistic/textual terms. The truth degree of generated summaries is calculated by fuzzy cardinality-based methods instead of scalar cardinality-based methods to overcome inherent disadvantages. The results of the study are interpreted in two ways: word clouds are used for single objective cases, and list of sentences that exceed a threshold value are used for bi-objective cases. LS-based findings, explanations and strategic decisions are directed at decision support to increase supply network performance, efficiency and sustainability.},

Based on the sliding mode control and Lyapunov stability theory, four alternative sliding surfaces are constructed to stabilize the chaotic two-predator one-prey model to its zero equilibrium point. The focused control signals realize the control from only one state which provides simplicity in implementation.

  abstract     = {Today, the companies apply lean or customized production methods, which enable the production of different kinds of products in small quantities, to meet different customer demands. But, the increase in the product variety leads to an increase in the number of setups and thus production time. The companies aim to reduce the setup time by improving activities and by eliminating the problems causing extending setup time. Single minute exchange of die (SMED) method is the most common setup method that makes it possible to perform equipment setup operations in fewer than 10 min, i.e. several minutes expressed by a single digit. It is possible to further reduce setup times by integrating quality tools and methods into the SMED method. In this study, it is developed a novel SMED model that integrating the traditional SMED and fuzzy failure modes and effects analysis (fuzzy-FMEA) methods. Fuzzy FMEA method is used to prevent problems causing further extending setup time on setup activities. A new operation worksheet, “Setup Observation and Analysis Form” that leads the analyst in during the investigation of the machine and its set-up process, is also designed. The new approach is applied to set up a plastic injection mold for a pen manufacturing company. The setup time is reduced from 71.32 to 36.97 min, achieved a 48% improvement.},

The BAP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and the solution space exponentially grows as the problem size increases. Therefore, problem specific heuristic or meta-heuristic search algorithms are widely used to solve the BAP. In this study two population-based search algorithms; i.e. Combat Genetic Algorithm (CGA) and Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC) algorithm, are proposed in solving the BAP to maximize the throughput of the line under the total buffer size constraint for unreliable production lines. Performances of the proposed algorithms are tested on existing benchmark problems taken from the literature. The experimental results showed that the proposed BB–BC algorithm yielded better results than the proposed CGA as well as other algorithms reported in the literature.},

New studies focus on Multi-Criteria-Inventory Classification (MCIC) since such an extension of the criteria fits the realities of modern business decisions. The proposed approach in this study uses three-phased MCIC incorporating analytical hierarchy process (AHP), Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm, and a newly proposed Revised-Veto (Rveto) phase to meet the ABC classification principles and increase its applicability and flexibility. This new approach is called AHP–FCM–Rveto and proposed in this study for the first time.

Nowadays, companies are focused not only on cost-reduction and effectiveness or realized processes but also on reducing the negative impact on natural and social environment. Therefore, the maintenance is also transforming its role in order to better support value creation, both contributing to the economic dimension as well as extending its care for the environmental and social aspects. The paper presents a new method to solve the problem of the initial maintenance indicator merge into a new synthetic index that allows measuring the level of maintenance sustainability. The proposed approach allows to look at the process of combining indicators from a different perspective (i.e. through interactions between criteria) to help decision-makers in improving economic, social and environmental results of maintenance system. To justify effectiveness of proposed approach, it was applied to Composite Maintenance Sustainability Indicator, which was therefore generalized and expanded, so that it could be used in decision support system. The included case study shows the real benefit of using the proposed approach to analyse the actual results of maintenance system from sustainability point of view and forecasting future actions.},

Ignoring these deviations can potentially reduce product quality and increase manufacturing costs. To consider the influence of the material batch in process optimization models, the batch needs to be efficiently identified. Thus, a smart service is proposed for in-situ material batch identification. This service is driven by a supervised machine learning model, which analyzes the signals of the machine’s control, especially torque data, for batch classification. The proposed approach is validated by cutting experiments with five different batches of the same specified material at various cutting conditions. Using this data, multiple classification models are trained and optimized. It is shown that the investigated batches can be correctly identified with close to 90% prediction accuracy using machine learning. Out of all the investigated algorithms, the best results are achieved using a Support Vector Machine with 89.0% prediction accuracy for individual batches and 98.9% while combining batches of similar machinability.},

Due to this complexity, simulation approaches based on calculation of the underlying physical principles can often only provide a qualitative understanding of the inter-relationships between these parameters. An alternative approach such as parameter optimisation, often requires a systematic and hence time-consuming experimental exploration over the available parameter space. Here, we apply neural networks for parameter optimisation and for predictive visualisation of expected outcomes in laser surface texturing with blind vias for tribology control applications. Critically, this method greatly reduces the amount of experimental laser machining data that is needed and associated development time, without negatively impacting accuracy or performance. The techniques presented here could be applied in a wide range of fields and have the potential to significantly reduce the time, and the costs associated with laser process optimisation.},

Starting from the development of a prototype multi-robot multi-operator collaborative workcell, a simulation environment was developed to evaluate the makespan and the degree of collaboration in multi-robot multi-operator CAS. From the simulation environment, a mathematical model was conceptualized. The presented model allows estimating, with a certain degree of accuracy, the performances of the system. The results have investigated how several process characteristics, i.e. the number and type of resources, the resources layout, the task allocation method, and the number of feeding devices, influence the degree of collaboration between the resources. Lastly, the authors propose a compact analytic formulation, based on an exponential function, and define the methods and the influence factors to determine its parameters.},

The new mechanism is able to fulfill a secondary task due to the introduction of redundancy. The proposed methodology sets as secondary task the minimization of the rotary motors torque, or the minimization of the norm of the positioning error. The control is based on the solution of a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints equations are the kinematic closure equations, and the objective function is the table motor torque or the positioning error of the tool tip. The implementation of this framework in the virtual machine model of the mechanism shows an improvement of the performances: actually, the introduction of a redundant axis allows the minimization of the torques and position errors.},

Taking into account the computing capabilities and connectivity of the hardware available for smart manufacturing, we propose a particular solution that allows meeting one of the essential requirements of intelligent production processes, i.e., autonomous health management. Indeed, efficient and fast algorithms, that does not require a high computational cost and can be appropriately performed on machine controllers, i.e., on edge, are combined with others, which can handle large amounts of data and calculations, executed on remote powerful supervisory platforms, i.e., on the cloud. In detail, new condition monitoring algorithms based on Model-of-Signals techniques are developed and implemented on local controllers to process the raw sensor readings and extract meaningful and compact features, according to System Identification rules and guidelines. These results are then transmitted to remote supervisors, where Particle Filters are exploited to model components degradation and predict their Remaining Useful Life. Practitioners can use this information to optimise production planning and maintenance policies. The proposed architecture allows keeping the communication traffic between edge and cloud in the nowadays affordable “Big data” range, preventing the unmanageable “Huge data” scenario that would follow from the transmission of raw sensor data. Furthermore, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method are tested considering a meaningful benchmark, the PRONOSTIA dataset, allowing reproducibility and comparison with other approaches.},

  abstract     = {3D printing offers great potential for developing complex flexure mechanisms. Recently, thickness-correction factors (TCFs) were introduced to correct the thickness and stiffness deviations of powder-based metal 3D printed flexure hinges during design and analysis. However, the reasons for the different TCFs obtained in each study are not clear, resulting in a limited value of these TCFs for future design and fabrication. Herein, the influence of the porous layer of 3D printed flexure hinges on the hinge thickness is investigated. Samples of parallelogram flexure mechanisms (PFMs) were 3D printed using selective laser melting (SLM) and 316L stainless steel powder. A 3D manufacturing error analysis was completed for each PFM sample via 3D scanning, surface roughness measurement and morphological observation. The thickness of the porous layer of the flexure hinge was independent of the designed hinge thickness and remained close to the average powder particle diameter. The effective hinge thickness could be estimated by subtracting twice the value of the porous layer thickness from the designed value. Guidelines based on finite element analysis and stiffness experiments are proposed. The limitations of the presented method for evaluating the effective hinge thickness of flexure hinges 3D printed via SLM are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {A macroscopic model evaluating shear behavior is necessary to simulate the failure process of shear walls under different axial compression ratios and different out-of-plane bending moments. Accordingly, based on the results of experiments and numerical simulations, a three-segment skeleton curve model was established to reflect the relationship between shear force and deformation when a reinforced concrete shear wall is subjected to axial and horizontal force. Corresponding hysteresis rules were proposed to obtain a macroscopic hysteresis model of the shear wall. Comparison between numerical and experimental results showed that the peak displacement, ductility, and hysteresis characteristics determined using the macroscopic model matched the experimental results well. The numerical results of the macroscopic shear model showed that the in-plane shear performance of a shear wall is almost unchanged when the out-of-plane displacement is very small, but if the displacement along the thickness direction increases, the in-plane shear bearing capacity and the deformation ability of a shear wall will notably decrease. The results can be used for structural design or collapse simulation.},

  abstract     = {Remanufacturing plays a vital role in promoting the development of circular economy for its great advantages in energy saving, material saving and emission reduction. Remanufacturing process planning (RPP), which affects the performance of remanufacturing greatly, becomes increasingly important to the remanufacturing enterprises. In general, RPP is knowledge dependent. Some remanufacturing enterprises, especially small and middle-sized remanufacturing enterprises (SMREs) may have inadequate remanufacturing knowledge, which makes it difficult to implement a proper RPP. Therefore, how to share and make full use of the knowledge in different remanufacturing enterprises for RPP has become a bottleneck. To this end, a hybrid method integrating blockchain (BC) and case-based reasoning (CBR) for RPP, which can take full advantage of the remanufacturing knowledge by cross enterprises knowledge sharing, is presented in this paper. In this proposed method, a BC network was utilized to record the remanufacturing knowledge and its associated transactions to guarantee the security and reliability of knowledge sharing, and CBR was employed to retrieve and reuse the most suitable solution by analyzing the similarity between previous remanufacturing cases and new case with the nearest neighbor algorithm. Finally, a used lathe guideway was set as a case study to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach. The hybrid method has been applied in a prototype system written in HTML and JavaScript. The results indicated that the proposed approach can effectively help SMREs to obtain optimum solutions for RPP with comprehensive economic, environmental and social benefits.},

The predicting model includes four input variables: gas pressure, sheet thickness, laser power, and cutting speed, and five kerf quality indices: rough zone ratio, widths of up and down heat affected zones, maximum surface roughness, and kerf taper angle. The experiments were designed using Taguchi L18 orthogonal array. The kerf surface contains three main zones: rough, transient, and smooth zones. The results of conventional RVFL as well as modified RVFL-EO algorithms were compared with experimental ones. Seven statistical criteria were used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms.

  abstract     = {In the present day markets, it is essential for organizations that manage their supply chain efficiency to sustain their market share and improve profitability. Optimized inventory control is an integral part of supply chain management. In inventory control problems, determining the ordering times and the order quantities of products are the two strategic decisions either to minimize total costs or to maximize total profits. This paper presents three models of inventory control problems. These three models are deterministic single-product, deterministic multi-product, and stochastic single-product. Due to the high computational complexity, the presented models are solved using the Emperor Penguins Colony (EPC) algorithm as a metaheuristic algorithm and a soft computing method. EPC is a newly published metaheuristic algorithm, which has not yet been employed to solve the inventory control problem. The results of applying the proposed algorithm on the models are compared with the results obtained by nine state-of-the-art and popular metaheuristic algorithms. To justify the proposed EPC, both cost and runtime criteria are considered. To find significant differences between the results obtained by algorithms, statistical analysis is used. The results show that the proposed algorithm for the presented models of inventory control has better solutions, lower cost, and less CPU consumption than other algorithms.},

Based on this fact, an error analysis method and an error compensation strategy are proposed in this paper. The first step was to measure the relevant error sources that may affect the localization system. Then error model of localization system was established, and the validity of this error model was verified by comparing simulated and actual positioning results. In addition, the impact factors of each error source on localization system accuracy were obtained using the error transfer theory. According to the error analysis results, an efficient error compensation strategy was proposed, which could compensate the errors in order of impact factors, and judge whether the error compensation method is optimal. Finally, the experimental results proved that the proposed error analysis method was valid and the error compensation strategy could efficiently enhance the positioning accuracy to meet the industrial application requirements.},

An early prediction of those alarms can bring several benefits to manufacturing companies such as predictive maintenance of the equipment, or production optimization. This paper introduces a new system that allows to anticipate the activation of several alarms and thus, warns the operators in the plants about situations that could hamper the machines operation or stop the production process. The system follows a two-stage forecaster–analyzer approach on which first, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network based forecaster predicts the future sensor’s measurements and then, distinct analyzers based on residual neural networks determine whether the predicted measurements will trigger an alarm or not. The system supports some features that make it particularly suitable for smart manufacturing scenarios: on the one hand, the forecaster is able to predict the future measurements of different types of time-series data captured by various sensors in non-stationary environments with dynamically changing processes. On the other hand, the analyzers are able to detect alarms that can be modeled with simple rules based on the activation condition, and also more complex alarms on which it is unknown when the activation condition will be fulfilled. Moreover, the followed approach for building the system makes it flexible and extensible for other predictive analysis tasks. The system has shown a great performance to predict three different types of alarms.},

However, if the population size is expanded and the number of evolutionary iterations is too high, frequent interactions are likely to cause customer fatigue. This paper proposes an adaptive interactive artificial immune algorithm based on improved hierarchical clustering. This algorithm uses the improved hierarchical clustering algorithm to optimize generation of the initial antibodies and applies the affinity calculation method based on customer intention, adaptive crossover and mutation operators, and a multisolution reservation method based on hybrid selection strategy to the artificial immune algorithm. Via empirical research on the customized operational data of wheel hubs, the proposed method effectively solves the problem of customer fatigue, significantly improves the convergence speed of the algorithm and reduces the time cost.},

  abstract     = {Recent technological advancements in computing, sensing and communication have led to the development of cyber-physical manufacturing processes, where a computing subsystem monitors the manufacturing process performance in real-time by analyzing sensor data and implements the necessary control to improve the product quality. This paper develops a predictive control framework where control actions are implemented after predicting the state of the manufacturing process or product quality at a future time using process models. In a cyber-physical manufacturing process, the product quality predictions may be affected by uncertainty sources from the computing subsystem (resource and communication uncertainty), manufacturing process (input uncertainty, process variability and modeling errors), and sensors (measurement uncertainty). In addition, due to the continuous interactions between the computing subsystem and the manufacturing process, these uncertainty sources may aggregate and compound over time. In some cases, some process parameters needed for model predictions may not be precisely known and may need to be derived from real time sensor data. This paper develops a dynamic Bayesian network approach, which enables the aggregation of multiple uncertainty sources, parameter estimation and robust prediction for online control. As the number of process parameters increase, their estimation using sensor data in real-time can be computationally expensive. To facilitate real-time analysis, variance-based global sensitivity analysis is used for dimension reduction. The proposed methodology of online monitoring and control under uncertainty, and dimension reduction, are illustrated for a cyber-physical turning process.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, recommender systems have become necessary in overcoming the challenges related to the incredible growth of information. They are used in a wide range of contexts and applications, mainly as prediction tools for customer interest, designed to help customers decide, compare, discover and explore products (Meyer in Recommender systems in industrial contexts, Sciences et Technologies de l’Information, Grenoble, 2012). Therefore, research in the field has focused on improving the efficiency of data processing for instant and accurate recommendations. Recommendation of products, accordingly, does not take into consideration supply chain constraints for deliveries. This can lead to recommendations for products that can be costly or too long to ship to the customer, resulting in an avoidable increase in the stress on the supply chain. This paper addresses the problem of considering delivery constraints in product recommendations. The objective is to shift demand toward products that can be delivered using the current network state without additional resources in a given time window, perimeter and with a minimum acceptable profit, in the context of e-commerce. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to adjust product recommendations in order to shift customers’ interests towards particular products with consideration for remaining unit loads of scheduled deliveries. For this, quasireal-time information about the supply chain is taken into consideration to improve the number of shippable products in the recommendation list, resulting in a possible improvement in truck-load utilization, lower operation costs and reduced lead-times for delivery. This method works in two stages: the first stage is the computation of the recommendation with traditional recommendation systems, and the second stage is recommendation adjustments in four phases that consider the evaluation of active trucks, evaluation of physical constraints for transportation, evaluation of the profits associated with adding a pickup/delivery to a scheduled tour for each recommended item and adjustment of recommendation scores. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of the recommendation adjustment on the recommendation list has been conducted for each of the parameters considered in the proposed method: time window, perimeter radius and minimum acceptable profit. Various experimental results prove that the method permits increasing the number of recommended products that can be shipped using the available resources within a given perimeter radius, time window and minimum profit.},

To this end, the article proposes a proof-of-concept of a simheuristics framework for robust scheduling applied to a Flow Shop Scheduling Problem. The framework is composed of genetic algorithms for schedule optimization and discrete event simulation and is synchronized with the field through a Digital Twin (DT) that employs an Equipment Prognostics and Health Management (EPHM) module. The contribution of the EPHM module inside the DT-based framework is the real time computation of the failure probability of the equipment, with data-driven statistical models that take sensor data from the field as input. The viability of the framework is demonstrated in a flow shop application in a laboratory environment.},

Comparison was made between the theoretically well-grounded response surface designs method with a few approaches to the model construction based on intuitively understood heuristic bases justified by their successful practical applications. In order to determine a set of Pareto-optimal solutions for a discrete decision space, the durations of process execution were generated through a virtual simulation. In order to outline and justify the adopted solutions a comprehensive example of the practical construction of the machine spinning process model was presented, including its various versions. The results obtained were validated and evaluated. The main utilitarian conclusion is the indication whereby basing on a partial experiment plan it is possible, thanks to simple heuristic methods, to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions which are close to those obtained when the full experiment plan is carried out.},

  abstract     = {Variation propagation modelling in multistage machining processes through use of analytical approaches has been widely investigated for the purposes of dimension prediction and variation source identification. Yet the variation prediction of complex features is non-trivial task to model mathematically. Moreover, the application of the variation propagation approaches and associated variation source identification techniques using Skin Model Shapes is unclear. This paper proposes a multilayer shallow neural network regression approach to predict geometrical deviations of parts given manufacturing errors. The neural network is trained on a simulated data, generated from machining simulation of a point cloud of a part. Further, given a point cloud data of a machined feature, the source of variation can be identified by optimally matching the deviation patterns of the actual surface with that of shallow neural network generated surface. To demonstrate the method, a two-stage machining process and a virtual part that has planar, cylindrical and torus features was considered. The geometric characteristics of machined features and the sources variation could be predicted at an error of 1% and 4.25%, respectively. This work extends the application of Skin Model Shapes in variation propagation analysis in multistage manufacturing.},

Solar cell manufacturing is a delicate process that often introduces defects that reduce cell efficiency or compromise durability. Current inspection systems detect and discard faulty cells, wasting a significant percentage of resources. We introduce Cell Doctor, a new inspection system that uses state of the art techniques to locate and classify defects in solar cells and performs a diagnostic and treatment process to isolate or eliminate the defects. Cell Doctor uses a fully automatic process that can be included in a manufacturing line. Incoming solar cells are first moved with a robotic arm to an Electroluminescence diagnostic station, where they are imaged and analysed with a set of Gabor filters, a Principal Component Analysis technique, a Random Forest classifier and different image processing techniques to detect possible defects in the surface of the cell. After the diagnosis, a laser station performs an isolation or cutting process depending on the detected defects. In a final stage, the solar cells are characterised in terms of their I–V Curve and I–V Parameters, in a Solar Simulator station. We validated and tested Cell Doctor with a labelled dataset of images of monocrystalline silicon cells, obtaining an accuracy and recall above 90% for Cracks, Area Defects and Finger interruptions; and precision values of 77% for Finger Interruptions and above 90% for Cracks and Area Defects. Which allows Cell Doctor to diagnose and repair solar cells in an industrial environment in a fully automatic way.},

The dataset contains wide kinds of fabrics and detailed fabric structure parameters. Then, a novel multi-task and multi-scale convolutional neural network (MTMSnet) is proposed to predict the location maps of yarns and floats. By adopting the multi-task structure, the MTMSnet can better learn the related features between yarns and floats. Finally, the weave pattern and basic weave repeat are recognized by combining the yarn and float location maps.

Based on the data captured by various IoT sensors, we demonstrate the facts to shift the HM&amp;D technology from costly sensor to economic microphone based mechanism. The adopted strategy is capable to reduce the bulky data transmission on the internet, and to increase the up-time of AgVs. We experimented on the essential red hot chili peppers system of the AgV’s backbone hydraulic system—the hydraulic filter and pump. The measurement system analysis is adopted to determine the preciseness of data captured near the considered components. The envision of the correlation between the collected data extracts significant information to draw the facts to embrace the future HM&amp;D technology shift.

  abstract     = {Most scheduling problems are required to follow rigid metrics, such as the maximum completion time, earliest deadline first, etc., ignoring the flexibility of manufacturing services (MSs) and the effects of their historical data hidden in millions of manufacturing activities. The historical data serves as a powerful basis for describing the comprehensiveness or credibility of the MS itself with the help of Industrial IoT enabling all equipment to communicate and take preventive actions. Similar to the bank credit for individuals, MSs should also have their own referential credit values when choosing the most suitable service for a specific manufacturing task. This paper summarizes the MS attributes from six aspects with sufficient sub-attributes. The fuzzy Analytic Network Process combined with the Cross-Entropy method is employed to evaluate the credit of MSs in the complex manufacturing network system. Such service scoring mechanism (SSM) can personify a comprehensive credit evaluation of services, where, a smart service configuration mode based on credit is proposed for carrying out the supply–demand matching with the help of the data-security technology. Subsequently, a credit-based manufacturing mode is derived under SSM. Numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate the validity of the matching mode. The result may assist manufacturers to allocate their manufacturing tasks in real time in a “credit” way and make quicker decisions in exceptional circumstances, while making the chosen service truly competent enough to finish the work, so as to further improve the customer satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Facility layout aims to arrange a set of facilities in a site. The main objective function is to minimize the total material handling cost under production-derived constraints. This problem has received much attention during the past decades. However, these works have mainly focused on solving a 2D layout problem, dealing with the footprints of pieces of equipment. The obtained results have been then adapted to the real spatial constraints of a workshop. This research work looks to take account of spatial constraints within a 3D space from the very first steps of problem solving. The authors use a approach by combining a genetic algorithm with A*, 〈GA,A*〉 research. The genetic algorithm generates possible arrangements and A* finds the shortest paths that products must travel in a restricted 3D space. The application allows to converge to a layout minimizing the total material handling cost. This approach is illustrated by its application on an example inspired by a valve assembly workshop in Tunisia and the results are discussed from two points of view. The first one consists in comparing the effect of the choice of the distance measurement technique on the handling cost. For this purpose, the results of the application of 〈GA,A*〉 are compared with those obtained by combining the genetic algorithm and two of the most commonly used distance measurements in the literature of the discipline, namely the Euclidean distance, 〈GA,Euclidean〉, and the rectilinear distance, 〈GA,rectilinear〉. Our results show that the proposed approach offers better results than those of 〈GA,rectilinear〉 whereas they are not as good as those obtained by the 〈GA,Euclidean〉 approach. The effectiveness of the 〈GA,A*〉 approach is then studied from the perspective of the effect of the algorithm used for the generation of candidate arrangements. The final results obtained from the application of 〈GA,A*〉 are then compared with those of the approach combining particle swarm optimization and A*, 〈PSO,A*〉. This comparison shows that the 〈GA,A*〉 approach obtains better results. Nevertheless, its convergence speed is lower than that of 〈PSO,A*〉. The paper ends with some conclusions and perspectives.},

It has established to be the most reliable and promising solution for the development of an automatic defect detection. Since the surface of the silicon steel strip has a cluttered background and defects with small sizes, flaws detection becomes a complex task. In this paper a novel rapid algorithm based on anisotropic diffusion and saliency map is proposed for detection of defects in images of hot rolled silicon steel. The algorithm first adopted a saliency map to enhance defects. Then the computed saliency map was employed in the anisotropic diffusion coefficient function as an orientation guide of the diffusion flow. The aim behind using salient feature is that a small defect can frequently attract attention of human eyes which permits to identify defects in high textured image. Finally, the defects were extracted using a local threshold operator. To verify the validity of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments were realized on an image database of silicon steel strip then a comparison with traditional diffusion algorithms was given. Experimental results show that this method achieves accuracy and outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

The idea of the DCNNAO is to extract the value of the objective function from the MD simulation snapshots directly by DCNN aided image process technique. Considering the huge memory requirement for MD result files, the main superiority of DCNNAO is to reduce the memory requirement and improve the efficiency of the optimization process by using a contour image (several hundred kilobytes) as the input instead of an MD result file (several hundred gigabytes). To complete this strategy, a Python script is written to generate required snapshots from result files automatically. Moreover, three boosted decision trees based optimization methods including surrogate optimization and heuristic algorithms are also implemented for comparison study. A detailed optimization result demonstrates that all the above methods can obtain an acceptable solution. The comparison is also given for an informed selection of them based on the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.},

While designing a robotic assembly line, production managers are concerned about the cost involved in such a system development. Most of the research reported till date did not consider purchasing cost while optimizing the design of a robotic assembly line. This study presents the first attempt to study the cost-oriented robotic assembly line balancing problem with setup times to minimize the cycle time and total purchasing cost simultaneously. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to formulate this problem. The elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and improved multi-objective artificial bee colony (IMABC) algorithm are developed to achieve a set of Pareto solutions for the production managers to utilize for selecting the better design solution. The proposed IMABC develops new employed bee phase and scout phase, which selects one solution in the permanent Pareto archive to replace the abandoned solution, to enhance exploration and exploitation. The comparative study on a set of generated instances demonstrates that the proposed model is capable of achieving the proper tradeoff between line efficiency and purchasing cost, and the proposed NSGA-II and IMABC achieve competing performance in comparison with several other multi-objective algorithms.},

However, extracting signal characteristic is fairly time consuming and depends on specialized signal processing knowledge. Although some studies have developed highly accurate algorithms, the diagnostic results rely heavily on large data sets and unreliable human analysis. This study proposes an automatic feature learning neural network that utilizes raw vibration signals as inputs, and uses two convolutional neural networks with different kernel sizes to automatically extract different frequency signal characteristics from raw data. Then long short-term memory was used to identify the fault type according to learned features. The data is down-sampled before inputting into the network, greatly reducing the number of parameters. The experiment shows that the proposed method can not only achieve 98.46% average accuracy, exceeding some state-of-the-art intelligent algorithms based on prior knowledge and having better performance in noisy environments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we focus on an unrelated parallel workgroup scheduling problem where each workgroup is composed of a number of personnel with similar work skills which has eligibility and human resource constraints. The most difference from the general unrelated parallel machine scheduling with resource constraints is that one workgroup can process multiple jobs at a time as long as the resources are available, which means that a feasible scheduling scheme is impossible to get if we consider the processing sequence of jobs only in time dimension. We construct this problem as an integer programming model with the objective of minimizing makespan. As it is incapable to get the optimal solution in the acceptable time for the presented model by exact algorithm, meta-heuristic is considered to design. A pure genetic algorithm based on special coding design is proposed firstly. Then a hybrid genetic algorithm based on bin packing strategy is further developed by the consideration of transforming the single workgroup scheduling to a strip-packing problem. Finally, the proposed algorithms, together with exact approach, are tested at different size of instances. Results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm shows the effective performance.},

The acquisition of cutting data often means higher cost and time, limiting the application of neural network in the machining sector, to a certain extent. In this paper, for the task of cutting force prediction, a “transfer network” was established, based on data obtained by simulation, combined with the theory and method in the field of transfer learning. Compared to “ordinary network”, that is, traditional back-propagation neural network based on experimental samples alone, transfer network exhibits obvious performance advantages. On one hand, this means that, using the same experimental samples, the prediction error of transfer network will be controlled; while on the other hand, when the same prediction error is achieved, the number of experimental samples required by the transfer network will be less.},

Minimal spanning tree is adopted to connect multi-terminal points in a graph and Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest route among the candidate paths; the design domain is divided into several sub-domains to simplify the graph and the proposed algorithm solves the routing problems in a sequential manner to deal intermediate points. Then, the proposed method was applied to the design of the routes for four different routing components of a commercial truck.

Hence, before reaching the threshold of flatness deviation caused by the wear of the face mill, the tool inserts need to be changed to avoid the expected product rejection. As current CNC machines have the facility to track, in real-time, the main drive power, the present study utilizes this facility to predict the flatness deviation—with proper consideration to the amount of wear of cutting tool insert’s edge. The prediction of deviation from flatness is evaluated as a regression and a classification problem, while different machine-learning techniques like Multilayer Perceptrons, Radial Basis Functions Networks, Decision Trees and Random Forest ensembles have been examined. Finally, Random Forest ensembles combined with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) balancing technique showed the highest performance when the flatness levels are discretized taking into account industrial requirements. The SMOTE balancing technique resulted in a very useful strategy to avoid the strong limitations that small experiment datasets produce in the accuracy of machine-learning models.},

This leads to a higher microhardness and thus improved fatigue and wear resistance. A parametric and a non-parametric model were developed in order to investigate the correlation between the thermomechanical load in the workpiece subsurface and the resulting α′-martensite content. It was demonstrated that increasing passive forces and cutting forces promoted the deformation-induced phase transformation, while increasing temperatures had an inhibiting effect. The feed force had no significant influence on the α′-martensite content. With the proposed models it is now possible to estimate the α′-martensite content during cryogenic turning by means of in-situ measurement of process forces and temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Modern production systems face enormous challenges due to rising customer requirements resulting in complex production systems. The operational efficiency in the competitive industry is ensured by an adequate production control system that manages all operations in order to optimize key performance indicators. Currently, control systems are mostly based on static and model-based heuristics, requiring significant human domain knowledge and, hence, do not match the dynamic environment of manufacturing companies. Data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) showed compelling results in applications such as board and computer games as well as first production applications. This paper addresses the design of RL to create an adaptive production control system by the real-world example of order dispatching in a complex job shop. As RL algorithms are “black box” approaches, they inherently prohibit a comprehensive understanding. Furthermore, the experience with advanced RL algorithms is still limited to single successful applications, which limits the transferability of results. In this paper, we examine the performance of the state, action, and reward function RL design. When analyzing the results, we identify robust RL designs. This makes RL an advantageous control system for highly dynamic and complex production systems, mainly when domain knowledge is limited.},

  abstract     = {The amount of electronic waste generated in the world is impressive. The USA alone yearly throw away 9.4 million tons of electronic devices: only 12.5% is recycled. One way to reduce this massive impact on the environment is to disassemble these devices with the aim of reusing and recycling as many parts as possible. Disassembling end-of-life products is a complex industrial process that may pose workers at risk because some parts of the product may contain dangerous materials. It is thus crucial to design efficient, sustainable and secure disassembly lines. This paper presents a multi-objective formulation of the Disassembly Line Balancing Problem (DLBP) which promotes efficiency and includes a new objective that increases the level of safety. The efficiency is guaranteed by balancing the idle times of the workstations, and by maximizing the profit and the level of feasibility of a disassembly sequence, which means disassembling the product as much as possible. Safety is maximized by extracting each dangerous part with a priority that is higher the more dangerous the part is. The most dangerous parts can thus be quickly removed from the product, thereby eliminating the exposure to the greatest risks. The disassembly continues with the execution of the tasks that remove the parts that are gradually less dangerous. Along with the DLBP formulation, this paper presents a genetic algorithm purposely designed to solve the problem. Two real-world case studies are discussed which entail the disassembly of a TV monitor and an air conditioner.},

This study incorporates data augmentation with sliding window to generate amounts of subsequences and thus to enhance the diversity and avoid over-fitting. The key features of equipment sensor can be learned automatically through stacked convolution-pooling layers. The importance of each sensor is also identified through the diagnostic layer in the proposed MTS-CNN. An empirical study from a wafer fabrication was conducted to validate the proposed MTS-CNN and compare the performance among the other multivariate time series classification methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the MTS-CNN can accurately detect the fault wafers with high accuracy, recall and precision, and outperforms than other existing multivariate time series classification methods. Through the output value of the diagnostic layer in MTS-CNN, we can identify the relationship between each fault and different sensors and provider valuable information to associate the excursion for fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {In most cases, designers must manually specify geometric tolerance types and values when designing mechanical products. For the same nominal geometry, different designers may specify different types and values of geometric tolerances. To reduce the uncertainty and realize the tolerance specification automatically, a tolerance specification method based on machine learning is proposed. The innovation of this paper is to find out the information that affects geometric tolerances selection and use machine learning methods to generate tolerance specifications. The realization of tolerance specifications is changed from rule-driven to data-driven. In this paper, feature engineering is performed on the data for the application scenarios of tolerance specifications, which improves the performance of the machine learning model. This approach firstly considers the past tolerance specification schemes as cases and sets up the cases to the tolerance specification database which contains information such as datum reference frame, positional relationship, spatial relationship, and product cost. Then perform feature engineering on the data and established machine learning algorithm to convert the tolerance specification problem into an optimization problem. Finally, a gear reducer as a case study is given to verify the method. The results are evaluated with three different machine learning evaluation indicators and made a comparison with the tolerance specification method in the industry. The final results show that the machine learning algorithm can automatically generate tolerance specifications, and after feature engineering, the accuracy of the tolerance specification results is improved.},

However, the reported process planning models are too simple to describe all characteristics because of the complexity of process planning. Therefore, a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) mathematical model is established based on OR-node of the network graph. In the model, the linear expression of the OR-node controlling function as well as three types of changing costs are first established. Beside, considering the OR-node selection state in the encoding and decoding method, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) is designed to combine a genetic algorithm with a simulated annealing algorithm. The tournament selection method is adopted in the proposed HEA, and the discussion on the tournament size is conducted on the open problems to make the algorithm designing more reasonable and scientific. The HEA and the new MILP model are both tested on series of numerical experiments which are carried on the existing benchmarks as well as some randomly generated cases. The behavior of both two methods can verify their effectiveness and superiority successfully.},

  abstract     = {Identifying the optimal sequence of joining is an exhaustive combinatorial optimization problem. On each assembly, there is a specific number of weld points that determine the geometrical deviation of the assembly after joining. The number and sequence of such weld points play a crucial role both for sequencing and assembly planning. While there are studies on identifying the complete sequence of welding, identifying such joints are not addressed. In this paper, based on the principles of machine intelligence, black-box models of the assembly sequences are built using the support vector machines (SVM). To identify the number of the critical weld points, principle component analysis is performed on a proposed data set, evaluated using the SVM models. The approach has been applied to three assemblies of different sizes, and has successfully identified the corresponding critical weld points. It has been shown that a small fraction of the weld points of the assembly can reduce more than 60% of the variability in the assembly deviation after joining.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a communication paradigm that connects the vehicles to the Internet for transferring information between the networks. One of the key challenges in IoV is the management of a massive amount of traffic generated from a large number of connected IoT-based vehicles. Network clustering strategies have been proposed to solve the challenges of traffic management in IoV networks. Traditional optimization approaches have been proposed to manage the resources of the network efficiently. However, the nature of next-generation IoV environment is highly dynamic, and the existing optimization technique cannot precisely formulate the dynamic characteristic of IoV networks. Reinforcement learning is a model-free technique where an agent learns from its environment for learning the optimal policies. We propose an experience-driven approach based on an Actor-Critic based Deep Reinforcement learning framework (AC-DRL) for efficiently selecting the cluster head (CH) for managing the resources of the network considering the noisy nature of IoV environment. The agent in the proposed AC-DRL can efficiently approximate and learn the state-action value function of the actor and action function of the critic for selecting the CH considering the dynamic condition of the network.The experimental results show an improvement of 28% and 15% respectively, in terms of satisfying the SLA requirement and 35% and 14% improvement in throughput compared to the static and DQN approaches.},

It optimizes the design and manufacturing process of products and greatly reduces the consumption of resources and energy by virtue of the huge potential of computer modeling and simulation and information communication technology. Under the background of intelligent manufacturing, intelligent bearing is proposed on the basis of traditional bearing products. Intelligent bearing is one of the research and development directions of high-end bearings at home and abroad. Embedded test technology is one of the research fields of intelligent bearings at present. Firstly, based on the finite element model, the structural design problems related to the integration of rolling bearing and sensor are studied. According to the load distribution of bearing, the optimal slot position of bearing is determined. Considering the influence of reducing the bearing capacity, the influence of axial and radial slot ways of bearing outer ring on the maximum deformation and stress of bearing outer ring is studied, and the bearing outer ring is analyzed The relationship between the maximum deformation, maximum stress and the groove size of the outer ring of the bearing is determined to provide the basis for the selection and design of the sensor module. Secondly, according to the friction moment formula, the total heat of the bearing is calculated. Based on the workbench, the temperature field cloud distribution model of the rolling bearing is established to analyze the changes of the speed, the radial load and the temperature of the inner and outer ring of the bearing Finally, according to the slot position and slot size, select the appropriate sensor and rolling bearing integration to achieve the real-time monitoring of the operation state of the bearing.},

The model was developed based on an improved Ghost bottleneck module sequence to achieve an efficient model. Furthermore, the use of the convolutional block attention module adaptively refined the feature map to improve the generalization of the model. Feature pyramid network was used to fuse the shallow and deep features in the network to improve the extraction ability of various size features. Experiments were carried out on wheelset axle box concurrent fault datasets. Model size, diagnosis speed and accuracy were used as evaluation indexes to compare the efficiencies of existing fault diagnosis methods and our proposed model.

As a result, scheduling solutions may not put into practice. This paper therefore studies the dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem when loading and unloading time (DRFJSP-LU) of the fixtures is considered. It formulates a multi-objective mathematical model to jointly minimize the makespan and the total setup time. Considering the influence of resource requirement similarity among different operations, we propose a similarity-based scheduling algorithm for setup-time reduction (SSA4STR) and then an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to optimize the DRFJSP-LU. Experimental results show that the SSA4STR can effectively reduce the loading and unloading time of fixtures while ensuring a level of makespan. The experiments also verify that the scheduling solution with multiple resources has a greater guiding effect on production than the scheduling result with a single resource.},

To fill this gap, this study proposes a dynamic dispatching rule based on self-organization (DDRSO) to autogenerate optimal scheduling scheme through mechanisms of interaction, coordination and competition. Besides, an extended DDRSO is proposed to further consider hot lots and transient dynamic bottlenecks. Both DDRSO and E-DDRSO are designed from three aspects: role definition of self-organization units, negotiation mechanism among self-organization units, and decision methods. This research adopts a benchmark industrial manufacturing system to illustrate the availability of the proposed approach. Compared with heuristic dispatching strategies, DDRSO achieves improvement on MOV, TH and ODR by 4.9%, 9.06% and 20.23%, respectively. Meanwhile, E-DDRSO performs better than DDRSO under all workload levels. In addition, compared with a flexible dispatching method BPSO-SVM, E-DDRSO also obtain better performances, especially improvement on CT by 16.51%.},

Traditional network security architectures are based on RSA and elliptic curve cryptographic systems, which is claimed to be broken on quantum computers. We exploit the countermeasures of post-quantum algorithms to protect cloud manufacturing against quantum computer attacks. We propose a post-quantum secure scheme for cloud manufacturing. First, in order to retain confidentiality in cloud manufacturing, we propose a post-quantum asymmetric-key encryption scheme to encrypt the message with the generated session key. Second, in order to retain authentication security in cloud manufacturing, we propose a post-quantum public-key signature generation scheme. Third, based on the encryption scheme and signature generation scheme, we propose a post-quantum secure communication system for cloud manufacturing. We implement our design on cloud-based environment and the comparison with related designs show that our design is suitable for protecting communication in cloud manufacturing.

In this context the optimisation problem becomes a multi-variable problem in which the aim is to optimize by minimizing cost (or time) and improving technological performances (e.g. turning force). To enable such computation a methodology, named conditional design optimization (CoDeO) is proposed which allows the modelling and simultaneous optimization of process parameters and product design (geometric variables), using single or multi-criteria optimization strategies. After investigation of CoDeO’s requirements, evolutionary algorithms, in particular Genetic Algorithms, are identified as the most suitable for overall NNS manufacturing chain optimization The CoDeO methodology is tested using an industrial case study that details a process chain composed of casting and machining processes. For the specific case study presented the optimized process resulted in cost savings of 22% (corresponding to equivalent machining time savings) and a 10% component weight reduction.},

The high-quality image transmission in visual sensor networks (VSNs) consumes more space, energy, transmission delay which may experience the various security threats. Image compression is a key phase of visual sensing systems that needs to be effective. This motivates us to propose a fast and efficient intelligent image transmission module to achieve the energy-efficiency, minimum delay, and bandwidth utilization. Compressive sensing (CS) introduced to speedily compressed the image to reduces the consumption of energy, time minimization, and efficient bandwidth utilization. However, CS cannot achieve security against the different kinds of threats. Several methods introduced since the last decade to address the security challenges in the CS domain, but efficiency is a key requirement considering the intelligent manufacturing of VSNs. Furthermore, the random variables selected for the CS having the problem of recovering the image quality due to the accumulation of noise. Thus concerning the above challenges, this paper introduced a novel one-way image transmission module in multiple input multiple output that provides secure and energy-efficient with the CS model. The secured transmission in the CS domain proposed using the security matrix which is called a compressed secured matrix and perfect reconstruction with the random matrix measurement in the CS. Experimental results outwards that the intelligent module provides energy-efficient, secured transmission with low computational time as well as a reduced bit error rate.},

Specifically, we use the Path-based bottleneck (PBB), Constant work-in-process (CONWIP), and Capacity-slack CONWIP (CSC) as pull CPS deployment schemes, in which the CSC is a modified CONWIP strategy that integrates the order review function of the PBB. We summarize the characteristics of these pull control strategies and analyze important roles in guiding the CPS deployment. Then, we compare the performance of the three pull control strategies by simulation. Our findings show that it is feasible to get the balance between the size of CPS deployment and the system performance through a suitable pull control strategy to guide CPS deployment. Finally, we introduce a case of a strander manufacturer and use the case data to estimate the performance and implementation costs of the CPS deployment schemes which are guided by pull control strategies.},

  abstract     = {The template design problem (TDP) is a hard combinatorial problem with a high number of symmetries which makes solving it more complicated. A number of techniques have been proposed in the literature to optimise its resolution, ranging from complete methods to stochastic ones. However, although metaheuristics are considered efficient methods that can find enough-quality solutions at a reasonable computational cost, these techniques have not proven to be truly efficient enough to deal with this problem. This paper explores and analyses a wide range of metaheuristics to tackle the problem with the aim of assessing their suitability for finding template designs. We tackle the problem using a wide set of metaheuristics whose implementation is guided by a number of issues such as problem formulation, solution encoding, the symmetrical nature of the problem, and distinct forms of hybridisation. For the TDP, we also propose a slot-based alternative problem formulation (distinct to other slot-based proposals), which represents another option other than the classical variation-based formulation of the problem. An empirical analysis, assessing the performance of all the metaheuristics (i.e., basic, integrative and collaborative algorithms working on different search spaces and with/without symmetry breaking) shows that some of our proposals can be considered the state-of-the-art when they are applied to specific problem instances.},

A digital twin (DT) is an advanced virtual factory technology that has simulation as its core technical functionality, which it performs in the type and instance stages of the physical asset. For providing an efficient information object to the DT application, this paper proposes Virtual REpresentation for a DIgital twin application (VREDI): an asset description for the operation procedures of a work-center-level DT application. For the successful application of DT as a smart factory technology, VREDI is designed to meet four core technical requirements—DT definition, AAS property inheritance, improving the existing asset description, and supporting DT-based technical functionalities. Based on the analysis of the technical requirements, the elements of VREDI are derived and the reference relationships between them are designed. It is then possible to provide the required technical functionality using the VREDI header, and a detailed P4R structure and elements of the body are defined. VREDI is applied to the concept to support the main properties of the DT. It is designed to inherit the AAS properties for efficient information management and interoperability. The application of advanced concepts such as “type and instance” and supporting vertical integration and horizontal coordination overcomes the limitations of the existing asset descriptions. Additionally, VREDI designates elements for supporting six DT-based technical functionalities in the type and instance stages of the physical work center.},

Secondly, an improved clustering with elbow criterion and a resampling operation are applied simultaneously to generate representative subsets; and correspondingly, several back propagation neural network (BPNN) with the architecture optimized by genetic algorithm are trained by these subsets respectively to generate effective diverse learners; and then, a K-nearest neighbor based dynamic weight combination strategy which is sensitive to current testing sample is proposed to make full use of the learner’s positive effects and avoid its negative effects. Finally, the results of effective experiments prove that both the newly involved features and the improvements in the proposed ensemble are effective. In addition, comparison experiments confirm that the proposed enhanced ensemble of BPNNs outperforms significantly the prevailing approaches, including single, ensemble and hybrid models.

  abstract     = {Compared with obstacle avoidance in open environment, collision-free path planning for duct-enter task is often challenged by narrow and complex space inside ducts. For obstacle avoidance, redundant robot is usually applied for this task. The motion of redundant robot can be decoupled to end-effector motion and self-motion. Current methods for duct-enter task are not robust due to the difficulty to properly define the self-motion. This difficulty mainly comes from two aspects: the definition of distances from robot to obstacles and the fusion of multiple data. In this work, we adapt the ideas underlying the success of human to handling this kind tasks, variable optimization strategies and learning, for one robust path planner. Proposed planner applies reinforcement learning skills to learn proper self-motion and achieves robust planning. For achieving robust behavior, state-action planner is creatively designed with three especially designed strategies. Firstly, optimization function, the kernel part of self-motion, is considered as part of action. Instead of taking every joint motion, this strategy embeds reinforcement learning skills on self-motion, reducing the search domain to null space of redundant robot. Secondly, robot end orientation is taken into action. For duct-enter task, robot end link is the motion starter for exploring movement just like the snake head. The orientation of robot end link when passing through some position can be referred by following links. Hence the second strategy can accelerate exploring by reduce the null space to possible redundant robot manifold. Thirdly, path guide point is also added into action part. This strategy can divide one long distance task into several short distance tasks, reducing the task difficulty. After these creative designs, the planner has been trained with reinforcement learning skills. With the feedback of robot and environment state, proposed planner can choose proper optimization strategies, just like the human brain, for avoiding collision between robot body and target duct. Compared with two general methods, Virtual Axis method with orientation Guidance and Virtual Axis, experiment results show that the success rate is separately improved by 5.9% and 49.7%. And two different situation experiments are carried out on proposed planner. Proposed planner achieves 100% success rate in the situation with constant start point and achieves 98.7% success rate in the situation with random start point meaning that the proposed planner can handle the perturbation of start point and goal point. The experiments proves the robustness of proposed planner.},

However, there is still a large room for improving the classification performance over the generic DNN models. In this paper, a unified deep neural network with multi-level features is proposed for weld defect classification. Firstly, we define 11 weld defect features as inputs of our proposed classification model. Not limited to geometric and intensity features, 4 features based on the intensity contrast between weld defect and its background are proposed in this paper. Secondly, we construct a novel deep learning framework: a unified deep neural network, where multi-level features of each hidden layer are fused by the last hidden layer to predict the type of weld defect comprehensively. In addition, we investigate pre-training and fine-turning strategies to get better generalization performance with small dataset. Comparing with other classification methods like SVM and generic DNN model, our framework takes full advantage of multi-level features extracted from each hidden layer, an outstanding performance is shown where the classification accuracy is improved by 3.18% and 4.33% on the test dataset, to reach 91.36%.},

  abstract     = {A growing awareness is brought that the safety and security of industrial control systems cannot be dealt with in isolation, and the safety and security of industrial control protocols (ICPs) should be considered jointly. Fuzz testing (fuzzing) for the ICP is a common way to discover whether the ICP itself is designed and implemented with flaws and network security vulnerability. Traditional fuzzing methods promote the safety and security testing of ICPs, and many of them have practical applications. However, most traditional fuzzing methods rely heavily on the specification of ICPs, which makes the test process a costly, time-consuming, troublesome and boring task. And the task is hard to repeat if the specification does not exist. In this study, we propose a smart and automated protocol fuzzing methodology based on improved deep convolution generative adversarial network and give a series of performance metrics. An automated and intelligent fuzzing framework BLSTM-DCNNFuzz for application is designed. Several typical ICPs, including Modbus and EtherCAT, are applied to test the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework. Experiment results show that our methodology outperforms the existing ones like General Purpose Fuzzer and other deep learning based fuzzing methods in convenience, effectiveness, and efficiency.},

Deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), based on traditional generative adversarial networks (GAN), introduces convolutional neural network into the training for unsupervised learning to improve the effect of generative networks. Conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is a conditional model obtained through introducing conditional extension into GAN. C-DCGAN is a combination of DCGAN and CGAN.

Two datasets (Bearing dataset and Planetary gear box dataset) are carried out to validate. The simulation experiments showed that the improved performance is mainly due to the generated signals from C-DCGAN to balance the dataset.

This emerging trend, so called smart manufacturing, is a collection of various technologies that support decision-making in real-time in the presence of changing conditions in manufacturing activities; this may advance manufacturing competitiveness and sustainability. As a factory becomes highly automated, physical asset management comes to be a critical part of an operational life-cycle. Maintenance is one area where the collection of technologies may be applied to enhance operational reliability using a machine condition monitoring system. Data-driven models have been extensively applied to machine condition data to build a fault detection system. Most existing studies on fault detection were developed under a fixed set of operating conditions and tested with data obtained from that set of conditions. Therefore, variability in a model’s performance from data obtained from different operating settings is not well reported. There have been limited studies considering changing operational conditions in a data-driven model. For practical applications, a model must identify a targeted fault under variable operational conditions. With this in mind, the goal of this paper is to study invariance of model to changing speed via a deep learning method, which can detect a mechanical imbalance, i.e., targeted fault, under varying speed settings. To study the speed invariance, experimental data obtained from a motor test-bed are processed, and time-series data and time–frequency data are applied to long short-term memory and convolutional neural network, respectively, to evaluate their performance.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven deep learning technology has gained many achievements in the field of motor fault diagnosis and prognostics. However, the application objects of those previous studies are commonly limited to the faulty data sharing the similar distribution under unvarying stable working condition. Unfortunately, this limitation is nearly invalid in the real-world scenario, where the working condition is complicated and changes invariably, resulting in the unfavourable situation that the deep representation learning methods of the previous studies always fail in extracting the effective representations for fault diagnosis in real applications. To tackle this issue, inspired by f-divergence estimation, this work takes a different route and proposes an unsupervised deep representation learning approach, named Deep Mutual Information Maximization (DMIM), using variational divergence estimation approach to maximize mutual information (MI) between the input and output of a deep neural network. Meanwhile the representation distribution is automatically tuned by matching to a prior distribution with the same philosophy of Variational Autoencoder. Opposite to previous works which learn representations basically with supervised feedback regulation or unsupervised reconstruction, the proposed unsupervised MI maximization framework aims to make representational characteristics like independence play a bigger role to capture the most unique representations. To verify the effectiveness of our proposal, faulty motor data from the motor tests under European driving cycle for simulating the real working scenario, are collected for validation. It turns out that DMIM outperforms many popular unsupervised and fully-supervised learning methods. It opens new avenues for unsupervised learning of representations for motor fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {It is estimated that the emergence of digital businesses, and growing dynamic traffic demands for Internet applications, including cloud computing and the Internet of Things, will impact the traffic at unprecedented rates. Thus, to cost-efficiently accommodate these challenging requirements, network operators are motivated to maximize the achieved capacity over deployed links, and design more efficient networks capable of handling a wide range of applications, as well as operate more closely to optimality. On the other hand, as the network elements age, nonlinear impairments increases (which can be translated to increasing the network load) and hence, the system margin and maximum achievable rate decrease. Therefore, in order to increase the capacity of optical networks and extend their life time, an accurate physical model is required to estimate the quality of signal and quantify the margin of lightpaths. In this regard, a machine learning (ML) method is proposed based on the modular neural networks to account the cross channel nonlinear effects in estimating noise power and OSNR of lightpaths. For this, the dependence of the contributed nonlinear component of noise power on the transmitted powers as well as the modulation formats of all channels are considered in this data-model. Indeed, this ML-based model provides a useful tool for per-lightpath power management, as a fundamental element for reducing margins. Results of evaluating various proposed modular models show that, in general, all modular models are able to estimate OSNR of lightpaths, with average accuracy of more than 96.6%. However, the proposed $$ MM_{4} $$ modular model is the model presenting better generalization, being able to correctly estimate OSNR of lightpaths, with average accuracy of 99.2%. Also, $$ MM_{3} $$ model performs better for partially loaded network scenarios (99.3%).},

  abstract     = {In recent years, metal cellular structures have drawn attentions in various industrial sectors due to their design freedoms and abilities to achieve multi-functional mechanical properties. However, metal cellular structures are difficult to fabricate due to their complex geometries, even with modern additive manufacturing technologies such as the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process. Assessing the manufacturability of metal cellular structures via a DMLS process is a challenging task as the geometric features of the structures are complex. Besides, via a DMLS process, the manufacturability also depends on the cumulative deformation of the layers during the manufacturing process. Existing methods on Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) provide design guidelines that are based on past successful printed designs. However, they are not effective in predicting the manufacturability of metal cellular structures. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning based manufacturability assessment (SSDLMA) framework to assess whether a metal cellular structure can be successfully manufactured from a given DMLS process. To enable efficient learning, we represent the complex cellular structures as 3D binary arrays with a simple yet efficient voxelisation method. We then train a deep learning based classifier using only a small amount of experimental data by adopting a semi-supervised learning approach. By running real experiments and comparing with existing DFAM methods and machine learning models, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed SSDLMA framework. The proposed framework can be extended to predict the manufacturability of various other complex geometries beyond cellular structure in a reliable way even with a small number of training data.},

For their potential to be realized, SPC methods capable of handling these datasets need to be developed. This paper presents an approach for performing SPC using high-density point clouds. The proposed approach is based on transforming the high-dimensional point clouds into Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline (NURBS) surfaces.

  abstract     = {In the high speed milling process, the accurate predictions of surface roughness and residual stress can avoid the deterioration of machined surface quality. But it’s hard to estimate the surface roughness and residual stress under different tool wear status and cutting parameters. In this work, a novel intelligent reasoning method-improved case based reasoning (ICBR) was proposed to predict the surface roughness and residual stress. The inputs of ICBR are cutting parameters and tool wear status. The corresponding outputs of ICBR are surface roughness and residual stress. In the ICBR, K-nearest neighbor method and artificial neural network (ANN) as case retrieval was introduced to retrieve the K similar cases to the inputs. Through retrieving K similar cases, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model as case reuse was established to output the surface roughness and residual stress. The vibration particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the ANN and GPR models. The high speed milling experiments of Compacted Graphite Iron was performed to validate the performance of ICBR. The experimental results showed that the cutting speed is the most important factor affecting the surface roughness. The feed rate is the most important factor affecting the residual stress. The ICBR gives the accurate estimation of surface roughness with the Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 11.6%. As for residual stress, the prediction accuracy using ICBR is 87.5%. Compared with Back-Propagation neural network, standard CBR and GPR models, the ICBR has better predictive performance and can be used for estimations of surface roughness and residual stress in the actual machining process.},

  abstract     = {Increased demand for a greater variety of products has forced many companies to rethink their strategies to offer more product variants without sacrificing production efficiency. In this context, research has found that such a trade-off can be properly managed by exploiting the module-based product family (MBPF) design. Over the years, active work in developing methods to design MBPFs has been carried out. Nevertheless, many of them have been created, and consequently exist, in isolation from one other. As a result, the adoption of these methods in industry and academy alike is inhibited by the seemingly broad array of material without a coherent organizing structure. To bridge this gap, this paper performs a systematic literature review and a meta-synthesis, wherein 72 methods to design MBPFs and their respective instances are connected in the form of a functional model and structured classes of design problems. These entities together serve as a meta-method for organizing the research on MBPF design, from which it was possible to identify the common underlying structure among the methods developed over the past 20 years. The main contributions of this work include: (1) constructing a functional model that connects the design methods for MBPFs; (2) suggesting structured classes of design problems that complement the functional model by cataloging the techniques meant to execute each sub-function of the model; (3) proposing a construction heuristic to build and assess functional models and classes of design problems.},

  abstract     = {Many studies have been conducted to improve wafer bin map (WBM) defect classification performance because accurate WBM classification can provide information about abnormal processes causing a decrease in yield. However, in the actual manufacturing field, the manual labeling performed by engineers leads to a high level of uncertainty. Label uncertainty has been a major cause of the reduction in WBM classification system performance. In this paper, we propose a class label reconstruction method for subdividing a defect class with various patterns into several groups, creating a new class for defect samples that cannot be categorized into known classes and detecting unknown defects. The proposed method performs discriminative feature learning of the Siamese network and repeated cross-learning of the class label reconstruction based on Gaussian means clustering in a learned feature space. We verified the proposed method using a real-world WBM dataset. In a situation where there the class labels of the training dataset were corrupted, the proposed method could increase the classification accuracy of the test dataset by enabling the corrupted sample to find its original class label. As a result, the accuracy of the proposed method was up to 7.8% higher than that of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, through the proposed class label reconstruction, we found a new mixed-type defect class that had not been found until now, and we detected new types of unknown defects that were not used for learning with an average accuracy of over 73%.},

  abstract     = {Due to the improvement of network infrastructure and the application of Internet of Things equipment, a large number of sensors are deployed in the industrial pipeline production, and the large size of data is generated. The most typical case in the production line is product inspection, that is, defect inspection. To implement an efficient and robust detection system, in this study, we propose a classification computing model based on Lie Group Machine Learning, which can find the possible defective products in production. Usually, a workshop has a lot of assembly lines. How to process large data on so many production lines in real-time and accurately is a difficult problem. To solve this problem, we use the concept of fog computing to design the system. By offloading the computation burden from the cloud server center to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely data. Our system has two obvious advantages. The first one is to apply Lie Group Machine Learning to fog computing environment to improve the computational efficiency and robustness of the system. The other is that without increasing any production costs, it can quickly detect products, reduce network latency, and reduce the load on bandwidth. The simulations prove that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method has an average running efficiency increase of 52.57%, an average delay reduction of 42.13%, and an average accuracy increase of 27.86%.},

  abstract     = {In the field of CNC milling, chatter has been a hot research topic, which is related to machining quality, precision and cost. Stability lobe diagram (SLD) reflects the vibration of the machining system under different process parameters and cutter axis vectors that is significant for optimization. The accurate dynamic characteristics of the machining system is the prerequisite for stability analysis. Finite element simulation is mainly aimed at small diameter cutter system, and accuracy is poor. The most widely used method is hammer test, but the equipment is expensive, the operation is too professional and it cannot reflect the dynamic characteristics of the machining system in working status. This paper proposes an undetermined coefficient method for the general cutter system to identify the modal parameters, that are the natural frequency, stiffness and damping ratio, just based on the very simple experiment of three-axis half-immersion milling in horizontal plane. Firstly, considering the exact in-cut cutting edge and the instantaneous cutting force coefficient corresponding to the axial factor and the chip thickness, the dynamic model of three-axis milling machining for the general cutter is established. Secondly, two implicit conditions of stable critical speed and cutting depth are derived based on feedback control theory in the frequency domain. Thirdly, the two sets of critical cutting depth and the chatter frequency under arbitrary speeds are obtained by using the dichotomy. With the method proposed in this paper, one of the two is used to solve a series of modal parameter sets, and the other of the two is used to extract the optimal modal parameters in the modal parameter sets. Finally, taking the identified modal parameters as known conditions to search the points one by one in the two-dimensional space composed of the rotational speed and the cutting depth, and judge whether it meets the critical conditions. SLD can be obtained by connecting the points that satisfy critical conditions together. Based on the previous experiment of flat-end cutter, it verified the feasibility of the modal parameter identification method in the paper. In the designed three-axis milling experiment of the ball-end cutter, the in-cut cutting edge simulation and the cutting force coefficient identification were carried out, and the modal parameters of the cutter system were also obtained successfully. The plotted lobe diagram was verified by the spectrum analysis result of the vibration signal collected by the acceleration sensor.},

SADT/IDEF0 models are commonly used by automation experts to model manufacturing systems based on the manual process. However, function generalisation without benchmarking is difficult for experts particularly for complex and highly skilled-based tasks. This paper proposes a functional task abstraction approach to support automation design specification based on human factor attributes. A semi-automated clustering approach is developed to identify key functions from an observed manual process. The proposed approach is tested on five different automation case studies. The results indicate the proposed method reduces inconsistency in task abstraction when compared to the current approach that relies on the experts, which are further validated against the solutions generated by automation experts.},

Two identical builds with the same material, process, and build parameters were produced, resulting in 434 samples for mechanical testing (ISO 527-2 1BA). The developed linear models had low accuracy, and therefore needed an application of more advanced data analysis techniques.

Since constraint violation information of individuals in current generation are already known, the positive side of tangent line of one point as positive halfspace is defined. A point is treated as potential point if it locates in the intersect region of two positive halfspaces. Hence, the region includes all these points has greater possibility to obtain smaller constraint violation. Only when the offspring locates in this area, the actual objective function value and constraint violation will be calculated. The estimated worse individuals will be omitted without calculating actual constraint violation and fitness function value. Four engineering optimization and a case study with the grinding optimization process are studied. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

Deep learning has been proved to be an effective way to detect defects in X-ray images. In this work, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) which has been utilized broadly in many applications is adopted as our baseline. In FPN, there mainly exits two issues: firstly, down sampling operation in Convolutional Neural Network is often utilized to enhance the perception field, causing the loss of location information in feature maps, and secondly, there exists feature imbalance in feature maps and proposals. DetNet and Path Aggregation Network are adopted to solve the two shortages. To further improve the recall rate, soft Non-Maximum Suppression (soft-NMS) is adopted to remain more proposals that have high classification confidence. Defects in X-ray images of casting parts are provided with low semantic information, causing the different instances between detection results and annotations in the same area. We propose soft Intersection Over Union (soft-IOU) criterion which could evaluate several results or ground truths in the near area, making it more accurate to evaluate detection results.

  abstract     = {One of the most important parameters in machining process is tool wear. Thus, monitoring the wear of cutting tools is essential to ensure product quality, increase productivity, reduce environmental impact and avoid catastrophic damages. As wear is related to the vibrations of the process, the vibration signal is commonly used to monitor the process non-intrusively. Traditional wear monitoring techniques present a number of problems such as: the difficulty of identifying vibration features sensitive to wear evolution, the specialist requirement for supervising the model training and an endless series of tests to work with balanced data. To overcome these difficulties, this paper aims to propose a new approach in the application of unsupervised artificial intelligence technique with imbalanced data to identify the cutting tool wear condition during the turning process. The methodology will allow industrial applications since no supervision is required in the model training when machining condition is changed. From vibration signals collected during each tool pass, a self-organizing map model was used to identify the ideal moment of tool change. The classifier used was compared to benchmark supervised methods (weighted k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine). Imbalanced data sets were used to simulate the industrial reality. Tool tests were performed under different wear conditions and changing the cutting parameters. The results showed that it is possible to predict the cutting tool wear condition with a self-organizing map neural for imbalanced data, using only the vibration signal with up to 92% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Efficient quality control is inevitable in the manufacturing of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Because defective LED chips may be traced back to different causes, a time and cost-intensive electrical and optical contact measurement is employed. Fast photoluminescence measurements, on the other hand, are commonly used to detect wafer separation damages but also hold the potential to enable an efficient detection of all kinds of defective LED chips. On a photoluminescence image, every pixel corresponds to an LED chip’s brightness after photoexcitation, revealing performance information. But due to unevenly distributed brightness values and varying defect patterns, photoluminescence images are not yet employed for a comprehensive defect detection. In this work, we show that fully convolutional networks can be used for chip-wise defect detection, trained on a small data-set of photoluminescence images. Pixel-wise labels allow us to classify each and every chip as defective or not. Being measurement-based, labels are easy to procure and our experiments show that existing discrepancies between training images and labels do not hinder network training. Using weighted loss calculation, we were able to equalize our highly unbalanced class categories. Due to the consistent use of skip connections and residual shortcuts, our network is able to predict a variety of structures, from extensive defect clusters up to single defective LED chips.},

  abstract     = {As one of the demand-side programs, time-of-use (TOU) tariffs brings opportunities of maintaining power grid stability for electricity providers and chances of energy conservation for manufacturers, but it also brings challenge for enterprises to optimize scheduling schemes. This paper studies a two-stage parallel machine scheduling problem under TOU to minimize total electricity costs. The two-stage parallel machine system is composed of identical parallel speed-scaling machines at stage 1 and unrelated parallel machines at stage 2. The key issues lie in assigning a group of jobs to a set of parallel machines at each stage and choosing the appropriate processing speed for all jobs at stage 1, and then determining the interval of processing time for jobs on each selected machine. To solve this problem, a new continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated. According to the characteristics of this model, a tabu search-greedy insertion hybrid (TS-GIH) algorithm is designed, which realizes job-machine assignment based on load balancing principle, job insertion with greedy mechanism as well as movement and speed adjustment strategies to find more suitable positions for jobs. The effectiveness of the proposed TS-GIH is demonstrated by comparing with CLPEX and improved genetic algorithm (IGA) through real-life and randomly generated instances. The results show that TS-GIH can realize the trade-off between computation time and solution quality. Compared with CLPEX, the computation time of TS-GIH is significantly less, and the solution quality is much better than IGA.},

  abstract     = {Compacted graphite iron (CGI) plays an important role in contemporary manufacturing of automobile engine, and coated tool is the best choice for milling of CGI. But studies about the estimation of the wear of coated tool are still rare and incomplete. As tool wear is the main factor that affects the quality of machined surface, in this study, we proposed an intelligent model-adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate the tool wear, and ANFIS was learned by the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. As the PSO algorithm is easy to fall into the local minimum, the vibration and communication particle swarm optimization (VCPSO) algorithm was proposed by introducing the self-random vibration and inter-particle communication mechanisms. Besides that, to obtain the optimal combination of milling parameters, the multi-objective optimization based on minimum cutting power, surface roughness and maximum material removal rate (MRR) was studied using VCPSO algorithm. The experimental results showed that the ANFIS learned by VCPSO algorithm (ANFIS-VCPSO) has better performance for the estimation of tool wear compared with other intelligent models. The VCPSO algorithm was tested using Benchmark functions, and the results showed VCPSO algorithm has the global optimization ability. Meantime, the best combinations of milling parameters under different tool wear status were obtained through VCPSO algorithm. The proposed ANFIS-VCPSO model as a new intelligent model can be applied for real-time tool wear monitoring, which can improve the machining efficiency and prolong tool life. In order to meet the requirements of green and intelligent manufacturing, the best combination of milling parameters was also obtained in this work.},

We derive the analytical form of the equilibrium solution of order quantities of manufacturers and wholesale prices of suppliers in different scenarios and compare the decision differences when reliable supplier stays in different game positions. We further investigate the impact of different cooperation contract between the manufacturer who adopts dual sourcing and unreliable supplier on the procurement and pricing strategies by numerical experiments. The results illustrate that reliable supplier acts as the Stackelberg leader are more beneficial to suppliers.

The active rotating tool presented here is equipped with a gap sensor that can measure the distance between the tool, workpiece, and machining tip so that micron-scale dimples and grooves can be patterned and connected to piezoelectric actuators. Electronic control and power connections are made to the external controller via a slip ring. Accurate measurements of the distance between the tool and workpiece were used to increase the lubrication effect by machining patterns with uniform size and depth. It is difficult to accurately measure errors in cylinders of various shapes using a single gap sensor; thus, we employed two gap sensors to ensure accurate assessment of cylinder shape, and a least mean square algorithm was implemented to compensate for the measured runout errors, which were tracked and compensated using the gap sensor. The method presented here reduces errors on the inner face of a cylinder, and produces a uniform pattern.},

  abstract     = {In industrial production, the characteristics of compressor vibration signal change with the production environment and other external factors. Therefore, to ensure the effectiveness of the model, the vibration signal prediction model needs to be updated constantly. Due to the complex structure of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, the LSTM model is difficult to adapt to the scene of online update. Therefore, the update model based on LSTM is difficult to respond quickly to data changes, which affects the accuracy of the model. To solve this problem, the online learning algorithm is introduced into prediction model, Error-LSTM (E-LSTM) model is proposed in this paper. The main idea of E-LSTM model is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model according to test error of the model. First, the hidden layer neurons of LSTM network are divided into blocks, and only part of the modules are activated at each time step. The number of modules activated is determined by test error. Thus, the training speed of the model is accelerated and the efficiency of the model is improved. Second, the E-LSTM model can adaptively adjust the training method according to the data distribution characteristics, so as to improve the accuracy of updated model. In experimental part, two types of datasets are used to verify the performance of the proposed model. LSTM model is used for comparative experiments, and the results showed that the updating model based on E-LSTM is better than that based on LSTM in terms of model accuracy and efficiency.},

However, it is well known that during processing using this procedure there are difficulties in collecting data. It is required to establish an adequate model that would make it possible to predict the cutting force based on the input parameters. During machining to avoid difficulties in acquisition data, two models have developed based on fuzzy logic that will allow indirect monitoring of the cutting force. This research uses the improved fuzzy logic methods for modeling, whereby it can make predictions of the main cutting force according to the different input parameters. The contribution of this work reflected through the application of two innovative methods based on reducing the number of rules, which leads to better interpretability of models. First is the Mamdani with rule reduction method, and second is the Sugeno sub-clustering method based on the identification of the model structure, it comes down to finding the required number of rules by forming specific clusters. Both approaches differ by reducing the number of rules without affecting the accuracy of the models. The ability to predict the model determined by applying different statistical parameters. It concluded that Mamdani and Sugeno models give an approximate quality of the prediction. The resulting models also have an acceptable error to predict data that did not participate in their creation. Furthermore, obtained models can be used at the generalization stage where the cutting force information is required and where direct measurement is not possible.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble learning method has shown its superiority in bearing fault diagnosis based on the condition based monitoring. Nevertheless, features extracted from the monitoring signals of bearing systems often contain interrelated and redundant components, leading to poor performances of the base classifiers in the ensemble. Moreover, the current ensemble methods rely on voting strategies to aggregate the diagnostic predictions of these base classifiers without considering their reliabilities and weights simultaneously. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Diagnosis Aggregation Method with Evidential Reasoning rule, i.e., DAMER, for bearing fault diagnosis. In this method, a semi-random subspace approach using a structured sparsity learning model is developed to decrease the negative effect of interrelated and redundant features, and in the meanwhile to generate accurate and diverse base classifiers. Furthermore, an adaptive evidential reasoning rule (ER rule) incorporating with ensemble learning theory is utilized to aggregate the diagnostic predictions of the base classifiers by taking both their weights and reliabilities into account. To validate the proposed DAMER, an empirical study is conducted on Case Western Reserve University bearing vibration dataset, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed DAMER as well as its superiority over commonly used ensemble methods. The performances of feature subsets from multiple domains and the aggregation capability of the adaptive ER rule were also investigated. Results illustrate that DAMER can be utilized as an effective method for bearing fault diagnosis.},
