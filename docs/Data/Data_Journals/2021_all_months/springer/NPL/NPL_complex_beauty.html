  abstract     = {Biologically inspired spiking neural networks are increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence due to their ability to solve complex problems while being power efficient. They do so by leveraging the timing of discrete spikes as main information carrier. Though, industrial applications are still lacking, partially because the question of how to encode incoming data into discrete spike events cannot be uniformly answered. In this paper, we summarise the signal encoding schemes presented in the literature and propose a uniform nomenclature to prevent the vague usage of ambiguous definitions. Therefore we survey both, the theoretical foundations as well as applications of the encoding schemes. This work provides a foundation in spiking signal encoding and gives an overview over different application-oriented implementations which utilise the schemes.},

  abstract     = {Real-time video anomaly detection and localization still prevail as a challenging task. Autoencoders are expected to give high reconstruction error for abnormal events than normal events while trained on video segments of normal events. Nevertheless, this assumption is not always true in practice. Sometimes the autoencoder offers better generalization. Therefore, it also reconstructs abnormal events well, leading to slightly degraded performance for anomaly detection. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Skip connected and Memory Guided Network (SMGNet) for video anomaly detection. The memory guided network with skip connection help in avoiding loss of meaningful information such as foreground patterns, in addition to memorizing significant normality patterns. The effect of augmenting memory guided network with skip connection in the residual spatiotemporal autoencoder (R-STAE) architecture is evaluated. The proposed technique achieved improved results over three benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Drug-Target Binding Affinity (DTBA) prediction is one class of Drug-Target Interaction problem (DTI), where the focus is to predict the binding strength of a drug-target pair. Several machine learning approaches have been developed for this purpose. However, almost all rely on the use of increasingly sophisticated inputs to improve the obtained results besides that they don’t allow any analysis or interpretation due to their black-box characteristic. This work is an attempt to address these limitations by leveraging the use of attention mechanisms with convolution-deconvolution architecture. In this paper, we define two multilevel attention-based models for DTBA prediction. Our two approaches attempt to get advantage of the attention concept, by probing different abstraction levels of drug-target feature maps. We evaluate the performance of our methods on two benchmark datasets, KIBA and Davis. The results show that both approaches are very effective. Compared to other well-known methods, they achieved excellent results regarding the considered performance metrics, while using merely sequences as inputs and providing a potential way of results interpretation.},

In actual sense, errors are not fixed as suggested by this recent model but vary under different circumstances.

Accurately predicting the exchange rate appears to be difficult on account of the characteristics of time variability and randomness. This study proposes an Adaboost-based reinforcement ensemble learning framework, which combines two-stage feature extraction with deep learning models to perform multivariate exchange rate prediction. Considering the impact of data information hidden in other financial markets on the foreign exchange market, multiple exogenous variables are introduced as input factors of the proposed model. Auto-encoder and Self-organizing map, as the main two-stage feature extraction models, have their advantages in simplifying model input and clustering similar feature data respectively. Feature extraction paves the way for the subsequent establishment of deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) for prediction, which improves the robustness of the model while improving the prediction accuracy. Finally, the Adaboost algorithm is utilized to integrate the DRNN prediction results. The empirical results reveal that the proposed model has higher accuracy in exchange rate prediction. The prediction effect of the model is significantly better than comparable models and it is a promising way of forecasting exchange rates.},

  abstract     = {Proteins may be defined as one of the most prominent structural and functional units of life. The structure of a protein is as diverse as the function it sustains. Knowledge about the structural folding of protein serves to ascertain its function. Experimental determination of protein function via its structure is a tedious and gradual process. Protein structure prediction thus; seeks to cultivate adequate ways aimed at providing plausible models for proteins whose structures remain unexplored. Hence, there is a dire need of computational tools to predict, evaluate and visualize the structures of unknown proteins from their amino acid sequences. However, the existing computational tools suffer from various drawbacks that affect their performance substantially like—low prediction accuracy, inefficient modeling of sequence–structure relationship, local methods lacking global exploration, and inability to suffice to the dynamic and exponentially growing data. Accordingly, swarm Intelligence based particle swarm optimization in combination with fuzzy sets has been introduced to propose a neural network based model for secondary structure prediction of protein. The data from six standard datasets namely- RS126, EVA6, CB396, CB513, Manesh and PSS504 has been utilized for the training and testing of the neural network. The model is evaluated using performance measures like- sensitivity, fallout, false discovery rate, miss-rate, specificity, false omission rate, precision, negative predictive value, Q3 accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Sensitivity analysis and 10, 20, 30 and 40 fold cross validation has been performed for further verification of results. The proposed model resolves most of the issues addressed above, thus achieving an average Q3 accuracy of above 90% which is better than the existing tools for secondary structure prediction.},

The distribution characteristics of roots of characteristic equation are discussed in detail to get the sufficient conditions for Hopf bifurcation of system caused by delays. Then the designed protocol is simpler and easier to implement compared with some previously investigates. Subsequently, by using the normal form method and central manifold theorem, the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the period and stability of bifurcation periodic solution are determined.

Both recycling and reworking are assumed in the reverse logistic. There was a disturbance because we considered the demand time-dependent. From the former points the presented model is so close to the real-world problem in the field of SC. The Pontryagin minimum principle is applied to reformulate the OCP into a system of equations.

Defining the appropriate window duration has been the target of several previous works. In most of these analyses, the recognition performance increases with the windows duration until an optimal value and decreases or saturates for longer windows. This paper evaluates several strategies to combine sub-window information inside a window, obtaining important improvements for long windows. This evaluation was performed using a state-of-the-art human activity recognition system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This deep neural network includes convolutional layers to learn features from signal spectra and additional fully connected layers to classify the activity at each window. All the analyses were carried out using two public datasets (PAMAP2 and USC-HAD) and a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation. For 10-s windows, the accuracy increased from 90.1 (± 0.66) to 94.27 (± 0.46) in PAMAP2 and from 80.54 (± 0.73) to 84.46 (± 0.67) in USC-HAD.

  abstract     = {Dense depth estimation based on a single image is a basic problem in computer vision and has exciting applications in many robotic tasks. Modelling fully supervised methods requires the acquisition of accurate and large ground truth data sets, which is often complex and expensive. On the other hand, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising alternative to monocular depth estimation as it does not require ground truth depth data. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised joint learning framework for depth estimation using consecutive frames from monocular and stereo videos. Our architecture leverages two new ideas for improvement: (1) triplet attention and (2) funnel activation (FReLU). By adding triplet attention to the deep and pose networks, this module captures the importance of features across dimensions in a tensor without any information bottlenecks, making the optimisation learning framework more reliable. FReLU is used at the non-linear activation layer to grasp the local context adaptively in images, rather than using more complex convolutions at the convolution layer. FReLU extracts the spatial structure of objects by the pixel-wise modeling capacity provided by the spatial condition, making the details of the complex image richer. The experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, software effort prediction (SEP) and software test prediction (STP) (i.e., software reliability problems) are tackled by integrating the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) with a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). Software effort and test prediction problems are common in software engineering and arise when seeking to determine the actual software resources needed to develop a project. BPNN is the most popular prediction algorithm used in the literature. The performance of BPNN depends totally on the initial parameter values such as weight and biases. The main objective of this paper is to integrate SSA with the BPNN to find the optimal weight for every training cycle and thereby improve prediction accuracy. The proposed method, abbreviated as SSA-BPNN, is tested on twelve SEP datasets and two STP datasets. All datasets vary in terms of complexity and size. The results obtained by SSA-BPNN are evaluated according to twelve performance measures: MSE, RMSE, RAE, RRSE, MAE, MRE, MMRE, MdMRE, VAF(%), R2(%), ED, and MD. First, the results obtained by BPNN with SSA (i.e., SSA-BPNN) and without SSA are compared. The evaluation of the results indicates that SSA-BPNN performs better than BPNN for all datasets. In the comparative evaluation, the results of SSA-BPNN are compared against thirteen state-of-the-art methods using the same SEP and STP problem datasets. The evaluation of the results reveals that the proposed method outperforms the comparative methods for almost all datasets, both SEP and STP, in the case of most performance measures. In conclusion, integrating SSA with BPNN is a very powerful approach for solving software reliability problems that can be used widely to yield accurate prediction results.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the number of electrical and electronic devices used in production and life has been increasing. It leads to serious interference and aliasing among electromagnetic signals. To address electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues, we propose a feasible blind source separation method based on wavelet transform and improved equivariant adaptive separation via independence (EASI) algorithm. First, we leverage the wavelet transform algorithm to denoise mixed electromagnetic signals. Second, we use the variable step-size EASI algorithm to separate each signal from the mixed signals. It is inspired by the simulated annealing strategy. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of WE method. The experimental results show that WE method can provide support for solving EMI problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the image deblurring task has attracted more and more researchers’ attention. Many researchers are devoted to eliminating motion blur by using a “coarse-to-fine” architecture. This architecture can effectively eliminate motion blur caused by a simple relative displacement. But when using the architecture directly for the face image deblurring task, there would exist some problems. For example, complex network structures make the model difficult to be trained, and a large number of parameters need to be calculated would result in expensive runtime. Since details of images can’t be completely restored, the quality of images will deteriorate, and deblurring visual effect is poor, so in order to solve these issues, combining the “coarse-to-fine” architecture with the “stacked” architecture, we propose a new network architecture-“Stack-based Scale-recurrent Network” for the face image deblurring task. The ConvLSTM network is employed to build a model. We achieves the purpose of improving the visual clarity and the quality of restored face images. And we use the improved encoder-decoder to enhance network performance. Compared with the other deblurring methods, our method can restore clear face images with higher-quality and clearer vision.},

  abstract     = {Solar energy is one of the world&#39;s clean and renewable source of energy and it is an alternative power with the ability to serve a greater proportion of rising demand needs. The operation and maintenance of solar energy have a significant impact on PV integrated distribution grids. Hence, the short-term forecasting of solar power is an important task for the effective management of grid-connected PV. In recent developments, most of the electric appliances (air conditioners, geysers, clothes dryers, electric blankets, etc.) usage mainly depends on the weather temperature. Therefore, temperature variations are considered to have a significant impact on the use of electrical appliances. Rapid solar integration and advanced temperature-dependent electrical appliances have drawn attention to the prediction of solar power and temperature in advance for efficient grid operation. Therefore, this paper proposes a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based forecast model for accurate forecasting. The suitable network structure for accurate forecasting of solar power and temperature is obtained by doing statistical analysis on the various network models. The statistical analysis gives the two-layer LSTM structure (i.e. layer 1 with 10 nodes and layer 2 with 20 nodes) is the suitable architecture for accurate forecasting of solar and temperature data. The proposed LSTM structure gives 0.2478 Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and 6.7207 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for solar data, while for temperature data, it gives 0.014 MAPE and 1.0423 RMSE. The proposed network model showed an improvement in the forecast accuracy over the traditional network models available in the literature.},

Furthermore, the approach allows mini-batch sizes as low as 1, which are typical for streaming-data settings. Major problems in such settings are undesirable local optima during early training phases and numerical instabilities due to high data dimensionalities. We introduce an adaptive annealing procedure to address the first problem, whereas numerical instabilities are eliminated by an exponential-free approximation to the standard GMM log-likelihood. Experiments on a variety of visual and non-visual benchmarks show that our SGD approach can be trained completely without, for instance, k-means based centroid initialization. It also compares favorably to an online variant of Expectation-Maximization (EM)—stochastic EM (sEM), which it outperforms by a large margin for very high-dimensional data.},

The transmission of MJNNs signals invoked a communication scheme in which the RRP is used for the data transmissions in order to avoid undesirable data collisions. Protocol-dependent state estimator modeling of a hybrid switching system with mixed time delays and disturbances is designed for the first time to achieve asymptotic tracing for the neuron state. Using the Lyapunov stability theory and several asymptotic methods, sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the state estimation are established under the constraint of $$H_\infty $$ performance. By employing a combination of matrix analysis techniques, the estimator gain matrices are calculated by the feasible solutions to the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

In this paper, we propose a finger vein de-noising algorithm based on Custom Sample-Texture Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CS-TCGAN). The proposed algorithm effectively protects the texture features while removing noise. Firstly, the proposed algorithm uses texture loss, adversarial loss, and content loss as constraints, which lead to a better de-noising performance on finger vein image with blurred texture.Secondly, in order to avoid the checkerboard artifacts effect caused by up-sampling in de-convolution process which results in the loss of the vein information, the dimension preserving structure is adopted in the generator network to minimize this problem. Lastly, the noise distribution of finger vein images obtained in the practical application has been investigated to generate the training dataset for obtaining a de-noising model with better generalization. Specifically, the training dataset has been established by combining Poisson noise, salt/pepper noise, Gaussian noise, and speckle noise. The experimental results illustrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the traditional filtering de-noising approaches and the widely used CGAN de-noising algorithms.},

First, most networks have poor recognition ability on high resolution images, resulting in blurred boundaries in the segmented building maps. Second, the similarity between buildings and background results in intra-class inconsistency. To address these two problems, we propose an UNet-based network named Context-Transfer-UNet (CT-UNet). Specifically, we design Dense Boundary Block. Dense Block utilizes reuse mechanism to refine features and increase recognition capabilities. Boundary Block introduces the low-level spatial information to solve the fuzzy boundary problem. Then, to handle intra-class inconsistency, we construct Spatial Channel Attention Block. It combines context space information and selects more distinguishable features from space and channel. Finally, we propose an improved loss function to enhance the purpose of loss by adding evaluation indicator. Based on our proposed CT-UNet, we achieve 85.33% mean IoU on the Inria dataset, 91.00% mean IoU on the WHU dataset and 83.92% F1-score on the Massachusetts dataset.

  abstract     = {Positive and Unlabeled learning (PU learning) has drawn plenty of attention among researchers over the last few years, where only labeled positive examples and unlabeled examples are available for training a classifier. Many classic techniques for solving PU learning problems belong to the category of “two-step strategy”. However, quite a number of them cannot extract reliable negative examples accurately and often lead to unsatisfactory classification results. In this paper, we propose a two-step learning scheme based on the collaborative representation (CR) for PU learning. In the first step, to handle the deficiency of negative training data, collaborative representation (CR) technique is utilized to identify reliable negative examples from unlabeled training examples. Subsequently, collaborative representation based classification (CRC) framework with $${l}_{2}$$ -norm regularization term is applied to perform PU classification. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results demonstrate that the two-step CR-based approaches can achieve competitive classification accuracy when compared with both traditional and state-of-the-art techniques in dealing with different PU learning issues.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks offer advanced procedures for many learning tasks because of the ability to extract preferable features at every network layer. The evolved efficiency of extra layers inside a deep network will come at the expense of appended latency and power consumption in feedforward inference. As networks continue to grow and deepen, these outcomes become exceedingly prohibitive for energy-sensitive and real-time software. To overcome this problem, we propose the Side Road Network (SRN), an innovative deep network structure that is enhanced with further side road (SR) classifiers. The SR classifiers are trained by Pseudoinverse learning algorithm (PIL). The PIL algorithm does not integrate crucial user-dependent parameters such as momentum constant or learning rate. The SRN structure allows the prediction of results for a major portion of test samples to exit the network earlier via these SR classifiers since samples can be inferred with certainty. We analyze SRN structure using different models such as VGG, ResNet, WRN, and MobileNet. We evaluate the performance of SRN on three image datasets—CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet—and show that it can improve the model prediction at earlier layers.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) includes two sub-tasks namely, aspect extraction and aspect-level sentiment classification. Most existing works address these sub-tasks independently by applying a supervised learning approach using labeled data. However, obtaining such labeled sentences is difficult and extremely expensive. Hence, it is important to solve ABSA without taking a dependency on labeled sentences. In this work, we propose a three-step semi-supervised hybrid approach that jointly detects an aspect and its associated sentiment in a given review sentence. The first step of our approach takes a small set of seed words for each aspect and sentiment class to construct respective semantically coherent class vocabularies. The second step makes use of these constructed vocabularies along with POS tags to label a subset of sentences from the training corpus. As we adopt a semi-automated approach to label the data, this process may induce noise in the labels during the annotation. In the last step, we use such labeled sentences to build a noise-robust deep neural network for aspect and sentiment classification. We conduct experiments on two real data sets to verify the effectiveness of our model ( https://github.com/Raghu150999/UnsupervisedABSA ).},

This paper presents a generative adversarial network (GAN) based three-stage-training algorithm for multi-view FER. Specifically, the frontal-view faces are firstly adopted to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in an efficient way. Then, the pre-trained CNN is embedded in a well-designed GAN such that the faces with different deflections can be synthesized as the frontal-view ones containing expression features. The original and synthesized faces are finally fused and employed to retrain the CNN classifier such that the multi-view FER problem is efficiently resolved.

In response to the above issues, this paper uses the attention to scale method and proposes a novel attention model for semantic segmentation, which aggregates multi-scale and context features to refine prediction. Specifically, the skeleton convolutional neural network framework takes in multiple different scales inputs, by which means the CNN can get representations in different scales. The proposed attention model will handle the features from different scale streams respectively and integrate them. Then location attention branch of the model learns to softly weight the multi-scale features at each pixel location. Moreover, we add an recalibrating branch, parallel to where location attention comes out, to recalibrate the score map per class. We achieve quite competitive results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, which surpass baseline and related works.},

In contrast, previous textual encoding-based methods capture such structured knowledge from a semantic perspective and employ deep neural textual encoder to model graph triples in semantic space, but they fail to trade off the contextual features with model’s efficiency. Therefore, in this paper we propose a Siamese textual encoder operating on each graph triple from the knowledge base, where the contextual features between a head/tail entity and a relation are well-captured to highlight relation-aware entity embedding while a Siamese structure is also adapted to avoid combinatorial explosion during inference. In the experiments, the proposed method reaches state-of-the-art or comparable performance on several link prediction datasets. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed method is much more efficient than its baseline with similar evaluating results.},

We present a method for generating “poisonous-label” images that use Enhanced Conditional DCGAN (EC-DCGAN) to synthesizes fake images and uses asymmetric poisoning vectors to mislabel them. We evaluate our method by generating “poisonous-label” images from MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets and using them to manipulate image classifiers.

This paper proposed the BLSTM and CNN Stacking Architecture (BCSA) to enhance the ability to recognition emotions. In order to match the input formats of BLSTM and CNN, slicing feature matrices is necessary. For utilizing the different roles of the BLSTM and CNN, the Stacking is employed to integrate the BLSTM and CNN. In detail, taking into account overfitting problem, the estimates of probabilistic quantities from BLSTM and CNN are combined as new data using K-fold cross validation. Finally, based on the Stacking models, the logistic regression is used to recognize emotions effectively by fitting the new data. The experiment results demonstrate that the performance of proposed architecture is better than that of single model. Furthermore, compared with the state-of-the-art model on SER in our knowledge, the proposed method BCSA may be more suitable for SER by integrating time series acoustic features and the local structure among different features.},

LIGE is employed to reconstruct the latent interaction graph from the dynamic trajectory data by exploiting the encoder in Neural Relational Inference. DCII invokes the traditional graph model and measures the significance of nodes. In the re-ranking module FSCR, we introduce a novel metric, the formation stability coefficient, to measure swarm formation stability and re-ranking the candidates. The experimental results on the Drone swarm datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively identify the influential nodes of drone swarm. The extracting time in LIGE is relatively long, which makes it difficult to recognize the core node within the limit time. By optimizing the encoder structure, the extraction time can be reduced to at least twice the original.},

Starting from the initial concept (i.e. No Cover) of coverless information hiding, our model is composed of two generative models: F and G, which are utilized to generate cover image and reconstruct secret image, respectively. The attempt to utilize G to reconstruct secret image usually leads to color distortion and content loss. We realize that the problem is due to the lack of content information of secret image in the middle image, which is generated by F. An extraction module is added during the generation of cover image, which is called “content-consistency”. The experimental results clearly verify the capacity of our model, which can further improve the quality of reconstructed secret image.

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to the synchronization of delayed inertial neural systems by virtue of intermittent control scheme. In the proposed inertial models, a type of mixed delays is introduced which is composed of discrete delays and infinite distributed delays. Particulary, the finite distributed delays can be easily obtained by selecting specific kernel functions in infinite distribute delays. To realize exponential synchronization, different from the previous continuous designs for the first-order systems obtained by suitable substitutions of reduced-order, an intermittent control scheme is directly developed for the response inertial systems. Furthermore, a direct analysis method is proposed to derive the synchronization conditions by constructing a Lyapunov functional formed by the state variables and their derivatives. Lastly, the designed control scheme and established criteria are verified via providing a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {In traditional neural network integration, people adopt Boosting, Bagging and other methods to integrate traditional neural networks. The integration is complex, time-consuming and laborious, difficult to popularize and apply. This paper is not a continuation of this method, but another integration which is called by us morphological neural network integration (MNNI) or morphological associative memory integration (MAMI). These networks used in MAMI are a network family, with 10 family members, unified in the morphological associative memory framework. Various morphological associative memory networks can be directly used as individual networks to learn and work separately, and then synthesize to draw conclusions. The results of some experiments show that this method is not only feasible in theory, but also effective in practice. It can avoid the complexity of traditional integration method, make the integration structure simple and clear, easy to operate, save time, and therefore is a method of neural network integration with research and application value. The contribution of this paper lies in that: (1) it proposed the concept and method of MNNI and, (2) verified the effectiveness of MNNI through experiments and, (3) it has the characteristics of simplicity, saving time and labor and cost, with a good application prospect and, (4) thus promoting the development of morphological neural networks in theory and practice.},

Subsequently, in each module, the first layer conducts what we call the correlation projection process for feature extraction. The second layer determines its parameters analytically through solving a least squares problem. By introducing a corresponding label decoding process, the proposed CPNet achieves a multi-exit structure which is the first of its kind in multilayer analytic learning. Due to the analytic learning technique, the proposed method only needs to visit the dataset once, and is hence significantly faster than the commonly used backpropagation, as verified in the experiments. We also conduct classification tasks on various benchmark datasets which demonstrate competitive results compared with several state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Since the definitions of the biological neuron model are similar to the oscillator structures, many control theorems are used in common with the biological neuron model. While the stability and the synchronization etc. control methods are frequently studied subject for these nonlinear systems, the “rotation-transition” concept draws attention in the recent studies dealing with nonlinear dynamical systems. The studies about the rotation-transition of the nonlinear systems are usually focused on the chaotic oscillator structures. On the other hand, the concept of the rotated attractor is also encountered in the dynamics of biological systems and there is no research about the rotation-transition of biological neuron models. In this study, the rotation-transition process of the Hindmarsh–Rose neuron model has been performed for the first time. In this context, firstly, the HR neuron model is converted to a rotated structure by using the Euler’s rotation theorem. Then, the characteristics outcomes of the rotated HR neuron model are analyzed by calculating the equilibrium points and Lyapunov exponents. The functionality of the rotated HR neuron model has been tested by the numerical simulation studies. Lastly, the rotated HR neuron model is implemented by using FPGA device. Briefly, this conversion process is modeled mathematically, then supported by the results of numerical simulations and finally verified by the results of the FPGA based experimental realizations. Thus, a phase control method for the dynamical attractor of a neuron model is achieved without the need for any coupling identification in this system.},

The original convolutional subspace clustering network contains the stacked convolutional encoder module, the stacked convolutional decoder module and the self-expression module. We firstly alter the self-expression module, i.e., add a new k-block diagonal regularizer to the weights of the self-expression module. It means that the $$\ell _1$$ or $$\ell _2$$ regularizer is abandoned. The k-block diagonal regularizer is proposed to directly pursue the block diagonal matrix, so introducing this regularizer to the self-expression module will make the learned representation matrix conform with the block diagonal matrix better. Secondly, we add a new spectral clustering module to this convolutional subspace clustering network, in which the spectral clustering result is used to supervise the learning of the representation matrix. This subspace structured regularizer is introduced to the spectral clustering module, which further refines the learned representation matrix. Experimental results on three challenging datasets have demonstrated that the proposed deep learning based subspace clustering method achieves the better clustering effect over the state-of-the-arts.},

Also, since the amount of data available for NLP tasks in Persian is very restricted, a massive dataset for different NLP tasks as well as pre-training the model is composed. ParsBERT obtains higher scores in all datasets, including existing ones and gathered ones, and improves the state-of-the-art performance by outperforming both multilingual BERT and other prior works in Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, and Named Entity Recognition tasks.},

For this model, first, the sliding segments and sliding regions are investigated. Then, based on the obtained sliding regions, we discuss the null-clines and the existence conditions of various equilibria such as regular equilibrium, virtual equilibrium and boundary equilibrium. By choosing the membrane potential threshold as the bifurcation parameter, the boundary node bifurcation, pseudo-saddle-node bifurcation and the global touching bifurcation are investigated by using numerical techniques. Furthermore, the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed FHN model with membrane potential threshold control policy are verified by circuit simulation. Numerical examples show that the membrane potential threshold guided switching may cause complex dynamics.},

Generally, sensitive classifiers are likely to over-fit noisy samples, while robust classifiers are prone to ignore concept drift in data streams. This contradictory raises a high requirement for online algorithms to respond to the above two challenges. In this paper, a Chunk Dynamic Weighted Majority module which processes samples chunk-by-chunk is combined with the online Gradient Boosting Decision Tree framework to cope with drifting data streams with noise. The method could discard weak classifiers which are not appropriate for the current concept distribution, and create new weak classifiers to adapt to drifting data streams. Besides, a robust Doom2 loss function is developed to address the noise sensitivity in stable data streams. The result of experiments demonstrates that compared with the state-of-the-art online algorithms, the proposed algorithm can obtain better results in both noisy stable data streams and drifting data streams.},

The innovations are summarized as follows: (1) the auxiliary systems and the NN state observer are developed to eliminate the influence of input saturation and estimate unmeasurable states; (2) in order to against the drawback of “explosion of complexity&quot; for the traditional backstepping control technique (BCT), the dynamic surface control technique is used to reduce the excessive computation burden; (3) the proposed NN control approach for nonstrict-feedback systems only utilize the property of radial basis function-neural networks (RBF-NNs), instead of the restrictive assumption. Furthermore, unknown smooth functions are approximated by RBF-NNs in nonlinear systems. By employing the BCT, an adaptive output-feedback controller has been constructed. Meanwhile, all signals in closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimate bounded. An explicit function with the saturation error and designed parameters is obtained, which indicates the tracking error can be tuned through the saturation error and designed parameters.

Similarly, it has been observed that their hybrid algorithms provide a reliable estimate to global optimum. Therefore, in this paper based on multi-swarm approach an advanced hybrid algorithm haDEPSO is suggested for engineering design optimization problems. Where, proposed advanced DE (aDE) and PSO (aPSO) are integrated with the suggested hybrid. In aDE, a novel mutation and crossover strategy along with the slightly changed selection scheme are introduced, to avoid premature convergence. And aPSO comprises of novel gradually varying parameters, to avoid stagnation. In haDEPSO, entire population ( $$pop$$ ) is sorted according to the fitness function value and divided into two sub-populations $$pop_{{{ }1}}$$ and $$pop_{{{ }2}}$$ . Since $$pop_{{{ }1}}$$ and $$pop_{{{ }2}}$$ contains best and rest half of the main population which implies global and local search capability respectively. In order to maintain local and global search capability, applying aDE (due to its good local search ability) and aPSO (because of its virtuous global search capability) on the respective sub-population. Evaluating both sub-population then better solution obtained in $$pop_{{{ }1}}$$ and $$pop_{{{ }2}}$$ are named as best and gbest separately. If best is less than gbest then $$pop_{{{ }2}}$$ is merged with $$pop_{{{ }1}}$$ thereafter merged population evaluated by aDE (as it mitigates the potential stagnation). Otherwise, $$pop_{{{ }1}}$$ is merged with $$pop_{{{ }2}}$$ afterward merged population evaluated by aPSO (as it established to guide better movements). The convergence characteristic of aDE and aPSO provides different approximation to the solution space, thus haDEPSO achieve better solutions. Performance of proposed hybrid haDEPSO and its integrating component aDE and aPSO have been verified on CEC 2006 constrained benchmark functions. Then they applied on five engineering design optimization problems. Results confirms the superiority of proposed approaches over many state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, not only it brings tremendous redundant information but makes the model more overweight and sophisticated. To relieve this condition, a deep architecture with the comparison and interaction modules separated named SNMA is presented in this paper. The SNMA uses the Siamese network to extract context information, and employs the multi-head attention mechanism to extract interaction information from sentence pairs separately. Experimental results on four recent Chinese sentence matching datasets outline the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {There are many plant species with medicinal properties and hence, it becomes very crucial to recognize its relevance. With a range of plant species available for medicinal use, it becomes vital to classify them accurately for their efficient use in medicine. The precise and unerring classification of the plant species is beyond the reach of a common person since it requires thorough knowledge of the subject and manual recognition is tedious and inaccurate due to human error. The advocate solution engages the ReNet50 architecture for automated classification of medicinal leaf prior to the fine-tuning. The initial layers of the pre-trained ResNet50 model are freezed during the first phase of the training while the newly added layers are trained using a differential learning rate obtained by the one-cycle policy. The fine-tuned model from phase I is loaded and trained by unfreezing in the second phase. This process is repeated in such a way that the size of the image is made to increase progressively from 80, 128, 150 to 180 pixels in these two stages of learning. The proposed architecture is validated on four-leaf datasets, which also includes a self-created dataset of leaf images collected from the internet. The publicly available benchmark datasets of leaf images considered for carrying out experiments are Flavia leaf dataset, LeafSnap dataset (lab and field), and MalayaKew (MK) Leaf Dataset (D1 and D2). Several preprocessing techniques; such as identifying mislabeled and irrelevant images from the dataset, data preprocessing, and data balancing are applied before fine-tuning of the model in case of self-collected dataset from the internet. The top-1 accuracy of the Flavia dataset is 100%, whereas MK-D1 and MK-D2 datasets achieved top-1 accuracy of 99.05%, and 99.89% respectively. The Accuracy of the LeafSnap dataset is 97.95% and 99.43% for the field and lab images respectively.},

For example, if a user watched a movie, then the user-movie pair will be marked as positive. On the other hand, the user-movie pairs did not appear in the historical data could be either positive or negative. This phenomenon motivates us to formalize the recommender task as a Positive Unlabeled learning problem. As the model trained on the biased historical data may not generalize well on future data, we propose an active learning approach to improve the model by querying further labels from the unlabeled data pool. With the target of querying as few instances as possible, an active selection strategy is proposed to minimize the expected loss and match the distribution between labeled and unlabeled data. Experiments are performed on both classification datasets and movie recommendation dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the labeling cost while achieving superior performance regarding multiple criteria.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most commonly used algorithms in the field of feature extraction, common spatial pattern (CSP) has a good effect on multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification, especially for motor imagery-based signals. However, the formulation of the conventional CSP based on the L2-norm is sensitive to outliers. Whereas the L1-norm-based common spatial pattern (CSP-L1) proposed in recent years can seek robust spatial filters to effectively alleviate the impact of outliers, the L1-norm is unable to characterize the geometric structure of the data well. To further improve the robustness of CSP, in this paper, we propose a new extension to CSP called the L21-norm-based common spatial pattern (CSP-L21), which is formulated by using the L21-norm rather than the L2-norm. Moreover, CSP-L21 has the advantages of rotational invariance and geometric structure characterization. We provide a non-greedy iterative algorithm to maximize the objective function of CSP-L21. Experiments on a toy example and three popular data sets of BCI competitions illustrate that the proposed method can efficiently extract discriminative features.},

In general, the conventional unsupervised approaches lack sufficient accuracy and semantics for the clustering, and the supervised approaches rely on large amount of training data for the classification. This paper explores the semi-supervised scheme for the financial data prediction, in which accurate predictions are expected with a small amount of labeled data. Due to lack of sufficient distinguishability in financial data, it is hard for the existing semi-supervised approaches to obtain satisfactory results. In order to improve the performance, we first convert the input labeled clues to the global prior probability, and propagate the’soft’ prior probability to learn the posterior probability instead of directly propagating the’hard’ labeled data. A label diffusion model is then constructed to adaptively fuse the information at feature space and label space, which makes the structures of data affinity and labeling more consistent.

Two branches are used for high- and low-frequency-domain channel information to maintain the stability of feature delivery. The adaptive feature fusion network complements the advantages of missing high-frequency features, enhances the feature extraction integrity of convolutional neural networks, and improves network detection performance. The simulation tests showed that this algorithm’s detection results are significantly enhanced on blurred objects, overlapping objects, and objects with low contrast between the object and background. The detection results on the Common Objects in Context dataset was more than 1% higher than the CornerNet algorithm.

Although numerous studies have been conducted in recent years, encrypted traffic classification still remains a major challenge and unbalanced data is known as one of the most important problems in this field. Even though previous researches have focused on dealing with the class imbalance problem in the pre-processing step via machine learning and specifically deep learning methods, they are still confronted with some restrictions. To this end, a new traffic classification method is presented in this paper that aims to deal with the problem of unbalanced data along the training process. The proposed method utilized a Cost-Sensitive Convolution Neural Network (CSCNN) where a cost matrix was employed to assign a cost to each misclassification based on the distribution of each class. These costs were then utilized during the training process to increase the final classification accuracy. Various experiments were carried out to explore the performance of the proposed method for the tasks of traffic classification, traffic description, and application identification.‌ According to the obtained results, CSCNN achieved higher efficiency compared to both machine learning and deep learning based methods on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset.},

However, with increasing complexity in the design of rotating machinery, it is quite challenging to quantify the faults precisely. In this present study, an attempt has been made to predict the defect severity of the rotating machinery using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This ANFIS algorithm employs artificial neural networks to define the membership functions, rules and weights to construct the fuzzy inference system. Experiments are performed on a multi-stage spur gearbox model while it is subjected to fluctuating operating speeds. Two local defects on bearing race as well as on gear tooth with four different severity levels are seeded intentionally. Three condition monitoring (CM) strategies, namely, vibration, lubrication oil and acoustic signal analyses are executed, and the raw data is recorded synchronously. The raw vibration and acoustic waveforms are decomposed through discrete wavelet transform to extract the descriptive statistics from the wavelet coefficients. Among them, most discriminating features are selected and given as input to ANFIS classification tool to train the network for obtaining the Sugeno-type FIS, which in turn estimates the severity of the component. Later, the features from the individual CM strategies are combined to devise an integrated feature dataset which is further channelled as input to the ANFIS for predicting the defect severity levels. The investigation reveals that, the proposed integrated feature set in conjunction with ANFIS can discriminate between the defect severity conditions of the gears as well as bearings under fluctuating speeds.},

  abstract     = {Because it is very expensive to collect a large number of labeled samples to train deep neural networks in certain fields, semi-supervised learning (SSL) researcher has become increasingly important in recent years. There are many consistency regularization-based methods for solving SSL tasks, such as the $$\Pi $$ model and mean teacher. In this paper, we first show through an experiment that the traditional consistency-based methods exist the following two problems: (1) as the size of unlabeled samples increases, the accuracy of these methods increases very slowly, which means they cannot make full use of unlabeled samples. (2) When the number of labeled samples is vary small, the performance of these methods will be very low. Based on these two findings, we propose two methods, metric learning clustering (MLC) and auxiliary fake samples, to alleviate these problems. The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on SSL benchmarks. The error rates are 10.20%, 38.44% and 4.24% for CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, CIFAR-100 with 10,000 labels and SVHN with 1000 labels by using MLC. For MNIST, the auxiliary fake samples method shows great results in cases with the very few labels.},

The Banach fixed point theorem and a truncation method are adopted to establish the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions under both global and local Lipschitz conditions. Then, we explore the mean square exponential stability and almost sure exponential stability by employing the inequality techniques, the stochastic analysis techniques together with the properties of the nonlocal delayed term. Furthermore, we obtain the critical value of time delay $$\tau $$ that guarantees the stability of the mild solutions. At last, our theoretic results are illustrated by application to the stochastic non-local delayed Nicholson blowflies equation with numerical simulations.},

The accuracy of the NER directly affects the results of downstream tasks. Most of the relevant methods are implemented using neural networks, however, the word vectors obtained from a small data set cannot describe unusual, previously-unseen entities accurately and the results are not sufficiently accurate. Recently, the use of XLNet as a new pre-trained model has yielded satisfactory results in many NLP tasks, integration of XLNet embeddings in existent NLP tasks is not straightforward. In this paper, a new neural network model is proposed to improve the effectiveness of the NER by using a pre-trained XLNet, bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) and conditional random field (CRF). Pre-trained XLNet model is used to extract sentence features, then the classic NER neural network model is combined with the obtained features. In addition, the superiority of XLNet in NER tasks is demonstrated. We evaluate our model on the CoNLL-2003 English dataset and WNUT-2017 and show that the XLNet-BiLSTM-CRF obtains state-of-the-art results.},

As a critical technology for building Knowledge Bases (KBs), it converts unstructured natural language sentences into structured representations, usually expressed in the form of triples. Most conventional open information extraction approaches leverage a series of manual pre-defined extraction patterns or learn patterns from labeled training examples, which requires a large number of human resources. Additionally, many Natural Language Processing tools are involved, which leads to error accumulation and propagation. With the rapid development of neural networks, neural-based models can minimize the error propagation problem, but it also faces the problem of data-hungry in supervised learning. Especially, they leverage existing Open IE tools to generate training data, and it causes data quality issues. In this paper, we employ a distant supervision learning approach to improve the Open IE task. We conduct extensive experiments by employing two popular sequence-to-sequence models (RNN and Transformer) and a large benchmark data set to demonstrate the performance of our approach.},

The goal is to identify the actual suspect and retrieve images of the real suspect. Prior work focuses on extracting pedestrians’ discriminative visual features or using spatial-temporal information while neglecting the importance of cross-camera trajectory information. Due to the spatial-temporal consistency, the trajectory and image complement each other and the trajectory is associated with the image data. Therefore, we consider retrieving the suspect’s image based on the trajectory and introducing a Hidden Markov Model based trajectory framework to jointly analyze image data and trajectory information.

It is not only the need for more detailed research work of sailors, but also an inevitable requirement for accurately revealing the impact of the marine environment. In this paper, the functional magnetic resonance image data of 33 sailors before and after sailing were used to study the brain FCs changes of sailors at the activated voxels level, in which the activated voxels were obtained by independent component analysis combined with Anatomical Automatic Labelling template. Then, the FCs between the corresponding brain regions of these activated voxels were statistically analyzed to obtain the FCs with significant differences (DFCs) between sailors before and after sailing. Finally, the classification evaluation of sailors before and after sailing was realized by using the FCs and DFCs as the characteristic samples in support vector machine. The results indicated that the DFCs between the activated brain regions had better discriminative performance for sailors before and after sailing, especially for the FCs within Prefrontal lobe and Occipital lobe as well as those between them which showed a significant difference between sailors before and after sailing.},

Due to the varying acoustic environments, online enhancement is a very significant aspect for its applicability in practical scenarios. This emphasizes the need to observe the environment and enhance the speech accordingly. Adaptive filters were used previously to provide online enhancement, but a neural network based online enhancement has not been proposed previously. In this paper, we employ a unique architecture based on Long- Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance single channel speech online. The LSTM network is trained online in a novel way by minimizing the Stein’s unbiased risk estimate. This method of retraining helps the network to learn denoising without using a clean sample or ground truth. To avoid training for each and every sample we have used policy iteration with reward function based on ITU-T P.563, the widely-used single ended perceptual measure. The performance of this LSTM retraining can be observed with the increased PESQ of the enhanced speech by 0.53 on average. The proposed method also improves intelligibility which can be seen from the improvement in the metric STOI by 0.22.},

This paper investigates how to automatically evaluate User eXperience in this domain using sentiment analysis techniques. For this purpose, a corpus with the opinions given by a total of 583 users (107 English speakers and 476 Spanish speakers) about three learning management systems in different courses has been built. All the collected opinions were manually labeled with polarity information (positive, negative or neutral) by three human annotators, both at the whole opinion and sentence levels. We have applied our state-of-the-art sentiment analysis models, trained with a corpus of a different semantic domain (a Twitter corpus), to study the use of cross-domain models for this task. Cross-domain models based on deep neural networks (convolutional neural networks, transformer encoders and attentional BLSTM models) have been tested. In order to contrast our results, three commercial systems for the same task (MeaningCloud, Microsoft Text Analytics and Google Cloud) were also tested. The obtained results are very promising and they give an insight to keep going the research of applying sentiment analysis tools on User eXperience evaluation. This is a pioneering idea to provide a better and accurate understanding on human needs in the interaction with virtual learning environments and a step towards the development of automatic tools that capture the feed-back of user perception for designing virtual learning environments centered in user’s emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, responses, behaviors and accomplishments that occur before, during and after the interaction.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing human activities seamlessly and ubiquitously is now closer than ever given the myriad of sensors readily deployed on and around users. However, the training of recognition systems continues to be both time and resource-consuming, as datasets must be collected ad-hoc for each specific sensor setup a person may encounter in their daily life. This work presents an alternate approach based on transfer learning to opportunistically train new unseen or target sensor systems from existing or source sensor systems. The approach uses system identification techniques to learn a mapping function that automatically translates the signals from the source sensor domain to the target sensor domain, and vice versa. This can be done for sensor signals of the same or cross modality. Two transfer models are proposed to translate recognition systems based on either activity templates or activity models, depending on the characteristics of both source and target sensor systems. The proposed transfer methods are evaluated in a human–computer interaction scenario, where the transfer is performed in between wearable sensors placed at different body locations, and in between wearable sensors and an ambient depth camera sensor. Results show that a good transfer is possible with just a few seconds of data, irrespective of the direction of the transfer and for similar and cross sensor modalities.},

  abstract     = {The pervasive use of artificial intelligence and neural networks in several different research fields has noticeably improved multiple aspects of human life. The application of these techniques to machines has made them progressively more “intelligent” and able to solve tasks considered extremely complex for a human being. This technological evolution has deeply influenced the way we interact with machines. Purely symbolic artificial intelligence and techniques like ontologies, have also been successfully used in the past applied to robotics, but have also shown some limitations and failings in the knowledge construction task. In fact, the exhibited “intelligence” is rarely the result of a real autonomous decision, but it is rather hard-encoded in the machine. While a number of approaches have already been proposed in literature concerning knowledge acquisition from the surrounding environment, they are either exclusively based on low-level features or they involve solely high-level semantics-based attributes. Moreover, they often don’t use a general high-level knowledge base for grounding the acquired knowledge. In this contexts, the use of semantics technologies, such as ontologies, is mostly employed for action-oriented tasks. In this article we propose an extension of a novel approach for knowledge acquisition based on a general semantic knowledge-base and the fusion of semantics and visual information by means of neural networks and ontologies. The proposed approach has been implemented on a humanoid robotic platform and the experimental results are shown and discussed.},

  abstract     = {The problem of automatic text classification is an essential part of text analysis. The improvement of text classification can be done at different levels such as a preprocessing step, network implementation, etc. In this paper, we focus on how the combination of different methods of text encoding may affect classification accuracy. To do this, we implemented a multi-input neural network that is able to encode input text using several text encoding techniques such as BERT, neural embedding layer, GloVe, skip-thoughts and ParagraphVector. The text can be represented at different levels of tokenised input text such as the sentence level, word level, byte pair encoding level and character level. Experiments were conducted on seven datasets from different language families: English, German, Swedish and Czech. Some of those languages contain agglutinations and grammatical cases. Two out of seven datasets originated from real commercial scenarios: (1) classifying ingredients into their corresponding classes by means of a corpus provided by Northfork; and (2) classifying texts according to the English level of their corresponding writers by means of a corpus provided by ProvenWord. The developed architecture achieves an improvement with different combinations of text encoding techniques depending on the different characteristics of the datasets. Once the best combination of embeddings at different levels was determined, different architectures of multi-input neural networks were compared. The results obtained with the best embedding combination and best neural network architecture were compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The results obtained with the dataset used in the experiments were better than the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Although documents are increasingly multimodal, their automatic processing is often monomodal. In particular, natural language processing tasks are typically performed based on the textual modality only. This work extends the syntactic parsing task to the image modality in addition to text. In particular, we address the prepositional phrase attachment problem, a hard and semantic problem for syntactic parsers. Given an image and a caption, the proposed approach resolves syntactic attachment of prepositions in the parse tree according to both visual and lexical features. Visual features are derived from the nature and position of detected objects in the image that are aligned to textual phrases in the caption. A reranker uses this information to reorder syntactic trees produced by a shift-reduce syntactic parser. Trained on the Flickr-PP corpus which contains multimodal gold-standard attachments, this approach yields improvements over a text-only syntactic parser, in particular for the subset of prepositions that encode location, leading to an increase of up to 17 points of attachment accuracy.},

Although melanoma is the best-known type of skin cancer, there are other pathologies that are the cause of many death in recent years. The lack of large datasets is one of the main difficulties to develop a reliable automatic classification system. This paper presents a deep learning framework for skin cancer detection. Transfer learning was applied to five state-of-art convolutional neural networks to create both a plain and a hierarchical (with 2 levels) classifiers that are capable to distinguish between seven types of moles. The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of dermatoscopic images, were used for experiments, with the help of data augmentation techniques to improve performance. Results demonstrate that the DenseNet201 network is suitable for this task, achieving high classification accuracies and F-measures with lower false negatives. The plain model performed better than the 2-levels model, although the first level, i.e. a binary classification, between nevi and non-nevi yielded the best outcomes.},

First, by selecting a projective matrix, the error system is obtained and an event-based projective synchronization control policy is proposed to realize the projective synchronization between two complex networks with different dimensions. It is revealed that the projective synchronization problem can be transformed into the optimal regulation of the error system with a performance function. Then, a data-driven control scheme is proposed to implement the event-trigged projective synchronization control policy, which is composed of identifier, critic network and actuator. The identifier is applied to estimate the unknown dynamics. The actuator is employed to construct the control inputs and the optimal value is estimated by the critic network. Both actuator and critic network are based on neural networks. The neural network weights and controller are updated at event-triggered instant so that the computing and communication resources can be saved. By employing appropriate event-triggered threshold and learning rate of neural network, the synchronization error is proved to be be asymptotically approaching zero and the Zeno behaviors are excluded. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the increasing complexity and operational productivity of industrial processes, the need for efficient modeling schemes for industrial systems is highly demanded. This study presents a new simulator model for a real winding process based on a combination of Multi-gene Genetic Programming (MGP) and Capuchin Search Algorithm (CapSA), referred to as MGP-CapSA modeling approach. CapSA is a meta-heuristic algorithm used to optimize the coefficients of the regression equations of the MGP technique. The winding process has tensions in the web between reels 1 and 2 and between reels 2 and 3. On this basis, two mathematical models were developed by the MGP-CapSA method to estimate the tensions in the web for this process. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed MGP-CapSA method were verified by extensive experiments and hypothesis testing, and the proposed method was then compared with other well-known intelligent and conventional modeling methods. The proposed MGP-CapSA method can be exploited to enhance control performance and achieve robust fault-tolerant system. A comparison of the MGP-CapSA method with other promising modeling methods corroborates the performance level of MGP-CapSA over those competitors. The results demonstrate that MGP-CapSA is a suitable method for generating robust models for complex nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {Recently, multi-scale feature fusion has been considered as one of the most important issues in designing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing methods directly add the corresponding layers together without considering the semantic gaps between them, which may lead to inadequately feature fusion results. In this paper, we propose an attention refined network (HR-ARNet) to enhance multi-scale feature fusion for human pose estimation. The HR-ARNet employs channel and spatial attention mechanisms to reinforce important features and suppress unnecessary ones. To tackle the problem of inconsistent among keypoints, we utilize self-attention strategy to model long-range keypoints dependencies. We also propose to use the focus loss, which modifies the commonly used square error loss function to let it mainly focus on top K ‘hard’ keypoints during training. Focus loss selects ‘hard’ keypoints based on the training loss and only backpropagates the gradients from the selected keypoints. Experiments on human pose estimation benchmark, MPII Human Pose Dataset and COCO Keypoint Dataset, show that our method can boost the performance of state-of-the-art human pose estimation networks including HRNet (high-resolution net) (Sun et al., Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2019).

  abstract     = {Rapid developments in processors and radio technology have led to the emergence of small sensor nodes capable of communicating in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Nodes in WSN transmit data using multi-hop routing and based on cooperation with each other. This collaboration has made these types of networks vulnerable to many attacks. In order to determine the reliability of nodes in separating malicious nodes from other nodes, an intelligent trust management scheme must be used. In recent years, trust-based routing protocols and opportunistic routing have become important tools to increase WSN security and performance. In this paper, an energy-aware trust and opportunity-based routing (ETOR) algorithm is proposed with respect to a novel hybrid fitness function. This algorithm has two main steps: one is to select secure nodes based on tolerance constant and the other is to select opportunistic nodes from secure nodes to perform routing. ETOR uses the multipath routes technique with an intra-cluster and inter-cluster multi-hop communication mechanism. In addition, the optimal and secure route is selected based on a novel hybrid fitness function with the parameters of energy, trust, QoS, connectivity, distance, hop-count and network traffic. The simulation was performed by MATLAB based on evaluation criteria such as throughput, delay, detection rate, NRL, distance, energy, packet delivery ratio and network lifetime in the presence of DoS attack. The experimental results show that the evaluation criteria in ETOR have improved compared to other secure routing algorithms. In addition, the ETOR algorithm provides more optimal routes for the effective transmission than its untrusted version, i.e. the energy-aware opportunity based routing.},

Generating high-quality proposals is a key step in temporal action detection. A high-quality proposal usually contains two main characteristics. One is the temporal overlaps between proposals and action instances should be as large as possible. The another one is the number of generated proposals should be as few as possible. Inspired by the similarity comparison in face recognition and the similarity of action in same action segment, we design a module to compare the similarity for visual features extracted from visual feature encoder. We find out time points where the similarity of features changes shapely to generate candidate proposals. Then, we train a classifier to evaluate the candidate proposals whether contains or not contains action instances. The experiments suggest that our method outperforms other temporal action proposal generation methods in THUMOS-14 dataset and ActivityNet-v1.3 dataset. In addition, our method still outperforms other methods when using different visual features extracted from different networks.},

Different from traditional algorithms, the newly proposed algorithm can extract not only the principal singular vectors but also the corresponding principal singular values. First, a dynamical system is obtained from the gradient flow, which is obtained from optimization of a novel information criterion. Then, based on the dynamical system, a stable neural network algorithm, which can extract the left and right principal singular vectors, is obtained. Moreover, by satisfying orthogonality instead of orthonormality, we are able to extract the normalization scale factor as the corresponding singular value. In this case, the principal singular triplet (principal singular vectors and the corresponding singular value) of the cross-correlation matrix can be extracted by using the proposed algorithm. What’s more, the proposed algorithm can also be used for multiple PSTs extraction on the basis of sequential method. Then, convergence analysis shows that the proposed algorithm converges to the stable equilibrium point with probability 1. Last, experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is fast and stable in convergence, and can also extract multiple PSTs efficiently.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposed a coupled model of effective feature extraction and optimized classifier, which can overcome the existing problems of coal and gas outbursts classification in the literatures. Firstly, we support the use of kernel principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis methods to extract linear and nonlinear feature information from coal and gas outbursts influencing factors. Secondly, in order to realize the complementarity and correlation between coal and gas outbursts influencing factors, we perform parallel feature fusion to combine the extracted linear and nonlinear feature information. Thirdly, an improved classifier called BO–MKRVM has been proposed that combines mixed kernel relevance vector machine (MKRVM) and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to predict coal and gas outbursts according to the extracted features. In BO–MKRVM model, an effective mixed kernel function which combines Gaussian kernel function and Sigmoid kernel function is proposed to improve the learning and generalization ability of the MKRVM classifier, then the BO and tenfold cross-validation are utilized to optimize kernel parameters and weight coefficients of MKRVM with strong global and local search capability, the proposed BO–MKRVM classifier is performed on coal and gas outbursts dataset. Compared with the single feature extraction method, the combination of linear and non-linear feature extraction methods can obtain complete feature information and contribute to the classification performance of outbursts. The mixed kernel function considers the characteristics of coal and gas outbursts sample data, which can also effectively improve the outbursts accuracy. After the MKRVM classifier is optimized by BO algorithm, the BO–MKRVM classifier has better fitting effect and generalization ability, and obtains higher accuracy with a lower time. The experimental results are obviously better than those of other classification models, which further verifies the applicability of the proposed coupled model.},

In multi-object tracking field,the main strategy is tracking-by-detection. Although the detection based tracking method can get great results, it is relies on the performance of the detector. In complex scene, detector can not provide reliable results. Moreover,due to the incorrect detection results, data association process can not be trusted. Based on this motivation, this paper focuses on improving the accuracy of detection and data association. We introduce the efficient channel attention module to the backbone network, which can adaptively extract important information in images. Furthermore, we apply switchable atrous convolution in the network to dynamically adjust the receptive field according to object changes. In data association process, the appearance features with minimum occlusion are saved for each existing trajectory, which are used for re-associate after the objects are lost. Extensive experiments on MOT16,MOT17 and MOT20 challenging datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable with the state-of-the-art multi-object tracking methods.},

The 3D convolution provides spatial and temporal invariance to restore the foreground of frames, while the 2D convolution is sufficient to deal with spatial features, given a relatively consistant background. Thus, our model takes advantage of the great processing power of the 3D stream to handle the foreground which usually contains more dynamical motion blur, and the advantage of the simplicity of the 2D stream to handle the mostly consistent background. We have the full advantage of combining both the 3D convolution and the 2D convolution. Then we take the two-stream model as the generator and adopt the adversarial learning. We test our model on the VideoDeblurring and GOPRO datasets, and compare with other methods which we have listed. Our method outperforms others in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), especially shows a good performance handling the foreground with obvious motion blur.},

Although many types of research have been conducted in this area, the use of their results in the diagnosis of prostate cancer is yet to be properly carried out. In this paper, a Data, Detection, and View (DDV) taxonomy is introduced that defines each major component, which is required to implement a proper deep learning prostate cancer detection system. The proposed taxonomy is a step toward developing a way to assist the pathologists for early detecting prostate cancer and hence facilitating the patients to seek speedy counseling from the doctors. If the diagnosis of cancer can be performed in the early stages then it can be prevented from spreading to other cells. The components of the proposed taxonomy must be reviewed and used as an evaluation and validation criteria for approving the deep learning classification model to be used in real-world clinical practices. Through the study of 22 state-of-the-art research papers in the field of deep learning-based prostate cancer classification system, we proved the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DDV taxonomy system.},

We considered three MRI scan groups (patients with AD dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (NC)). We developed a three-binary classification task (AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and NC vs. MCI) for the AD classification tasks. Specifically, an unsupervised convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is pre-trained on the MRI scans. Finally, a supervised deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the output of the SNN for the classification tasks. Experiments are performed using the Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and promising results are obtained for the AD classification tasks. We present our proposed model results for both the unsupervised spike pre-training technique and the case where the pre-training technique was not considered, thus serving as a baseline. The accuracy of the proposed model with spike pre-training techniques for the three-binary classification are 90.15%, 87.30%, and 83.90%, respectively, and the accuracy of the model without the spike are 86.90%, 83.25%, and 76.70%, respectively, with a noticeable increase in accuracy and thus, reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also evaluated the robustness of our proposed approach by running experiment on six baseline methods using our preprocessed MRI scans. Our model outperformed almost all the comparable methods due to the robust discriminative capability of the SNN in extracting relevant AD features for the AD classification task.},

  abstract     = {A set of coupled Kuramoto oscillators is the main applied model for harmonization study of oscillating phenomena in physical, biological and engineering networks. In line with the previous studies and to bring the analytical results into conformity with further realistic models, in present paper the synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators has been investigated and the necessary and sufficient conditions for the frequency synchronization and phase cohesiveness have been introduced using the contraction property. The novelty of this paper lies in the following: (I) we consider the heterogeneous second-order model with non-uniformity in coupling topology; (II) we apply a non-zero and non-uniform phase shift in coupling function; (III) we introduce a new Lyapunov-based stability analysis technique. We demonstrate how the heterogeneity in network and the phase shift in coupling function are the key factors in network synchronization. The synchronization conditions are presented on the basis of network graph-theoretical characteristics and the oscillators’ parameters. Investigation of the analytical results reveals that an increase in the phase shift and heterogeneity of oscillators will complicate the synchronization conditions. The validity of the main theoretical results has been confirmed through the numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {The symptoms of cancer normally appear only in the advanced stages, so it is very hard to detect resulting in a high mortality rate among the other types of cancers. Thus, there is a need for early prediction of lung cancer for the purpose of diagnosing and this can result in better chances of it being able to be treated successfully. Histopathology images of lung scan can be used for classification of lung cancer using image processing methods. The features from lung images are extracted and employed in the system for prediction. Grey level co-occurrence matrix along with the methods of Gabor filter feature extraction are employed in this investigation. Another important step in enhancing the classification is feature selection that tends to provide significant features that helps differentiating between various classes in an accurate and efficient manner. Thus, optimal feature subsets can significantly improve the performance of the classifiers. In this work, a novel algorithm of feature selection that is wrapper-based is proposed by employing the modified stochastic diffusion search (SDS) algorithm. The SDS, will benefit from the direct communication of agents in order to identify optimal feature subsets. The neural network, Naïve Bayes and the decision tree have been used for classification. The results of the experiment prove that the proposed method is capable of achieving better levels of performance compared to existing methods like minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and correlation-based feature selection.},

Next, the labeled training set is sampled to multiple subsets and they generate multiple classifiers to predict the filtered unlabeled sample respectively. The predicted label is formed by multiple classifiers with weighted voting mechanism, and the weight of classifier is changing constantly according to the correctness of the prediction for unlabeled samples by classifier. Then, security verification is carried out to ensure that the classifier evolves in the direction of error reduction when the new sample is added. Only the label making classifiers error lower and having the same predictive value with the three classifiers in security verification is added into the labeled set to expand the number of labeled sets. Finally, the algorithm iterates until the unlabeled sample set is empty. The experiment is carried out on the UCI data set and the result shows that the proposed S3C-MC has good safety and has a higher classification rate.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of Internet information technology, image data is explosively growing. How to quickly and effectively acquire and manage these image information has become a research hotspot in the computer field. It is precisely because images can display information intuitively, and people can get the information they need directly from images. Therefore, people are more accustomed to using images as a more commonly used medium to replace large amounts of text to convey information, which is also the main reason for the rapid growth of image information. In the face of such vast image data, if it can not be used reasonably and fully, it is obviously a great waste of resources. If we want to make full use of these resources, we need to organize and manage them effectively. The research of image classification involves many interdisciplinary disciplines such as mathematics, biology, medicine, pattern recognition, machine learning, artificial intelligence and so on. Its development has gone through many stages. Recently, the hot research on deep learning methods has brought new opportunities to image classification. In this paper, a meta-learning framework based on multi-intelligent nervous system is proposed for image classification and recognition. We integrate the multiple-capsule intelligent neural systems to construct the efficient model. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher image recognition rate.},

It contains four phases, (1) Noise evacuation (2) Attribute extraction and selection (3) Classification and (4) Segmentation. Initially, the procured image is denoised utilizing wiener filter, and then the significant GLCM attributes are extricated from the images. Then Deep Learning based classification has been performed to classify the abnormal images from the normal images. Finally, it is processed through the Fuzzy K-Means algorithm to segment the tumor region separately.

  abstract     = {Image recognition technology is one of the important research topics in the field of computer vision, which has been widely used in face recognition, aircraft recognition and unmanned driving. As an important research field of computer vision, image target recognition mainly uses the computer to extract the feature information of the target from the acquired image, transforms the content of the image into the feature expression that can be processed by the computer, and classifies the target objects in the image through the appropriate classification algorithm. Compared with traditional image recognition methods, deep learning can learn more complex knowledge. The excellent deep network model can extract the most useful information from the training data, play a good role in generalization, and has a stronger ability to predict the unknown data. For image classification and image recognition, convolutional neural network layer is used to extract image features. The complex network can make large-scale image classification possible. Combined with the specially designed network structure, the target in the image can be located. In this paper, a medical burn image recognition system is constructed by using convolutional neural network technology and deep learning. The proposed model has better robustness compared with existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In today’s industrial production process, in order to keep the product quality unchanged or improve and keep the production operation in a continuous and stable state, the real-time monitoring of process variables of product quality becomes more and more important. Although the development of measurement technology makes the previously unmeasurable variables become measurable, some key quality variables are still difficult to meet the requirements of real-time measurement due to the bad measurement environment, high cost of instruments and the time lag caused by assay. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a processor to predict the reliability of complex and changeable state information, keep the reliable and useful state information, and realize the reliability measurement of state information, so as to provide people with targeted guidance and help. The information content in digital image is divided into perceptual content and semantic content. Perceptual content includes color, shape, texture, frequency, material and time-domain change; semantic content includes target, event and its relationship. Text is a special target which contains rich semantic information. Text analysis is the key clue to describe and understand the content of scene.

  abstract     = {People give more importance concerning the overall quality of the modernized ecosystem. The pollution of air is one of the significant problems to be resolved as it restricted the ecological transformation of the modernized ecosystem. Therefore, it is fundamental to evaluate the implication of these ecological issues to enhance the urban ecosystem. This vital purpose of this research is to propose a canonical correlation analysis based hyper basis feedforward neural network classification (CCA-HBFNNC) model for evaluating sustainable urban environmental quality. The CCA-HBFNNC model initially acquires a large size of U.S. air pollution dataset as input. Then, a canonical correlative analysis based feature selection algorithm is applied in the CCA-HBFNNC model to select the key pollutant features, which bear fundamental implications to the modernize air pollution to maintain the level of urban sustainability. After the feature selection process, the CCA-HBFNNC model applies the HYPER BASIS FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFICATION (HBFNNC) algorithm in order to classify input air data based on chosen pollutants features. During the classification process, the HBFNNC algorithm used three critical layers namely hidden, output and input layers for efficiently categorizing each input data as higher or lower pollution level with higher accuracy. If the level of air pollution on the urban environment is higher, finally CCA-HBFNNC model significantly reduces the pollution level. In this way, the CCA-HBFNNC model attains improved urban sustainability levels when compared to sophisticated operation. An experimental evaluation of the CCA-HBFNNC model is determined in terms of CCA-HBFNNC model, time complexity and false-positive rate in consideration of the diversified number of air data retrieved from the big data sets. An investigational result shows that the proposed CCA-HBFNNC model can increases the sustainability level and minimizes the time complexity of urban development when contrasted with contemporary works.},

This paper proposes a novel tracking framework based on a full convolutional auto-encoder appearance model, which is trained by using Wasserstein distance and maximum mean discrepancy . Compared with previous works, the proposed framework has better performance in three aspects, including appearance model, update scheme, and state estimation. To address the issues of the original update scheme including poor discriminant performance under limited supervisory information, sample pollution caused by long term object occlusion, and sample importance unbalance, in this paper, a novel latent space importance weighting algorithm, a novel sample space management algorithm, and a novel IOU-based label smoothing algorithm are proposed respectively. Besides, an improved weighted loss function is adopted to address the sample imbalance issue. Finally, to improve the state estimation accuracy, the combination of Kullback-Leibler divergence and generalized intersection over union is introduced. Extensive experiments are performed on the three widely used benchmarks, and the results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

Our proposed new method noise removal isomap with a classification (NRIC), is based on the local tangent space alignment (LTSA) algorithm with classification techniques to remove noises and optimize neighborhood structure Isomap. The primary purpose of the NRIC is to increase efficiency, reduce noise, and improve the performance of the graph. Experiments on the real-world datasets have shown that the NRIC method outperforms efficiently and maintains an accurate low dimensional representation of the noisy nonlinear manifold learning data. The results show that LTSA with classification techniques provides high accuracy, mean-precision, mean-recall, and areas under the (ROC) curve (AUC) of the high dimensional datasets and optimizes the graphs.},

Secondly, combine them into a new multi-dimensional signal and solve its correlation matrix, and use singular value decomposition to obtain the eigenvalues of the matrix, and then use it to estimate the source number. Thirdly, select those IMFs whose correlation coefficients with the observed signal are bigger and regard them together with the original signal after denoising as new observed signals. Finally, recover the source signals by fast independent component analysis (Fast-ICA).

The key component of our correspondence scheme is a deformation energy that penalizes geometric distortion, encourages structure preservation and simultaneously allows mesh topology changes. To ensure the design of wavelet neural network architecture, an optimization algorithm should be applied to estimate and optimize the network parameters. Therefore, we compare our approach of 3d mesh deformation using MMWNN architecture based on genetic algorithm and our approach relying on Levenberg-Marquardt Method.

  abstract     = {Symbolic regression is to search the space of mathematical expressions to find a model that best fits a given dataset. As genetic programming (GP) with the tree representation can represent solutions as expression trees, it is popularly-used for regression. However, GP tends to evolve unnecessarily large programs (known as bloat), causing excessive use of CPU time/memory and evolving solutions with poor generalization ability. Moreover, even though the importance of local search has been proved in augmenting the search ability of GP (termed as memetic algorithms), local search is underused in GP-based methods. This work aims to handle the above problems simultaneously. To control bloat, a multi-objective (MO) technique (NSGA-II, Non-dominant Sorting Genetic Algorithm) is selected to incorporate with GP, forming a multi-objective GP (MOGP). Moreover, three mutation-based local search operators are designed and incorporated with MOGP respectively to form three multi-objective memetic algorithms (MOMA), i.e. MOMA_MR (MOMA with Mutation-based Random search), MOMA_MF (MOMA with Mutation-based Function search) and MOMA_MC (MOMA with Mutation-based Constant search). The proposed methods are tested on both benchmark functions and real-world applications, and are compared with both GP-based (i.e. GP and MOGP) and nonGP-based symbolic regression methods. Compared with GP-based methods, the proposed methods can reduce the risk of bloat with the evolved solutions significantly smaller than GP solutions, and the local search strategies introduced in the proposed methods can improve their search ability with the evolved solutions dominating MOGP solutions. In addition, among the three proposed methods, MOMA_MR performs best in RMSE for testing, yet it consumes more training time than others. Moreover, compared with six reference nonGP-based symbolic regression methods, MOMA_MR generally performs better than or similar to them consistently.},

A dynamic model of master-slave neural networks is established, which contains time-varying delays and Lévy noises. The main purpose is to enable the slave system to follow the master system under the condition of limited communication capacity. Both the master system and the slave system are affected by random noises. Some sufficient conditions are given by means of linear matrix inequality methods which are established by applying Lyapunov functional together with the generalized Dynkin’s formula. Furthermore, a discrete event-triggered control is adopted in master-slave systems, which not only reduces the transmission resources but also avoids the Zeno phenomenon. At last, a numerical example is provided to verify the usefulness of judgment conditions in this study.},

We analyze that this is due to the training problem caused by the unbalanced distribution of edge and non-edge pixels. We propose to use residual connections to solve the class-imbalanced training problem in edge samples. Moreover, we introduce a new biased cross-entropy loss function to better train the edge detection network, which will adjust the weights according to the ratio of edges and non-edges pixels. Compared to other methods, our method predicts clearer and crisp edges. We set up multiple long and short residual connections in the network to establish various information propagation pathways. This makes the final prediction of our method not only with contour information but also have rich details. We evaluated our method on the BSDS500 and NYUD datasets and showed promising results.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the vector of locally aggregated descriptor (VLAD) has shown its great effectiveness in diverse computer vision tasks including image retrieval, Scene classification, and action recognition. Its great success stems from its powerful representation ability and computational efficiency. However, it remains unclear about its theoretical foundation and how it is connected to basic while important algorithms, e.g., the bag-of-words model and match kernels, and how its performance is affected by parameter configurations, e.g., normalization and pooling, which are also widely used in state-of-the-art algorithms based on local features. In this paper, with an aim to achieve the full capacity of VLAD, we conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study from both theoretical analysis and experimental practice perspectives. As a theoretical contribution, we provide a new formulation of VLAD via match kernels, which serves to connect VLAD with existing important encoding methods based on local features. As a contribution to the practical use of VLAD, we comprehensively investigate the roles and effects of the two widely-used operations in local feature encoding: normalization and pooling. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first comprehensive study on VLAD, which will not only enable a full understanding of it but also provide an important guidance for state-of-the-art algorithms based on local features. We have conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: Scene-15, Caltech 101 and PPMI for both image classification and action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Many classical feature extraction and dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as linear algorithm principal component analysis (PCA) and nonlinear algorithm local linear embedding (LLE), have been applied to face recognition. As we all know, PCA is a global algorithm and LLE is a local algorithm. However, PCA cannot obtain the local structure of high-dimensional spatial data samples, and LLE cannot obtain the global structure of high-dimensional spatial data samples. The application effect of these algorithms is not ideal, especially when they are always affected by overlapping points (outliers) and sparse points in the data. To solve these problems, the paper proposes a new effective feature extraction and dimension reduction algorithm called sparse fuzzy difference embedding (SFDE). Firstly, SFDE algorithm tries to search an optimal projection mapping matrix, which can affect not only the local of the fuzzy local minimizing embedding obtained by LLE but also the global of the fuzzy global maximizing variance obtained by PCA. Secondly, SFDE algorithm obtains the sparse transformation matrix by using the lasso regression return. This feature makes SFDE more intuitive and powerful than PCA, LLE, and other algorithms. Finally, we estimated the proposed algorithm through experiments in Yale and AR standard face databases and added the density of “salt and pepper” noise to the Yale and AR databases to verify the robustness of SFDE algorithm. The experimental results of the SFDE algorithm were better than those of the LDA, PCA, LLE, sparse differential embedding (SDE), and fuzzy local graph embedding based on maximum margin criterion algorithms because of its sparsity and fuzzy set, which also indicates that the SFDE algorithm is an effective algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Document-level sentiment classification is dedicated to predicting the sentiment polarity of document-level reviews posted by users about products and services. Many methods use neural networks have achieved very successful results on sentiment classification tasks. These methods usually focus on mining useful information from the text of the review documents. However, they ignore the importance of users’ review habits. The reviews posted by the same user when commenting on different products contain similar review habits, and reviews that contain highly similar review habits often have similar sentiment ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel sentiment classification algorithm that utilizes user’s review habits to enhance hierarchical neural networks, namely as HUSN. Firstly, we divide the reviews in the training set according to the users. All the reviews of each user are aggregated together and called the historical reviews of this user. Secondly, the target review in the test set and its multiple historical reviews in the training set are sent to the Long Short-Term Memory based hierarchical neural network to obtain the corresponding review document representations containing the user’s review habits. Finally, we calculate the similarities between the target review document representation and multiple historical review document representations. The higher the similarity, the closer the review habits of different reviews from the same user, and the closer the corresponding sentiment ratings. Experimental results show that the similarities between the review habits of different reviews from the same user can further improve the performance of document-level sentiment classification. The HUSN algorithm performs better than all baseline methods on three publicly available document-level review datasets.},

Active learning paradigm seeks to handle this problem by identifying the most informative examples from the unlabeled examples to label. In this paper, we present two novel active learning approaches based on non-parallel support vector machines and twin support vector machines which adopt the margin sampling method and the manifold-preserving graph reduction algorithm to select the most informative examples. The manifold-preserving graph reduction is a sparse subset selecting algorithm which exploits the structural space connectivity and spatial diversity among examples. In each iteration, an active learner draws the informative and representative candidates from the subset instead of the whole unlabeled data. This strategy can keep the manifold structure and reduce noisy points and outliers in the whole unlabeled data. Experimental results on multiple datasets validate the effective performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble approaches introduced in the Extreme Learning Machine literature mainly come from methods that rely on data sampling procedures, under the assumption that the training data are heterogeneously enough to set up diverse base learners. To overcome this assumption, it was proposed an ELM ensemble method based on the Negative Correlation Learning framework, called Negative Correlation Extreme Learning Machine (NCELM). This model works in two stages: (i) different ELMs are generated as base learners with random weights in the hidden layer, and (ii) a NCL penalty term with the information of the ensemble prediction is introduced in each ELM minimization problem, updating the base learners, (iii) second step is iterated until the ensemble converges. Although this NCL ensemble method was validated by an experimental study with multiple benchmark datasets, no information was given on the conditions about this convergence. This paper mathematically presents sufficient conditions to guarantee the global convergence of NCELM. The update of the ensemble in each iteration is defined as a contraction mapping function, and through Banach theorem, global convergence of the ensemble is proved.},

How to enhance the discriminability of $$l _2$$ norm regularization-based representation method is a meaningful work. In this paper, we put forward a novel $$l _2$$ norm regularization-based representation method, called Weighted Discriminative Sparse Representation for Classification (WDSRC), in which we consider the global discriminability and the local discriminability using two discriminative regularization terms of representation. The global discriminability is obtained by decorrelating the representation results stemming from all distinct classes. The local discriminability is achieved by the weighted representation in which the representation coefficient of the training images dissimilar to the test image will be reduced and the representation coefficient of the training images similar to the test image will be increased, which restrains the training images dissimilar to the test image and promotes the training images similar to the test image as much as possible in representing the test sample. By considering the global and local discriminability of representations simultaneously, the proposed WDSRC method can gain more discriminative representation for classification. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of object, face, action and flower demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WDSRC method.},

  abstract     = {A competitor analysis is a core process in management decision making, and the extraction of competitive factors is a key component in a competitor analysis. Owing to the rapid development of social media, methodologies and frameworks facilitating a competitor analysis through online reviews have recently been proposed. However, existing studies have only focused on the detection of comparative sentences in review comments. Thus, product developers compare the competitive factors only within identical feature dimensions of a product. This study proposes a novel approach to identifying the competitive factors at the comprehensive level of the product features—in other words, the focus is on the points of differentiation of each product as perceived by customers using an explainable neural network. We assume that keywords, which have a significant influence on the classification decision, are considered meaningful points of differentiation by consumers. Thus, we establish a classification model to classify the review comments for each corresponding product and calculate the weight of importance of each keyword in such comments during the classification process. We then extract and prioritize the keywords to determine the competitiveness based on the weight of importance. The experiment results show that our proposed method effectively extracts the competitive factors in both qualitative and quantitative experiments. This is the first study on extracting competitive factors with an explainable neural network based on customer reviews; future studies may extend the scope of the extraction of such factors using an explainable neural network.},

To implement this active learning algorithm, the proposed method uses reinforcement learning based on deep neural networks as as a pre-trained acquisition function tailored for the fixed budget situation. By using the pre-trained deep Q-learning-based acquisition function, we can realize the active learner which selects a sample for annotation from the pool of unlabeled samples taking the fixed-budget situation into account. The proposed method is experimentally shown to be comparable with or superior to existing active learning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the fixed-budget active learning.},

  abstract     = {Current detection networks usually struggle to detect small-scale object instances due to spatial information loss and lack of semantics. In this paper, we propose a one-stage detector named LocalNet, which pays specific attention to the detailed information modeling. LocalNet is built upon our redesigned detection-oriented backbone called long neck ResNet, which aims to preserve more detailed information in the early stage to enhance the representation of small objects. Furthermore, to enhance the semantics in the detection layers, we propose a local detail-context module, which reintroduces the detailed information lost in the network and exploits the local context within a restricted receptive field range. Moreover, we explore a method for training detectors nearly or totally from scratch, which provides the potential to design network structures with more freedom. With nearly $$94\%$$ of the pretrained parameters randomly reinitialized in the backbone, our model improves the mAP of our baseline model from 75.0 to $$82.3\%$$ on the PASCAL VOC dataset with an input size of $$300\times 300$$ and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Even when trained from scratch, our model achieves $$80.8\%$$ mAP, which is $$5.8\%$$ greater than the mAP of our baseline model with a fully pretrained backbone.},

  abstract     = {Although research on outlier detection methods has been an investigation area for long, few of those studies relate to an Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Several critical decisions taken on daily business operations depend on various data collected over time. Therefore, it is mandatory to guarantee its correctness, integrity, and accuracy before any further processing can commence. Outliers are often assumed to be Error by most algorithms in the past, which is always attributed to faulty sensors. Hence, this assumption has been investigated and results show that outliers can be classified into Error and Event types with the support of a Non-parametric sequence-based learning algorithm. The event type outlier is majorly caused by abnormality from sensor readings, which are very important and should not be ignored. However, the non-parametric sequence approach and other existing techniques still find it elusive to detect outliers in the global search space of a large dataset. Therefore, this paper proposes an Enhanced Non-parametric sequence learning algorithm based on Ensemble Clustering Techniques to detect Event and Error outliers in large datasets. Experiments are conducted on six different datasets from the UCL repository, except one collected from a laboratory testbed, to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach over the existing techniques. The results show a remarkable performance rate of 96.653% accuracy, 94.284% precision, and 98.112% for Error outlier detection. It also performs better in Event outlier detection with 87.611% accuracy, 71.141% precision and 85.755% specificity with 1291 s execution time.},

  abstract     = {Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) are a vital module of many corporate, especially within the online commerce domain, where consumers are provided with recommendations about products potentially relevant for them. A traditional CARS, which utilizes deep learning models considers that user’s preferences can be predicted by ratings, reviews, demographics, etc. However, the feedback given by the users is often conflicting when comparing the rating score and the sentiment behind the reviews. Therefore, a model that utilizes either ratings or reviews for predicting items for top-N recommendation may generate unsatisfactory recommendations in many cases. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes an effective context-specific sentiment based stacked autoencoder (CSSAE) to learn the concrete preference of the user by merging the rating and reviews for a context-specific item into a stacked autoencoder. Hence, the user&#39;s preferences are consistently predicted to enhance the Top-N recommendation quality, by adapting the recommended list to the exact context where an active user is operating. Experiments on four Amazon (5-core) datasets demonstrated that the proposed CSSAE model persistently outperforms state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods on various effectiveness metrics.},

Besides, both the number of controlled molecules and the impulsive strength of the presented control scheme are mode-dependent, either identical or different with respect to different topologies. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and comparison principle, the sufficient criteria for guaranteeing the exponential synchronization of genetic oscillator networks with finite arbitrarily switching topologies are established.

However, due to the time dependence, object correlation and Display Constraint, there are few methods for solving such problem properly. In this paper, we defined the problem of multi-object spatial–temporal anomaly detection with Display Constraint in detail. To address this problem, we proposed a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based framework. First, we proposed a Display Constraint Graph to represent location relationship and designed an LSTM framework to calculate the reconstruction error. Then we used the DCG based anomaly score to discriminate abnormal subsequences and objects. We applied this method to 18 MOBA game data streams, and achieved better results than traditional methods.},

Traditional approaches like Granger causality or transfer entropy fail to capture all the interdependence of the statistic moments, which might lead to wrong causal conclusions. In the previous papers (Chen et al. in 25th international conference, ICONIP 2018, Siem Reap, Cambodia, proceedings, Part II, 2018), the authors proposed a novel definition of Wiener causality for measuring the intervene between time series based on relative entropy, providing an integrated description of statistic causal intervene. In this work, we show that relative entropy is a special case of an existing more general divergence estimation. We argue that any Bregman divergences can be used for detecting the causal relations and in theory remedies the information dropout problem. We discuss the benefits of various choices of divergence functions on causal inferring and the quality of the obtained causal models. As a byproduct, we also obtain the robustness analysis and elucidate that RE causality achieves a faster convergence rate among BD causalities. To substantiate our claims, we provide experimental evidence on how BD causalities improve detection accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic computing using analog non-volatile memory (NVM) devices has been the subject of various studies due to its potential ability to achieve extremely low power consumption less than that of traditional von Neumann architecture. However, using NVM devices, such as phase change memory (PCM) and resistive-RAM devices, presents various challenges, such as limitations in the number of conductance steps and device variability resulting from process variation and electro/thermo-dynamics. Limitations in the number of conductance steps and device variability could reduce the accuracy of neural network training. It is necessary to quantitatively analyze the effect of the number of conductance steps and synaptic device variability on the accuracy of neural network training and assess requirements for NVM devices to make NVM-based neuromorphic computing successful. We conducted the analysis using simulations focusing on a spiking neural network (SNN) based restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) with PCM devices using the PCM-refresh method. The results of our quantitative simulation, which used the MNIST dataset, showed that having more than 500 conductance steps achieves comparable performance to that when there are more than 1000 conductance steps. We also found that less than 10% conductance update variation in the synaptic devices is required to achieve the comparable accuracy with the no variation case. These results can provide guidelines for designing and optimizing a synaptic device for realizing NVM-based neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {The global optimization of binary quadratic programming (BQP) has very important theory and wide application in various fields. Since BQP is a classic NP-hard problem, traditional algorithms will be very time-consuming when the dimension is very large. The neural network based algorithms have significant advantages in solving large scale optimization problems. However, directly applying neural network based algorithm cannot guarantee finding the global optimal solution of BQP. In this paper, we propose a neural network based algorithm for BQP by analyzing and utilizing geometric characteristics of the objective function isosurface and combining the advantages and properties of neural network as well as branch-and-bound method. Furthermore, the neural network algorithm is implemented with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to take advantage of the parallel structure. System Generator which can be used to convert the design into HDL code automatically is adopted so that the calculation of upper and lower bounds can be deployed to FPGA. The numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. Meanwhile, simulation results show the feasibility of applying the proposed algorithm to FPGA hardware.},

Modeling of electron beam welding is conducted in the present study through Elman and Jordan recurrent neural networks (RNNs), both having a single feed-back loop, to meet the said requirement. The RNNs are trained using some nature-inspired optimization tools, namely cuckoo search, firefly, flower pollination, and crow search utilizing input–output welding data, obtained from a computational fluid dynamics-based heat transfer and fluid flow welding model. RNN predictions are validated through real experiments. Thus, the effect of change in the position of the feed-back loop on the accuracy of prediction of RNNs is investigated. In addition, a few popular statistical tests have been used to evaluate the performances of the RNNs tuned by various optimization algorithms, where flower pollination-tuned Jordan RNN is observed to yield the best results.},

Three tabs called active, oldest, and votes are used by SE to list the users’ answers. The default tab to display the answers is the votes’ tab. The problem with the current listing mechanism of the answer is that newly posted answers are always placed at the bottom of the list because of no votes. To receive the votes from the users, the answer needs to be seen by the user. However, the current mechanism favoring the oldest answers to gain the user’s votes. To resolve this bias, and provide an equal opportunity to all answers, this paper suggested a deep learning-based framework that predicts virtual votes for answers as soon as it is being posted on CQAs. The predicted votes may use to lists the answers on SE. The proposed model helps the users to know how many votes may be received their answer in the future. This also motivates the users to post high-quality answers to receive more votes. The prediction of votes required only the textual content of the answers and hence it is free from the handcrafted feature engineering. To validate the model, three different datasets of the SE are used and found a promising performance on each dataset.},

The second approach is to solve the primal TWSVM, and convert into completely unconstrained minimization problem. Since the objective function is convex, piecewise quadratic but not twice differentiable, we present an efficient algorithm using the generalized Newton’s method termed as GTWSVM.

  abstract     = {Aerial scene classification is a challenging problem in understanding high-resolution remote sensing images. Most recent aerial scene classification approaches are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These CNN models are trained on a large amount of labeled data and the de facto practice is to use RGB patches as input to the networks. However, the importance of color within the deep learning framework is yet to be investigated for aerial scene classification. In this work, we investigate the fusion of several deep color models, trained using color representations, for aerial scene classification. We show that combining several deep color models significantly improves the recognition performance compared to using the RGB network alone. This improvement in classification performance is, however, achieved at the cost of a high-dimensional final image representation. We propose to use an information theoretic compression approach to counter this issue, leading to a compact deep color feature set without any significant loss in accuracy. Comprehensive experiments are performed on five remote sensing scene classification benchmarks: UC-Merced with 21 scene classes, WHU-RS19 with 19 scene types, RSSCN7 with 7 categories, AID with 30 aerial scene classes, and NWPU-RESISC45 with 45 categories. Our results clearly demonstrate that the fusion of deep color features always improves the overall classification performance compared to the standard RGB deep features. On the large-scale NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, our deep color features provide a significant absolute gain of 4.3% over the standard RGB deep features.},

  abstract     = {To enable deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis to achieve excellent performance in differentiating benign and malignant breast tumors in ultrasound images, a large number of labeled training samples must be collected. However, it is difficult to acquire sufficient samples due to the high costs of data collection and labeling. Fortunately, breast ultrasound images have two labels from different sources of domain knowledge: the biopsy results are “clean” labels, and the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score functions as a “noisy” label. Based on these two label types, we propose a multitask classification method based on label distribution correction (MTLC-Net). In our method, we propose different tasks to address the noisy and clean labels. Specifically, we propose a label distribution correction task for noisy labels that includes jointly training the network parameters and soft labels. The model is generalizable and robust by correcting the noisy label distribution based on the BI-RADS score, and it extracts knowledge from the noisy label task to improve the learning in the clean-label task. We conducted extensive comparisons with existing methods. Our method achieved a classification accuracy of 75.8%, a precision of 73.0%, a recall of 80.1% and an F1 score of 0.764—results that are significantly better than those of the existing state-of-the-art methods for differentiating benign and malignant breast tumors in ultrasound images.},

  abstract     = {Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records associated with hospitalization, diagnosis, medications and so on. Secondary use of EHRs can promote the clinical informatics applications and the development of healthcare undertaking. EHRs have the unique characteristic where the patient visits are temporally ordered but the diagnosis codes within a visit are randomly ordered. The hierarchical structure requires a multi-layer network to explore the different relational information of EHRs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Representation Learning method (MLRL), which is capable of learning effective patient representation by hierarchically exploring the valuable information in both diagnosis codes and patient visits. Firstly, MLRL utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to explore the potential connections in diagnosis codes, and a linear transformation is implemented to further map the code vectors to non-negative real-valued representations. The initial visit vectors are then obtained by summarizing all the code representations. Secondly, the proposed method combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with self-attention mechanism to learn the weighted visit vectors which are aggregated to form the patient representation. Finally, to evaluate the performance of MLRL, we apply it to patient’s mortality prediction on real EHRs and the experimental results demonstrate that MLRL has a significant improvement in prediction performance. MLRL achieves around 0.915 in Area Under Curve which is superior to the results obtained by baseline methods. Furthermore, compared with raw data and other data representations, the learned representation with MLRL shows its outstanding results and availability on multiple different classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to find the person across non-overlapping camera views in public places. Existing methods are getting better and better at learning finer pedestrian details, but at the same time they all ignore the relations between these details, which makes some details that are critical to discrimination unable to play a key role in decision-making. To solve this problem, we propose a graph relation learning method for person re-identification. Firstly, we use graph structure to build the relation graph, and then use the weight operation to get the relation vertices that can receive suggestions from other details. Finally, by using the collaborative training scheme to train relation vertices and regional global average features, our model can learn the relation information. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can effectively improve the discriminative ability of the model, enhance the role of neglected important clues in decision-making, and achieve state-of-the-arts performance on the more challenging CUHK03-NP dataset.},

Among them, information bottleneck (IB) theory claims that there are two distinct phases consisting of fitting phase and compression phase in the course of training. This statement attracts many attentions since its success in explaining the inner behavior of feedforward neural networks. In this paper, we employ IB theory to understand the dynamic behavior of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and investigate how the fundamental features such as convolutional layer width, kernel size, network depth, pooling layers and multi-fully connected layer have impact on the performance of CNNs. In particular, through a series of experimental analysis on benchmark of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, we demonstrate that the compression phase is not observed in all these cases. This shows us the CNNs have a rather complicated behavior than feedforward neural networks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a Double Hidden Layer Neural Networks synchronization mechanism using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and mutual learning is used for the development of the cryptographic key exchange protocol. This protocol is used to exchange sensitive information through a public channel. At the time of exchanging sensitive information, an intruder can easily attack the vital information/signals by sniffing, spoofing, phishing, or Man-In-The-Middle attack. There is, however, hardly some investigation to investigate the randomness of the common input vector in the synchronization of two neural networks. This proposed technique provides GAN generated random input vectors for neural synchronization which are very sensitive to the seed value. To enhance the security of the synchronization process, GAN generates the best random sequence of the input vector. Two neural networks use GAN generated input vector and different random weight vector and swap their output. In some steps, it results in complete synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the common learning rule. The synchronized weight vector serves as a session key at the end of the neural synchronization process. An increase in the weight range increases the complexity of a successful attack exponentially but the effort to build the neural key decreases over the polynomial time. The proposed technique offers synchronization and authentication steps in parallel. It is difficult for the attacker to distinguish between synchronization and authentication steps. This proposed technique has been passed through different parametric tests. The results have shown effective and robust potential. Simulations of the process show effectiveness in terms of cited results in the paper.},

To overcome the issue, spatial rough intuitionistic fuzzy C-means method has been proposed. The segmentation of MR brain image has been implemented by updating the MRI based on global spatial information of pixel with intuitionistic fuzzy c-means algorithm for segmenting cerebro spinal fluid, white matter and gray matter tissues. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets and rough sets have been used to deal with uncertainty and vagueness in medical images. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are used for image representations by using non-membership value, hesitation along with the membership value for the MR image. The membership value and non-membership value have been obtained using fuzzy hexagonal membership and fuzzy complement function respectively. Further, roughness measures are done to determine the initial cluster centroids by considering lower and upper approximation and the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm has been updates by the euclidean distance between the pixels based on global spatial information for segmenting MR brain image. The proposed method have been implemented and analysed with quantitative and qualitatively for the synthetic and real MR images. Experimental results exhibit a higher degree of segmentation accuracy on both synthetic and real MR images compared to existing methods and achieves better performance.},

The advancement in sensor technology and the rise of unmanned systems have paved the way for the automated systems. In this work, we propose an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) based livestock detection-counting system for fusion images using restricted supervised learning technique. For image fusion, we propose Dual-scale image Decomposition based Fusion technique (DDF) that fuses visible and thermal images. To reduce the difficulty of ground truth annotation, we introduce Seed Labels focused Object Detector (SLOD) that carefully propagates the annotation to all the object instances in the training images. Further, we propose a novel Restricted Supervised Learning (RSL) technique that produces competitive results with minimal training data. Experimental results show that the proposed RSL is more efficient and accurate when compared to other learning techniques (fully and weakly supervised). On the test data, with only five training images and five seed labels, the restricted supervised learning has improved the average precision from 4.05% (using fully supervised learning) to 80.58% (using restricted supervised learning). With 50 seed labels, the average precision is further boosted to 91.56%. The proposed model is extensively tested on benchmark animal datasets and has achieved an average accuracy of 98.3%.},

  abstract     = {Monocular depth estimation (MDE), which is the task of using a single image to predict scene depths, has gained considerable interest, in large part owing to the popularity of applying deep learning methods to solve “computer vision problems”. Monocular cues provide sufficient data for humans to instantaneously extract an understanding of scene geometries and relative depths, which is evidence of both the processing power of the human visual system and the predictive power of the monocular data. However, developing computational models to predict depth from monocular images remains challenging. Hand-designed MDE features do not perform particularly well, and even current “deep” models are still evolving. Here we propose a novel approach that uses perceptually-relevant natural scene statistics (NSS) features to predict depths from monocular images in a simple, scale-agnostic way that is competitive with state-of-the-art systems. While the statistics of natural photographic images have been successfully used in a variety of image and video processing, analysis, and quality assessment tasks, they have never been applied in a predictive end-to-end deep-learning model for monocular depth. Correspondingly, no previous work has explicitly incorporated perceptual features in a monocular depth-prediction approach. Here we accomplish this by developing a new closed-form bivariate model of image luminances and use features extracted from this model and from other NSS models to drive a novel deep learning framework for predicting depth given a single image.},

Gaussian Process (GP) is a non-parametric Bayesian modeling and can be used to predict the presence of either a single emotion (single-task GP) or multiple emotions (multi-task GP) in natural language text. Employing multiple kernels in GP can enhance the performance of the emotion analysis tasks. The particular choice of kernel functions determines the properties such as smoothness, length scales, sharpness, and amplitude, drawn from the GP prior. Using a specific kernel may be a source of bias and can be avoided by using different kernels together. The default kernel used with GP is a Radial Basis Function (RBF). It is infinitely differentiable; GP with this function has mean square derivatives of all orders and is thus very smooth. The sharpness which occurs in the midst of the smoothness can be detected using the exponential kernel. The multi-layer perceptron kernel has greater generalization for each training example and is good for extrapolation. Our experiments show that, for learning the presence of a single emotion in a natural language sentence (single-task), multiple kernel GP with the sum of RBF and multi-layer perceptron kernels performs better than single kernel GP. Likewise, for learning the presence of several different emotions in a sentence (multi-task), multiple kernel GP with the sum of RBF, exponential and multi-layer perceptron kernels performs better than single kernel GP. Multiple Kernel Gaussian Process also outperforms Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).},

When dealing with quaternion signals, traditional real-valued learning models usually provide only suboptimal solutions compared with their quaternion-valued counterparts. However, online sequential quaternion extreme learning machine (OS-QELM) model is still lacking in literature. To fill this gap, this paper aims to establish a framework for the derivation and the design of OS-QELM. Specifically, we first derive a standard OS-QELM, and then propose two augmented OS-QELM models which can capture the complete second-order statistics of noncircular quaternion signals. The corresponding regularized models and two approaches to reducing the computational complexity are also derived and discussed respectively. Benefiting from the quaternion algebra and the augmented structure, the proposed models exhibit superiority over OS-ELM in simulation results on several benchmark quaternion regression problems and colour face recognition problems.},

Without long-distance axon branches connecting distal neurons, no direct communication is possible. Artificial neural networks have almost entirely ignored axonal growth and pruning, instead relying on implicit assumptions that prioritize dendritic/synaptic learning above all other concerns. This project proposes a new model called the axon game, which allows biologically-inspired axonal plasticity dynamics to be incorporated into most artificial neural network models in a computationally efficient manner. First, we demonstrate that the axon game replicates multiple previously defined pre-synaptic cortical maps. Second, we demonstrate that the axon game integrated with a synaptic learning model similar to the Laterally Interconnected Synergetically Self-Organizing Map (LISSOM), can simulate the interaction of axonal plasticity and synaptic plasticity within one model creating both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic cortical maps. Finally, it is shown that pre-synaptic and post-synaptic maps can be decoupled from one another. This decoupling depends on the relative sizes of dendritic and axonal arbors, and indicates a novel theoretical prediction about how axonal and synaptic dynamics interact.},

  abstract     = {In the existing image captioning methods, masked convolution is usually used to generate language description, and traditional residual network (ResNets) methods used for masked convolution bring about the vanishing gradient problem. To address this issue, we propose a new image captioning framework that combines dense fusion connection (DFC) and improved stacked attention module. DFC uses dense convolutional networks (DenseNets) architecture to connect each layer to any other layer in a feed-forward fashion, then adopts ResNets method to combine features through summation. The improved stacked attention module can capture more fine-grained visual information highly relevant to the word prediction. Finally, we employ the Transformer to the image encoder to sufficiently obtain the attended image representation. The experimental results on MS-COCO dataset demonstrate the proposed model can increase CIDEr score from $$91.2 \%$$ to $$106.1 \%$$ , which has higher performance than the comparable models and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Process monitoring helps to estimate the quality of the end products, equipment health parameters, and operational reliability of chemical processes. This is an area in which data-driven approaches are widely used by academic and industrial practitioners. With the ever-increasing complexities in process industries, there is an increased thrust in developing the process monitoring methods of generic nature which are capable of handling the inherent nonlinear characteristics of the chemical process. This demanded the employment of complex data-driven model paradigms in the process monitoring framework. To circumvent the issues related to high-dimensional process data, a large body of these process monitoring algorithms extract only relevant features during the training. Further, model complexity is another important issue that needs to be accounted while employing these methods. In this work, an optimization-based features selection method for process monitoring is proposed, that simultaneously trades-off between the optimal feature selection and the resulting model complexity, by means of solving a multi-objective optimization problem. Particularly, this paper focuses on combining neural network architecture with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithm to obtain an improved identification accuracy while reducing the number of variables to be measured continuously in the process plant. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated using a basic numerical case and tested upon the operational data collected from the benchmark Tennessee Eastman plant data, and steel plates manufacturing case studies.},

It can be used to detect traces that cannot be directly observed under visible light.Efficient identification and analysis of handprint are conducive to obtaining more information for solving cases. However, due to thermal diffusion, the depth fuzzy feature of infrared handprint is not conducive to detection and classification, and the convolution neural network technology is widely used in the field of natural image classification because of its excellent feature extraction ability.Therefore, aiming at the problem of fuzzy infrared handprint classification, we design a novel convolution neural network, which includes a convolutional layer, small MBConv block and fully connected layer.We choose EfficientNet which is suitable for infrared handprint classification from classical convolution neural network as our basic network. And propose a small MBConv block to improve the network model, so that the network has fewer training parameters, effectively reduces the problem of over fitting, and improves the classification performance compared with the original model.We use our model for the automatic classification of infrared handprint images. The results show that our model achieves the average accuracyto 95.78% for multi-class classification, which is 2.19% higher than the original model.},

  abstract     = {The past few years have witnessed the resurgence of uncertainty estimation generally in neural networks. Providing uncertainty quantification besides the predictive probability is desirable to reflect the degree of belief in the model’s decision about a given input. Recently, Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) method has been introduced as a probabilistic approach based Bayesian approximation which is computationally efficient than Bayesian neural networks. MC-dropout has revealed promising results on image datasets regarding uncertainty quantification. However, this method has been subjected to criticism regarding the behaviour of MC-dropout and what type of uncertainty it actually captures. For this purpose, we aim to discuss the behaviour of MC-dropout on classification tasks using synthetic and real data. We empirically explain different cases of MC-dropout that reflects the relative merits of this method. Our main finding is that MC-dropout captures datapoints lying on the decision boundary between the opposed classes using synthetic data. On the other hand, we apply MC-dropout method on dataset derived from Bitcoin known as Elliptic data to highlight the outperformance of model with MC-dropout over standard model. A conclusion and possible future directions are proposed.},

Despite the multiplicity of researches on the linear discriminative analysis, most of them are sensitive to noise, outliers and the distribution of data, especially in the low sample size context. In this paper, we propose a novel image classification method, namely Margin and Locality Discriminant Projection, which simultaneously considers the margin and locality structure information based on low-rank and sparse representation. Specifically, the proposed method integrates marginal fisher analysis and neighborhood preserving embedding so as to preserve the intrinsic structure as well as enhance the discriminative ability, on account of which a more robust and comprehensive graph can be constructed to obtain sufficiently discriminative features. Meanwhile, the low-rank and sparsity constraints are introduced to compensate the noise. The proposed model can be solved efficiently using the linear alternative direction method with adaptive penalty and eigen-decomposition. Extensive experiments are conducted on four databases and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multimedia data encryption is an ever-growing and challenging domain in the emerging digital world, with image encryption at the forefront to provide privacy for the user’s data. Image encryption aims to generate a stable noisy image irrespective of the input image. The current solution to this communication challenge is to use complex mathematics with a series of algorithms known as public-key cryptography. But the increasing power of computers and the ingenuity of hackers is open up more and more cracks in this mathematical armor. An ideal solution to this problem would provide provable information security, guaranteeing the safety of our personal information. In addition to it, the system must adapt itself to day to day miracles of the real world. Neural assisted techniques are the solutions to satisfy the above-said requirements. Hence, this paper proposes Hopfield neural attractor-assisted image encryption scheme in which combined tent maps are employed for the substitution process. Nowadays, a chosen-plaintext attack is a big challenge for encryption schemes. To resist the chosen plaintext attack, this scheme proposes the higher bitplane confusion using the tent map, which replaces the conventional diffusion process. Besides, the proposed scheme offers desire metrics such as the average correlation of 0.003, entropy as 7.99, and keyspace of 10184.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates mean square stabilization problem of neural networks with weighted try once discard protocol and state observer. In general, sensor nodes access conflict happens frequently in the communication transmission networks. Aiming at this problem, we have adopted weighted try once discard protocol (WTOD) to reduce the occurrence of the conflict, The strategy is applied to discontinuous time systems, and only one node can obtain the access token to update signal transmission for the network. In addition, data transmission in the channel is large -scale and packet loss often occurs . Therefore, we adopt the method of quantized signal to reduce the pressure of channel transmission and ensure the stability of network transmission. As the system state is difficult to obtain, this paper design an observer to estimate the system state, the purpose of this paper is to guarantee the system to achieve the mean square stabilization with bounded output via the action of observer of signal output and controller, then solve the optimization problem of inequality through group of reasonable parameters of the controller and the observer. Finally, an example is given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller and observer.},

This permits to carry out the transformation of the observation space without forgetting what the target is. It has been shown in recent publications that this method produces a clear performance advantage in classification tasks. The above facts motivate to explore whether CMSDAE machines also offer performance improvements in regression problems, and in particular for time series prediction where conventional discriminative machines find difficulties: The layer-by-layer reconstruction of the target (together with the input) can help to reduce these difficulties. This contribution presents the CMSDAE regression/prediction machines and their design, showing experimental evidence of their frequent superior performance —never lower— with respect to other machine architectures.

Different from the exponential convergence conventional zeroing neural network (CZNN), the new FTCZNN adopts a novel design formula for its error matrix converging to zero. Theoretical analysis and proof of the new FTCZNN converges to the theoretical solution of the TVLCME in finite time are provided. For comparison purpose, the CZNN is also developed for solving the same TVLCME.

Secondly, an event-triggered mode-dependent $$H_\infty $$ filter is designed for descriptor Markovian jump system. By considering the network-induced delay and the event-triggered scheme, a delay system method is used to build a novel filtering error system model. By using Lyapunov function technology and free weighting method, the criteria are obtained in terms of LMIs which guarantee the filtering error system to be regular, impulse free and stochastically stable with the $$H_\infty $$ performance. Then, a co-design method is proposed for the designed filter parameters. Finally, a numerical simulation example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness, and by a compared example, we show that the number of transmitted data produced by the proposed neural network event-triggered scheme is less than those produced by traditional event-triggered scheme.},

  abstract     = {Emerging Trends in the use of smart portable accessories, particularly within the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), where smart sensor devices are employed for data gathering, require advancements in energy management mechanisms. This study aims to provide an intelligent energy management mechanism for wearable/portable devices through the use of predictions, monitoring, and analysis of the performance indicators for energy harvesting, majorly focusing on the hybrid PV-wind systems. To design a robust and precise model, prediction algorithms are compared and analysed for an efficient decision support system. Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) prediction algorithms are used to develop a Shallow Neural Network (SNN) for time series prediction. The proposed SNN model uses a closed-loop NARX recurrent dynamic neural network to predict the active power and energy of a hybrid system based on the experimental data of solar irradiation, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, precipitation, ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure collected from Jan 1st 2015 to Dec 26th 2015. The historical hourly metrological data set is established using calibrated sensors deployed at Middle East Technical University (METU), NCC. The accessory considered in this study is called as Smart Umbrella System (SUS), which uses a Raspberry Pi module to fetch the weather data from the current location and store it in the cloud to be processed using SNN classified prediction algorithms. The results obtained show that using the SNN model, it is possible to obtain predictions with 0.004 error rate in a computationally efficient way within 20 s. With the experiments, we are able to observe that for the period of observation, the energy harvested is 178 Wh/d, where the system estimates energy as 176.5 Wh/d, powering the portable accessories accurately.},

However, in deep learning, we are generally facing a very high dimensional feature space. This may lead to overfitting problem which is tried to be prevented by applying regularization techniques. In this framework, the sparse representation based feature selection and regularization methods are very attractive. This is because of the nature of the sparse methods which represent a data with as less as possible non-zero coefficients. In this paper, we utilize a variety of sparse representation based methods for regularizing of deep neural networks. For this purpose, first, the effects of three basic sparsity inducing methods are studied. These are the Least Square Regression, Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) and Correntropy inducing Robust Feature Selection (CRFS) methods. Then, in order to improve the regularization process, three combinations of the basic methods are proposed. This study is performed considering a simple fully connected deep neural network and a VGG-like network. Our experimental results show that, overall, the combined methods outperform the basic ones. Considering two important factors of the amount of induced sparsity and classification accuracy, the combination of the CRFS and SGL methods leads to very successful results in deep neural network.},

Consequently, identifying the correct type and grade of tumor in the early stages has an important role to choose a precise treatment plan. Examining the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the patient’s brain represents an effective technique to distinguish brain tumors. Due to the big amounts of data and the various brain tumor types, the manual technique becomes time-consuming and can lead to human errors. Therefore, an automated computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) system is required. The recent evolution in image classification techniques has shown great progress especially the deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) which have succeeded in this area. In this regard, we exploited CNN for the problem of brain tumor classification. We suggested a new model, which contains various layers in the aim to classify MRI brain tumor.

However, simply utilizing convolutional neural networks without taking other measures into account is computationally intensive, and the results are not satisfying. In this study, to obtain the most informative images for reconstruction, we introduce a residual block to a 2D encoder for improved feature extraction, and propose an attentive latent unit that makes it possible to select the most informative image being fed into the network rather than choosing one at random. The recurrent visual attentive network is injected into the auto-encoder network using reinforcement learning. The recurrent visual attentive network pays more attention to useful images, and the agent will quickly predict the 3D volume. This model is evaluated based on both single- and multi-view reconstructions. The experiment results show that the recurrent visual attentive network increases prediction performance in a way that is superior to other alternative methods, and our model has desirable capacity for generalization.},

The explored FONNs illustrate preferable stability performance if selecting a lesser self-connection delay, and Hopf bifurcation generates once they overstep the critical values. Moreover, the effects of fractional order on the bifurcation points are fully studied. It detects that the emergence of bifurcation can be lagged as fractional order amplifies.

CNN based applications have achieved tremendous advancement towards vision computing with high dimensional object labelling in images. The complex nature of High Dimensional (HD) images limits the performance of CNN’s. In high dimensional feature space, the pixel-based image labelling is a complex problem for the parsing of objects in an image. To overcome this issue, we have studied a two-stage end-to-end framework that uses manifold embedding based patch-wise CNN architecture to extract the features and classify the image for labelled classes. We have investigated the deep-features with an information fusion technique for low dimensional feature space compression by using pre-trained CNNs and spatiality preserving manifold embedding in the first stage. The cost of pixel-based labelling in HD feature space is very high, so researchers have tried to encapsulate maximum information within the minimum image size. Therefore, in this stage, we have first increased the valuable information by concatenating the deep spatial features and then embedding the massive dataset by using manifold preservation. In stage-2, the image patches are extracted and passed into three layers of convolution-pooling pair and two layers of fully connected pair using parameter tuning. The training dataset is prepared in the form of pixel-label pairs. Subsequently, the proposed method has been evaluated on publicly available images and compared with the previously proposed schemes. The proposed method has outperformed the previous techniques in accuracy and computation time with a significant margin.},

This paper aims to address this gap specifically for fall detection and motion recognition using acceleration data. To ensure reproducibility, we use a publicly available dataset, UniMiB-SHAR, with a well-established history in the HAR literature. We methodically analyze the performance of 64 different combinations of (i) learning representations (in the form of raw temporal data or extracted features), (ii) traditional and modern classifiers with different topologies on (iii) both binary (fall detection) and multi-class (daily activities of living) datasets. We report and discuss our findings and conclude that while feature engineering may still be competitive for HAR, trainable front-ends of modern deep learning algorithms can benefit from raw temporal data especially in large quantities. In fact, this paper claims state-of-the-art where we significantly outperform the most recent literature on this dataset in both activity recognition (88.41% vs. 98.02%) and fall detection (98.71% vs. 99.82%) using raw temporal input.},

  abstract     = {Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are considered as being &quot;approximately invariant&quot; to nuisance perturbations such as image transformation, shift, scaling, and other small deformations, some existing studies show that intense noises can cause noticeable variation to CNNs’ outputs. This paper focuses on exploring a method of measuring sensitivity by observing corresponding output variation to input perturbation on CNNs. The sensitivity is statistically defined in a bottom-up way from neuron to layer, and finally to the entire CNN network. An iterative algorithm is proposed for approximating the defined sensitivity. On the basic architecture of CNNs, the theoretically computed sensitivity is verified on the MNIST database with four types of commonly used noise distributions: Gaussian, Uniform, Salt and Pepper, and Rayleigh. Experimental results show the theoretical sensitivity is on the one hand in agreement with the actual output variation what on the maps, layers or entire networks are, and on the other hand an applicable quantitative measure for robust network selection.},

MCVMSVM adopts the idea of semi-supervised learning and transfers the K-class problem to K(K − 1)/2 binary classification problems. For each binary classification problem, a new SVM with a mixed regularization term which considers the margin and the distribution of examples is proposed. MCVMSVM can utilize the information of all examples without increasing the scale of the optimization problem.

  abstract     = {Twin support vector regression (TSVR) is generally employed with $$ \varepsilon $$ -insensitive loss function which is not well capable to handle the noises and outliers. According to the definition, Huber loss function performs as quadratic for small errors and linear for others and shows better performance in comparison to Gaussian loss hence it restrains easily for a different type of noises and outliers. Recently, TSVR with Huber loss (HN-TSVR) has been suggested to handle the noise and outliers. Like TSVR, it is also having the singularity problem which degrades the performance of the model. In this paper, regularized version of HN-TSVR is proposed as regularization based twin support vector regression (RHN-TSVR) to avoid the singularity problem of HN-TSVR by applying the structured risk minimization principle that leads to our model convex and well-posed. This proposed RHN-TSVR model is well capable to handle the noise as well as outliers and avoids the singularity issue. To show the validity and applicability of proposed RHN-TSVR, various experiments perform on several artificial generated datasets having uniform, Gaussian and Laplacian noise as well as on benchmark different real-world datasets and compare with support vector regression, TSVR, $$ \varepsilon $$ -asymmetric Huber SVR, $$ \varepsilon $$ -support vector quantile regression and HN-TSVR. Here, all benchmark real-world datasets are embedded with a different significant level of noise 0%, 5% and 10% on different reported algorithms with the proposed approach. The proposed algorithm RHN-TSVR is showing better prediction ability on artificial datasets as well as real-world datasets with a different significant level of noise compared to other reported models.},

  abstract     = {Political optimizer (PO) is a recently proposed human-behavior inspired meta-heuristic, which has shown tremendous performance on complex multimodal functions as well as engineering optimization problems. Good convergence speed and well-balanced exploratory and exploitative behavior of PO convince us to employ PO for the training of feedforward neural network (FNN). The FNN-training problem is formulated as an optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) or cross entropy (CE). The weights and biases of the FNN are arranged in the form of a vector called a candidate solution. The performance of the proposed trainer is evaluated on 5 classification data-sets and 5 function-approximation data-sets, which have already been used in the literature. In recent years, grey wolf optimizer, moth flame optimization, multi-verse optimizer, sine-cosine algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, ant lion optimizer, and Salp swarm algorithm have successfully been applied on neural network training. In this paper, we compare the performance of PO with these algorithms and show that PO either outperforms them or performs equivalently. The MSE, CE, training set accuracy, and test set accuracy are used as metrics for the comparative analysis. The non-parametric Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test is used to show the statistical significance of the results. Based on the tremendous performance, we highly recommend using PO for the training of artificial neural networks to solve the classification and regression problems.},

As the latest language representation model, BERT obtains new state-of-the-art results in the classification task. Nevertheless, the text classification framework of BERT neglects to make full use of the token-level text representation and label embedding, since it only utilizes the final hidden state corresponding to CLS token as sequence-level text representation for classification. We assume that the finer-grained token-level text representation and label embedding contribute to classification. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a Label-Embedding Bi-directional Attentive model to improve the performance of BERT’s text classification framework. In particular, we extend BERT’s text classification framework with label embedding and bi-directional attention. Experimental results on the five datasets indicate that our model has notable improvements over both baselines and state-of-the-art models.},

In this design, the RBF neural networks mechanism utilizes RC function to replace Gaussian function, which is called RCRBF. An N-dimensional RC function has the constant interpolation property, which is benefit for the function approximating errors analysis in the neural networks. Based on multivariable RC function approximation theory, we develop how to select the updated parameters and the distance of adjacent nodes in lattice points. Therefore, the proposed networks can uniformly approximate nonlinear dynamical function. As persistency excitation (PE) plays an important part in neural networks learning system, how does PE condition behave in input sequences is formulated by RC function analysis. The weights updating and errors convergence are concluded by Lyapunov function analysis. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed RCRBF method, Van Der Pol and Rossler dynamical system are used as test examples, in comparison with GRBF mechanism. The results show that the proposed method has better accurate identification and approximating effect than that of GRBF mechanism.},

However, it still shows a limitation in processing some real-world data, as the stood and BP is independent of data. In practice, the probabilities of selecting features in the latent space for different observed data are different, and they are usually dependent on some information from data, such as the location or time information. For example, data with closer distances usually have similar features. This kind of information (location or time) often called covariates, which are ignored in most BP-related literature. To account this problem, we propose a variational inference based dependent beta processes (VDBP), in which the dependent beta process is constructed using the stick-breaking representation and the dependency on the covariates is captured by a Gaussian process prior. An elegant representation of variational inference for with VDBP prior is obtained, which offers the efficient training method for the models using VDBP as priors. Through instantiating a Bayesian factor analysis model with VDBP, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed VDBP in image denoising and image inpainting tasks.},

  abstract     = {In the medical image processing, automatic segmentation of burn images is one of the critical tasks in the classification of skin burn into normal and burn area. Traditional models identify the burns from the image and distinguish the region as burn and non-burn regions. However, the earlier models cannot accurately classify the wound region and also requires more time in the prediction of burns. Also, the burn depth analysis is an important factor for the calculation of the percentage of burn depth i.e. degree of severity is analyzed by Total body surface area (TBSA). For those issues, we design a hybrid approach named DenseMask Regional convolutional neural network (RCNN) approach for segmenting the skin burn region based on the various degrees of burn severity. In this, hybrid integration of Mask-region based convolution neural network CNN (Mask R-CNN) and dense pose estimation are integrated into DenseMask RCNN that calculate the full-body human pose and performs semantic segmentation. At first, we use the Residual Network with a dilated convolution using a weighted mapping model to generate the dense feature map. Then the feature map is fed into the Region proposal network (RPN) which utilizes a Feature pyramid network (FPN) to detect the objects at different scales of location and pyramid level from the input images. For the accurate alignment of pixel-to-pixel labels, we introduce a Region of interest (RoI)-pose align module that properly aligns the objects based on the human pose with the characteristics of scale, right-left, translation, and left–right flip to a standard scale. After the alignment task, a cascaded fully convolutional architecture is employed on the top of the RoI module that performs mask segmentation and dense pose regression task simultaneously. Finally, the transfer learning model classifies the detected burn regions into three classes of wound depths. Experimental analysis is performed on the burn dataset and the result obtained shows better accuracy than the state-of-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel NeuroEvolutionary algorithm called Enhanced Cartesian Genetic Programming evolved Artificial Neural Network (ECGPANN) as a predictor for the lost signal samples in real time. Unlike traditional Cartesian Genetic Programming evolved Artificial Neural Network (CGPANN), the proposed algorithm introduces bi-chromosomal architecture instead of single chromosome to perform parallel evolution of topology with weights and architecture. This modification makes it suitable for obtaining global optimum solutions to predict both periodic and aperiodic lost samples at run-time. Sliding Window based Multi-instance Linear Regression (SW-MLR) and Sliding Window based Multi-instance Random Forest (SW-MRF) prediction algorithms are also exploited for the reconstruction of multiple missing samples. SW-MLR and SW-MRF being trained on fixed input/output cannot be utilized for random signal loss due to dynamic nature of number of output estimations needed at run-time. ECGPANN has the flexibility to produce variable number of outputs in real-time. Experimental results demonstrates the efficacy of the ECGPANN for both single and multi-sample loss with fix periodic and aperiodic noise using sliding window technique. The SNR improvement achieved ranges from 20 to 37 dB for periodic noise and 31–44 dB for aperiodic noise with signals having 16.6–50% samples missing. ECGPANN when compared in terms of its performance with the traditional CGPANN produced 4–5% improvement in prediction accuracy on average. The proposed ECGAPNN model is able to achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.051 (speech), 0.015 (guitar) and 0.038 (flute) for 16.6% lost/corrupted signals. MAE of 0.066 (speech), 0.020 (guitar) and 0.049 (flute) for 50% lost/corrupted data has been reported. The networks are trained and tested on audio speech signal and evaluated on music signals for its generality, with ECGPANN performing consistently better irrespective of the change in type of signals and demonstrated its robustness with change in number of missing samples in contrast to SW-MLR and SW-MRF. The ability to predict randomly variable number of missing samples make it applicable in real time.},

  abstract     = {Single image blind motion deblurring refers to transferring a blurred motion image into a corresponding clear image, which is a challenging and classic problem in the field of computer vision. The spatially variant blur is usually caused by many factors, such as camera jitter and object motion. Since image deblurring can be regarded as the task of image transformation, deep learning methods based on coarse-to-fine scheme, especially those using multi-scale architectures become popular. However, they have the disadvantages of unsatisfactory image quality and time-consuming running caused by large kernel size. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end network structure based on Deep Hierarchical Multi-patch network architecture integrated with Context Module and additional ResBlocks in order to tackle deblurring problem. Compared with recently proposed networks, it generates images with better visual effect as well as higher image quality index. Besides, our model significantly reduces the test time. We evaluate the proposed network structure on public GoPro dataset, a large-scale image dataset with complex synthetic blur. The experiments on the benchmark dataset prove that our effective method outperforms other state-of-the-art blind deblurring algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of Context Module in the task of single image blur removal.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning techniques, that are based on semantic analysis of behavioural attack patterns, have not been successfully implemented in cyber threat intelligence. This is because of the error prone and time-consuming manual process of deep learning solutions, which is commonly used for searching correlated cyber-attack tactics, techniques and procedures in cyber-attacks prediction techniques. The aim of this paper is to improve the prediction accuracy and the processing time of cyber-attacks prediction mechanisms by proposing enhanced Naïve Bayes posterior probability (ENBPP) algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines two functions; a modified version of Naïve Bayes posterior probability function and a modified risk assessment function. Combining these two functions will enhance the threat prediction accuracy and decrease the processing time. Five different datasets were used to obtain the results. Five different datasets containing 328,814 threat samples were used to obtain the processing time and the prediction accuracy results for the proposed solution. Results show that the proposed solution gives better prediction accuracy and processing time when different examination types and different scenarios are taken into consideration. The proposed solution provides a significant prediction accuracy improvement in threat analysis from 92–96% and decreases the average processing time from 0.043 to 0.028 s compared with the other method. The proposed solution successfully enhances the overall prediction accuracy and improves the processing time by solving the TTPs dependency and the prediction sets threshold problems. Thus, the proposed algorithm reaches a more reliable threat prediction solution.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to estimate the depth of anesthesia (DOA) at a safe and appropriate level taking into account the patient characteristics during the induction phase. Bi-spectral Index signal (BIS) as a common approach of controlling DOA generates noise and delays in the initial phase of induction. This may lead to useless information in the process of controlling. Moreover, using the BIS index entails a time-consuming process, high equipping costs, and a lack of accessibility to device accessories. To overcome these problems, we propose a new model of controlling DOA with no need for the use of such an index. Hence, an estimation strategy for DOA is developed applying a feedforward neural network and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference estimation model. This model estimates the dose of intravenous anesthetic drugs concerning the patients’ needs resulting in optimal drug dose and stable anesthesia depth. The proposed estimations are tested by sensitivity analysis being compared with real data obtained from the classical model (PK-PD) revised approach and BIS approach on 13 patients undergoing surgery. The results show an accuracy of 0.999, indicative of a high-validated model. Compared to BIS, our proposed model not only controls DOA accurately but also achieves outcomes in practice successfully. Some practical implications for future research and clinical practice are also suggested.},

The model is based on the improvement and generalization of the finite-time ZNN (FTZNN) dynamics by means of the varying-parameter ZNN (VPZNN) dynamics, and termed as VPFTZNN. More precisely, the proposed model replaces fixed and large values of the scaling parameter by an appropriate time-dependent gain parameter, which leads to a faster and bounded convergence of the error function in comparison to previous ZNN methods. The convergence properties of the proposed VPFTZNN dynamical evolution in its generic form is verified. Particularly, VPFTZNN for solving linear matrix equations and for computing generalized inverses are investigated theoretically and numerically. Moreover, the proposed design is applicable in solving the TV matrix inversion problem, solving the Lyapunov and Sylvester equation as well as in approximating the matrix square root. Theoretical analysis as well as simulation results validate the effectiveness of the introduced dynamical evolution. The main advantages of the proposed VPFTZNN dynamics are their generality and faster finite-time convergence with respect to FTZNN models.},

How to learn the unknown labeled data is a crucial issue in the data classification. In this paper, an evolved fuzzy min-max neural network for unknown labeled data classification (FMM-ULD) is proposed. In FMM-ULD, the unknown labeled data handling process is designed. Moreover, in the unknown labeled data handling process, a decision function and a threshold function are designed. In addition, FMM-ULD can realize further correction for the unsatisfactory data classification of the known category. The experimental results using UCI benchmark data set show that FMM-ULD get good performance for handling the unknown labeled data as a general method. In addition, the application result on the pipeline defect recognition in depth shows that FMM-ULD is effective in handling the real-application unknown labeled data problem.},

The innovative part of this paper is to reach the consensus and attain the stability for prescribed MASs with interval time varying delay using impulsive control in the presence of leader. The interaction between the agent is illustrated by an undirected graph. A class of distributed impulsive protocol relying on sampling information is suggested to reach the leader following consensus. The consensus is critically relying on the sampling period, control gains. By performing the similar procedures, the consensus problem of multi-agent system is converted to stability problem of the error system. By utilizing the stability theory of impulsive systems, algebraic graph theory, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the leader-following consensus of the multi-agent system. Terminally, a numerical example is given to show an efficacy of this presented approach and the sureness of theoretical analysis.},

Homonyms are a source of noise i most text analyses and are difficult to detect; numerous studies have been conducted in this regard. However, extant methods typically detect homonyms using a rule-based or statistical-based approach, which requires an answer set, with little regard to the semantic meaning of the word. Therefore, we propose a novel approach for the detection of homonyms based on contextual word embedding that allows a word to be understood based on the context in which it appears. In this study, we extracted all contextual word embedding vectors of individual words and clustered those vectors using a spherical k-means clustering to detect pairs of homonyms. In addition, we developed a homonym replacement method to increase the performance of a document embedding technique, based on the word vector value. We replaced the embedding vectors of homonyms with a representative vector based on the respective meaning using the proposed homonym detection method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively detects homonyms and significantly improves the performance of document embedding.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is an essential data analysis technique and has been studied extensively over the last decades. Previous studies have shown that data representation and data structure information are two critical factors for improving clustering performance, and it forms two important lines of research. The first line of research attempts to learn representative features, especially utilizing the deep neural networks, for handling clustering problems. The second concerns exploiting the geometric structure information within data for clustering. Although both of them have achieved promising performance in lots of clustering tasks, few efforts have been dedicated to combine them in a unified deep clustering framework, which is the research gap we aim to bridge in this work. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Manifold regularized Deep Embedded Clustering (MDEC), to deal with the aforementioned challenge. It simultaneously models data generating distribution, cluster assignment consistency, as well as geometric structure of data in a unified framework. The proposed method can be optimized by performing mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation. We evaluate MDEC on three real-world datasets (USPS, REUTERS-10K, and MNIST), where experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models and obtains the state-of-the-art performance.},
