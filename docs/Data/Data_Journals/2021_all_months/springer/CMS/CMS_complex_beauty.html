These models are showed to be capable to capture some phenomena observed for most financial time series, among others, the asymmetric patterns, leverage effects, dependency without correlation and tail heaviness. So, some theoretical probabilistic properties of such models are discussed, in particular, we establish firstly necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring the strict stationarity and ergodicity for solution process of MS-TGARCH. Secondary, we extend the standard results for the limit theory of the popular quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) for estimating the unknown parameters involved in model and we examine thus the strong consistency of such estimates. The finite-sample properties of QMLE are illustrated by a Monte Carlo study. Our proposed model is applied to model the exchange rates of the Algerian Dinar against the single European currency (Euro).},

We show that symmetric covariation can be defined using the proposed generalized fractional derivative, which has broader usages than those involved in this work. Several properties of symmetric covariation have been derived. These are either similar to or more general than those of the covariance functions in the Gaussian case. The main contribution of this framework is the representation of the characteristic function of bivariate symmetric $$\alpha $$ -stable distribution via convergent series based on a sequence of symmetric covariations.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider Marshall and Olkin’s family of distributions. The parent (baseline) distribution is taken to be a scaled family of distributions. Two models: (i) modified proportional hazard rate scale and (ii) modified proportional reversed hazard rate scale, are considered. Some stochastic comparison results in terms of the usual stochastic, hazard rate and reversed hazard rate orders are studied to compare order statistics formed from two sets of independent observations following these models. Most of the sufficient conditions are obtained depending on various majorization-type partial orderings. Further, the setup with multiple-outlier model is taken. Various stochastic orders between the smallest and largest order statistics are developed. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the established theoretical results.},

It is shown that they are asymptotically normally distributed under similar conditions as assumed in Wu and Tam (IEEE Trans Signal Process 49(2):373–380, 2001). In addition, a recursive algorithm for computing the M-estimators of frequencies is proposed, and the strong consistency of these estimators is established.

  abstract     = {Regular vine copula provides rich models for dependence structure modeling. It combines vine structures and families of bivariate copulas to construct a number of multivariate distributions that can model a wide range dependence patterns with different tail dependence for different pairs. Two special cases of regular vine copulas, C-vine and D-vine copulas, have been extensively investigated in the literature. We propose the Python package, pyvine, for modeling, sampling and testing a more generalized regular vine copula (R-vine for short). R-vine modeling algorithm searches for the R-vine structure which maximizes the vine tree dependence in a sequential way. The maximum likelihood estimation algorithm takes the sequential estimations as initial values and uses L-BFGS-B algorithm for the likelihood value optimization. R-vine sampling algorithm traverses all edges of the vine structure from the last tree in a recursive way and generates the marginal samples on each edge according to some nested conditions. Goodness-of-fit testing algorithm first generates Rosenblatt’s transformed data $${\varvec{E}}$$ and then tests the hypothesis $$H_0^*: {\varvec{E}} \sim C_{\perp }$$ by using Anderson–Darling statistic, where $$C_{\perp }$$ is the independence copula. Bootstrap method is used to compute an adjusted p-value of the empirical distribution of replications of Anderson–Darling statistic. The computing of related functions of copulas such as cumulative distribution functions, H-functions and inverse H-functions often meets with the problem of overflow. We solve this problem by reinvestigating the following six families of bivariate copulas: Normal, Student t, Clayton, Gumbel, Frank and Joe’s copulas. Approximations of the above related functions of copulas are given when the overflow occurs in the computation. All these are implemented in a subpackage bvcopula, in which subroutines are written in Fortran and wrapped into Python and, hence, good performance is guaranteed.},

We study its statistical properties including quantiles, moments, order statistics and Renyi entropy. The estimation of parameters by maximum likelihood method is discussed, and a Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators.
