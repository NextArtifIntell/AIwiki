  abstract     = {Living systems require a sustained supply of energy and nutrients to survive. These nutrients are ingested, transformed into low-energy waste products, and excreted. In contrast, synthetic DNA strand-displacement reactions typically run within closed systems provided with a finite initial supply of reactants. Once the reactants are consumed, all net reactions halt and the system ceases to function. Here we run DNA strand-displacement reactions in a continuous flow reactor, infusing fresh reactants and withdrawing waste, enabling the system to dynamically update its outputs in response to changing inputs. Running DNA strand-displacement reactions inside of continuous flow reactors allows the system to be re-used for multiple rounds of computation, which could enable the execution of more elaborate information processing tasks, including single-rail negation and sequential logic circuits.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that machine learning (ML) techniques have been playing an important role in several real world applications. However, one of the main challenges is the selection of the most accurate technique to be used in a specific application. In the classification context, for instance, two main approaches can be applied, model selection and hyper-parameter selection. In the first approach, the best classification algorithm is selected for a given input dataset, by doing a heuristic search in a large space of candidate classification algorithms and their corresponding hyper-parameter settings. As the main focus of this approach is the selection of the classification algorithms, it is referred to as model selection and they are also called automated machine learning (Auto-ML). The second approach defines one classification system and performs an extensive search to select the best hyper-parameters for this model. In this paper, we perform a wide and robust comparative analysis of both approaches for Classifier Ensembles. In this analysis, two methods of the first approach (Auto-WEKA and H $$_{2}$$ O) are compared to four methods of the second approach (Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Tabu Search and GRASP). The main aim is to determine which of these techniques generate more accurate Classifier Ensembles, given a time constraint. Additionally, an empirical analysis will be conducted with 21 classification datasets for evaluating the performance of the aforementioned techniques. Our findings indicate that the use of a hyper-parameter selection method provides the most accurate classifier ensembles, but this improvement was not detected by the statistical test.},

  abstract     = {Many complex systems observed in nature and society can be described in terms of network. A salient feature of networks is the presence of community patterns. Network-based models have already been applied in the analysis of data from very diverse areas, from epidemics modeling to periodicity detection in meteorological data. In this paper, inspired by the formation of community structures, such as the metabolic networks and the anatomical and functional connectome observed in biological neural networks, we present a model which makes use of connector hubs to detect price trend reversals and to automatize decision-making processes in stock market trading operations for selecting a good investment strategy and improve the returns. It starts by mapping the historical stock price time series as a network, where each node represents a price variation range and the edges are generated according to the time sequential order in which these ranges occur. Afterwards, communities of the constructed network so far are detected, which represent the up and down trends of the stock prices. The model has two phases: (1) Trend detection phase, where the price trend communities are detected and trend labels are generated; and (2) Operating phase. In this phase, the proposed technique predicts trend labels to future stock prices, in such a way that these trends can be used as triggers to perform buying and selling operations of the stock. We evaluate the model by applying it on historical data from 10 of the most traded stocks from both NYSE and the Brazilian Stock Exchange (Bovespa). The obtained results are promising, with the model’s best returns being able to outperform the stock price returns for the same period in 15 out of the 20 cases under consideration.},

  abstract     = {During the evolutionary process, algorithms based on probability distributions for generating new individuals suffer from computational burden due to the intensive computation of probability distribution estimations, particularly when using Probabilistic Graph Models (PGMs). In the Bayesian Optimisation Algorithm (BOA), for instance, determining the optimal Bayesian network structure by a given solution sample is an NP-hard problem. To overcome this issue, we consider a new BOA-based optimisation approach (FBOA) which explores the fact that patterns of PGM adjustments can be used as a guide to reduce the frequency of PGM updates because significant changes in PGM structure might not occur so frequently, and because they can be particularly sparse at the end of evolution. In the present paper, this new approach is scrutinised in the search space of an NK-landscape optimisation problem for medium and large-size instances. Average gaps and success rates as well as the correlation between the landscape ruggedness of the problem and the expected runtime of FBOA and BOA are presented for medium-size instances. For large-size instances, optimisation results from FBOA and BOA are compared. The experiments show that, despite our FBOA being of almost three times faster than BOA, it still produces competitive optimisation results.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces Multi-Region Symbolic Regression (MR-SR), a general framework that divides the original input data space of symbolic regression problems into subspaces (regions), generates different solutions to fit these regions and then combines them. MR-SR has three main components: (1) a strategy for finding the different regions of the data input space; (2) a method for generating the functions for each region; and (3) a strategy for combining the models found by (2). The main contribution of this paper is on how we generate the functions for each region. We model the function generation problem following a multi-objective approach, where each objective corresponds to the quality of the evolved function in a region, and the number of objectives is equal to the number of regions of the data input space. We test MR-SR in two scenarios with different objectives. In the first, we used the new approach to solve the symbolic regression problem with standard GP, with the main objective of reducing error rate. In the second, we took advantage of this method for a different purpose: to reduce the dimensionality of the semantic space of a variation of GP, namely Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP). Results in 10 datasets showed that the method using clustering k-means and a model switching strategy—which makes predictions using the best evolved function for the region of interest—obtained better results in 5 out of 10 datasets for GP with 2 regions. For GSGP the framework was less effective due to the lack of diversity of the solutions evolved.},

  abstract     = {A morphogenetic system (M system) is an abstract computational model inspired by characteristic properties of morphogenetic phenomena such as controlled growth, self-reproduction, homeostasis and self-healing in living systems. Besides selected principles of membrane computing, M systems also rely on algorithmic self-assembly of abstract tiles unfolding in a 3D (or generally, dD) space. Explicit spatial arrangements for interaction among an M system’s components are crucial for its function. From a computational viewpoint, key features of M systems include their computational universality and their efficiency to solve difficult problems. Both computational universality (in the Turing sense) and self-healing properties (in the sense of the algorithmic tile assembly model) have been demonstrated for different M systems in prior publications. Here, we demonstrate that both of these properties can be simultaneously achieved in a single M system. We present a Turing universal string acceptor M system that also exhibits self-healing capabilities of degree 1. This result is rather surprising since Turing machines are usually very sensitive to minor damage to their internal structure. The result thus sheds light on the power and importance of geometric and spatial arrangements for the reliability and robustness of a computational system.},

In sensing $$5&#39;\rightarrow 3&#39;$$ WK automata the process on the input is finished when the heads meet, and the model characterise the linear context-free languages. Deterministic variants are weaker, the class 2detLIN is accepted by them. In this paper a new concept, the state-determinism is investigated, that is in each configuration of a computation (if it is not finished yet) the next state is determined by the actual state of the configuration. There are various usual restrictions on WK automata, e.g., all-final, stateless or 1-limited variants. We place the new class, the state-deterministic $$5&#39;\rightarrow 3&#39;$$ WK automata, into the hierarchy based on the accepted language classes. Further, various hierarchy results including combined restrictions, e.g., 1-limited all-final state-deterministic $$5&#39;\rightarrow 3&#39;$$ WK automata are shown.},

Our problem is the construction a string t of length n using strings $$s^1,\dots , s^m$$ with possible overlapping. Firstly, we provide a classical (randomized) algorithm with running time $$O\left( n+L +m(\log n)^2\right) =\tilde{O}(n+L)$$ where L is the sum of lengths of $$s^1,\dots ,s^m$$ . Secondly, we provide a quantum algorithm with running time $$O\left( n +\log n\cdot (\log m+\log \log n)\cdot \sqrt{m\cdot L}\right) =\tilde{O}\left( n +\sqrt{m\cdot L}\right) $$ . Additionally, we show that the lower bound for a classical (randomized or deterministic) algorithm is $$\varOmega (n+L)$$ . Thus, our classical algorithm is optimal up to a log factor, and our quantum algorithm shows a speed-up when compared with any classical (randomized or deterministic) algorithm in the case of non-constant length of strings in the dictionary.},

In such models based on self-assembly, one of the key questions is the ability to construct fractal structures. We focus on the problem of generating an infinite fractal curves using a cyclic oritatami system, which has an infinite periodic transcript. We first establish a formal definition of drawing a curve using an oritatami system, proposing conditions and restrictions with reference to prior oritatami designs for possibly infinite conformations. Under such definition, we prove that it is impossible to draw a Koch curve or a Minkowski curve infinitely. We then establish sufficient conditions of infinite aperiodic curves that a cyclic oritatami system cannot fold.},

  abstract     = {A matrix insertion-deletion system (or matrix ins-del system) is described by a set of insertion-deletion rules presented in matrix form, which demands all rules of a matrix to be applied in the given order. These systems were introduced to model very simplistic fragments of sequential programs based on insertion and deletion as elementary operations as can be found in biocomputing. We are investigating such systems with limited resources as formalized in descriptional complexity. A traditional descriptional complexity measure of such a matrix ins-del system is its size $$s=(k;n,i&#39;,i&#39;&#39;;m,j&#39;,j&#39;&#39;)$$ , where the parameters from left to right represent the maximal matrix length, maximal insertion string length, maximal length of left contexts in insertion rules, maximal length of right contexts in insertion rules; the last three are deletion counterparts of the previous three parameters. We call the sum $$n+i&#39;+i&#39;&#39;+m+j&#39;+j&#39;&#39;$$ the sum-norm of s.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a simplified model of robot motion planning where particles on a board respond to global signals, causing them to move uniformly in a particular direction. We consider two types of movement commands: (1) Steps, which cause particles to move one unit distance in the given direction, and (2) Tilts, which cause particles to move maximally in the given direction. Under the overarching theme of reconfiguring robot swarms, we look at the problem of assembling general shapes both within systems that exclusively use step commands and systems that exclusively use tilt commands. We derive upper and lower bounds on the worst-case number of movements needed to reconfigure a general purpose board into a target shape. Under step transformations, we show a set of obstacles that can reconfigure n robots from any size-n shape to construct any other size-n shape with optimal $$\varTheta (n)$$ steps, which improves on previous techniques taking $$O(n^2)$$ steps. We then provide a board configuration that, under tilt transformations, can construct any size-n shape (given “helper particles”) in optimal $$\varTheta (n)$$ tilts, which also improves upon the previous best known time of $$O(n^2)$$ tilts.},

  abstract     = {In the research area of card-based cryptography, designing committed-format AND protocols that are efficient in terms of the number of required cards is a major topic. Such an AND protocol should receive two pairs of face-down (physical) cards representing two secret input bits, from which it should securely produce a pair of face-down cards representing the AND value of the two bits via a series of actions, such as shuffling and turning over cards, along with some helping cards. The number of required cards typically depends on allowed kinds of shuffling operations. This paper focuses on “RC-protocols” meaning to be able to use only the random cut (RC), which is the easiest shuffling operation to implement. The best committed-format AND RC-protocol currently known was devised by Stiglic in 2001, where eight cards are used (i.e., his protocol needs four helping cards). Since then, it has been an open question to determine whether there exists a committed-format AND RC-protocol using less than eight cards. In this study, we answer to the question: We propose a six-card committed-format AND RC-protocol (using exactly two random cuts). Therefore, we can reduce the number of required cards by two.},

  abstract     = {Cluster analysis is one important field in pattern recognition and machine learning, consisting in an attempt to distribute a set of data patterns into groups, considering only the inner properties of those data. One of the most popular techniques for data clustering is the K-Means algorithm, due to its simplicity and easy implementation. But K-Means is strongly dependent on the initial point of the search, what may lead to suboptima (local optima) solutions. In the past few decades, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), like Group Search Optimization (GSO), have been adapted to the context of cluster analysis, given their global search capabilities and flexibility to deal with hard optimization problems. However, given their stochastic nature, EAs may be slower to converge in comparison to traditional clustering models (like K-Means). In this work, three hybrid memetic approaches between K-Means and GSO are presented, named FMKGSO, MKGSO and TMKGSO, in such a way that the global search capabilities of GSO are combined with the fast local search performances of K-Means. The degree of influence of K-Means on the behavior of GSO method is evaluated by a set of experiments considering both real-world problems and synthetic data sets, using five clustering metrics to access how good and robust the proposed hybrid memetic models are.},

In recent years, it has been effectively used in several applications of science and engineering. In the conventional TLBO and most of its versions, all the learners have the same probability of getting knowledge from others. LebTLBO is motivated by the different probabilities of acquiring knowledge by the learner from others and introduced a learning enthusiasm mechanism into the basic TLBO. In this work, to achieve the enhanced performance of conventional LebTLBO by balancing the exploration and exploitation capabilities, an improved LebTLBO algorithm is proposed. The exploration of LebTLBO has been enhanced by the incorporation of the Opposition Based Learning strategy. Exploitation has been improved by Local Neighborhood Search inspired by the experience of the best solution so far discovered in a local neighborhood of the present solution. On the CEC2019 benchmark functions, the suggested technique is assessed, and computational findings show that it provides promising outcomes over other algorithms. Finally, improved LebTLBO is employed in three engineering problems and the competitive findings demonstrate its potential for a real-world problem such as the localization problem in Wireless Sensor Networks.},

  abstract     = {A core operator of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is the mutation. Recently, much attention has been devoted to the study of mutation operators with dynamic and non-uniform mutation rates. Following up on this area of work, we propose a new mutation operator and analyze its performance on the $$(1+1)$$ Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). Our analyses show that this mutation operator competes with pre-existing ones, when used by the $$(1+1)$$ EA on classes of problems for which results on the other mutation operators are available. We show that the $$(1+1)$$ EA using our mutation operator finds a (1/3)-approximation ratio on any non-negative submodular function in polynomial time. We also consider the problem of maximizing a symmetric submodular function under a single matroid constraint and show that the $$(1+1)$$ EA using our operator finds a (1/3)-approximation within polynomial time. This performance matches that of combinatorial local search algorithms specifically designed to solve these problems and outperforms them with constant probability. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the $$(1+1)$$ EA using our operator experimentally by considering two applications: (a) the maximum directed cut problem on real-world graphs of different origins, with up to 6.6 million vertices and 56 million edges and (b) the symmetric mutual information problem using a four month period air pollution data set. In comparison with uniform mutation and a recently proposed dynamic scheme, our operator comes out on top on these instances.},

  abstract     = {Swarm intelligence algorithms are stochastic algorithms, i.e. they perform some random movement. This random movement imparts the algorithms with exploration capabilities and allows them to escape local optima. Exploration at the start of execution helps with thorough inspection of the search/solution space. However, as the algorithm progresses, the focus should ideally shift from exploration to exploitation. This shift would help the algorithm to enhance existing solutions and improve its convergence capabilities. Hence if the range of random movement is not kept in check, it may limit an algorithm’s convergence capabilities and overall efficiency. To ensure that the convergence of an algorithm is not compromised, an improved search technique to reduce range of uniform random movement was recently proposed for bat algorithm. Uniform distribution and levy distribution are the most commonly used random distributions in swarm algorithms. In this paper, the applicability of the improved search technique over different swarm algorithms employing uniform and levy distributions, as well as Cauchy distribution has been studied. The selected algorithms are firefly algorithm, cuckoo search algorithm, moth search algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, earthworm optimization algorithm and elephant herding optimization algorithm. The resultant variants of each of these algorithms show improvement upon inclusion of the improved search technique. Hence results establish that the improved search technique has positive influence over swarm algorithms employing different random distributions.},

Improving the setting of this parameter has attracted many researchers. In this paper, we analyzed the GSA stability using the von Neumann stability criterion. First, we modeled the iterative process by a second-order differential equation and derived the first and second-order stability conditions. Then, based on these criteria, we suggested a new law to adjust the initial value of the parameter G, depending on the distance between objects and then on the search space. Some supporting simulations were carried out using different update laws of the gravitational constant (e.g., exponential, log-sigmoid, linear, and chaotic) on CEC 2017 benchmark functions in different search space dimensions. The achieved results show that the new setting leads to significantly better outcomes in high-dimensional search spaces (greater than 20). A comparison with other metaheuristics (Particle Swarm Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony, and Grey Wolf Optimizer) reveals that the new setting proffers GSA competitiveness. Tests on 23 real-world problems (CEC 2011 benchmark problems and the iron ores sintering problem) further proved all the merits of the proposed parameter setting.},

Six considered ABC variants tested the derived and state-of-the-art criteria in different update modes.

However, the essence of the evolutionary algorithms is that a lot of algorithm design is based on the manual result analysis, summarize, refine, feedback, and then, the algorithms are designed adaptively and correspondingly. This kind of design scheme needs artificial statistics and analysis of large amounts of data, which greatly increases the burden of the designers. To solve this problem, an evolutionary algorithm framework based on genetic operator automatic design is proposed in this paper. In the first step, Gene Expression Programming and Differential Evolution methods are combined together and used to design the genetic operators automatically and adaptively, this hybrid method can not only explore solutions in problem space for the problem solving as most classical evolutionary algorithms do, but also generate genetic operators automatically in operator space for the proper operators extraction and selection related to the evolutionary algorithms . In the second step, the designed operators are adopted into the typical evolutionary algorithms to verify the performance and the result shows that the new designed genetic operator is superior to or at least equivalent to some existing DE variants in a set of classical benchmark functions. More importantly, this paper is not aimed at designing high performance algorithms, but to provide a new perspective for algorithms designing, and to provide a reference scheme for the machine algorithms designing.},

The general scheme followed by a haea algorithm is to evolve every individual of the population by selecting genetic operators according to a kind of chaotic competition mechanism. This paper proposes and studies, from both theoretical and experimental points of view, the class of hybrid adaptive evolutionary algorithms (called chavela), i.e., the class of evolutionary algorithms that follow such a general scheme. In this way, this paper presents a formal characterization of the chavela class in terms of Markov kernels; establishes convergence properties; proves that (parallel) hill-climbing algorithms belong to the chavela class; develops generational, steady-state, and classic versions; and analyzes the running behavior of chavela on well-known optimization functions.},

  abstract     = {In evolutionary algorithms, the notion of diversity has been adopted from biology and is used to describe the distribution of a population of solution candidates. While it has been known that maintaining a reasonable amount of diversity often benefits the overall result of the evolutionary optimization process by adjusting the exploration/exploitation trade-off, little has been known about what diversity is optimal. We introduce the notion of productive fitness based on the effect that a specific solution candidate has some generations down the evolutionary path. We derive the notion of final productive fitness, which is the ideal target fitness for any evolutionary process. Although it is inefficient to compute, we show empirically that it allows for an a posteriori analysis of how well a given evolutionary optimization process hit the ideal exploration/exploitation trade-off, providing insight into why diversity-aware evolutionary optimization often performs better.},

  abstract     = {A major issue while conceiving or parameterizing an optimization heuristic is to ensure an appropriate balance between exploitation and exploration of the search. Evolution strategies and neighborhood-based metaheuristics constitute relevant high-level frameworks, which ease the problem solving but are often complex to configure. Moreover, their effective behavior, according to the particularities of the search landscapes, remains difficult to grasp. In this paper, we deeply investigate the sampled walk search algorithm, which is a local search equivalent of the $$(1,\lambda )$$ -evolution strategy, considering that the neighborhood relation describes mutation possibilities. We specifically designed experiments to better understand the behavior of such a strategy offering a fine way to deal with the exploration versus exploitation dilemma. The main contribution is the analysis of search trajectories by evaluating and visualizing both their width (exploration) and their height (exploitation). More generally, we aim at bringing insights about the behavior of the $$(1,\lambda )$$ -ES in a discrete optimization context and within a fitness landscape perspective.},

In a previous study, a folding operation between strings of formal languages was introduced as a model of such processes. The operation was then used to define a folding system (F-system) as a construct consisting of a core language, containing the strings to be folded, and a folding procedure language, which defines how the folding is done. This paper reviews main definitions associated with F-systems and next it determines necessary conditions for a language to belong to classes generated by such systems. The conditions are stated in the form of pumping lemmas and four classes are considered, in which the core and folding procedure languages are both regular, one of them is regular and the other context-free, or both are context-free. Full demonstrations of the lemmas are provided, and the analysis is illustrated with examples.},

  abstract     = {A natural way to interpret a cellular automaton (CA) is as a mechanism that computes, in a distributed way, some function f. In other words, from a computer science point of view, CAs can be seen as distributed systems where the cells of the CAs are nodes of a network linked by communication channels. A classic measure of efficiency in such distributed systems is the number of bits exchanged during the computation process. A typical approach is to look for bottlenecks: channels through which the nature of the function f forces the exchange of a significant number of bits. In practice, a widely used way to understand such congestion phenomena is to partition the system into two subsystems and try to find bounds for the number of bits that must pass through the channels that join them. Finding these bounds is the focus of communication complexity theory. Measuring the communication complexity of some problems induced by a CA $$\phi$$ turned out to be tremendously useful to give clues regarding the intrinsic universality of $$\phi$$ (a CA is said to be intrinsically universal if it is capable of emulating any other). In fact, there exist particular problems $$\mathrm {P}$$ ’s for which the following key property holds: if $$\phi$$ is intrinsically universal, then the communication complexity of $$\mathrm {P}(\phi )$$ must be maximal. In this tutorial, we intend to explain the connections that were found, through a series of papers, between intrinsic universality and communication complexity in CAs.},

OIM is theoretically rooted in a novel result that establishes that the phase dynamics of coupled oscillator systems, under the influence of subharmonic injection locking, are governed by a Lyapunov function that is closely related to the Ising Hamiltonian of the coupling graph. As a result, the dynamics of such oscillator networks evolve naturally to local minima of the Lyapunov function. Two simple additional steps (i.e., turning subharmonic locking on and off smoothly, and adding noise) enable the network to find excellent solutions of Ising problems. We demonstrate our method on Ising versions of the MAX-CUT and graph colouring problems, showing that it improves on previously published results on several problems in the G benchmark set. Using synthetic problems with known global minima, we also present initial scaling results. Our scheme, which is amenable to realisation using many kinds of oscillators from different physical domains, is particularly well suited for CMOS IC implementation, offering significant practical advantages over previous techniques for making Ising machines. We report working hardware prototypes using CMOS electronic oscillators.},

  abstract     = {Tile-based self-assembly systems are capable of universal computation and algorithmically directed growth. Systems capable of such behaviors typically make use of “glue cooperation” in which the glues on at least 2 sides of a tile must match and bind to those exposed on the perimeter of an assembly for that tile to attach. However, several models have been developed which utilize “weak cooperation”, where only a single glue needs to bind but other preventative forces (such as geometric, or steric, hindrance) provide additional selection for which tiles may attach, and where this allows for algorithmic behavior. In this paper we first work in a model where tiles are allowed to have geometric bumps and dents on their edges. We show how such “geometric” tiles can simulate systems of square tiles with complex glue functions (using asymptotically optimal sizes of bumps and dents). We then show that at scale factor 1 it is impossible for geometric tiles to simulate the behavior of systems which can include duples (i.e. tiles either twice as long or twice as tall as square tiles), and also that with only weak cooperation via geometric hindrance, no system in any model can simulate even a class of tightly constrained, deterministic cooperative systems. This helps to further define the limits of the powers of systems relying on geometric hindrance instead of glue cooperation.A shortened version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation (UCNC 2019).},

To each module we associate a symbol such that gluing of modules corresponds to concatenating the associated symbols. Every word corresponds to a graphical representation of a DNA origami structure. A set of rewriting rules defines equivalent words that correspond to the same graphical structure. We propose two different types of basic module structures and corresponding rewriting rules. For each type, we provide the number of all possible structures through the number of equivalence classes of words.

Both structure and physical complexity are often pivotal to task performance, however, assessing their overall importance is challenging. Using a recently developed framework, we evaluate and compare the dynamical freedom (referring to quality) of neural network structures, as an analogy for physical systems. The results quantify how structure affects the behavioural range of networks. It demonstrates how high quality reached by more complex structures is often also achievable in simpler structures with greater network size. Alternatively, quality is often improved in smaller networks by adding greater connection complexity. This work demonstrates the benefits of using dynamical behaviour to assess the quality of computing substrates, rather than evaluation through benchmark tasks that often provide a narrow and biased insight into the computing quality of physical systems.},

  abstract     = {DNA computing has a rich history of computing paradigms with great expressive power. However, far less expressive power is needed for data manipulation. Indeed, the relational algebra, the yardstick of database systems, is expressible in first-order logic, and thus less powerful than Turing-complete models. Turing-complete DNA computing models have to account for many and varied scenarios. A DNA implementation of data manipulations might be nimbler and perform its operation faster than a Turing-complete DNA computing model. Hence, we propose a restrictive model for implementing data manipulation operations, focused on implementability in DNA. We call this model the sticker complex model. A forte of the sticker complex model, is its ability to detect when hybridization becomes an uncontrolled chain reaction. Such chain reactions make hybridization less predictable and thus less attractive for deterministic computations. Next, we define a query language on sticker complexes, called DNAQL. DNAQL is a typed, applicative functional programming language, powerful enough to simulate the relational algebra on sticker complexes. The type system enjoys a number of desirable properties such as soundness, maximality, and tightness.},

Since TDCSP is an NP-complete problem, it is unsolvable in polynomial time on electronic computers. However, using the structure of DNA molecules, DNA computing algorithms are capable to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. In this paper, a DNA computing algorithm based on the sticker model is presented to find the optimal solution to TDCSP.

  abstract     = {Inspired by the phenomenon of migration of monarch butterflies, Wang et al. developed a novel promising swarm intelligence algorithm, called monarch butterfly optimization (MBO), for addressing unconstrained low-dimensional optimization problems. In this paper, we firstly extend the application area of the basic MBO to solve the constrained optimization problems. At the same time, the crossover operator originally used in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is incorporated into the butterfly adjusting operator in order to strengthen the exploitation of the basic MBO algorithm. Furthermore, the crossover rate is self-adaptively adjusted according to the fitness of the corresponding individual instead of the fixed crossover rate used in EAs. For migration operator, only individuals having better fitness are accepted and passed to the next generation instead of accepting all the individuals in the basic MBO algorithm. After incorporated all the modifications into the basic MBO algorithm, an improved MBO algorithm with self-adaptive crossover namely SACMBO, is proposed for unstrained and constrained optimization problems. Finally, the proposed SACMBO algorithm is further used to solve 22 unstrained optimization problems (with dimension of 100, 300, 500, 1000, and 1500) and 28 constrained real-parameter optimization functions from CEC 2017 competition (with dimension of 50 and 100), respectively.

In the suggested problem, one of the objectives is to shorten service time of ships with by coordinating of quay cranes, and the other is to reduce operating costs of quay cranes and yard trucks. Then, a Multi-objective Bacterial Colony Optimization algorithm (MOBCO) incorporating concepts of multi-swarm, topology, personal best and global best, named Multi-objective BCO with ring topology (MORBCO), is designed to handle the resulting problem. The extension of standard MOBCO to the MORBCO involves the addition of three specialized strategies: global chemotaxis operation, elite reproduction strategy and personal best archive with neighborhood communication mechanism. In order to test the performance of the MORBCO, benchmark tests are performed and compared with traditional MOBCO and three other well-known multi-objective algorithms first. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm can outperform other rivals and efficiently solve a variety of multi-objective problems in most of cases. Subsequently, MORBCO and two best performing algorithms from the previous test are applied to three instances generated by the proposed model. Judging by quality and diversity of obtained non-dominant solutions, we find that MORBCO has superior performance, especially for large instances of the container terminal problem.},

FEFERR_ELA employs a multimodal evolutionary algorithm that is capable of producing diverse solutions to search for optimal solutions corresponding to parameters of base learners, where each optimal solution leads to one trained model. A dynamic ensemble selection scheme is applied to select appropriate individuals for the ensemble. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on several benchmark problems and compared with some related ensemble learning models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the related works and can produce the neural network ensembles with better generalization.},

In order to address feature selection problem, this paper uses the multi-objective bacterial foraging optimization algorithm to select the feature subsets and k-nearest neighbor algorithm as the evaluation algorithm. The wheel roulette mechanism is further introduced to remove duplicated features. Four information exchange mechanisms are integrated into the bacteria-inspired algorithm to avoid the individuals getting trapped into the local optima so as to achieve better results in solving high-dimensional feature selection problem.

Traditionally, the real-world datasets contain all kinds of features informative as well as non-informative. These features not only increase computational complexity of the underlying algorithm but also deteriorate its performance. Hence, there an urgent need of feature selection method that select an informative subset of features from high dimensional without compromising the performance of the underlying algorithm. In this paper, we select an informative subset of features and perform cluster analysis by employing a cross breed approach of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA) named as hybrid binary particle swarm optimization and sine cosine algorithm (HBPSOSCA). Here, we employ a V-shaped transfer function to compute the likelihood of changing position for all particles. First, the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on ten benchmark test functions. Second, the HBPSOSCA is used for data clustering problem on seven real-life datasets taken from the UCI machine learning store and gene expression model selector. The performance of proposed method is tested in comparison to original BPSO, modified BPSO with chaotic inertia weight (C-BPSO), binary moth flame optimization algorithm, binary dragonfly algorithm, binary whale optimization algorithm, SCA, and binary artificial bee colony algorithm. The conducted analysis demonstrates that the proposed method HBPSOSCA attain better performance in comparison to the competitive methods in most of the cases.},

However, its key parameters, including the number of hidden nodes, the input weights, the biases and the tradeoff factors are normally generated randomly or preset by human. Moreover, the number of input weights and biases depend on the size of hidden layer. Inappropriate quantity of hidden nodes may lead to the useless or redundant neuron nodes, and make the whole structure complex, even cause the worse generalization and unstable classification performances. Based on this, an adaptive CCR-ELM with variable-length brain storm optimization algorithm is proposed for the class imbalance learning. Each individual consists of all above parameters of CCR-ELM and its length varies with the number of hidden nodes. A novel mergence operator is presented to incorporate two parent individuals with different length and generate a new individual. The experimental results for nine imbalance datasets show that variable-length brain storm optimization algorithm can find better parameters of CCR-ELM, resulting in the better classification accuracy than other evolutionary optimization algorithms, such as GA, PSO, and VPSO. In addition, the classification performance of the proposed adaptive algorithm is relatively stable under varied imbalance ratios. Applying the proposed algorithm in the fault diagnosis of conveyor belt also proves that ACCR-ELM with VLen-BSO has the better classification performances.},

Firstly, all the target grids are connected and the target areas are clustered according to the theory of minimum spanning tree. Secondly, the moving paths of AUVs are studied and divided into two stages: transferring to a target area and detecting in a target grid. And both of the stages are then optimized. Finally, a series of experiments in different cases are carried out, and the cooperative search method through target clustering and path optimization is compared with another two algorithms. Results show that the cooperative search method proposed in this paper can obtain a larger amount of total revenue in the same period of time with more stable performance than the other algorithms.
