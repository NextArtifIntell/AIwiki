  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new happiness model based on fuzzy theory when there exists an external force. Because perception and happiness represent a human mind, they cannot be measured precisely. In addition, it is not appropriate to express the degree of an external force using a precise value. Therefore, we apply fuzzy theory to the external force to measure the vagueness of its degree. The happiness model comprises a new non-autonomous quadratic system that can be constructed equivalent to forms of the Duffing equation. Adding a nonlinear term to the proposed happiness equation and using a sinusoidal external force (SEF) with a triangular fuzzy number (TFN) for happiness, we confirm that there are typical routes of chaotic behaviors, including periodic doubling, chaotic motion, and periodic windows. For these, we applied two methods. First, we fixed the parameters $${\varvec{c}},{\varvec{d}},{\varvec{\beta}},{\varvec{\omega}},$$ and A and varied the parameter s from 0 to − 1. Second, we fixed $${\varvec{c}},\,{\varvec{d}},\,{\varvec{\beta}},\,{\varvec{\omega}},\,\,{\text{and}}\,{\varvec{s}},$$ and varied the parameter A from 0.1 to 1. Finally, we show the route of chaotic behaviors by using time series, phase portraits, Poincare map, bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent.},

  abstract     = {The spread of COVID-19 has triggered one of the largest pandemics in modern human history. Humanity is still in the incomplete information period for this infectious disease, and how to effectively deal with such a major public crisis is a crucial problem. Although there are divergences in human natural semantics, the incomplete information increases it. Therefore, this study integrates the neutrosophic set and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to explore the key factors which would prevent expansion of the epidemic in the face of incomplete knowledge. The neutrosophic set technique is an effective tool for the representation of the ambiguity of natural human semantic expression, for the analysis of incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent information. DEMATEL is used to explore the causes and effects between factors and to generate an influential network relationship map. The results of analysis can help the government and relevant organizations to understand the cause and effect relationship between the factors and set appropriate prevention strategies. The results of this study show that the incorporation of neutrosophic set theory leads to a more meaningful evaluation under incomplete information. “Detect” is a key factor affecting the entire system. The results of this study contribute to the advancement and development of scientifically based decision-making by helping governments and relevant organizations to understand the causal relationships between factors, to set appropriate prevention strategies.},

Determining the factors that influence services to high-net-worth customers who typically have large investments in the financial markets is important for wealth management banks. This study constructs a hybrid approach by integrating the fuzzy logic and Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to identify the most influential criteria affecting the performance of wealth management banks in Taiwan during the 2019–2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys and interviews are designed using four dimensions (bank performance, service quality, customer relationship, and COVID-19) and 16 criteria for 10 banking executives using fuzzy linguistic scales, to obtain their expert opinions. The results show the order of influence as being service quality, customer relationships, bank performance, and COVID-19. The most important criteria are customized investment information (in-service quality), switching behavior (in-customer relationship), fee income (in-bank performance), and the number of confirmed cases in the top five countries affected by COVID-19. The managerial implication is that wealth management banks should focus on improving their service quality. Banks may strive to provide a wide range of customized investment information and increase customers’ usage of personalized financial products and services. The results of this study will benefit bank managers in serving high-net-worth individuals during the crisis period.},

  abstract     = {Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease has become a global health burden. Early detection of one of its potential prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), appears to be critical for early interventions. The present study, therefore, addressed the challenging issue of classifying individuals with MCI vs. healthy controls (HC) based on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, we design a feature extraction and feature fusion framework to extract discriminative features. In the first step, we extracted the sample entropy (SampEn) and Katz’s fractal dimension (KFD) features from their corresponding best electrodes selected by a wrapper-based algorithm. Next, the two best feature sets were fused by a principal component analysis (PCA) method. The eigen-complexity pattern (ECP) feature extracted by this framework was subsequently fed into the proposed MCI detector, the conformal kernel-based fuzzy support vector machine (CKF-SVM). The CKF-SVM not only adopts a fuzzified penalty strategy to avoid the overfitting often observed in conventional SVM due to outliers, but also applies a conformally transformed kernel to further increase the class separability. The results carried out on 51 participants (24 MCI, 27 HC) and leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) show that the ECP feature combined with a simple linear discriminant analysis classifier achieved an accuracy of 84.31%, higher than the one by either of the two complexity measures (SampEn and KFD), as well as the ones by spectral powers of different scalp regions. The results also show that CKF-SVM outperformed SVM and other classifiers commonly used in the MCI-HC classification studies. A high LOPO-CV accuracy 90.19% (sensitivity = 87.50%, specificity = 92.60%) was achieved by using the ECP feature and the CKF-SVM classifier. These results suggested that the proposed approach has a potential for developing a sensitive EEG-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that may, in the future, provide an objective measure to assist physicians’ diagnose of MCI and even a neurofeedback brain–computer interface (BCI) system for monitoring the intervention response of individuals with MCI.},

  abstract     = {In a motor imagery-based brain–computer interface system, an effective classifier is required. However, the effectiveness of classifier is substantially influenced by the individual differences among electroencephalography (EEG) signals and artifacts. Therefore, in this study, we adopted an ensemble method by combining various classifiers, including a fuzzy classifier that can reduce the influence of artifacts, to improve the robustness and accuracy in classification across participants. Nine participants were recruited for the experiment and asked to perform a left- and right-hand motor imagery task. We calculated the classification rates obtained with the linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and fuzzy twin SVM (FTSVM) classifiers based on the spectral features extracted by an autoregressive (AR) model and the spectral–temporal features extracted by the Morlet wavelet from overlapped 1.024-s EEG segments. The fivefold cross-validation accuracies of the ensemble method for the 1.024-s EEG were 71.39% and 73.06% with the AR- and wavelet-extracted features, respectively. In the comparison of individual classifiers, the Linear-FTSVM method outperformed other individual classifiers. In addition, the ensemble model with the inclusion of FTSVM classifiers performs superior to the ensemble models without using FTSVM classifiers.},

Approval was received from the Institutional Review Board of Fu Jen Catholic University for conducting experimental testing on healthy individuals with the designed mobile OGTS. The designed system comprises a mobile electric walking aid (EWA), a body weight support system (BWSS), and an exoskeleton gait orthosis (EGO). The system can perform multiple functions for physical overground gait training. The mobile EWA and EGO can be operated separately from the mobile OGTS. An interval type-2 fuzzy sliding controller (IT2FSC) was designed to compensate for disturbances and uncertainties because the mobile OGTS has a coupling issue and potential subjects have different weights and body shapes. The mobile OGTS has one IT2FSC to provide a pulse-width modulation output to regulate two linear actuators for the BWSS, and it adopts four IT2FSCs to produce voltage outputs to control the gait trajectory of the EGO. Three experiments demonstrated that the mobile OGTS provides a stable control force to assist the user in overground gait training as well as assist-as-needed body weight support for gait training.},

By the help of the LMIs-constrained multiobjective evolution algorithm (LMIs-constrained MOEA), one can obtain the Pareto optimal controller. However, the existing LMIs-constrained MOEA usually couples with a heavy computational load. This study proposes the front-squeezing LMIs-constrained MOEA to resolve such a computational cost problem.

The applicability of the TrBF-EDAS is demonstrated through an illustrative application with a real background concerning the selection of a medical device that can perform image-based assays dealing with dead and live cell count, cell viability. In this context, this selection process of the most desirable device to be used in cell culture studies in the department of medical biology in a faculty of medicine in Turkey is performed employing the TrBF-EDAS concerning the opinions of five decision-makers who are experts in their fields. In the study, computational analyses are performed to validate the TrBF-EDAS method. To this end, 24 cases are generated by determining randomly different weights of criteria. For all cases, the preference rankings determined by the TrBF-EDAS are compared with the outputs obtained by the TrBF-TOPSIS and TrBF-VIKOR, known in the literature, statistically. Finally, based on the computational results, it is worth noting that TrBF-EDAS is an efficient and useful tool to evaluate the alternatives in any system in which there is fuzzy bipolar information.},

Secondly, some aggregation operators of B $$P_{c}$$ FSs are constructed to accumulate the bipolar picture fuzzy (B $$P_{c}$$ F) data. Thirdly, the features of these aggregation operators are penned and then based on these aggregation operators a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is developed to resolve the vague data. In the end, an illustrated example of the investment of money is put forward to show the authenticity and efficacy of the suggested approach. Moreover, B $$P_{c}$$ F-TOPSIS, B $$P_{c}$$ F-VIKOR, and sensitivity analysis (SA) have been used to provide the strength and practicality of the proposed MCDM model.},

By introducing fuzzy logic system, the difficulties caused by unknown nonlinear functions and nonstrict-feedback are overcome. Considering the asymmetric dead zone input, an adaptive tracking controller is constructed by integrating the fuzzy logic system into the backstepping technology. The controller can not only realize the output signal tracking reference signal with a small tracking error, but also ensure that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability.

The unknown DZINs in the FONSs will cause FONSs instability. In this paper, by using the fractional-order Lyapunov stability theory, a variable structure adaptive fuzzy control (AFC) scheme is designed to solve the unknown DZINs in the FONSs. The unknown terms of the FONSs and the uncertain terms of DZINs are handled by fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). The parameters boundedness of FLSs is guaranteed via the constructed fractional-order adaptive laws (FOALs). By using FLSs, this paper does not need to know the exact values of gain reduction tolerances (GRTs) in the unknown DZINs, which makes the constructed scheme more suitable for the actual system. The scheme proposed in this paper can be used to effectively control the Riemann–Liouville FONSs and the Caputo FONSs with/without unknown DZINs. Finally, three simulation results verify the AFCs we designed are effective for both Riemann–Liouville FONSs and Caputo FONSs with unknown DZINs.},

Firstly, a fuzzy state observer (FSO) is developed to obtain the unmeasured velocities and approximate the uncertain dynamics of the DP system. Then, the vectorial backstepping technique is adopted to design a feedforward controller. A FLS-based single critic structure is established to approximate the performance index function. Subsequently, an adaptive optimal feedback controller is presented by utilizing adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method. Furthermore, the unknown environmental disturbances are estimated by a disturbance observer (DO) via the FSO to make the DP system robust. Therefore, the entire DP optimal control scheme is comprised of a feedforward controller, a feedback controller and an estimation of disturbances. The proposed robust adaptive optimal tracking control method can track the desired trajectory, and it is proved that all signals in the closed-loop DP system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed DP control scheme.},

This study integrates the views of enterprises and those of customers to build a BA-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model and adopts consistent fuzzy linguistic preference relations (CFLPR) to conduct empirical research on three car brands, namely Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, by analyzing differences in customers’ BA preference to the three brands and assessing management performance. Findings reveal that the customers of the two German brands, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, emphasize hedonic needs while customers of Lexus, the Japanese brand, stress on bonds of personal emotional factors. Apart from being able to measure the precise strength of customers’ BAs, this analytic model can also help enterprises to examine changes of factors concerning customers’ BA on a regular basis as well as serving as the foundation for evoking consumers’ identification about brand personality, consolidating brand loyalty, and developing marketing communications strategies.},

In this paper, a multi-attribute evaluation model based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets(IT2 FSs) is constructed and applied to service quality evaluation. First, an area similarity measure algorithm is proposed to calculate the similarity between two trapezoidal IT2 FSs. With the area similarity measure, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is modified to act as the evaluation approach. The evaluation model is then applied to a public transport service evaluation problem to sort each evaluation dimension to the predefined classes. The comparative analysis shows that our model can give more separated classifying results, which means a larger amount of information can be provided to decision-makers.},

  abstract     = {In multiple attribute decision analysis (MADA), the determination of attribute weights by using discriminating power (DCP) has become an important research topic. However, the reliability of a solution, which is an important factor in improving decision quality, has not been considered in existing studies on determining attribute weights with DCP. To address this, a method is proposed to objectively determine attribute weights with belief distributions (BDs) by considering three types of heterogeneous DCP (HDCP) and high solution reliability. The three types of HDCP in BDs are constructed to generate three sets of attribute weights in terms of entropy, deviation maximization and criteria importance through intercriteria correlation. The difference of belief degrees on grades and variation of the ordered preference intensity of grades are simultaneously considered in the HDCP. Three rules are proposed based on the majority principle to deal with possible conflicts among the three sets of attribute weights. By incorporating the three rules as constraints, a mixed-integer optimization model with the aim of maximizing the solution reliability is constructed to generate an integrated set of attribute weights. The maximum solution reliability will guarantee that the generated solution is satisfactory for the decision maker. Based on the integrated set of attribute weights, a pair of optimization models is further constructed on the condition that the solution reliability is the largest to determine the minimal and maximal expected utilities of the given alternatives, which will be further applied to generate a solution to the MADA problem. A strategic project selection problem is investigated using the proposed method to verify its applicability and validity.},

In this paper, we reveal the inherent deficiency of FCM and propose a new fuzzy clustering method called Gaussian Collaborative Fuzzy C-means (GCFCM) to solve these problems. In GCFCM, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and collaborative technology are adopted to enhance the ability of recognizing the intrinsic structure of clusters. Experimental results confirm that GCFCM is effective in dealing with noise, non-spherical clusters, size-imbalanced clusters, and those also show excellent performance in dealing with real-world data sets.},

Multiplicative probabilistic linguistic preference relations (MPLPRs) can solve this problem. The consistency of preference relations is crucial to ensure reliable decision results. We define the ordinal consistency of MPLPRs, and improve the ordinal consistency of MPLPRs. In order to facilitate calculation, the mapping from probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) to linguistic term is defined. In probabilistic linguistic information decision-making methods, some methods only collect the information of the decision matrix, and some methods only collect the information of the preference matrix, and almost no decision method that uses the decision matrix and the preference relation information at the same time, but the optimal ranking of alternatives is obtained according to the comprehensive attribute of alternatives. Based on the above considerations, first, we construct a nonlinear objective optimization model containing alternative attributes and alternative preferences. Then, a probabilistic linguistic group decision-making method based on attribute decision and multiplicative preference relations is further proposed. Finally, the feasibility of the method is illustrated by an example of hospital evaluation, and the advantages of the proposed method are verified by comparing the differences between the proposed method and other methods.},

A finite-time performance function (FTPF) is introduced in the backstepping design process to guarantee that the tracking error satisfies the predefined performance in a finite time. An improved event-triggered control mechanism is introduced to reduce the communication burden from the controller to the actuator.

First, an IT2 T–S fuzzy model is used to describe the nonlinear plant and the filter subject to parameter uncertainties, which can be captured with the lower and upper membership functions. Then, an event-triggered scheme and a quantizer are proposed to reduce the unnecessary waste of the network resources. Second, the asynchronous premise variables problem is considered in the design of the fuzzy filter, which means that the premise variable of the designed filter needs not to be identical with the plant. Third, by constructing a Lyapunov–Krasovskii function with quadruple integral items, and employing the Wirtinger inequality and some slack matrices, a stability condition with less conservative is obtained. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Existing literatures on DEMATEL focus on static decision environment at single time node. However, due to the increasingly complex and rapidly changing socioeconomic environment, decision-making has become more complex and dynamic. In this paper, dynamic group DEMATEL method based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) is proposed. In the view of the multi-stage, multi-factor and multi-expert complex decision-making situation, the method fully integrates the decision-making information of different periods from the perspective of dynamic evolution mechanism which can effectively link multi rounds DEMATEL decision-making process and reflect the time evolution of dynamic decision-making. Meanwhile, the TOPSIS method is applied to determine the weight of experts, which can effectively solve the influence of the best choice (positive ideal solution) and the worst choice (negative ideal solution) on the decision results in aggregation of group experts&#39; preference information, and fully consider the influence of hesitation and fuzziness of expert preference representation on expert weight. Finally, a numerical comparison is given to verify validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We proposed the fuzzy parameters dependent filtering to estimate the state variables for nonlinear stochastic systems. In general, it is difficult to solve the filtering parameters under the hybrid modeling technique of the sampled-data. And the discrete feedback property under the input-delay technique of the sampled-data always disappears. Therefore, we introduce the improved hybrid modeling technique to keep the discrete feedback property of the closed-loop systems. Next, the improved time-varying Lyapunov function method is adopted to analyze the remodeled hybrid systems. Then the sufficient conditions of mean-squared exponential stability and $${\mathscr {H}}_\infty$$ performance of the filtering error systems are obtained and the parameters of the fuzzy filtering can be solved. The proposed improved hybrid modeling technique can be widely applied to practically address the $${\mathscr {H}}_\infty$$ filtering design problem.

  abstract     = {The vendor managed inventory (VMI) is the most commonly known marketing and distribution methodology among the service provider and the retailer in a supply chain environment. The VMI framework&#39;s critical feature is to satisfy the demand of the products or items by the supplier rapidly generated from the retailers with the number of orders (order quantities). Due to the business&#39;s changing conditions, necessities of the particular product, production cycle, and manufacturing expenses, the VMI system&#39;s demand and order quantity are highly uncertain. Therefore, the total cost of a VMI system possesses higher-order uncertainties for a real-world scenario. This paper proposes a novel interval type-2 fuzzy vendor managed inventory (IT2FVMI) system, in which demand and order quantity are represented by the interval type-2 fuzzy numbers. The proposed IT2FVMI model aims to minimize the overall cost for the single vendor-retailer business, merchandise of multi-product, and a centralized warehouse of retailers&#39; inventory managed by the vendor. Since the proposed model is an NP-hard, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based solution approach is developed for solving it appropriately. Moreover, we have also formulated the classical/crisp VMI model and type-1 fuzzy vendor managed inventory (T1FVMI) model via considering demand and order quantity as the deterministic and the type-1 fuzzy numbers, respectively. The proposed solution technique is capable of solving both crisp VMI and T1FVMI problems. An appropriate real-world application is considered to conduct experimental simulations for the five test problems that displayed the various situations, and the minimum costs of the models are obtained. All the three models are thoroughly analyzed, and from comparison, it is demonstrated that the proposed IT2FVMI model outperforms both T1FVMI and crisp VMI models by providing a more trustworthy solution in terms of minimum cost, statistical analysis, and significantly faster convergence.},

The process, however, often leads to ignoring some requirements due to the budget limitations, without considering the impact of those requirements on the values of the selected requirements. That may lead to user dissatisfaction and financial losses in software projects. To mitigate this problem, we propose a method that allows for partial satisfaction (selection) of software requirements rather than ignoring them, when tolerated. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have carried out experiments; our initial results suggest that the method mitigates value loss by reducing the chances that requirements with positive influences are ignored.},

Firstly, an adaptive fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable states of the vessel. To guarantee the robustness of the system, a kind of sliding mode intermediate variable with the improved approaching law is constructed to eliminate the chattering effect and the vessel can obtain a better control performance. By combining with the relative threshold event-triggered strategy, the controllers only update when the triggering conditions are met. Hence, the update frequency of controllers and the loss of actuators are enormously decreased in contrast with the fixed threshold event-triggered control law. Theoretical analysis proves that the tracking error can converge into a compact set, meanwhile the Zeno behavior is avoided. Simulation results and comparative analysis indicate the availability and superiority of the designed controllers.},

This structure allows us to obtain different knowledge than the one obtained from standard classifiers. With a BN, representing a dataset, we can calculate different probabilities about a set of features with respect to other ones. This inference can be more powerful than the one obtained from classifiers. A BN can be built from data and have analytical and diagnostic capabilities that make it very suitable for credit domains. Credit scoring and risk analysis are fundamental tasks for financial institutions with the aim to avoid important losses. In these tasks and other domains, an excessive number of features can convert a BN into a complex and difficult to interpret model, but a few number of features can represent a loss of information obtained from data. A new method based on imprecise probabilities is presented to select an informative subset of features. Using this new feature selection method, we can build a BN that has an excellent adjustment to the data, considering a reduced number of features. Via a set of experiments, it is shown that the adjustment is better than the ones obtained with no previous variable selection method and with a similar and successful variable subset selection method based on precise probabilities. Finally, a BN is built with two important characteristics: (i) it represents a better adjustment to the data; and (ii) it has a low complexity (better interpretability) due to the small number of important selected features. A practical example about inference on a BN to help on credit risk analysis is also presented.},

The paper deals with the development of a decision support framework for the prioritization of suppliers on sustainability factors. The framework is based on the combined approach of the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and the fuzzy inference system (FIS) to evaluate the supplier for the benefit of the manufacturer. The role of AHP is to select the significant factors as criteria, while the FIS mechanism works to measure the sustainability index of each supplier for prioritization from the combined effect of the selected factors. In the ranking process, experts’ opinions on the importance of deciding the criteria (developed by the AHP) are considered in linguistic terms. To handle the subjectivity of decision makers assessments, fuzzy logic has been applied using FIS. In addition, uncertainties in the decision making support system are overcome by considering the fuzzy set theory for the selected sustainable factors. A numerical experiment is carried out to consider seven suppliers working with the goalkeeping gloves manufacturing firm for the pragmatic application of the proposed framework. The methodology of the integrated AHP–FIS approach is utilized to rank the suppliers by calculating the sustainability index value. The proposed approach provides a platform for the manufacturer to better understand the capability, sustainable suppliers must possess to continue working with them for the sustainable supply chain management.},

  abstract     = {The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is employed in a vast range of applications because of its smoothness (by Fuzzy Control (FC)) and adaptability (by Neural Network (NN)). Although ANFIS is better in nonlinear optimization, two major loopholes need to be addressed thoroughly. They are the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity. To overcome these complications, a novel usage of the ANFIS model is proposed as Cascaded ANFIS in this paper. As the primary source of this algorithm, a general two-input one-output ANFIS algorithm is used. The novel algorithm has two main modules called pair selection and training model. Pair selection is responsible for selecting the best match for the inputs, while the training module generates the output. The cascaded behavior of the novel algorithm generates additional iterations to advance the best solution. Even though the number of parameters that need to be adjusted is increasing at each additional iteration, the complexity of the algorithm may stay stable. Two-hybrid state-of-the-art algorithms are used to compare the performance of the novel algorithm, namely, Particle Swarm Optimization-based ANFIS (ANFIS-PSO) and Genetic Algorithm-based ANFIS (ANFIS-GA). Furthermore, individual performance is presented for seven publicly recognized datasets. The results have demonstrated that, for some datasets, the root means square error (RMSE) can be minimum as 0.0001.},

  abstract     = {Let us have a population of objects that are subjected to a given event. Each object can be assigned a degree of membership to the population. Assume that for a set of objects, a continuous parameter is measured before and after the given event. We can now form two paired fuzzy samples from the population—Z1 and Z2. We then measure the change ΔZ of Z from Z2 to Z1 and form the fuzzy sample of change Z3. Our aim is to explore if the event has caused statistically significant change ΔZ of Z for that Population. Therefore, we conduct statistical tests for nullity of the central tendencies (mean, median) of change over paired fuzzy samples. We develop two Bootstrap based simulation algorithms to identify the pvalue of such tests for the mean of change and for the median of change. Each of the algorithms has eight modifications depending on: (a) whether the synthetic fuzzy samples were generated using ‘quasi-equal-information generation’ (i.e. synthetic fuzzy samples with almost equal amount of information as the original ones) or using ‘equal-size generation’ (i.e. synthetic fuzzy samples with the same size of fuzzy observations as the original ones); (b) whether the approximated sample cumulative distribution functions (CDF) for the synthetic samples generation are empirical (ECDF), or fuzzy empirical (FECDF); (c) whether we perform a one-tail or two-tail test. We demonstrate the consistency of the developed fuzzy Bootstrap nullity tests on two numerical examples where the central tendencies of change are known. We also present a medical case study, where we compare the proposed techniques with an alternative one that utilizes crisp tests. In that case study, we demonstrate the advantages of fuzzy Bootstrap nullity tests in comparison to standard crisp methods over central tendencies. In our discussions, we outline that to declare significance of change, we focus on a whole cluster of tests over fuzzy paired samples as opposed to relying on individual test results.},

Such problems negatively affect their lives. Thus, access to long-term care is a critical issue for older adults. In response to the aforementioned serious health issues, society must strive to provide a supportive and effective rehabilitation environment for older adults. This study designed an intelligent active and passive limb rehabilitation system to track and quantify the effectiveness of joint movements in patients automatically. The proposed method uses a camera and PoseNet to capture key feature information regarding human skeleton nodes and identify rehabilitation actions through joint movements. In addition, to solve the problem of joint occlusion during joint angle measurement, the designed system is equipped with a self-designed inertial measurement unit with GY-85 nine-axis sensors, which are mounted on the occluding part of the joints. A fuzzy inference system was developed to provide scores, suggestions, and encouragement for each rehabilitation session. This system also provides an interactive interface for users to monitor each rehabilitation session and examine whether rehabilitation is performed accurately.},

It is called cyclic pursuit-fuzzy PD control method. The control process is divided into different fuzzy sets, for which different control coefficients are set.

The detuning will increase the required capacity of the power supply and reduce the transfer efficiency of the system. To solve this problem, this paper analyzes the relation between the input impedance angle of the primary side and the resonant state and proposes an adaptive frequency tracking control (AFTC) method based on the fuzzy PI compound controller. In this method, a fuzzy PI compound controller is used to control the impedance angle (θ = 0), which can make the operating frequency to track the resonant frequency, so that the MCR-WPT system can maintain in the resonant state. The experimental results show that the AFTC method can make the operating frequency to track the resonant frequency faster and accurately during the parameter variations so that the MCR-WPT system can maintain in the resonant state and achieve the higher output power and system efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) plays an important role in ocean research and exploration. The underwater environment has a great influence on AUV control and human–robot interaction, since underwater environment is highly dynamic with unpredictable fluctuation of water flow, high pressure and light attenuation. The traditional control model contains a large number of parameters, which is not effective and produces errors frequently. The proposal of fuzzy control addressed this issue to a certain extent. It applies fuzzy variables to the controller, which replace the values in an interval. In addition to the controller, underwater human–robot interaction is also difficult. Divers cannot speak or show any facial expressions underwater. The buttons on the AUV also need to overcome the huge water pressure. In this paper, we proposed a method to recognize the gesture instructions and apply it to the fuzzy control of AUV. Our contribution is the gesture recognition framework for the human–robot interaction, including the gesture detection network and the algorithm for the control of AUV. The experiment result shows the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {As autonomous ships become the future trend for maritime transportation, it is of importance to develop intelligent autonomous navigation systems to ensure the navigation safety of ships. Among the three core components (sensing, planning and control modules) of the system, an accurate detection of target ships’ navigation information is critical. Within a typical maritime environment, the existence of sensor noises as well as the influences generated by varying environment conditions largely limit the reliability of using a single sensor for environment awareness. It is therefore vital to use multiple sensors together with a multi-sensor data fusion technology to improve the detection performance. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based multi-sensor data fusion algorithm for moving target ships detection has been proposed and designed using both AIS and radar information. A two-stage fuzzy logic association method has been particularly developed and integrated with Kalman filtering to achieve a computationally efficient performance. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been tested and validated in simulations where multiple target ships are transiting with complex movements.},

Within the distributed surge and yaw controller design, the unknown dynamics and the ocean disturbances are lumped together by using a linear state transformation. And a prediction-based fuzzy state observer (PFSO) is devised for estimating the unmeasured lumped states, where prediction errors are used to update fuzzy weights. Through the Lyapunov analysis, it is proven that surge and yaw-tracking errors and state observation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded.

Based on the previous research, the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is selected as the low-level driving motor, and it is combined with the propeller to form the low-level thrusters for the DPS. The fuzzy control strategy is selected for the PMSM controller design, and the proposed chaotic random distribution harmony search (CRDHS) algorithm is used to optimize the fuzzy controller rules’ weights. The proposed CRDHS employs a chaotic map for rule weight adaptation in order to prevent the conventional harmony search to get stuck on local solutions. By adjusting the weights of each fuzzy rule via CRDHS, more consistent control performance is achieved. The required fuzzy output and the fuzzy controller are used for control of the PMSM.

To achieve a precise estimation of AUV’s motion, the variable multi-dimensional fuzzy predictor employs a sliding data window (SDW) as the system status observer, and uses the Delaunay triangulation partition method for model construction. The predictive control scheme takes advantages of the constraints-tolerance of predictive control, the uncertainty immunity of fuzzy logic calculation, and the adaptability of variable fuzzy model.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy logic controller for three-phase four-wire unified power quality conditioner (UPQC). Here, TS fuzzy controller uses numerical consequent rule, which can be either a linear expression or a constant. In this premise, the efficiency of the proposed controller with linear consequent rules is analyzed for DC-link voltage regulation and hysteresis band calculation of both shunt and series voltage source inverters. Mamdani-type fuzzy logic controller has limitation in providing a broad range of variation in gaining control over UPQC to solve various power quality problems during load transients and source voltage fluctuations. The proposed controller provides a wide range of variation in gaining control, which results in improved tracking performances of UPQC during the transient, unbalanced load and distortions which are observed in the power system. Synchronous reference frame theory is implemented with two steps, viz., Generation of current reference signal and Generation of reference voltage signal. TS controller reduces the complexity using brief computation, whereas Mamdani system involves several fuzzy rules that makes it complicated. To control hysteresis band for shunt and series inverters, the fuzzy logic controller is modeled with the implementation of linear rules. The proposed controller is validated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Adequate results of comparison with proposed Takagi–Sugeno-type fuzzy controller and Mamdani-type fuzzy controller are reported.},

Then, by using the FE information, a fuzzy fault-tolerant controller is designed to guarantee the stability of the system. Additionally, in the design schemes of the FE observer and the fault-tolerant controller, the $${L_\infty }$$ method is used to deal with the problems of FE and FTC for the system with persistent disturbance such that the robustness of the system against the persistent external disturbance can be increased. Compared with the traditional $${H_\infty }$$ method which is only applicable for dealing with the energy bounded signals, the $${L_\infty }$$ FTC strategy proposed in this paper can deal with the persistent disturbance such that the shortcomings of the traditional $${H_\infty }$$ approach are overcome.

First, we propose two types of pre-processing methods to complete probability normalization. Accordingly, the normalized PLTS is represented in the form of probabilistic linguistic probability distribution (PLPD). Then, probabilistic linguistic earth-mover (PLEM) distance is constructed to measure the divergency between PLPDs, and a probabilistic linguistic probability distribution weighted mean (PLPDWM) is also developed to facilitate information fusion. On this basis, an aggregation operator-based MCDM approach is established that integrates the probability distribution-based PLTS processing methods and the proposed worst-priority weight (WPW) method. Finally, the developed approach is demonstrated by solving a practical atmospheric pollutant evaluation problem and its strengths are verified through further sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.},

However, experts’ bounded rationality, imprecise risk assessments and unobjective risk factors’ weights are prominent challenges existed in the conventional FMEA model. Thus, to better meet the challenges and further improve the performance of FMEA, this paper constructs a novel FMEA model for risk ranking by integrating the TODIM with the PROMETHEE II technique under q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment. Considering the fuzziness and uncertainty in risk assessments, q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) are utilized to assist experts in describing their actual opinions concerning each failure modes flexibly and freely. Further, based on the proposed normalized projection model for q-ROFSs, a comprehensive criteria weighting determination method is employed for obtaining the optimal weights and a novel distance measurement of q-ROFSs is also further presented. Subsequently, the integrated TODIM-PROMETHEE II technique is developed for ranking failure modes, which has the ability of considering risk aversion behavior of experts. After that, the detailed steps are depicted via a representative case in blood transfusion. Finally, the comparative analysis is conducted to verify the stable and superiority of the FMEA method proposed in this paper. The proposed method under q-ROF environment can solve some cases which the traditional FMEA technique cannot, as well as helping experts to express their opinions flexibly, which improves the implementation accuracy of the FMEA.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy Q-learning extends Q-learning to continuous state space and has been applied to a wide range of applications such as robot control. But in a multi-agent system, the non-stationary environment makes joint policy challenging to converge. To give agents more suitable rewards in a multi-agent environment, a multi-agent reward-iteration fuzzy Q-learning (RIFQ) is proposed for multi-agent cooperative tasks. The state space is divided into three channels by the proposed state-divider with fuzzy logic. The reward of an agent is reshaped iteratively according to its state, and the update sequence is constructed by calculating the relation among states of different agents. Then, the value functions are updated top-down. By replacing the reward given by the environment with the reshaped reward, agents can avoid the most unreasonable punishments and receive rewards selectively. RIFQ provides a feasible reward relationship for multi-agents, which makes the training of multi-agent more steady. Several simulation experiments show that RIFQ is not limited by the number of agents and has a faster convergence speed than baselines.},

  abstract     = {High-utility itemsets mining (HUIM) has attracted considerable attention due to its superior performance in discovering the profitable itemsets from databases. Generally, an itemset is discovered as a high-utility itemset (HUI) by HUIM only if its utility (such as profit) is higher than a predefined utility threshold. The previous HUIM methods cannot address the sharp boundary problem and the efficiency problem simultaneously. To tackle the above problems, we take the attempt to combine the fuzzy set theory and the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in the HUIM method, which is called EA-HUFIM. For the proposed EA-HUFIM, it is challenging to design an appropriate EA and a suitable fitness function. Therefore, we focus on analyzing the characteristics of fuzzy-based HUI (i.e., HUFI) and present a theorem and a lemma based on a new concept, the high database-max utility fuzzy itemsets (HDFIs). The fitness function adopted in the EA-HUFIM method is inspired by the proposed lemma. Besides, we present a general EA framework with considering the elite learning strategy. The top K 1-HUFIs and top K 1-HDFIs are stored as an elite archive for further offspring production. To improve efficiency, we further employ a fuzzy map and a transaction map to propose a novel preprocessing method, and thus, the computational costs can be reduced. Experiments on several datasets and the results demonstrate that the EA-HUFIM method is effective in quantitative databases.},

  abstract     = {Smartphones are essential personal belongings today. However, smartphone buyers (SBs) are often hesitant in deciding what the best smartphone and rate plan to choose offered by telecom providers. Among many new smartphones, it is often difficult for users to choose the most suitable one in consideration of reaching the salient success aspiration level (SSAL) as close as possible, e.g., large battery capacity, and avoiding falling below the survival aspiration level (SAL) as far as possible, e.g., budget limitation, simultaneously. A novel hybrid weighted SSAL-SAL fuzzy goal programming (FGP) is proposed to assist SBs in finding satisfactory smartphones of their preferences with suitable rate plans. To meet different preferences, SBs can easily set different weights for each smartphone selection goal with linguistic terms, such as high, average, and low. In addition, these linguistic terms can easily be transformed into trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The weights are then attached to goals in the objective function in the weighted SSAL-SAL-FGP model for choosing the most suitable smartphone. Moreover, this study also allows SBs to set the goal satisfaction levels as a preemptive priority for each goal in the FGP to find the most suitable rate plan option for the selected smartphone. The proposed approach allows SBs to select the best smartphones with suitable rate plans considering their priority preferences. In addition, SBs can save costs and precious time in finding their ideal smartphones and rate plan options. Finally, various examples are used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed weighted SSAL-SAL-FGP model, which allows SBs to set different weights for each goal with the intuitive method, such as linguistic terms or preemptive priority to select appropriate smartphones with suitable rate plans to match their habits and budgets. Besides, this study distributed an online questionnaire to investigate smartphone owners and found that female smartphone owners consider the battery capacity and the weight of the smartphone more crucial than the other criteria, while male smartphone owners prefer a smartphone with bigger screen size.},

  abstract     = {The early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is important to reduce deaths due to this disease. Images of patients with PD obtained through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluids; images of these components provide physicians with important information to determine the severity of the disease. Therefore, methods for segmenting these regions in images have been employed. However, difficulties have been encountered in the segmentation of the PD MRI images owing to the unclear boundaries between the gray matter and white matter and the regions being contained in homogeneous and unclear structures. Therefore, we propose a hybrid wavelet k-means clustering (KMC) and fuzzy median filter (FMF) method. First, detailed information from the MRI images was extracted using discrete wavelet transform; these images were enhanced by increasing the pixel values. The enhanced images were then fed into the KMC model for segmentation. Finally, the segmented images were input into the FMF for removing uncertainty and noise. This method can also be used for segmenting the MRI images of other diseases such as tuberous sclerosis (TBS) and atrial fibrillation (AF). The results of a qualitative and quantitative evaluation conducted using an open-source benchmark dataset and a clinical dataset were presented. The peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and mean-squared error were used to compare the efficiency of the proposed method with that of other segmentation methods. The results proved that the proposed method can assist in the early detection of PD, TBS, and AF from MRI.},

  abstract     = {Thermal energy is the energy from a substance in which molecules and atoms vibrate faster because of an increase in temperature. Thermal energy storage (TES) is an available energy resource for renewable energy platforms that enables them to meet sustainable technical requirements. The TES technique is divided into three categories; sensible TES, latent-heat TES, and thermo-chemical TES. The best of these techniques is selected in this research paper. Here the Interval-Valued Hesitant Pythagorean Fuzzy Set (IVPHFS) under the Normal Wiggly Mathematical Methodology is proposed and described for application to multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technology. The MCDM methods, the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for determining weight values, and the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method for ranking alternative values are used employed here. The alternative values are selected based on the following criteria: capacity, efficiency, storage period, charging and discharging times, and cost},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems are very common in the real world. The complexity of the problem necessitates a solution method that is more in line with the decision-making habits of decision-makers (DMs). This paper introduces a novel type of integrated linguistic information, namely, the Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Sets (PHFLSs), which combines the concepts of Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Sets and Probabilistic Linguistic Term Sets for solving MCGDM problems. By integrating PHFLSs into the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations II (PROMETHEE II), a group decision-making framework is constructed to effectively generate the best decision given various evaluations from multiple DMs. More specifically, the DMs’ assessments are first developed and normalized based on PHFLSs definitions. Then the Hausdorff distance is employed to compute the distances between different PHFLSs, from which the weights of criteria are derived and then fed into PROMETHEE II for the best group decision. To demonstrate the practicality and capability of the proposed decision framework, a case study on seeking the best open-source software project is presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {A supercapacitor (SC)-based interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive including the speed tracking of a specific velocity profile and the charging of the SC is developed in this study to emulate the operation of an urban light rail vehicle (LRV). In the SC-based IPMSM drive, the motoring mode to emulate the LRV speed tracking control and the charging mode for the charging of the SC are both designed. In the motoring mode, a field-oriented controlled (FOC) IPMSM drive system is developed to emulate the speed control of an LRV. In the charging mode, the constant current and constant voltage (CC–CV) charging strategy is developed for the charging of the SC. Moreover, the above two modes use the same inverter and coordinate transformations to reduce the design complexity. Furthermore, in order to test the performance of SC, the speed command of the emulated LRV is obtained using a specific testing driving cycle. The design objective is for fast charging of SC being able to provide enough energy for the emulated LRV to operate a full testing driving cycle. In addition, to improve the transient speed response of the emulated LRV, a Chebyshev fuzzy neural network (CheFNN) intelligent speed controller is proposed. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed CC–CV charging strategy for the SC and the proposed CheFNN speed controller for the emulated LRV.},

Firstly, a more general actuator fault model is considered and the fuzzy reliable observer-based control scheme is designed. By applying the new Lyapunov functional candidates, free-weighting matrix method and slack matrix variables, some negative integral terms can be adopted and the nonlinear terms caused by time delay and partly unknown transition rates can be dealt. Furthermore, novel sufficient conditions on guaranteeing the closed-loop system is stochastically finite-time bounded (SFTB) with the prescribed $$H_{\infty }$$ level are proposed. Particularly, different from traditional slowly varying delays, the case of mode-dependent fast-varying delays which are more difficult to be dealt is considered in this paper.

The combined effects of the possibilistic mean and the variance/standard deviation on the ranking of generalized fuzzy numbers are considered. The axiomatic properties of the proposed ranking method are further verified. It is found that the possibilistic mean exhibits the dominant role as compared to the possibilistic variance or standard deviation. Some comparisons with the existing approaches are reported by carrying out lots of numerical examples. The observations reveal that the shortcomings in an existing method can be overcome. Generalized fuzzy numbers can be distinguished using a possibility degree. The developed ordering procedures of fuzzy numbers are consistent with human intuition, where the inherent uncertainty of fuzzy quantities is revealed.},

An active disturbance rejection fuzzy controller is designed based on the proposed DO, under which the tracking error will converge to a very small neighborhood of the origin by designing the proper parameters.

This paper aims to define a new family of fuzzy sets called general continuous linguistic variables (GCLV), which represents a linguistic variable rather than a set of linguistic values. We refer to it as the principle of representation of linguistic variables. They are based on the well-known sigmoidal functions and contain at least three different classes of membership functions, namely, an increasing sigmoidal function, a decreasing sigmoidal function, and a convex one. These diverse features are essential to represent linguistic values exhibiting different semantics. We explore the properties of GCLV, including those ones over that allow us to approximate every continuous membership function. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of GCLV as a fuzzy tool.

To tackle the FCDCP model, the corresponding defuzzification methods based on credibility measure are proposed for transforming the fuzzy MPS/MRP integrated programming model into a crisp equivalent mixed-integer programming model. When decision-makers decide on MPS/MRP integrated programming problem, the optimal lot sizing and scheduling solutions from the FCDCP model can not only provide an effective method for production planners to deal with the uncertainty in the production system, making the production plan more reasonable and accurate, but it can also help decision-makers obtain the optimal production plans and determine the best allocation of production resources, effectively reducing the total cost of the production system.

This paper proposes a hybrid risk analysis framework for FMEA based on interval type-2 fuzzy numbers and ORESTE method. First, the interval type-2 fuzzy numbers are utilized to express the uncertain risk evaluation information provided by experts. Second, the power average (PA) operator for interval type-2 fuzzy numbers is constructed to fuse individual risk assessment information and build the group risk assessment matrix. Then, the extended ORESTE method is introduced to determine the risk priority of each failure mode, in which distance measure of interval type-2 fuzzy numbers is incorporated. Finally, a case of ocean-going fishing vessel in a marine industry is selected to illustrate the application and feasibility of the proposed FMEA approach.

The process of Sustainability Enterprise Risk Management (SERM) is typically implemented to integrate all social, economic, environmental, and technological aspects in a systematic way to properly manage emerging risks and other non-quantifiable risks for company survival. Therefore, in this study, an attempt has been carried out to develop a comprehensive framework to implement the ERM framework under the sustainability platform by considering 29 sub-criteria based on four main aspects, including social, environmental, technological, and economic. In addition, a new fuzzy decision-making approach using the VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje) approach under q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFSs) called VIKOR-q-ROFSs approach is introduced to identify, rank, and evaluate the main criteria of SERM in the universal appeal for all industries such as Chinese manufacturing Small And Mid-Size Enterprises (SMEs) based on expert opinions and literature review. To determine the weights of SERM criteria by the decision experts, this study has introduced q-ROFNs. Moreover, to facilitate the q-ROFNs, a novel q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted averaging operator (q-ROFWAO) is proposed. Furthermore, VIKOR is applied to rank and evaluate the manufacturing SMEs as the alternatives for this study. The results of this paper showed that technological suitability was the important risk factor followed by technological advance, occupational safety and health, product and services responsibility, (benefit) anti-corruption labor practices, and technological practicability. In addition, the findings of the analysis show that the proposed method was efficient and effective in evaluating risk assessment of SERM in the SMEs.},

  abstract     = {The data-driven forecasting methods/models usually face two important tasks: one is to effectively deal with the uncertainties and/or noise in the data for improving the accuracy, another is to increase the models’ interpretability. In order to realize these two objectives, this study presents one novel double-input rule modules (DIRMs) stacked deep interval type-2 fuzzy model (DIT2FM) for forecasting applications. Firstly, the stacked structure of the proposed deep fuzzy model, abbreviated as IT2DIRM-DFM, is presented. This deep fuzzy model is constructed by stacking the interval type-2 fuzzy sets-based double-input rule modules (IT2DIRMs). It can not only efficiently handle high levels of uncertainties exited in the observed data by the type-2 fuzzy scheme, but also has better interpretable ability than the conventional deep models through clearly observing which rules are fired and how the fired degrees are. Then, the data-driven learning strategy for the IT2DIRM-DFM is proposed. In the proposed learning strategy, the data generation processes for all the stacked layers and the constrained least square method based design of the DIRMs are presented in detail. Finally, the proposed model is successfully applied to two real-world forecasting applications, and comparison results with the other forecasting models are also given. Both the statistical analysis and the experimental comparisons validate the superiorities of the proposed model over the other comparative models.},

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) power has proved to be the most reliable and sustainable technology as a primary source of power. The intermittent and fragmentary nature of solar energy has its own shortcomings due to which the PV system fails to meet the continuous demand of power structure set-up. Hence, optimization algorithm such as maximum power point tracking (MPPT) has been implemented to augment and improve the power efficiency of the PV system. Conventional techniques such as Incremental conductance and perturb and observe based MPPT fail to tackle the non-linearity and oscillations issue in tracking the maximum power especially when the array is shaded. MPPT is incorporated to overcome these limitations. Modern techniques such as artificial neural network, evolutionary algorithms (EA) and Fuzzy logic, can be additionally integrated into the system to select the desired algorithm to obtain maximum optimized output. In this research work, a BAT EA trained Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based MPPT is implemented for a partially shaded PV array. A modified SEPIC converter controlled by BAT ANFIS ensures maximum power delivery to the load. The suggested technique is tested for various patterns of shading and the results reveals that the BAT ANFIS MPPT is advantageous.},

In the proposed algorithm, we mainly emphasize on the structure identification of the TSK fuzzy model. Firstly, the similarity of features is calculated by the ridge reduction distribution function. Secondly, the type-2 fuzzy membership degree is applied to redefined a new intuitionistic fuzzy set, which is used to calculate the decision score (type-2 intuitionistic fuzzy membership degree) of each attribute feature. And we select the appropriate features (premise variables) by the threshold decision principle. Thirdly, the importance density function of particle filtering is constructed with the estimation results of the proposed TSK fuzzy model, which can effectively reduce the particle degradation phenomenon. Finally, the results of experiments on datasets show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and is excellent at handling the nonlinear non-Gaussian problem in the maneuvering target tracking system.},

The fuzzy linear regression analysis seeks for regression models fitting well all the data based on a specific criterion. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is employed for the analysis and prediction of a nonparametric fuzzy regression function with non-fuzzy inputs and symmetric trapezoidal fuzzy outputs. To this end, two new hybrid algorithms are proposed in which the fuzzy least squares and linear programming have been used to optimize the secondary weights. The algorithms are applied to a multi-layered validation method to confirm the models’ reliability. In addition, three methods of nonparametric fuzzy regression with crisp inputs and asymmetric trapezoidal fuzzy outputs, are compared. Three nonparametric techniques in statistics, namely local linear smoothing (L-L-S), K-nearest neighbor smoothing (K-NN) and kernel smoothing (K-S) with trapezoidal fuzzy data have been analyzed to obtain the best smoothing parameters. The performance of the models is illustrated through numerical examples and simulations. More specifically, the accuracy of the algorithms is confirmed by exhaustive simulations.},

  abstract     = {In the classical leave-one-out procedure for outlier detection in regression analysis, we exclude an observation and then construct a model on the remaining data. If the difference between predicted and observed value is high we declare this value an outlier. As a rule, those procedures utilize single comparison testing. The problem becomes much harder when the observations can be associated with a given degree of membership to an underlying population, and the outlier detection should be generalized to operate over fuzzy data. We present a new approach for outlier detection that operates over fuzzy data using two inter-related algorithms. Due to the way outliers enter the observation sample, they may be of various order of magnitude. To account for this, we divided the outlier detection procedure into cycles. Furthermore, each cycle consists of two phases. In Phase 1, we apply a leave-one-out procedure for each non-outlier in the dataset. In Phase 2, all previously declared outliers are subjected to Benjamini–Hochberg step-up multiple testing procedure controlling the false-discovery rate, and the non-confirmed outliers can return to the dataset. Finally, we construct a regression model over the resulting set of non-outliers. In that way, we ensure that a reliable and high-quality regression model is obtained in Phase 1 because the leave-one-out procedure comparatively easily purges the dubious observations due to the single comparison testing. In the same time, the confirmation of the outlier status in relation to the newly obtained high-quality regression model is much harder due to the multiple testing procedure applied hence only the true outliers remain outside the data sample. The two phases in each cycle are a good trade-off between the desire to construct a high-quality model (i.e., over informative data points) and the desire to use as much data points as possible (thus leaving as much observations as possible in the data sample). The number of cycles is user defined, but the procedures can finalize the analysis in case a cycle with no new outliers is detected. We offer one illustrative example and two other practical case studies (from real-life thrombosis studies) that demonstrate the application and strengths of our algorithms. In the concluding section, we discuss several limitations of our approach and also offer directions for future research.},

First, we improve the variational auto-encoder to predict the next state through the joint-state and joint-action for agents. Then several fuzzy partitions are built according to the next joint-state, which aims at assigning the prediction error to different agents. With the proposed method, each agent in the multi-agent environment receives its individual intrinsic reward. We elaborate on the proposed method in partially observable environments and fully observable environments separately. Experimental results show that multi-agent learns joint policies more efficiently by the proposed fuzzy curiosity-driven mechanism, and it can also help agents find better policies in the training process.},

  abstract     = {The distributed hybrid flowshop scheduling (DHFS) problem is a common scheduling problem that has been researched in both academic and industrial fields during recent years. The uncertainty levels in realistic applications are generally too high to be represented by a deterministic value or a triangular fuzzy number (TFN) value. Considering the DHFS problem with type-2 fuzzy processing time and setup time constraints, an improved version of brain storm optimization was developed, where the objective is to minimize the maximum type-2 fuzzy completion time among all factories. The main contributions of this study are as follows: (1) each solution is represented by a two vectors, i.e., a scheduling vector and a factory assignment vector; (2) two realistic constraints, i.e., the type-2 fuzzy processing time in an uncertain environment and the setup time, make the problem more realistic; (3) a novel constructive heuristic based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) method, called distributed NEH, is proposed; (4) several local search heuristics considering the problem features and the objective are developed to enhance the local search abilities; and (5) a simulated-annealing-based acceptance criterion is embedded to enhance the exploration abilities. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and effective for solving the considered type-2 fuzzy DHFS problems in comparison with other recently published efficient algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In data processing, measurement of uncertainty is one of the significant evaluation tools, which can describe the uncertainty essence of data. So far, there are few measurable tools to study the uncertainty of type-2 fuzzy information systems (TFISs-2) (the expanded models of fuzzy information systems). This paper is devoted to looking for effective indicators to describe the uncertainty of TFISs-2. The fuzzy $$T_{\text {cos}}$$ -similarity relations are first introduced, which are generated by TFISs-2 based on Gaussian kernel. Then, the fuzzy information structures are defined on account of this fuzzy $$T_{\text {cos}}$$ -similarity relation. Next, two measures constructed from the upper and lower approximations are given for TFISs-2, that is, $$\delta$$ -accuracy and $$\delta$$ -roughness, which are used to reflect the degree of accuracy and inaccuracy of information by numerical form. Furthermore, by combining roughness and entropy, the $$\delta$$ -rough entropy is investigated. Finally, the practicability of proposed measures is tested by a numerical experiment. The experimental results show that the $$\delta$$ -rough entropy is efficacious and applicable for TFISs-2.},

As the equivalent resistors and the disturbance are uncertain, interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2FLSs) are used to handle the uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Based on backstepping control design and command filtered techniques, by considering the limited communication resources of the system, an event-triggered saturation controller is designed, and the constraint conditions of the control signal are guaranteed. According to the Lyapunov theory, it is ensured that all the variables of the closed-loop photovoltaic system are bounded.

  abstract     = {Today’s business environments are prone to high levels of uncertainties and risks because the speed of changes is too high. Hence, the way of dealing with threats has changed. Complex socio-technical systems (CSSs) are confronted with out-of-control disturbances that need risk management systems to be applied. Risk management is organized activities to monitor and control risks in CSSs. Newly, resilience engineering (RE) as a safety management discipline has been expanded to change the attitude to risks. RE is defined as the capability of a system to absorb disturbances and adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Process industries as CSS, are potentially disposed to catastrophic events such as explosions, toxic leakages, stoppages of production operations, etc. In this paper, a novel RE-based algorithm is developed to measure the efficiency of process industries for preventing and reducing disorders considering their high-level of uncertainty. To do this, firstly, resilience indices in an oil refinery as an essential process industry are extracted. Then, using type-2 fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA), a new multi-objective approach is presented to evaluate the efficiency of DMUs from the perspective of RE. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs) is used in this approach because they potentially hold more implication than the classical type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs). As a case study, a refinery as a CSS is evaluated. Using the proposed algorithm shows the efficiency scores of DMUs in the refinery. By conducting a comparative analysis, it was revealed that the proposed model outperforms classical methods. The results of the proposed approach show that besides simplicity, there is good stability to consider the criteria of RE in efficiency measurement with IT2 FSs.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, general type-2 fuzzy systems are an attractive alternative for non-linear control problems because they provide good robustness in real-world environments, where there exist many noise sources. This kind of fuzzy systems can have better performance in comparison to type-1 fuzzy systems as they offer uncertainty handling capabilities. However, one of the main problems in implementing general type-2 fuzzy systems is their elevated computational cost. The computational cost of a general type-2 fuzzy system depends on the representation that is used, for example, the α-planes representation consists on a discretization of general type-2 fuzzy systems into several horizontal slices called α-planes, then solving every α-plane as an interval type-2 fuzzy system and after that the integration of the results to approximate a general type-2 fuzzy system. The main contribution of this work is the proposed computational cost reduction of the α-planes representation by optimizing the α-planes integration process based on the composite Newton–Cotes rules. In this way, the number of α-planes required for a good approximation is reduced, and the computational cost is also reduced by introducing new equations for the α-planes aggregation. Finally, a systematic comparative analysis of the improvement offered by the proposed method with respect to the conventional approach is presented.},

  abstract     = {Selecting right renewable energy resources (RESs) is emerging as a solution to alleviate energy crisis and environmental pollution. To better address the RESs selection problems, this paper proposes an enhanced Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS). Specifically, the decision information is characterized by linguistic terms and then encoded by interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). The current IT2FSs preprocessing models recklessly transform IT2FSs into crisp numbers, which may discount the superiority of applying fuzzy sets. Hence, we define a novel interval type-2 fuzzy projection model to measure the IT2FSs and some related theorems about the projection model are explored mathematically. Moreover, based on this new interval type-2 fuzzy projection model, an enhanced TOPSIS is proposed to calculate the closeness coefficients of alternatives. Of note, to keep information as much as possible, the obtained closeness coefficients are still IT2FSs. Finally, the Karnik–Mendel (KM) algorithms are employed to compare and rank those closeness coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a RESs selection case. Comparisons are also conducted to illustrate its advantages.},

In this process, to improve the stability of the angle motor, a coordinated steering controller of the angle motor and torque motor is proposed, and the type-2 fuzzy logic is designed based on the target front wheel angle and vehicle speed to optimize coordination coefficient. The front wheel angle step input and double-lane change trajectory tracking conditions are simulated in the carsim and simulink joint simulation platform, the results show that dual-motor steering system has good trajectory tracking ability, compared with no coordinated control, the current and velocity of angle motor are more stable under the coordinated steering control, which greatly reduces the steering load of the angle motor under different working conditions.

The performance is based on the data set composed of images provided by a Brazilian railway company, which covers the four possible railhead defects (cracking, flaking, head-check and spalling) and the normal condition of the railhead. Additionally, we apply different levels of additive white Gaussian noise in the images in order to challenge the proposed model. Finally, we discuss performance analysis in terms of convergence speed, computational complexity reduction, and classification ratio. The reported results show that the proposal achieved improved convergence speed, slightly higher classification ratio and remarkable computation complexity reduction when we limit the number of epochs for training, which may be required under real-time constraint or low computational resource availability.},

The input delay, which can commonly be raised by failure in the communication links and actuator operating lag may lead to control system instability. In the proposed adaptive T2FPID controller, output scaling factors have been chosen judiciously (according to a stable tuning algorithm) and thus improves the stability and performance of the controlled system. To perform this, the stability of the proposed method has been examined using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L-K) theorem, and the adaptation laws of the output scaling factors are derived. The proposed adaptation laws for the output scaling factors are simple and need a little knowledge about the structure of the power system. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive T2FPID controller, a comparison to the non-adaptive T2FPID and type-1 FPID (T1FPID) controllers is given for a two-area interconnected nonlinear power system with input time-delays. The obtained simulation results prove that the performance of the proposed T2FPID controller is superior compared to the other controllers in the presence of time-varying input delays, nonlinearities, and uncertainties.},

Furthermore, the classical TODIM method based on the cumulative prospect theory (CPT-TODIM) is built, which is a selectable method in reflecting the DMs’ psychological behavior. Thus, in this paper, the Pythagorean fuzzy CPT-TODIM (PF-CPT-TODIM) method is proposed for MAGDM issue. At the same time, it is enhancing rationality to get the weight information of attributes by using the entropy weight method under PFSs.

Firstly, the low-resolution map is transformed into a continuous map by bilinear interpolation. Then, a Terrain-Aided Navigation (TAN) system based on the Particle Filter (PF) is constructed to estimate the state of AUV position by particles. Particles of a random distribution of fixed variance can effectively track targets. However, a fixed variance distribution is not well adapted to many different situations. To improve navigation accuracy and robustness, fuzzy logic is used to estimate the distribution variance of particles under the current terrain gradient dynamically. The simulation results show that our proposed Fuzzy-PF TAN system is robust under various current disturbance situations. The position error of our system is within a map resolution unit of 500 m.},

In particular, we identified multidimensional factors that influence war outcomes in a relatively comprehensive and practical manner, thereby obtaining a relatively complete FID containing 24 nodes, with the value node “combat outcome” as the core. Subsequently, we performed a simulation analysis for a hypothetical war scenario to demonstrate the specific application and applicability of the proposed FID model. This study expands the prediction methods of war outcomes, and demonstrates that an FID can be feasibly applied in an uncertain battlefield environment to realize the prediction and risk assessment of war outcomes. Moreover, this approach can be used to analyze prewar decision making. The findings highlight that combat participants should attempt to further improve their military technology and combat effectiveness to gain combat advantage.},

  abstract     = {The aggregation of multi-source information can be realized by means of the ordered representation of polygonal fuzzy sets and their linear operations, especially the ordered representation plays an important role in multi-attribute decision analysis. An intuitionistic fuzzy set is not only a generalization of traditional fuzzy set, but also can overcome some defects of fuzzy phenomena described by binary logic. In this paper, we first propose the ordered representation and its arithmetic operations of n-intuitionistic polygonal fuzzy sets (n-IPFS) based on the idea of equidistant dissection, and give a method to solve the ordered representation of n-IPFS through an example. Secondly, a mathematical linear function describing multi-source information of modern smart city is given through an ordered representation of n-IPFS, a new normalization method and calculation formula are proposed for the intuitionistic polygonal decision matrix. Then, by using n-IPFS arithmetic operations the aggregation method of weighted average operator and geometric average operator of multi-source information is given. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by aggregating multi-source information, and thus an intuitionistic fuzzy set and polygonal fuzzy set are unified and applied to decision-making problem of multi-source information of modern smart cities.},

  abstract     = {With microgrids gaining more popularity in effectively meeting the increasing power demand, the operational challenges keep on increasing hand-in-hand. Especially when the microgrid work in islanded mode, it has to supply its area loads and maintain the system parameters as per the standards. This requires systematic coordination among the distributed generators so that the real and reactive power sharing is proportional to their ratings, simultaneously maintaining the system voltage and frequency at the rated values. While a droop controller shares the real power accurately, it is ineffective for precise reactive power sharing. The errors in reactive power sharing are compensated by adding virtual impedance in series with the distributed generator. The key objective of the work is to estimate the virtual impedance value to nullify the reactive power sharing errors without the need for communication links. A fuzzy logic controller is proposed to estimate the value for virtual impedance based on the real and reactive power demand at that particular instant. The virtual impedance dynamically changes depending on the load demand in order to compensate for the feeder impedance mismatch and hence called adaptive virtual impedance. Thus with the proposed fuzzy logic controller, accurate reactive power sharing is made possible without the requirement of communication links and the knowledge of feeder impedance. A secondary controller is also included to restore the frequency and the voltage to the rated values. A microgrid with equally and unequally rated DGs has been simulated in Matlab Simulink with the proposed fuzzy controller and successfully validated.},

Finally, a set of structured residuals which are sensitive to a single fault and decoupled from other faults is established by designing an observer for the subsystems.

Hence, the usual edge-detecting operators can give unreliable results, thus necessitating the use of fuzzy procedures. In literature, Chaira and Ray approach is a popular technique for fuzzy edge detection in which fuzzy divergence formulation is exploited. However, this approach does not specify the threshold technique must be applied. Then, in this work, starting from Chairy and Ray procedure, we present a new fuzzy edge detector based on both fuzzy divergence (thought and proved to be a distance) and fuzzy entropy minimization for the thresholding sub-step in gray-scale images. Eddy currents, thermal infrared, and electrospinning images were used to test the proposed procedure after their fuzzification by a suitable adaptive S-shaped fuzzy membership function. Moreover, the fuzziness content of each image has been quantified by new specific indices proposed here and formulated in terms of fuzzy divergence. The results have been evaluated by suitable assessment metrics here formulated and are considered to be encouraging when qualitatively and quantitatively compared with those obtained by some well-known I- and II-order edge detectors.},

Fuzzy methods are widely applied in decision-making problems because they are effective tools for handling imprecise and vague data. This paper proposes a modified algorithm to calculate the center of gravity of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Accordingly, we introduce a new similarity measure for generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers that we use in the classification of EEG signals. This measure combines the height, the center of gravity, the perimeter, the area, and the gyradius of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to quantify the similarity between generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. We use 16 sets of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to compare the proposed similarity measure with existing ones. Comparison results indicate that the proposed similarity measure can overcome the drawbacks of existing similarity measures. Finally, an EEG experiment is carried out in laboratory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity measure is more effective than other methods in terms of classification of EEG signals.},

One of possible methods of dealing with uncertain (rare, strange, unexampled) data is to treat them as “outliers” or “exceptions”. Among different definitions and algorithms for detecting outliers, we are especially interested in those based on linguistic information represented with type-2 fuzzy logic. We introduce new definitions of outliers in datasets in terms fuzzy properties and linguistically expressed quantities of objects possessing them. Next, new algorithms for detecting outlying objects are presented, to answer whether outliers appear in a dataset or not. Finally, recognition algorithms are presented and exemplified to enumerate particular objects being outliers (e.g., to eliminate them for further considerations). The novelty of this contribution is that we define, detect and recognize outliers using linguistic information represented mostly by type-2 fuzzy sets and logic (if any other information like measures or distances is not accessible), and we supersede this way some earlier approaches based on similar but relatively limited assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, researchers have focused on network level intrusion detection and program level intrusion detection to improve computer security. However, neither approach is foolproof. Typically, a successful attacker manifests in the form of the attacker becoming a user on the host either with elevated or normal user privileges. The reason for this situation is that current research and technology development have focused on external, not internal. At this point, user-level intrusion detection attempts to deter and curtail an attacker even after the system has been compromised. This paper proposed a novel method for anomaly detection of user behavior. Considering the complexity and fluctuation of user behavior, our method builds a finite automaton to profile the user’s normal behavior with closeness of commands within patterns and timing sequence and frequency information between patterns. This allows discrete data used for training to have a holistic structure that allows for a more accurate expression of the normal behavior of the user. In the detection stage, our method builds a threat evaluation system using fuzzy logic. Experimental results on data sets of Purdue University, SEA and self-collected data show that an accurate, effective and efficient detection can be achieved using the proposed approach.},

The issue about assessment of the skills acquired in those environments is a problem not solved since each simulator can collect different interaction data.

Several assessment models found in the scientific literature are based on Naive Bayes networks, which in turn are based on two kinds of probability measures: the classical one; and that one applied on fuzzy events. In this work, we propose a third one, which use the probability based on fuzzy parameters. The theoretical proposal of a new Naive Bayes network form, which uses Gaussian distribution, is presented and named GAUNB-FP network. It is proposed as the kernel of a new training assessment system and tested considering a bone marrow harvest simulator with three classes of performance provided by experts. Its performance was evaluated, according to decision matrix analysis, Kappa Coefficient and its variance. The results are compared with other four assessment systems based on different networks found in the scientific literature: Naive Bayes Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes Network, Bayesian Network and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. The comparison has shown the new assessment system based on GAUNB-FP network provided better results with respect of two of the other networks. It provided also the best results for two of three classes of performance.

Then, the first-order filter is employed to solve the shortcoming of “complexity of differentiation” in backstepping approach and the fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the nonlinear functions. Finally, it is demonstrated that the presented control approach realizes fast tracking effect and the boundedness of all signals. Comparison of simulation results is included to illustrate the superiority of the new design scheme.},

Different from the traditional study about fixed-time control for uncertain nonlinear systems, quantitative control issue is considered in this paper, and the nonlinear term can be unknown. The new adaptive control tactic of fixed-time tracking control is proposed via fuzzy logic systems approaching unknown nonlinearity, which overcomes the existing limitation of the upper boundary of system settling time relies on the initial condition. The closed-loop system stability is guaranteed in a fixed time. At the end of this paper, the availability of the strategy is proved by a numerical simulation.},

However, when the data samples are insufficient, the classical GMM-based clustering algorithms are not effective anymore. Referring to the idea of transfer clustering methods, this paper proposes a general transfer GMM-based clustering framework, which employs the important knowledge extracted from some known source domain to guide and improve the clustering on the target domain with small-scale data. Specifically, three traditional GMM-based clustering approaches are extended to the corresponding transfer clustering versions. Furthermore, to avoid the negative transfer problem, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is introduced to search the most matched source domain to provide more positive guidance for data clustering on the target domain. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the presented framework compared with several existing transfer clustering algorithms.},

All the involved parameters such as aggregate demand, budget allocation, quota flexibility, rating values, are depicted as type-2 triangular fuzzy (T-2TF) parameters. To tackle the T-2TF, first, critical values (CV)-based reduction method is introduced, and then chance-constrained programming is modeled to obtain the crisp version of the multiobjective SSP. Secondly, an interval-based approximation method is also developed for defuzzifying the T-2TF parameters. Further, a novel interactive neutrosophic programming approach is also suggested to solve the deterministic multiobjective SSP, which allows the decision-makers to incorporate the neutral thoughts or indeterminacy degrees efficiently. The computational study is presented to verify and validate the defuzzfied techniques and the proposed solution approach. An ample opportunity to select the most desired compromise solution with maximum overall satisfaction level is also addressed.

Unlike the existing works which describes the DZ constraint by the conventional deterministic models, this work describes the DZ by the fuzzy and uncertain value. Therefore, some imposed restricting assumptions on the DZ parameters such as known bounds of the DZ slopes, or linear and deterministic model for DZ description which exist in the previous works are removed in this work. In the proposed scheme, the neural network (NN) is invoked to model the uncertain nonlinearities of the follower agents and uncertain interaction of their neighbors. To decrease the number of adaptive parameters and computational load, maximum norm of the weight coefficients of the NN is considered as an adjustable parameter and tuned online. Also, to decrease the controller complexity and eliminate the repeated derivatives of nonlinear functions in the controller, the dynamic surface control (DSC) method is used to develop the proposed distributed consensus scheme. Stability analysis based on the Lyapunov direct method guarantees that all of the signals in the closed-loop MAS are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and the consensus error converges to a bound dependent on the design parameters. Therefore, appropriate choice of the design parameters makes the bound small. Simulation results on a well-known example demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed consensus algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Although fuzzy system (FS) is highly interpretable, it is difficult to address high-dimensional big data due to the curse of dimensionality. On the contrary, deep neural network (DNN), a fashion deep learning algorithm, can deal with high-dimensional big data with shortcomings of complex model, huge calculation, and poor interpretability. We present a model of random locally optimized deep fuzzy system (RLODFS) and four specific heuristic implementation algorithms, which combines the advantages of high interpretability of FS and great ability of processing high-dimensional big data of DNN. This method takes Wang-Mendel (WM) algorithm as the basic module, to construct a RLODFS by bottom-up parallel structure. Through hierarchical, random group and combination-based learning, and input sharing, it can retain the interpretability and dramatically improve the computational efficiency. The input variables of the low-dimensional FS are randomly grouped by isometric sampling. Four implementation algorithms of RLODFS based on random local search for optimal combination, group learning, and deep structure with 0, 1, 2, and 3 input sharing, respectively, named as RLODFS-S0, RLODFS-S1, RLODFS-S2, and RLODFS-S3, are developed for regression-oriented problems. Using local loops to find the best combination of parameters, our final algorithms, RLODFS, can achieve fast convergence in training phase, and also superior generalization performance in testing. Compared with six classic algorithms in 12 datasets, the proposed RLODFS algorithms are not only highly interpretable with just some fuzzy rules but also can achieve higher precision, less complexity, and better generalization. Furthermore, it can be used for training fuzzy systems on datasets of any size, particularly for big datasets. Relatively, RLODFS-S3 and RLODFS-S2 achieve the best in comprehensive performance. More importantly, the proposed RLODFS is a new promising method of deep learning with good interpretability and high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Since the alpha-planes expressions of general type-2 fuzzy sets (GT2 FSs) have been proposed, general type-2 fuzzy logic systems (GT2 FLSs) that are dependent on GT2 FSs are becoming quite popular to fuzzy logic researchers. Usually enhanced Karnik–Mendel (EKM) algorithms are adopted for performing the kernel block of type-reduction (TR). However, the essence of EKM-based TR process probably hinders the GT2 FLSs from real-world applications. It is an intriguing as well as unsolved problem for comparing EKM algorithms with other non-iterative algorithms. This paper provides a framework encompassing fuzzy reasoning, defuzzification, as well as type-reduction. Furthermore, the continuous of NT (CNT) algorithm is shown to be a precise approach when it is used to execute the centroid TR of GT2 fuzzy logic systems. Four computer tests display the characteristics of discrete Nagar-Bardini (NB) and Nie-Tan (NT) non-iterative algorithms. Compared with EKM approach, the developed one exhibits some superiorities in terms of guaranteeing high computation accuracy and low computation burdens, which broadens the application ranges for the proposed method.},

For asymmetric or small traffic flow, the common timing project based on single-loop phase structure cannot achieve optimal control. Therefore, this paper proposed a fuzzy control method of traffic light under time-varying universe and the phase structure have been optimized. For asymmetric traffic flow, the phase structure is optimized by adding additional phases to form a double-loop phase structure. In slack hour, the phase structure is optimized by merging phase. Taking an intersection in Jing-Hong city as an example, the feasibility of the method is verified. The results show that the delay of vehicles can be reduced and the traffic capacity of the intersection can be improved by this method.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are one of the most efficient artificial intelligence techniques for modeling large and complex systems. However, traditional FCMs have the limitation of not representing the indeterminacy situations presented in many decision-making problems. To overcome this limitation, neutrosophic cognitive maps (NCMs) were proposed as a new extension of traditional FCMs. Nevertheless, the way that NCMs reported in the bibliography handle the indeterminacy is still insufficient since they cannot quantify the degree of indeterminacy. Moreover, there are decision-making problems in which decisions should be considered as a sequence of decisions hardly interconnected in sequential order. This situation is presented in scenarios such as projects evaluation characterized by the existence of multiple interconnected processes (diagnosis, decision, and prediction). The lack of a suitable FCMs topology for modeling this kind of decision-making problems constitutes another challenging issue of FCMs. This paper presents a new neutrosophic cognitive map based on triangular neutrosophic numbers for multistage sequential decision-making problems (MS-TrNCM). In the proposed model, all the map’s connections are represented by triangular neutrosophic numbers, making it possible for decision makers to express their preferences considering the truth, indeterminacy, and falsity degrees. Furthermore, a new topology for representing multistage sequential processes is introduced. The suggested MS-TrNCM is applied to make diagnoses, decisions, and predictions during the evaluation of 1011 projects records from project evaluation database ”uci-gp-eval-201903051137” provided by the University of Informatics Sciences. In validation process, the superiority of the proposed MS-TrNCM over the NCMs and traditional FCMs has been demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Automatic detection of crop yield ripeness is a tedious task because of the presence of various intensities of color in crops. One of the solutions to this problem is the monitoring of those crops by performing segmentation operations. This operation can help to distinguish the ripe and non-ripe regions among the crop images. For this purpose, this study presents a new hybrid crop image segmentation method utilizing type-2 fuzzy set (T2FS), K-means clustering algorithm, and modified quantum optimization algorithm (MQOA). The proposed method fully utilizes the indispensable qualities of these three techniques by (a) using T2FS to represent each color component of crop images in terms of secondary memberships, (b) applying K-means clustering algorithm to extract the similar features from the set of type-2 entropy values obtained from the secondary memberships, and (c) exploiting MQOA to optimize the distance function used in K-means clustering algorithm to obtain the optimal clusters. The performance of the proposed method is assessed based on the experiments carried out on color images of cherry tomatoes. Evidence of experimental results suggests that the proposed method produces extremely effective segmented images relative to those well-known color image segmentation methods available in the literature of pattern recognition and computer vision domains.},

  abstract     = {In multiattribute decision-making (MADM), more and more attention is paid to the interaction between attributes when considering the actual decision environment. As a result, interactive MADM has become an emerging and challenging area of research whose success will greatly facilitate the development of decision-making. This paper models the interactive MADM problem and its contribution is multifaceted. First, the concept of probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is extended by Dempster–Shafer theory (DST), which helps to express more uncertain information, followed by some basic operations, such as score function and aggregation operator. In virtue of evidential best-worst method and the principle of maximum entropy, then a novel nonadditive measure determination method is developed based on the 2-order additive measure to better model the interaction between attributes. Further, the generalized PLTS-based Choquet integral is defined by which generalized PLTSs on a nonadditive measure can be reasonably aggregated. Finally, an interactive MADM model is constructed and the technical details are described. The proposed approach is implemented to select the supplier for medical devices, and its effectiveness is emphasized by comparison with other methods.},

  abstract     = {To model and deal with complex decision-making problems, many methods have been proposed in the past decades. However, how to deal with probabilistic uncertainty is still an open question. In this regard, this paper introduces a prospect theory-based evidential reasoning (ER) approach to process such uncertainty in multi-expert multi-criteria decision-making. Firstly, we introduce a novel way to model the uncertainty by assigning the uncertain belief to the envelope of evidence, which makes the expression consistent with experts’ perceptions. The ER approach is used to aggregate individual decision-making matrices with probabilistic uncertainty to obtain a collective matrix. Then, the ER approach is applied again on the obtained collective matrix to aggregate the evaluations under different criteria to generate the comprehensive evaluation of each alternative. Given that the decision-maker may have different risk preferences to gain and loss from those of the experts, we introduce a prospect function of evaluation grades to rank alternatives. In this way, we can obtain the ranking of alternatives which considers both the evaluations of experts and the risk preference of the decision-maker. The advantages of this method are highlighted by a case study concerning the evaluation of sustainable development ability of enterprises.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of the third scientific and technological revolution, the productive forces of capitalism have been greatly developed, and some new changes have appeared in the basic economic characteristics of contemporary monopoly capitalism. How to predict the basic economy of capitalism more effectively and accurately, thus to summarize the characteristics of new changes, has become a hot spot in the field of economic research. Based on the fuzzy system of modern intelligent algorithm, this paper analyzes the basic economic characteristics of modern monopoly capitalism and explores the essence of its new changes. Firstly, this paper establishes a type-II fuzzy logic system according to the modeling rules, optimizes the parameters of the front and the back of the fuzzy logic system based on the bacterial foraging algorithm, and tests the functions of the optimized type-II fuzzy logic system using Mackey–Glass chaotic time series. Then the nearest-neighbor clustering method in this system is used to cluster a group of economic data, and the clustering effect of nearest-neighbor clustering method in this system is measured. Finally, in order to test the predictive ability of the type-II fuzzy logic system proposed in this study, the investment evaluation of the products of a group is carried out. Experimental results show that the optimized type-2 fuzzy logic system still has only small prediction errors in noisy environments. After clustering with nearest-neighbor clustering method, two very obvious categories are obtained. It can be said that the classification effect is also very ideal. In the actual forecast of a certain group&#39;s products, the comprehensive similarity of product D is the largest, which is 0.936. Therefore, it shows that the type-two fuzzy logic system created in this study can effectively analyze the new changes in the basic economic characteristics of contemporary monopoly capitalism, and the changes are essentially the further development of capitalist economic laws.},

In the method, a generalized distance measure between two pieces of hesitant information is designed to overcome the limitations of existing distance measures. To accelerate the convergence of consensus reaching process with the consideration of the interaction among decision makers, decision makers are divided into several subgroups. The group leader is selected in terms of the contributions of decision makers to group consensus. In order to help generate a satisfactory solution by adequately considering the decision makers’ diverse opinions, the group discussion is introduced to clarify their opinions and minimize bias under the organization of the selected group leader. Based on the changes in the preference information before and after group discussion, the influence of each subgroup is generated and further applied to determine the weights of subgroups. Simulation and comparison experiments are conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this study, we propose a new conflict measurement method based on both the distance and angle between evidence. To combine the evidence distance and evidence angle effectively, the angle–distance ordered weighted averaging (OWA) pair is constructed inspired by the induced ordered weighted averaging operator. In addition, the personalized quantifier is used to describe decision-makers’ individual attitudes and risk preferences.

  abstract     = {Risk evaluation is a primary but important task for technological innovation projects and this task is a multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) process with probabilistic uncertainty and fuzzy uncertainty. Compromise programming decision-making methods with probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) are more appropriate for risk evaluation of technological innovation projects. This paper proposes a new approach named improved probabilistic linguistic-vise kriterijumska optimizacija kompromisno resenje (PL-VIKOR) method with probabilistic linguistic term sets for risk evaluation of technological innovation projects. Firstly, by fully considering both the relationship between each alternative and the positive ideal solution and the relationship between each alternative and negative ideal solution, the improved PL-VIKOR method for dealing with MCGDM problems is developed to make up the deficiency of the traditional PL-VIKOR method. Then, the improved PL-VIKOR method is applied to solve a practical MCGDM problem with probabilistic linguistic term sets involving the risk evaluation of technologically innovative projects for venture capital. Finally, we make some comparative analyses between the improved PL-VIKOR method and some existing methods to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method. The results reflect that the improved PL-VIKOR method is more reasonable when calculating the distance measure between two PLTSs, and it can make the risk evaluation of technological innovation project MCGDM with PLTSs more objective.},

In the proposed algorithm, a new optimization criterion—the maximum fuzzy correntropy criterion with fuzzy correntropy based on fuzzy information theory—is used to optimize the Kalman filter, by reducing the effect of the common correntropy applying the same weight for all samples. Moreover, to apply the MFC-KF algorithm to bearings-only maneuvering target tracking, it is combined with the least-squares method for measurement conversion. Moreover, the kernel width is set adaptively. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can track a target more accurately than the interactive multi-model extended Kalman filter (IMMEKF), the interactive multi-model unscented Kalman filter (IMMUKF), or the maximum correntropy Kalman filter (MCKF).},

In GrC, both classification accuracy and interpretability play significant roles. Fuzzy rule (FR) based classification systems are effective methods solving this problem. However, the accuracy of FR may be decreased when solving some complex application. In this paper, a novel model called FR–KDE integrating the FR and kernel density estimation (KDE) in the framework of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is proposed to deal with the classification problem. By fusing the result of FR and KDE via the Dempster’s combination rule, it can reduce the uncertainty of FR and obtain better accuracy. To illustrate the effect of the FR–KDE approach, it is applied to the medical data classification problem. Experimentally, the results demonstrate that the FR–KDE method is effective in handling biomedical data classification problems.},

Taking 39 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Zone as the research objects, this paper establishes a new evaluation index system for “non-waste cities,” and proposes a multi-source, heterogeneous and multi-attribute decision-making method for the comprehensive evaluation of “non-waste cities.” Specifically, the evaluation index system of “non-waste cities” is constructed from four aspects: economic level, environmental pollution, resource consumption, and waste utilization. Considering that there is the characteristic of multi-source heterogeneity for the attribute values (that is, real numbers, interval numbers, and fuzzy linguistic variables coexist), the multi-source heterogeneous data are uniformly converted into two-tuples, and then a new two-tuple entropy weight method is proposed to determine the weights of evaluation attributes. Moreover, combining the traditional grey relational analysis method with TOPSIS, a multi-source, heterogeneous and multi-attribute decision-making method based on two-tuple mixed correlation degree (TTMCD-MSHMADM) is proposed to evaluate the “non-waste cities,” and an empirical analysis is made for the 39 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Zone. The result gives a theoretical basis for the formulation of sustainable economic development policies in the Yangtze River Economic Zone, and provides a decision reference for selecting the demonstration cities of “non-waste cities.”},

Based on this, for depicting different kinds of hesitance in decision-makers’ expressions, we put forward the vector random linguistic variable (VRLV) and apply it into the pairwise comparisons of alternatives in order to get the VRLVs-FPR. Furthermore, a consistency improving method is given to manage the consistency of VRLVs-FPR and a consensus improving method is given to manage the consensus process of LGDMPP.

  abstract     = {The practical applications of engineering designs are often concerned by the presence of interrelated decisions. Naturally, these decisions are induced by solving many conflicting and incommensurable objectives. To deal with the interlinked decisions as well as the paradox natures among objectives, this paper presents an integrated approach based on dynamic programming approach (DPA) and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) denoted as DPA-IFS for solving multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). In DPA-IFS, the principle of DPA aims to generate an efficient solution of MOOP. In contrast, IFS aims to handle conflicting natures among the objective functions by means of the satisfaction (maximization the degree of membership) and dissatisfaction (minimization the degree of non-membership) concepts. The illustration is investigated by numerical illustrations taken from the literature. Furthermore, a new closeness strategy-based distance function is introduced to measure the worth of a satisfactory solution. The proposed methodology is validated on the IEEE 30-bus with six generators as a real test paradigm in the electrical power system. The results obtained by the DPA-IFS show the superior results than those obtained by different approaches.},

Consider that most existing analysis results related to suspension systems are independent of membership functions, which may cause conservatism, thus, a novel membership functions-dependent Lyapunov function is employed in the stability analysis. In the proposed analysis technique, both of the information of membership functions and their derivatives are applied to reduce the conservativeness. A switching control strategy is proposed to assure that suspension constraint requirements are satisfied by using the information of time-derivative of membership.

  abstract     = {In hospital operation management, the medical supplier selection is a significant problem in which experts’ domain knowledge plays a critical role in selecting medical suppliers. The probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR) whose elements are probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) is an effective tool to express experts’ preferences on alternatives based on pairwise comparisons. Due to the lack of knowledge of experts and the limit information of alternatives, some preference information may be missing and thus the incomplete PLPR (InPLPR) is constructed. In this study, a group decision-making (GDM) method with InPLPRs is proposed to deal with a practical medical supplier selection problem. To achieve this goal, we first propose a method to check whether an InPLPR is acceptable. Then, a procedure is developed to complete the acceptable InPLPR based on the property of additive consistency and a social strategy is proposed to complete the unacceptable InPLPR. Afterward, a GDM model based on InPLPRs is constructed in which the aggregation phase and exploitation phase are conducted by the probabilistic linguistic weighted averaging (PLWA) operator. Besides, an approach for calculating the weights of experts is proposed considering the characteristics of InPLPRs. Finally, we illustrate the proposed GDM model by a practical case about the medical supplier selection. A comparative analysis is presented to demonstrate the advantages of our method.},

However, marine ranching ecological security (MRES) has received limited attention, which has affected the management of marine ranching. To provide decision support for the management of MRES in China, we obtained the influence paths of MRES in China using probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). The DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) framework was employed to construct the evaluation index system of MRES, and PLTSs were used to describe the multiple values resulting from three threshold setting methods. We selected 17 samples of marine ranching enterprises in China to apply our method and input their data into multi-value QCA to identify the influence paths of MRES relating to those enterprises. We found that there exists an influence path (configuration) that causes a high level of MRES, namely F1{2}*F2{2}*~F3*F4{2}*F5{1,2}. This means that for a high level of MRES, the driver, pressure and impact factors should be at their best levels, and the state factor can be at the normal level. MRES was at the high level whether the response factor was normal or positive. Our findings generate theoretical and practical implications managing MRES.},

For the controller description, the surge degree of freedom dynamic model is linearized using feedback linearization technique and then a fuzzy PID tracking control law is sketched. To illustrate the robust tracking performance of the controller, the proposed control law is compared with a conventional PID controller. The results show improvement in the tracking error in the presence of noise and dynamic model parameter perturbation. The main reason behind the ability of the supervisory controller in handling the uncertainties is the auto-adjustment ability of PID gains when faced with real-time situations.},

  abstract     = {Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and vague sets are two sets that are commonly used in expressing vague and uncertain information. Despite their commonality, these two sets are characterized by different memberships. Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are characterized by membership and non-membership with the sum of these memberships being less or equal than one. On the other hand, vague sets are characterized by either truth or false memberships with no clear-cut values of their sum. However, these two sets have shown a great extent of superiority in dealing with uncertain and imprecise information despite differences in the memberships. Therefore, it is a worthy effort to develop a new generic set by combining these two sets: interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and vague sets. In this paper, the notion of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy vague sets (IVIFVS) is proposed where membership and non-membership of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are combined with truth membership and false membership of vague sets. To complement this new definition, several mathematical propositions, algebraic relations and arithmetic operations of IVIFVS are presented. Moreover, a new linguistic variable of IVIFVS with five linguistic scales that are normally used in solving multi-criteria decision-making problems is developed. Some examples are provided to illustrate the conceptual definitions and linguistic variables of the new sets.},

  abstract     = {The natural gas pipeline construction project possesses different kinds of highly risky occupational hazards because of its complex and dynamic surrounding environments. Occupational risk evaluation is one of the most effective techniques to reduce and manage these risks and hazards. There are various kinds of techniques to address the problem of occupational risk evaluation, however, most of these techniques overlook the decision-makers’ different risk perceptions under the different probability of risk occurrence. In addition, current occupational risk evaluation approaches are unable to cope with the risk analysis problem including correlated risk parameters within the random and fuzzy context. Aiming to compensate for these limitations, we present an extended occupational risk evaluation method for a natural gas pipeline construction project by integrating the cloud model, cumulative prospect theory, and Bonferroni mean operator. In this framework, four risk parameters in the safety and critical effect analysis (SCEA) are introduced to rate the risk of each occupational hazard. Then, the normal cloud model is utilized to transform the linguistic risk evaluation information into quantitative data, which can model the uncertainty of randomness and fuzziness in the risk evaluation process. Next, the extended cumulative prospect theory based on Bonferroni mean operator is constructed to derive the risk magnitude of each hazard considering the decision maker’s different risk perception and interactions among risk parameters. Finally, the proposed extended occupational risk evaluation method is tested by the risk evaluation of the concrete coating procedure. The sensitivity and comparison analyses are led to validate the rationality and reliability of the proposed occupational risk evaluation method.},

Then, under the zero-input strategy, a newly stochastic switched sampled-data controller is introduced. Based on the Lyapunov function method, a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii (LKF) function is constructed via introducing a fuzzy membership functions (FMFs), which can use the information about the actual sampling pattern. Each term of the LKF need not be positive, but it needs to be positive at sampling instants. Using the reciprocally convex method and relaxed free-matrix-based (FMB) integral inequality, novel stabilization criteria are established to guarantee that the T-S fuzzy system is stochastic stable when the control packet dropout occurs in a random way. Based on the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), a fuzzy controller design algorithm for sampled data is presented to obtain a larger sampling interval.

  abstract     = {Optimization is used to find the maximum or minimum of a function. In this research, optimization is applied to the objective function of the FCM algorithm. FCM is an effective algorithm for grouping data, but it is often trapped in local optimum solutions. Therefore, the similarity measure in the clustering process using FCM is very important. This study uses a new method, which combines the Minkowski distance with the Chebyshev distance which is used as a measure of similarity in the clustering process on FCM. The amount of data that is quite large and complex becomes one of the difficulties in providing analysis of multivariate data. To overcome this, one of the techniques used is dimensional reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is an algorithm of the dimensional reduction method based on the main components obtained from linear combinations, which can help stabilize cluster analysis measurements. The method used in this research is dimensional reduction using PCA, clustering using FCM with a combination of Minkowski and Chebyshev distances (FCMMC), and clustering evaluation using the Davies Bouldin Index (DBI). The purpose of this research is to minimize the objective function of FCM using new distances, namely, the combination of Minkowski and Chebyshev distances through the assistance of dimensional reduction by PCA. The results showed that the cluster accuracy of the combined application of the PCA and FCMMC algorithms was 1.6468. Besides, the minimum value of the combined objective function of the two methods is also obtained, namely, 0.0373 which is located in the 15th iteration, where this value is the smallest value of the 100 maximum iterations set.},

  abstract     = {In the design phase of a new smart product, production costs are unpredictable due to location, transport, and engineering design. In these situations, consequently, cost optimization becomes ambiguous. This paper presents a methodology to obtain optimization through a fuzzy linear programming problem (FLPP) in which fuzzy numbers signify the right-side parameters. The comparative investigation of modeling and optimizing creation cost through a new α-cut based quadrilateral fuzzy number is proposed to solve the fuzzy linear programming and the necessary operations on the proposed number. Due to the probabilistic increase and decrease in the accessibility of the various constraints, the actual expected total cost fluctuates. In this respect, a unique situation of instability is incorporated, and reasonable models to reduce the cost of eradication in the creation process are presented. The main endeavor is made to look at the credibility of optimized cost utilizing the α-cut based quadrilateral FLPP models, and the outcome is contrasted with its augmentation. The data of the production cost of RCF Kapurthala is taken, and the creation expenses of various mentors from the year 2010–2011 are considered as input parameters. The aggregate cost is focused on the objective function. The least low, lower, upper, and most upper bounds are computed for each situation, and then systems of optimized fuzzy LPP are constructed. The credibility of quadrilateral fuzzy LPP concerning all situations is obtained and using this membership grade, the minimum, and highest minimum costs are illustrated.},

We propose a fuzzy portfolio model as it is an efficient portfolio selection method associated with uncertain or vague returns. Although many researchers focus on studying the fuzzy portfolio model, they do not consider excess investment based on the selected guaranteed rates of return for some securities. To manage such an investment, a new fuzzy return function—where some securities are considered for excess investment based on the selected guaranteed rate of return—is introduced to improve the possibilistic mean and variance values, leading to a revised fuzzy portfolio model. Accordingly, to set certain securities for excess investment in the fuzzy return function, efficient portfolios for each selected guaranteed rate of return can be obtained under different levels of investment risk. Finally, we present a numerical example of a portfolio selection problem to illustrate the proposed model. This example shows that the expected rate of return of a lower guaranteed rate of return is larger than that of a higher guaranteed rate of return under different levels of investment risks. The portfolio analysis with some guaranteed rate of returns can provide more invested risk selection.},

The main contribution of this work is finding the best method that generates an optimal vector of values for the membership function optimization of the fuzzy controller. This with the goal of improving the performance of the controller and thus the trajectory generated by the autonomous robot is closer to the desired trajectory. It should be noted that the fuzzy controller that is optimized is an interval type-2 fuzzy controller, which has a greater capability for managing uncertainty than a type-1 fuzzy controller. In this case, the limiting membership functions in the interval type-2 fuzzy sets are themselves type-1 fuzzy sets that define the footprint of uncertainty. Type-2 fuzzy controllers have been shown in previous works to handle better the control of robotic systems under noisy and dynamic conditions and this is why their optimal design is very important. Simulation results show that GSO outperforms FA in the optimal design of interval type-2 fuzzy controllers.},

To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations are performed by modeling a two degree of freedom ball balancer system. The eminence of the controller is assessed by comparing its operation on the modeled system with conventional fuzzy logic controller and by calculating the root mean square error, and time response analysis. The results showed a steady and precise response of the proposed approach to the framework of positioning ball on the plate.},

  abstract     = {Membrane fouling is a widespread problem that restricts the stable operation of membrane bioreactor (MBR) in wastewater treatment process (WWTP). However, it is difficult to avoid the occurrence of membrane fouling due to the lack of effective early warning methods. To deal with this problem, an intelligent early warning method, using a knowledge-based fuzzy broad learning (K-FBL) algorithm, is proposed for membrane fouling in this paper. First, the existing knowledge is extracted from the humanistic category of membrane fouling in the form of fuzzy rules. Then, the existing knowledge of membrane fouling can be used to compensate for the shortage of data sets. Second, a K-FBL algorithm is designed to train the fuzzy subsystems with the existing knowledge. Then, the uncertainties of membrane fouling process can be degraded to improve the learning performance. Third, a K-FBL-based early warning method is designed to realize the precise classification and provide the operational suggestions for membrane fouling. Finally, the experiment results of a real plant are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed K-FBL-based early warning method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a path-following-based design for guaranteed cost control of a class of nonlinear systems represented by polynomial fuzzy systems. First, this paper proposes a polynomial Lyapunov function approach to guaranteed cost control for the feedback system consisting of a polynomial fuzzy system and a polynomial fuzzy controller. In particular, we introduce a new type of polynomial fuzzy controllers based on an approximate solution for the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman inequality. To design a guaranteed cost polynomial fuzzy controller effectively, a path-following-based design algorithm is newly developed by formulating as a sum-of-squares (SOS) stabilization problem. Two new relaxations are provided by bringing a peculiar benefit of the SOS framework. One is an $${\mathcal{S}}$$ -procedure relaxation for the considered outmost Lyapunov function level set that is contractively invariant set. The other is an $${\mathcal{S}}$$ -procedure relaxation for design conditions obtained for polynomial membership functions redefined by variable replacements in considered ranges. Furthermore, this paper provides a practical and reasonable way for estimating lower upper-bounds of a given performance function by increasing the order of a considered polynomial function. Finally, a complicated nonlinear system design example is employed to illustrate the validity of the proposed design algorithm and the lower upper-bound estimation.},
