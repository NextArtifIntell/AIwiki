  abstract     = {When solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), it is important to uniformly explore the promising regions that are not dominated by feasible solutions, and this can effectively avoid the loss of the Pareto front fragments. To achieve this, we propose a grid-based uniform search (GUS) to guide the current population to search the promising areas uniformly in this paper. Therein, the promising areas are divided into a number of grids, which are then fully explored by the individuals located in them. In the process of reducing the population size, the individuals with the largest constraint violations in the most crowded grids are removed one by one. To balance the local search and the global search, we dynamically reduce the number of divided grids in GUS with the increase of evolutionary iterations. Embedding the dynamic GUS in evolutionary algorithm, we design a new constrained algorithms for CMOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than other state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms in dealing with different CMOPs.},

This paper presents a dynamic multiobjective evolutionary framework (DMOEF-MS), which adopts a novel multipopulation structure and Steffensen’s method to solve DMOPs. In DMOEF-MS, only one population deals with the original DMOP, while the others focus on single-objective problems that are generated by the weighted summation of the original DMOP. Then, Steffensen’s method is used to control the evolving process in two ways: prediction and diversity-maintenance. Particularly, the prediction strategy is devised to predict the next promising positions for the individuals that handle single-objective problems, and the diversity-maintenance strategy is used to increase population diversity before the environment changes and reinitialize the multiple populations after the environment changes. This paper gives a comprehensive comparison of DMOEF-MS with some state-of-the-art DMOEAs on 14 DMOPs and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Our framework is based on an integrated sequence-to-sequence attention model. The proposed system involves extracting a hidden representation from an image using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU), and decoding the encoded vectors to generate dynamic information using a BGRU with temporal attention. We validate our framework using an online recognition system applied to a benchmark Latin, Arabic and Indian On/Off dual-handwriting character database. The performance of the proposed multi-lingual system is demonstrated through a low error rate of point coordinates and high accuracy system rate.},

  abstract     = {The advent of multifactorial optimization (MFO) has made a wind of change in intelligence computation in general and specifically in evolutionary computing. Based on the implicit parallelism of population-based search, MFO optimizes different problems simultaneously and entirely. However, the randomness of knowledge transfers raises the question of how to diminish harmful interactions among tasks for more effective transfers. In recent years, many proposals have been devised to handle this paradigm and improve existing algorithms. Notwithstanding the diversity in their concept, there are few efforts to solve many-task optimization (MaTO) that contains beyond three tasks. In light of this reason, this paper proposes two algorithms named SA-MFEA and LSA-MFEA for MaTO. Instead of utilizing fixed parameters, SA-MFEA and LSA-MFEA adapt the probability of random mating parameter to reduce negative transfers based on the historical memory of successful rmp. Besides, LSA-MFEA is capable of enhancing the exploitation by linear population size reduction. To examine the efficiency of the two proposed algorithms, experiments on various many-task benchmark problems and comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms have been conducted. The results demonstrated that SA-MFEA and LSA-MFEA are competitive in terms of quality of solutions, convergence trend, and computation time.},

In this paper, we present a decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for solving scalable multi/many-objective problems. The key features of the algorithm include the following three aspects: (1) a resource allocation strategy to coordinate the utility value of subproblems for good coverage; (2) a multioperator and multiparameter strategy to improve adaptability and diversity of the population; and (3) a bidirectional local search strategy to prevent the decrease in exploration capability during the early stage and increase the exploitation capability during the later stage of the search process.

The recorded historical success information guides the CLS to choose the chaotic map for the next iteration. In our experiment, we compare the chaotic spherical evolution algorithm (CSE) with the original SE and other metaheuristic algorithms. The test set consists of 29 benchmark functions from the CEC2017 benchmark set and 22 real-world optimization problems from the CEC2011 set.

  abstract     = {Various niching methods have been widely adopted for solving multimodal optimization. However, keeping a balance between exploitation and exploration is still a tough task for designers of multimodal optimization algorithms. An essential niching method is encouraged to deal with optimization problems. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive niching method based on multi-strategy fusion for multimodal optimization. The method changes the traditional way that populations are evaluated in meta-heuristic algorithms. First, a population-entropy based on information theory is proposed as the convergence-maintaining mechanism to track the population status in algorithms. Second, a distribution-radius based on similarity measurement is investigated as the diversity-preserving mechanism to measure the spatial distribution of the optimal solution found. Third, a utility-fitness based on utility theory is adopted to assess the quality of each individual and provide a trade-off between exploitation and exploration. Three strategies are tightly linked and form a closed loop, so that meta-heuristic algorithms equipped with the proposed approach are able to find multiple optimal solutions. The value of population-entropy, the length of distribution-radius, and the evaluation of utility-fitness interact with each other and are adaptively adjusted in each iteration. Meanwhile, our niching method is universal for meta-heuristic algorithms. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, experiments are conducted using kinds of test functions with different dimensions. The proposed approach is hybrid with different kinds of evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence algorithms, including genetic algorithm, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, brain storm optimization, and artificial bee colony algorithm. The hybrid algorithms are compared with other variants of the standard meta-heuristic algorithms. The validity of the algorithm is analyzed comprehensively. The statistical results show that the hybrid algorithms perform better than other algorithms in both peak ratio and success rate. Then, the hybrid algorithms are verified in practical scheduling problems, and the results show that the algorithms are able to effectively find multiple solutions.},

Firstly, the proposed LPE randomly selects three individuals from three consecutive populations, respectively, and then fits a line on each dimension of the three individuals by using the linear least square fitting model. Finally, LPE regards the line expression as its reproduction operator to generate the offspring individuals. LPE algorithm does not have any control parameters except for a population size. Its reproduction operator based on the linear least square fitting model holds solid mathematical foundation without any empirical coefficients, and is theoretically proven to be adaptive to the variation of population regions. The effectiveness of the proposed LPE is validated on CEC2014, CEC2017 benchmark functions and a comprehensive set of seven engineering design problems. The comparison experiments indicate that LPE is a competitive optimizer compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In this paper, we present a study on multiform multi-objective evolutionary optimization. In contrast to existing MOEAs, which only focus on the optimization of a single MOP, the proposed new paradigm considers to construct multiple forms of a given MOP, which may contain different useful information for solving the MOP. The evolutionary search is then performed on both the given MOP and the constructed forms concurrently. By transferring useful traits found along the evolutionary search across the given MOP and the built problem forms, enhanced multi-objective optimization performance can be obtained. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that considers the multiform optimization for solving MOP. To evaluate the performance of the proposed multiform paradigm for multi-objective optimization, comprehensive empirical studies with commonly used MOP benchmarks using different existing MOEAs as the basic MOP solvers are conducted and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Core-periphery structure detection (CPSD) in complex networks is essential to reveal functional nodes in the complicated systems, e.g., influential nodes in a social network and central cells in a biological network. Some progress has been made in solving the CPSD problem with heuristic algorithms. However, CPSD is naturally an NP-hard optimization problem and the core-periphery structures (CPSs) in real networks usually are not clearly distinguishable. The majority of the existing CPSD methods are single-objective methods relying on some assumptions, preference, and/or prior knowledge. They can provide only one trade-off solution that is inevitably biased and lacks of flexibility in terms of resolution. To address this issue, this paper formulates the CPSD problem as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), i.e., minimizing the core-node size and maximizing the core-node capacity of the CPSs, simultaneously. Solving the MOP can provide more accurate CPSs and allow one to explore the network structure at different preferred resolutions. A multi-objective memetic algorithm (called MOMA-PCLS) is accordingly proposed to solve the formulated problem. A new plateau-climbing local search (PCLS) method incorporating the information of the heavy-tailed distribution of the node capacity is introduced to fine-tune the individual solutions in MOMA-PCLS. By combining the evolutionary operations and PCLS, MOMA-PCLS manages to improve the search efficiency significantly. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show the superiority of MOMA-PCLS to other state-of-the-art algorithms in detecting CPSs of complex networks.},

However, most of the existing research has focused on the double-objective project scheduling problem, while literature on project scheduling problems with more than two objectives is rather scarce. In this paper, the typical multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is extended to a new triple-objective multi-mode project scheduling problem (TOMPSP) with the objectives of minimizing the project duration, minimizing the resource investment and maximizing the robustness of the schedule. To solve the presented triple-objective problem, we resort to the latest version of the multi-objective genetic algorithm, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). In the decoding process of the NSGA-III, a modified SSGS (serial schedule generation scheme), in which resource constraints are relaxed, is suggested by considering the delays of activities. Although the NSGA-III shows excellent performance in numerous multi-objective optimization problems with more than two objectives, it has a potential disadvantage in that it occasionally cannot find the intercept during the adaptive normalization process, and thus, the population cannot be normalized as expected. Since a case without an intercept is impossible in the NSGA-II, we adopt the NSGA-II normalization process rather than that of NSGA-III. The standard instances in PSPLib are modified to serve as the instances of the TOMPSP, and a computational experiment is conducted to test the algorithms. The results show that the presented algorithm not only greatly simplifies the implementation of the NSGA-III but also significantly improves the execution efficiency and calculation quality.},

In this paper, an adaptive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed by incorporating the concepts of the grid system (denoted as AGMOEA). Based on grid, the objective space is divided into subspaces. Based on the quality and dominance relationship between subspaces, the evolutionary opportunities are dynamically allocated to different subspaces with an adaptive selection strategy. To improve the evolutionary efficiency, the evolutionary scheme and an external archive mechanism considering representative individuals are proposed. The experimental results on 21 benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive or superior to the rival algorithms.},

In this paper, an efficient self-adaptive bilevel differential evolution (SABiLDE) with k-nearest neighbors (kNN) based interpolation is proposed to solve bilevel optimization problems. The kNN approximation is applied to estimate the optimal lower level variables for any newly generated upper candidates to improve the computational efficiency. A similarity based self-adaptive strategy for the dynamic control of lower level population size and search radius is introduced to further enhance the efficiency of the lower level function evaluations. A test set with 10 standard test problems and the SMD suite with controllable complexities are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Compared with four recent state-of-the-art methods, the numerical results produced by the proposed method are promising and show great potential for solving generic bilevel optimization problems.},

In this problem, products are firstly produced in a number of distributed hybrid flow shops (HFS) and then delivered to a customer in batches. To satisfy the production and distribution practice, some products can only be manufactured in a subset of distributed HFSs, and the transportation of some finished products is outsourced to a 3PL provider. Considering the NP-hardness of IPDSP, three fast heuristics (CR-based heuristic, SLACK-based heuristic, and EDD-based heuristic) and an adaptive human-learning-based genetic algorithm (AHLBGA) are proposed to minimize the sum of earliness, tardiness and delivery costs. Motivated by human learning behaviours, AHLBGA integrates an adaptive learning operator with traditional genetic operators to generate candidate solutions. Such learning operator performs social learning, family learning, and individual random learning to improve offspring individuals. The computational experiments on small-sized and large-sized test problems show the superiority of AHLBGA.},

  abstract     = {Navigation correction is usually frequently required by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially under uncertain navigation environments. Although the UAV’s straight flights that connect navigation correction points can constitute a plan of navigation corrections, the underlying attitude orientations of the UAV when flying through the visited points are also required by appropriate steering motions. In this regard, a UAV routing and orientation problem (UAV-ROP) that minimizes the 3D flight distances of the UAV under navigational, steering and uncertain constraints, is introduced and proven NP-hard in this paper. To optimize the layered routing and orientations in the UAV-ROP simultaneously, an effective memetic algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the algorithm, the GA performs the outer loop for optimizing the route and the local search metaheuristic does the inner loop for optimizing the orientations. Also, a globally maintained knowledge base that records high-quality sub-routes is used to accelerate the inner optimization of the memetic algorithm. The highlight in addressing the UAV-ROP in this paper is a layered optimization idea in a memetic algorithm to fit the layered optimization requirements of the problem. Experiments on open-access datasets indicate that, the proposed memetic algorithm shows an excellent overall performance compared with other competitors, which is qualified to give an authenticated reliable route with orientations of the UAV despite uncertain navigation environments.},

We design a timely-vertices based crossover operator and mutation operator to give birth to the offspring with high quality and good structure built in the search process.

  abstract     = {The challenge of maximizing the diversity of a collection of points arises in a variety of settings, and the growing interest of dealing with diversity resulted in an effort to study these problems in the last few years. Generally speaking, maximizing diversity consists in selecting a subset of points from a given set in such a way that a measure of their diversity is maximized. Different objective functions have been proposed to capture the notion of diversity, being the sum and the minimum of the distances between the selected points the most widely used. However, in all these models, the number of points to be selected is established beforehand, which in some settings can be unrealistic. In this paper, we target a variant recently introduced in which the model includes capacity values, which reflects the real situation in many location problems. We propose a mathematical model and a heuristic based on the Scatter Search methodology to maximize the diversity while satisfying the capacity constraint. Scatter search is a memetic algorithm hybridizing evolutionary global search with a problem-specific local search. Our empirical analysis with previously reported instances shows that the mathematical model implemented in Gurobi solves to optimality many more instances than the previous published model, and the heuristic outperforms a very recent development based on GRASP. We present a statistical analysis that permits us to draw significant conclusions.},

This paper presents two simple local search methods, the iterated greedy algorithm and iterated local search algorithm, to deal with type I mixed-model two-sided assembly line balancing problems. These two algorithms utilize new precedence-based local search functions with referenced permutation and two neighborhood structures to emphasize intensification while preserving high search speed. Additionally, these local search methods are enhanced by utilizing the best decoding scheme amongst nine candidates and a new station-oriented evaluation to guide the search direction. New lower bound calculations are also presented to check the optimality of the achieved solutions. Eleven recent and high-performing metaheuristic algorithms are re-implemented to test the performance of the proposed algorithms. A comprehensive study on a set of benchmark problems demonstrates the advantages of the improvements and the superiority of the two proposed methods.

However, these algorithms sometimes suffer slow and poor convergence toward the PO front. One of the remedies to improve their convergence is to couple global search of MOEAs with local search. However, such coupling brings other implementation challenges, such as what, when, and how many solutions can be chosen for local search with MOEAs? In this paper, these challenges are addressed by developing a local search module that can choose solutions for local search using a set of reference lines. The heuristic strategies are also developed with the module for determining the frequency of executing local search and for terminating MOEA adaptively using a statistical performance indicator. The proposed algorithm, which is referred to as $${\text {RM}}^2$$ OEA, is tested on 2-objective ZDT and 3-objective DTLZ test problems. Results demonstrate faster and improved convergence of $${\text {RM}}^2$$ OEA over a benchmark MOEA from the literature.},

More seriously, some algorithms even overemphasize the diversity of solution set in the decision space at the cost of convergence. How to improve convergence and diversity simultaneously is an important issue when solving multimodal multiobjective optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm with a decomposition strategy in the decision space (EMO-DD). A decision subregion allocation and diversity archive preservation methods are proposed to promote the diversity of solutions in the decision space. Meanwhile, a bi-objective optimization problem is formulated for screening for solutions with great convergence and diversity. Combining a modified mating selection method, well-performed solutions both on the convergence and diversity are preserved and inherited. The performance of EMO-DD is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on fifteen test problems.

  abstract     = {Many real-world combinatorial optimization problems have both expensive objective and constraint functions. Although surrogate models for the discrete decision variables can be trained to replace the expensive fitness evaluations in evolutionary algorithms, the approximation errors of the surrogate models for the constraint function easily misguide the search. The classic genetic algorithm, which is often applied straightforwardly to the combinatorial optimization problems, gradually exposes its inefficiency in the search process. Therefore, we proposed a random forest assisted evolutionary algorithm using a new competitive neighborhood search, where random forest is used as the surrogate models to approximate both the objective and constraint functions and the competitive neighborhood search is to improve the search efficiency. Moreover, competitive neighborhood search shows a natural adaptability to the surrogate model, which helps to reduce the impact of approximation errors. The proposed algorithm is tested on 01 knapsack problems and quadratic knapsack problems with various dimensions and constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to solve the expensive constrained combinatorial optimization problems efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a pre-processing procedure of choosing the optimal feature subsets for constructing model, yet it is difficult to satisfy the requirements of reducing number of features and maintaining classification accuracy. Towards this problem, we propose novel multi-objectives large-scale cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for three-objectives feature selection, termed MLFS-CCDE. Firstly, a cooperative searching framework is designed for efficiently and effectively seeking for the optimal feature subset. Secondly, in the framework, three objectives, feature’s number, classification accuracy and total information gain are established for guiding the evolution of features’ combination. Thirdly, in framework’s decomposition process, cluster-based decomposition strategy is elaborated for reducing the computation; in framework’s coevolution process, dual indicator-based representatives are elaborated for balancing the representative solution’ convergence and diversity. Finally, to verify framework’s practicability, a heart disease diagnosis system based on MLFS-CCDE framework is constructed in cardiology. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed MLFS-CCDE outperforms its competitors in terms of both classification accuracy and metrics of features’ number.},
