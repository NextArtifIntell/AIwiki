  abstract     = {Abstract. A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is the aggregation of insoluble amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles. A key histopathological observation is that tau protein aggregates follow a structured progression pattern through the brain. Mathematical network models of prion-like propagation have the ability to capture such patterns, but a number of factors impact the observed staging result, thus introducing questions regarding model selection. Here, we introduce a novel approach, based on braid diagrams, for studying the structured progression of a marker evolving on a network. We apply this approach to a six-stage ‘Braak pattern’ of tau proteins, in Alzheimer’s disease, motivated by a recent observation that seed-competent tau precedes tau aggregation. We show that the different modeling choices, from the model parameters to the connectome resolution, play a significant role in the landscape of observable staging patterns. Our approach provides a systematic way to approach model selection for network propagation of neurodegenerative diseases that ensures both reproducibility and optimal parameter fitting.Author Summary. Network diffusion models of neurodegenerative diseases are a class of dynamical systems that simulate the evolution of toxic proteins on the connectome. These models predict, from an initial seed, a pattern of invasion called staging. The generalized staging problem seeks to systematically study the effect of various model choices on staging. We introduce methods based on braid diagrams to test the possible staging landscape of a model and how it depends on the choice of connectome, as well as the model parameters. Our primary finding is that connectome construction, the choice of the graph Laplacian, and transport models all have an impact on staging that should be taken into account in any study.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Altered functional connectivity is related to severity of language impairment in poststroke aphasia. However, it is not clear whether this finding specifically reflects loss of functional coherence, or more generally, is related to decreased structural connectivity due to cortical necrosis. The aim of the current study was to investigate this issue by factoring out structural connectivity from functional connectivity measures and then relating the residual data to language performance poststroke. Ninety-seven participants with a history of stroke were assessed using language impairment measures (Auditory Verbal Comprehension and Spontaneous Speech scores from the Western Aphasia Battery–Revised) and MRI (structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional connectivity). We analyzed the association between functional connectivity and language and controlled for multiple potential neuroanatomical confounders, namely structural connectivity. We identified functional connections within the left hemisphere ventral stream where decreased functional connectivity, independent of structural connectivity, was associated with speech comprehension impairment. These connections exist in frontotemporal and temporoparietal regions. Our results suggest poor speech comprehension in aphasia is at least partially caused by loss of cortical synchrony in a left hemisphere ventral stream network and is not only reflective of localized necrosis or structural connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Previous research has shown that the autonomic nervous system provides essential constraints over ongoing cognitive function. However, there is currently a relative lack of direct empirical evidence for how this interaction manifests in the brain at the macroscale level. Here, we examine the role of ascending arousal and attentional load on large-scale network dynamics by combining pupillometry, functional MRI, and graph theoretical analysis to analyze data from a visual motion-tracking task with a parametric load manipulation. We found that attentional load effects were observable in measures of pupil diameter and in a set of brain regions that parametrically modulated their BOLD activity and mesoscale network-level integration. In addition, the regional patterns of network reconfiguration were correlated with the spatial distribution of the α2a adrenergic receptor. Our results further solidify the relationship between ascending noradrenergic activity, large-scale network integration, and cognitive task performance.Author Summary. In our daily lives, it is usual to encounter highly demanding cognitive tasks. They have been traditionally regarded as challenges that are solved mainly through cerebral activity, specifically via information-processing steps carried by neurons in the cerebral cortex. Activity in cortical networks thus constitutes a key factor for improving our understanding of cognitive processes. However, recent evidence has shown that evolutionary older players in the central nervous system, such as brain stem’s ascending modulatory systems, might play an equally important role in diverse cognitive mechanisms. Our article examines the role of the ascending arousal system on large-scale network dynamics by combining pupillometry, functional MRI, and graph theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Inferring the structural connectivity from electrophysiological measurements is a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. Directed functional connectivity measures, such as the generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC), provide estimates of the causal influence between areas. However, the relation between causality estimates and structural connectivity is still not clear. We analyzed this problem by evaluating the effectiveness of GPDC to estimate the connectivity of a ground-truth, data-constrained computational model of a large-scale network model of the mouse cortex. The model contains 19 cortical areas composed of spiking neurons, with areas connected by long-range projections with weights obtained from a tract-tracing cortical connectome. We show that GPDC values provide a reasonable estimate of structural connectivity, with an average Pearson correlation over simulations of 0.74. Moreover, even in a typical electrophysiological recording scenario containing five areas, the mean correlation was above 0.6. These results suggest that it may be possible to empirically estimate structural connectivity from functional connectivity even when detailed whole-brain recordings are not achievable.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Temporal networks have become increasingly pervasive in many real-world applications, including the functional connectivity analysis of spatially separated regions of the brain. A major challenge in analysis of such networks is the identification of noise confounds, which introduce temporal ties that are nonessential, or links that are formed by chance due to local properties of the nodes. Several approaches have been suggested in the past for static networks or temporal networks with binary weights for extracting significant ties whose likelihood cannot be reduced to the local properties of the nodes. In this work, we propose a data-driven procedure to reveal the irreducible ties in dynamic functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI data with continuous weights. This framework includes a null model that estimates the latent characteristics of the distributions of temporal links through optimization, followed by a statistical test to filter the links whose formation can be reduced to the activities and local properties of their interacting nodes. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to a resting-state fMRI dataset, and provide further discussion on various aspects and advantages of it.Author Summary. In this work we propose an optimization-based null model to infer the significant ties, meaning the links that cannot be reduced to the local strengths and properties of the nodes, from the dynamic functional connectivity network. We asses multiple aspects of this approach and demonstrate that it is adaptable to most temporal segmentation methods. We demonstrate that this approach provides several advantages such as taking into account the global information of the network. We also compare the proposed model with several commonly applied null models empirically and theoretically.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Information exchange in the human brain is crucial for vital tasks and to drive diseases. Neuroimaging techniques allow for the indirect measurement of information flows among brain areas and, consequently, for reconstructing connectomes analyzed through the lens of network science. However, standard analyses usually focus on a small set of network indicators and their joint probability distribution. Here, we propose an information-theoretic approach for the analysis of synthetic brain networks (based on generative models) and empirical brain networks, and to assess connectome’s information capacity at different stages of dementia. Remarkably, our framework accounts for the whole network state, overcoming limitations due to limited sets of descriptors, and is used to probe human connectomes at different scales. We find that the spectral entropy of empirical data lies between two generative models, indicating an interpolation between modular and geometry-driven structural features. In fact, we show that the mesoscale is suitable for characterizing the differences between brain networks and their generative models. Finally, from the analysis of connectomes obtained from healthy and unhealthy subjects, we demonstrate that significant differences between healthy individuals and the ones affected by Alzheimer’s disease arise at the microscale (max. posterior probability smaller than 1\%) and at the mesoscale (max. posterior probability smaller than 10\%).Author Summary. Capitalizing on network information theory we propose a new framework for the analysis and comparison of empirical and synthetic human connectomes, in health and disease. We quantitatively assess the ability of our approach in identifying differences and similarities in the structural connectivity of the human brain, ranging between microscopic and macroscopic scales. Relying on two different diffusion processes, namely classic and maximal entropy random walks, we show that the mesoscale is suitable for capturing differences between empirical connectomes and their synthetic models, while differences between healthy subjects and patients affected by Alzheimer’s disease are mostly significant at the microscopic scale.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent developments of whole-brain models have demonstrated their potential when investigating resting-state brain activity. However, it has not been systematically investigated how alternating derivations of the empirical structural and functional connectivity, serving as the model input, from MRI data influence modeling results. Here, we study the influence from one major element: the brain parcellation scheme that reduces the dimensionality of brain networks by grouping thousands of voxels into a few hundred brain regions. We show graph-theoretical statistics derived from the empirical data and modeling results exhibiting a high heterogeneity across parcellations. Furthermore, the network properties of empirical brain connectomes explain the lion’s share of the variance in the modeling results with respect to the parcellation variation. Such a clear-cut relationship is not observed at the subject-resolved level per parcellation. Finally, the graph-theoretical statistics of the simulated connectome correlate with those of the empirical functional connectivity across parcellations. However, this relation is not one-to-one, and its precision can vary between models. Our results imply that network properties of both empirical connectomes can explain the goodness-of-fit of whole-brain models to empirical data at a global group level but not at a single-subject level, which provides further insights into the personalization of whole-brain models.Author Summary. The structural and functional connectivities of the brain, which reflect the anatomical connections of axonal bundles and the amount of coactivation between brain regions, respectively, only weakly correlate with each other. In order to enhance and investigate this relationship, large-scale whole-brain dynamical models were involved in this branch of research. However, how the definitions of the brain regions parcellated according to a so-called brain atlas influence these models has so far not been systematically assessed. In this article, we show that this influence can be large, and link group-averaged, atlas-induced deviations to network properties extracted from both types of connectivity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same association does not apply to subject-specific variations. These results may contribute to the further personalization of the whole-brain models.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A structural covariance network (SCN) has been used successfully in structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) studies. However, most SCNs have been constructed by a unitary marker that is insensitive for discriminating different disease phases. The aim of this study was to devise a novel regional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) that could provide more comprehensive information in morphological network analysis. R2SNs were constructed by computing the Pearson correlations between the radiomics features extracted from any pair of regions for each subject (AAL atlas). We further assessed the small-world property of R2SNs, and we evaluated the reproducibility in different datasets and through test-retest analysis. The relationships between the R2SNs and general intelligence/interregional coexpression of genes were also explored. R2SNs could be replicated in different datasets, regardless of the use of different feature subsets. R2SNs showed high reproducibility in the test-retest analysis (intraclass correlation coefficient &amp;gt; 0.7). In addition, the small-word property (σ &amp;gt; 2) and the high correlation between gene expression (R = 0.29, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and general intelligence were determined for R2SNs. Furthermore, the results have also been repeated in the Brainnetome atlas. R2SNs provide a novel, reliable, and biologically plausible method to understand human morphological covariance based on sMRI.Author Summary. Gray matter volume and cortical thickness are some of the most popular brain morphological measures of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). These patterns are important for understanding complex brain cognitive function. However, most of the studies typically analyze single/several anatomical regions independently without considering associations among brain regions. The structural covariance network (SCN) is often used to reconstruct the brain structural network from sMRI and is commonly used to measure the association between regions in the human brain with morphological similarity. However, most of the individual SCNs have been constructed by a unitary marker such as gray volume/cortical thickness with hyposensitivity. We develop a novel, reliable and biologically plausible brain network to understand human morphological covariance based on sMRI.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Previous computational models have related spontaneous resting-state brain activity with local excitatory–inhibitory balance in neuronal populations. However, how underlying neurotransmitter kinetics associated with E–I balance govern resting-state spontaneous brain dynamics remains unknown. Understanding the mechanisms by virtue of which fluctuations in neurotransmitter concentrations, a hallmark of a variety of clinical conditions, relate to functional brain activity is of critical importance. We propose a multiscale dynamic mean field (MDMF) model—a system of coupled differential equations for capturing the synaptic gating dynamics in excitatory and inhibitory neural populations as a function of neurotransmitter kinetics. Individual brain regions are modeled as population of MDMF and are connected by realistic connection topologies estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data. First, MDMF successfully predicts resting-state functional connectivity. Second, our results show that optimal range of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter concentrations subserve as the dynamic working point of the brain, that is, the state of heightened metastability observed in empirical blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals. Third, for predictive validity the network measures of segregation (modularity and clustering coefficient) and integration (global efficiency and characteristic path length) from existing healthy and pathological brain network studies could be captured by simulated functional connectivity from an MDMF model.Author Summary. How changes in neurotransmitter kinetics impact the organization of large-scale neurocognitive networks is an open question in neuroscience. Here, we propose a multiscale dynamic mean field (MDMF) model that incorporates biophysically realistic kinetic parameters of receptor binding in a dynamic mean field model and captures brain dynamics from the “whole brain.” MDMF could reliably reproduce the resting-state brain functional connectivity patterns. Further employing graph theoretic methods, MDMF could qualitatively explain the idiosyncrasies of network integration and segregation measures reported by previous clinical studies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Metamemory involves the ability to correctly judge the accuracy of our memories. The retrieval of memories can be improved using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) during sleep, but evidence for improvements to metamemory sensitivity is limited. Applying tES can enhance sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which along with metamemory requires the coordination of activity across distributed neural systems, suggesting that examining functional connectivity is important for understanding these processes. Nevertheless, little research has examined how functional connectivity modulations relate to overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. Here, we developed a closed-loop short-duration tES method, time-locked to up-states of ongoing slow-wave oscillations, to cue specific memory replays in humans. We measured electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence changes following stimulation pulses, and characterized network alterations with graph theoretic metrics. Using machine learning techniques, we show that pulsed tES elicited network changes in multiple frequency bands, including increased connectivity in the theta band and increased efficiency in the spindle band. Additionally, stimulation-induced changes in beta-band path length were predictive of overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. These findings add new insights into the growing literature investigating increases in memory performance through brain stimulation during sleep, and highlight the importance of examining functional connectivity to explain its effects.Author Summary. Numerous studies have demonstrated a clear link between sleep and memory—namely, memories are consolidated during sleep, leading to more stable and long-lasting representations. We have previously shown that tagging episodes with specific patterns of brain stimulation during encoding and replaying those patterns during sleep can enhance this consolidation process to improve confidence and decision-making of memories (metamemory). Here, we extend this work to examine network-level brain changes that occur following stimulation during sleep that predict metamemory improvements. Using graph theoretic and machine-learning methods, we found that stimulation-induced changes in beta-band path length predicted overnight improvements in metamemory. This novel finding sheds new light on the neural mechanisms of memory consolidation and suggests potential applications for improving metamemory.},

The edges of the graph encode the strength of the axonal connectivity between regions of the atlas that can be estimated via diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography. Herein, we aim to provide a novel perspective on the problem of choosing a suitable atlas for structural connectivity studies by assessing how robustly an atlas captures the network topology across different subjects in a homogeneous cohort. We measure this robustness by assessing the alignability of the connectomes, namely the possibility to retrieve graph matchings that provide highly similar graphs. We introduce two novel concepts. First, the graph Jaccard index (GJI), a graph similarity measure based on the well-established Jaccard index between sets; the GJI exhibits natural mathematical properties that are not satisfied by previous approaches. Second, we devise WL-align, a new technique for aligning connectomes obtained by adapting the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph-isomorphism test. We validated the GJI and WL-align on data from the Human Connectome Project database, inferring a strategy for choosing a suitable parcellation for structural connectivity studies. Code and data are publicly available.Author Summary. An important part of our current understanding of the structure of the human brain relies on the concept of brain network, which is obtained by looking at how different brain regions are connected with each other. In this paper we present a strategy for choosing a suitable parcellation of the brain for structural connectivity studies by making use of the concepts of network alignment and similarity. To do so, we design a novel similarity measure between weighted networks called graph Jaccard index, and a new network alignment technique called WL-align. By assessing the possibility to retrieve graph matchings that provide highly similar graphs, we show that morphology- and structure-based atlases define brain networks that are more topologically robust across a wide range of resolutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work presents a novel strategy for classifying neurons, represented by nodes of a directed graph, based on their circuitry (edge connectivity). We assume a stochastic block model (SBM) in which neurons belong together if they connect to neurons of other groups according to the same probability distributions. Following adjacency spectral embedding of the SBM graph, we derive the number of classes and assign each neuron to a class with a Gaussian mixture model-based expectation maximization (EM) clustering algorithm. To improve accuracy, we introduce a simple variation using random hierarchical agglomerative clustering to initialize the EM algorithm and picking the best solution over multiple EM restarts. We test this procedure on a large (≈212–215 neurons), sparse, biologically inspired connectome with eight neuron classes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is broadly stable to the choice of embedding dimension, and scales extremely well as the number of neurons in the network increases. Clustering accuracy is robust to variations in model parameters and highly tolerant to simulated experimental noise, achieving perfect classifications with up to 40\% of swapped edges. Thus, this approach may be useful to analyze and interpret large-scale brain connectomics data in terms of underlying cellular components.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The quantification of human brain functional (re)configurations across varying cognitive demands remains an unresolved topic. We propose that such functional configurations may be categorized into three different types: (a) network configural breadth, (b) task-to task transitional reconfiguration, and (c) within-task reconfiguration. Such functional reconfigurations are rather subtle at the whole-brain level. Hence, we propose a mesoscopic framework focused on functional networks (FNs) or communities to quantify functional (re)configurations. To do so, we introduce a 2D network morphospace that relies on two novel mesoscopic metrics, trapping efficiency (TE) and exit entropy (EE), which capture topology and integration of information within and between a reference set of FNs. We use this framework to quantify the network configural breadth across different tasks. We show that the metrics defining this morphospace can differentiate FNs, cognitive tasks, and subjects. We also show that network configural breadth significantly predicts behavioral measures, such as episodic memory, verbal episodic memory, fluid intelligence, and general intelligence. In essence, we put forth a framework to explore the cognitive space in a comprehensive manner, for each individual separately, and at different levels of granularity. This tool that can also quantify the FN reconfigurations that result from the brain switching between mental states.Author Summary. Understanding and measuring the ways in which human brain connectivity changes to accommodate a broad range of cognitive and behavioral goals is an important undertaking. We put forth a mesoscopic framework that captures such changes by tracking the topology and integration of information within and between functional networks (FNs) of the brain. Canonically, when FNs are characterized, they are separated from the rest of the brain network. The two metrics proposed in this work, trapping efficiency and exit entropy, quantify the topological and information integration characteristics of FNs while they are still embedded in the overall brain network. Trapping efficiency measures the module’s ability to preserve an incoming signal from escaping its local topology, relative to its total exiting weights. Exit entropy measures the module’s communication preferences with other modules/networks using information theory. When these two metrics are plotted in a 2D graph as a function of different brain states (i.e., cognitive/behavioral tasks), the resulting morphospace characterizes the extent of network reconfiguration between tasks (functional reconfiguration), and the change when moving from rest to an externally engaged “task-positive” state (functional preconfiguration), to collectively define network configural breadth. We also show that these metrics are sensitive to subject, task, and functional network identities. Overall, this method is a promising approach to quantify how human brains adapt to a range of tasks, and potentially to help improve precision clinical neuroscience.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modeling communication dynamics in the brain is a key challenge in network neuroscience. We present here a framework that combines two measurements for any system where different communication processes are taking place on top of a fixed structural topology: path processing score (PPS) estimates how much the brain signal has changed or has been transformed between any two brain regions (source and target); path broadcasting strength (PBS) estimates the propagation of the signal through edges adjacent to the path being assessed. We use PPS and PBS to explore communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks. We show that brain communication dynamics can be divided into three main “communication regimes” of information transfer: absent communication (no communication happening); relay communication (information is being transferred almost intact); and transducted communication (the information is being transformed). We use PBS to categorize brain regions based on the way they broadcast information. Subcortical regions are mainly direct broadcasters to multiple receivers; Temporal and frontal nodes mainly operate as broadcast relay brain stations; visual and somatomotor cortices act as multichannel transducted broadcasters. This work paves the way toward the field of brain network information theory by providing a principled methodology to explore communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose that the application of network theory to established psychological personality conceptions has great potential to advance a biologically plausible model of human personality. Stable behavioral tendencies are conceived as personality “traits.” Such traits demonstrate considerable variability between individuals, and extreme expressions represent risk factors for psychological disorders. Although the psychometric assessment of personality has more than hundred years tradition, it is not yet clear whether traits indeed represent “biophysical entities” with specific and dissociable neural substrates. For instance, it is an open question whether there exists a correspondence between the multilayer structure of psychometrically derived personality factors and the organizational properties of traitlike brain systems. After a short introduction into fundamental personality conceptions, this article will point out how network neuroscience can enhance our understanding about human personality. We will examine the importance of intrinsic (task-independent) brain connectivity networks and show means to link brain features to stable behavioral tendencies. Questions and challenges arising from each discipline itself and their combination are discussed and potential solutions are developed. We close by outlining future trends and by discussing how further developments of network neuroscience can be applied to personality research.},

In adults, such networks are modulated by the state of consciousness and the circadian rhythm; however, it is unknown if infant brain networks exhibit similar variation, given the unique temporal properties of infant sleep and circadian patterning. To address this, we analyzed functional connectivity networks calculated from long-term EEG recordings (average duration 20.8 hr) from 19 healthy infants. Networks were subject specific, as intersubject correlations between weighted adjacency matrices were low. However, within individual subjects, both sleep and wake networks were stable over time, with stronger functional connectivity during sleep than wakefulness. Principal component analysis revealed the presence of two dominant networks; visual sleep scoring confirmed that these corresponded to sleep and wakefulness. Lastly, we found that network strength, degree, clustering coefficient, and path length significantly varied with time of day, when measured in either wakefulness or sleep at the group level. Together, these results suggest that modulation of healthy functional networks occurs over ∼24 hr and is robust and repeatable. Accounting for such temporal periodicities may improve the physiological interpretation and use of functional connectivity analysis to investigate brain function in health and disease.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Describing how the brain anatomical wiring contributes to the emergence of coordinated neural activity underlying complex behavior remains challenging. Indeed, patterns of remote coactivations that adjust with the ongoing task-demand do not systematically match direct, static anatomical links. Here, we propose that observed coactivation patterns, known as functional connectivity (FC), can be explained by a controllable linear diffusion dynamics defined on the brain architecture. Our model, termed structure-informed FC, is based on the hypothesis that different sets of brain regions controlling the information flow on the anatomical wiring produce state-specific functional patterns. We thus introduce a principled framework for the identification of potential control centers in the brain. We find that well-defined, sparse, and robust sets of control regions, partially overlapping across several tasks and resting state, produce FC patterns comparable to empirical ones. Our findings suggest that controllability is a fundamental feature allowing the brain to reach different states.Author Summary. Understanding how brain anatomy promotes particular patterns of coactivations among neural regions is a key challenge in neuroscience. This challenge can be addressed using network science and systems theory. Here, we propose that coactivations result from the diffusion of information through the network of anatomical links connecting brain regions, with certain regions controlling the dynamics. We translate this hypothesis into a model called structure-informed functional connectivity, and we introduce a framework for identifying control regions based on empirical data. We find that our model produces coactivation patterns comparable to empirical ones, and that distinct sets of control regions are associated with different functional states. These findings suggest that controllability is an important feature allowing the brain to reach different states.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Network analysis of large-scale neuroimaging data is a particularly challenging computational problem. Here, we adapt a novel analytical tool, the community dynamic inference method (CommDy), for brain imaging data from young and aged mice. CommDy, which was inspired by social network theory, has been successfully used in other domains in biology; this report represents its first use in neuroscience. We used CommDy to investigate aging-related changes in network metrics in the auditory and motor cortices by using flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging in brain slices and in vivo. We observed that auditory cortical networks in slices taken from aged brains were highly fragmented compared to networks observed in young animals. CommDy network metrics were then used to build a random-forests classifier based on NMDA receptor blockade data, which successfully reproduced the aging findings, suggesting that the excitatory cortical connections may be altered during aging. A similar aging-related decline in network connectivity was also observed in spontaneous activity in the awake motor cortex, suggesting that the findings in the auditory cortex reflect general mechanisms during aging. These data suggest that CommDy provides a new dynamic network analytical tool to study the brain and that aging is associated with fragmentation of intracortical networks.Author Summary. In this work, we introduce a novel technique (the community dynamic interference method, CommDy) which is based on social network theory, to analyze neural data. We use CommDy to analyze imaging data from the cerebral cortex of awake mice and mouse brain slices. In each case, data were obtained from young and aged mice. Using CommDy, we found that in both types of data, aging is associated with a fragmentation of cortical circuitry. Specifically, the strength of intracortical connectivity diminishes with aging, leaving fragmented cortical networks. Thus, CommDy is a novel tool now available to the neuroscience community, and has revealed aging-related pathology of cortical networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While brain imaging tools like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) afford measurements of whole-brain activity, it remains unclear how best to interpret patterns found amid the data’s apparent self-organization. To clarify how patterns of brain activity support brain function, one might identify metric spaces that optimally distinguish brain states across experimentally defined conditions. Therefore, the present study considers the relative capacities of several metric spaces to disambiguate experimentally defined brain states. One fundamental metric space interprets fMRI data topographically, that is, as the vector of amplitudes of a multivariate signal, changing with time. Another perspective compares the brain’s functional connectivity, that is, the similarity matrix computed between signals from different brain regions. More recently, metric spaces that consider the data’s topology have become available. Such methods treat data as a sample drawn from an abstract geometric object. To recover the structure of that object, topological data analysis detects features that are invariant under continuous deformations (such as coordinate rotation and nodal misalignment). Moreover, the methods explicitly consider features that persist across multiple geometric scales. While, certainly, there are strengths and weaknesses of each brain dynamics metric space, wefind that those that track topological features optimally distinguish experimentally defined brain states.Author Summary. Time-varying functional connectivity interprets brain function as time-varying patterns of coordinated brain activity. While many questions remain regarding how brain function emerges from multiregional interactions, advances in the mathematics of topological data analysis (TDA) may provide new insights. One tool from TDA, “persistent homology,” observes the occurrence and persistence of n-dimensional holes in a sequence of simplicial complexes extracted from a weighted graph. In the present study, we compare the use of persistent homology versus more traditional metrics at the task of segmenting brain states that differ across experimental conditions. We find that the structures identified by persistent homology more accurately segment the stimuli, more accurately segment high versus low performance levels under common stimuli, and generalize better across volunteers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent evidence suggests that the human functional connectome is stable at different timescales and is unique. These characteristics posit the functional connectome not only as an individual marker but also as a powerful discriminatory measure characterized by high intersubject variability. Among distinct sources of intersubject variability, the long-term sources include functional patterns that emerge from genetic factors. Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of additive genetic factors to the variability of functional networks by determining the heritability of the connectivity strength in a multivariate fashion. First, we reproduced and extended the connectome fingerprinting analysis to the identification of twin pairs. Then, we estimated the heritability of functional networks by a multivariate ACE modeling approach with bootstrapping. Twin pairs were identified above chance level using connectome fingerprinting, with monozygotic twin identification accuracy equal to 57.2\% on average for whole-brain connectome. Additionally, we found that a visual (0.37), the medial frontal (0.31), and the motor (0.30) functional networks were the most influenced by additive genetic factors. Our findings suggest that genetic factors not only partially determine intersubject variability of the functional connectome, such that twins can be identified using connectome fingerprinting, but also differentially influence connectivity strength in large-scale functional networks.Author Summary. The functional connectome is a unique representation of the functional organization of the human brain. As such, it has been extensively used as an individual marker, a “fingerprint,” because of its high intersubject variability.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Ongoing neuronal activity in the brain establishes functional networks that reflect normal and pathological brain function. Most estimates of these functional networks suffer from low spatiotemporal resolution and indirect measures of neuronal population activity, limiting the accuracy and reliability in their reconstruction over time. Here, we studied the stability of neuronal avalanche dynamics and corresponding reconstructed functional networks in the adult brain. Using chronically implanted high-density microelectrode arrays, the local field potential (LFP) of resting-state activity was recorded in prefrontal and premotor cortex of awake nonhuman primates. Avalanche dynamics revealed stable scaling exhibiting an inverted parabolic profile and collapse exponent of 2 in line with a critical branching process over many days and weeks. Functional networks were based on a Bayesian-derived estimator and demonstrated stable integrative properties characterized by nontrivial high neighborhood overlap between strongly connected nodes and robustness to weak-link pruning. Entropy-based mixing analysis revealed significant changes in strong link weights over weeks. The long-term stability in avalanche scaling and integrative network organization in the face of individual link weight changes should support the development of noninvasive biomarkers to characterize normal and abnormal brain states in the adult brain.Author Summary. The brain is spontaneously active even in the absence of specific sensations or movements. This ongoing activity arises from the interactions among hundreds of thousands of neurons, which has been captured by a variety of distinct functional networks predictive of healthy and pathological brain functions. The global dynamical states and overarching network principles that underlie such ongoing brain activity are not well understood. Here we identify avalanche dynamics and “friendship” networks as two major features of ongoing activity in the frontal cortex of nonhuman primates. We demonstrate their stability over weeks in the face of local network changes. Deviation from avalanche dynamics and “friendship” organization might provide robust biomarkers to identify normal and pathological brain states.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding how human brain microstructure influences functional connectivity is an important endeavor. In this work, magnetic resonance imaging data from 90 healthy participants were used to calculate structural connectivity matrices using the streamline count, fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and a myelin measure (derived from multicomponent relaxometry) to assign connection strength. Unweighted binarized structural connectivity matrices were also constructed. Magnetoencephalography resting-state data from those participants were used to calculate functional connectivity matrices, via correlations of the Hilbert envelopes of beamformer time series in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Nonnegative matrix factorization was performed to identify the components of the functional connectivity. Shortest path length and search-information analyses of the structural connectomes were used to predict functional connectivity patterns for each participant. The microstructure-informed algorithms predicted the components of the functional connectivity more accurately than they predicted the total functional connectivity. This provides a methodology to understand functional mechanisms better. The shortest path length algorithm exhibited the highest prediction accuracy. Of the weights of the structural connectivity matrices, the streamline count and the myelin measure gave the most accurate predictions, while the fractional anisotropy performed poorly. Overall, different structural metrics paint very different pictures of the structural connectome and its relationship to functional connectivity.Author Summary. We use microstructural MRI and resting-state MEG data to investigate the relationship between the brain’s structure and function. We construct functional brain networks by calculating correlations between the Hilbert envelope of the beamformer time series in different brain areas. We also construct structural brain networks using tractography, for five different edge weightings (number of streamlines, fractional anisotropy, myelination, radial diffusivity, and a binary weighting). Those structural networks are then used in function-predicting algorithms, and the predicted functional networks are compared to the measured ones. We observe that the shortest-path-length algorithm is better at predicting the observed patterns of functional connectivity, and that the number of streamlines and myelination are the edge weightings that lead to the highest correlations between the predicted and the observed functional connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. During wakeful rest, individuals make small eye movements during fixation. We examined how these endogenously driven oculomotor patterns impact topography and topology of functional brain networks. We used a dataset consisting of eyes-open resting-state (RS) fMRI data with simultaneous eye tracking. The eye-tracking data indicated minor movements during rest, which correlated modestly with RS BOLD data. However, eye-tracking data correlated well with echo-planar imaging time series sampled from the area of the eye-orbit (EO-EPI), which is a signal previously used to identify eye movements during exogenous saccades and movie viewing. Further analyses showed that EO-EPI data were correlated with activity in an extensive motor and sensorimotor network, including components of the dorsal attention network and the frontal eye fields. Partialling out variance related to EO-EPI from RS data reduced connectivity, primarily between sensorimotor and visual areas. It also produced networks with higher modularity, lower mean connectivity strength, and lower mean clustering coefficient. Our results highlight new aspects of endogenous eye movement control during wakeful rest. They show that oculomotor-related contributions form an important component of RS network topology, and that those should be considered in interpreting differences in network structure between populations or as a function of different experimental conditions.Author Summary. We studied how subtle eye movements made during fixation, in absence of any other task, are related to resting-state connectivity measured using fMRI. We used a dataset for which eye tracking and BOLD resting-state were acquired simultaneously. We correlated brain activity with both eye-tracking metrics as well as time series sampled from the area of the eye orbits (EO-EPI). Eye-tracking data correlated well with the EO-EPI data. Furthermore, EO-EPI correlated with BOLD signal in sensorimotor and visual brain systems. Removing variance related to EO-EPI reduced connectivity between sensorimotor and visual areas and resulted in more modular resting-state networks. Our findings show that oculomotor-related contributions are an important component of resting-state network topology, and that they can be studied using EPI data from the eye orbits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We measured MRI network progression in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) patients as a function of healthy brain architecture. Resting-state functional MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI were acquired in 40 unilateral mTLE patients and 70 healthy controls. Data were used to construct region-to-region functional connectivity, structural connectivity, and streamline length connectomes per subject. Three models of distance from the presumed seizure focus in the anterior hippocampus in the healthy brain were computed using the average connectome across controls. A fourth model was defined using regions of transmodal (higher cognitive function) to unimodal (perceptual) networks across a published functional gradient in the healthy brain. These models were used to test whether network progression in patients increased when distance from the anterior hippocampus or along a functional gradient in the healthy brain decreases. Results showed that alterations of structural and functional networks in mTLE occur in greater magnitude in regions of the brain closer to the seizure focus based on healthy brain topology, and decrease as distance from the focus increases over duration of disease. Overall, this work provides evidence that changes across the brain in focal epilepsy occur along healthy brain architecture.Author Summary. In patients with focal epilepsy, seizures originate in the focus and propagate across the brain. Over years of duration of disease, these repeated seizures lead to network reorganization and disruption. We hypothesized that these changes occur along a framework that could be identified through healthy brain architecture, with the greatest changes occurring closest to the seizure focus and decreasing as distance from the focus increases. In this work we detected this pattern of change in functional and structural networks when distance to the focus was measured by functional and structural connectivity, respectively. Overall, this work presents a framework of spatiotemporal network progression over duration of disease related to the seizure focus and healthy brain architecture that may predict individual network evolution in focal epilepsy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Functional connectivity (FC) describes the statistical dependence between neuronal populations or brain regions in resting-state fMRI studies and is commonly estimated as the Pearson correlation of time courses. Clustering or community detection reveals densely coupled sets of regions constituting resting-state networks or functional systems. These systems manifest most clearly when FC is sampled over longer epochs but appear to fluctuate on shorter timescales. Here, we propose a new approach to reveal temporal fluctuations in neuronal time series. Unwrapping FC signal correlations yields pairwise co-fluctuation time series, one for each node pair or edge, and allows tracking of fine-scale dynamics across the network. Co-fluctuations partition the network, at each time step, into exactly two communities. Sampled over time, the overlay of these bipartitions, a binary decomposition of the original time series, very closely approximates functional connectivity. Bipartitions exhibit characteristic spatiotemporal patterns that are reproducible across participants and imaging runs, capture individual differences, and disclose fine-scale temporal expression of functional systems. Our findings document that functional systems appear transiently and intermittently, and that FC results from the overlay of many variable instances of system expression. Potential applications of this decomposition of functional connectivity into a set of binary patterns are discussed.Author Summary. Numerous studies of functional connectivity have revealed densely coupled sets of brain regions corresponding to resting-state networks or functional systems. Prior work suggests that functional connectivity fluctuates over time. Here, we extend those studies by suggesting that functional connectivity can be decomposed into a set of momentary network states, with each one partitioning the network into exactly two clusters or communities. We show that these bipartitions exhibit characteristic spatiotemporal patterns that are reproducible across participants and imaging runs, and can capture individual differences. Our decomposition approach discloses fine-scale dynamics of functional systems, and reveals that functional systems coalesce and dissolve at different times and on fast timescales. Numerous applications and extensions of the approach are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Functional and effective networks inferred from time series are at the core of network neuroscience. Interpreting properties of these networks requires inferred network models to reflect key underlying structural features. However, even a few spurious links can severely distort network measures, posing a challenge for functional connectomes. We study the extent to which micro- and macroscopic properties of underlying networks can be inferred by algorithms based on mutual information and bivariate/multivariate transfer entropy. The validation is performed on two macaque connectomes and on synthetic networks with various topologies (regular lattice, small-world, random, scale-free, modular). Simulations are based on a neural mass model and on autoregressive dynamics (employing Gaussian estimators for direct comparison to functional connectivity and Granger causality). We find that multivariate transfer entropy captures key properties of all network structures for longer time series. Bivariate methods can achieve higher recall (sensitivity) for shorter time series but are unable to control false positives (lower specificity) as available data increases. This leads to overestimated clustering, small-world, and rich-club coefficients, underestimated shortest path lengths and hub centrality, and fattened degree distribution tails. Caution should therefore be used when interpreting network properties of functional connectomes obtained via correlation or pairwise statistical dependence measures, rather than more holistic (yet data-hungry) multivariate models.Author Summary. We compare bivariate and multivariate methods for inferring networks from time series, which are generated using a neural mass model and autoregressive dynamics. We assess their ability to reproduce key properties of the underlying structural network. Validation is performed on two macaque connectomes and on synthetic networks with various topologies (regular lattice, small-world, random, scale-free, modular). Even a few spurious links can severely bias key network properties. Multivariate transfer entropy performs best on all topologies for longer time series.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Myelin plays a crucial role in how well information travels between brain regions. Complementing the structural connectome, obtained with diffusion MRI tractography, with a myelin-sensitive measure could result in a more complete model of structural brain connectivity and give better insight into white-matter myeloarchitecture. In this work we weight the connectome by the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), a measure sensitive to myelin, and then we assess its added value by comparing it with connectomes weighted by the number of streamlines (NOS). Our analysis reveals differences between the two connectomes both in the distribution of their weights and the modular organization. Additionally, the rank-based analysis shows that R1 can be used to separate transmodal regions (responsible for higher-order functions) from unimodal regions (responsible for low-order functions). Overall, the R1-weighted connectome provides a different perspective on structural connectivity taking into account white matter myeloarchitecture.Author Summary. In the present work, we show that by using a myelin-sensitive measure we can complement the diffusion MRI-based connectivity and provide a different picture of the brain organization. We show that the R1-weighted average distribution does not follow the same trend as the number of streamlines strength distribution, and the two connectomes exhibit different modular organization. We also show that unimodal cortical regions tend to be connected by more streamlines, but the connections exhibit a lower R1-weighted average, while the transmodal regions have higher R1-weighted average but fewer streamlines. This could imply that the unimodal regions require more connections with lower myelination, whereas the transmodal regions rely on connections with higher myelination.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Identifying the nodes able to drive the state of a network is crucial to understand, and eventually control, biological systems. Despite recent advances, such identification remains difficult because of the huge number of equivalent controllable configurations, even in relatively simple networks. Based on the evidence that in many applications it is essential to test the ability of individual nodes to control a specific target subset, we develop a fast and principled method to identify controllable driver-target configurations in sparse and directed networks. We demonstrate our approach on simulated networks and experimental gene networks to characterize macrophage dysregulation in human subjects with multiple sclerosis.Author Summary. We introduce an optimized heuristic, called stepwise target controllability, to quantify the centrality of a candidate driver node to influence the state of a network target set. We use this method to study macrophage gene network alterations in multiple sclerosis. We show that multiple sclerosis is characterized by a global loss of gene coactivation and that this is due to the dysregulation of few molecules along the driver-target pathways. These findings provide new insights into the macrophage network mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and provide fresh tools for the study of driver-target controllability in complex networked systems.},

The application of graph theory to model the complex structure and function of the brain has shed new light on its organization, prompting the emergence of network neuroscience. Despite the tremendous progress that has been achieved in this field, still relatively few methods exploit the topology of brain networks to analyze brain activity. Recent attempts in this direction have leveraged on the one hand graph spectral analysis (to decompose brain connectivity into eigenmodes or gradients) and the other graph signal processing (to decompose brain activity “coupled to” an underlying network in graph Fourier modes). These studies have used a variety of imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI, electroencephalography, diffusion-weighted and myelin-sensitive imaging) and connectivity estimators to model brain networks. Results are promising in terms of interpretability and functional relevance, but methodologies and terminology are variable. The goals of this paper are twofold. First, we summarize recent contributions related to connectivity gradients and graph signal processing, and attempt a clarification of the terminology and methods used in the field, while pointing out current methodological limitations. Second, we discuss the perspective that the functional relevance of connectivity gradients could be fruitfully exploited by considering them as graph Fourier bases of brain activity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The intrinsic function of the human brain is dynamic, giving rise to numerous behavioral subtypes that fluctuate distinctively at multiple timescales. One of the key dynamical processes that takes place in the brain is the interaction between core-periphery brain regions, which undergoes constant fluctuations associated with developmental time frames. Core-periphery dynamical changes associated with macroscale brain network dynamics span multiple timescales and may lead to atypical behavior and clinical symptoms. For example, recent evidence suggests that brain regions with shorter intrinsic timescales are located at the periphery of brain networks (e.g., sensorimotor hand, face areas) and are implicated in perception and movement. On the contrary, brain regions with longer timescales are core hub regions. These hubs are important for regulating interactions between the brain and the body during self-related cognition and emotion. In this review, we summarize a large body of converging evidence derived from time-resolved fMRI studies in autism to characterize atypical core-periphery brain dynamics and how they relate to core and contextual sensory and cognitive profiles.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding the neuroplastic capacity of people with Down syndrome (PwDS) can potentially reveal the causal relationship between aberrant brain organization and phenotypic characteristics. We used resting-state EEG recordings to identify how a neuroplasticity-triggering training protocol relates to changes in the functional connectivity of the brain’s intrinsic cortical networks. Brain activity of 12 PwDS before and after a 10-week protocol of combined physical and cognitive training was statistically compared to quantify changes in directed functional connectivity in conjunction with psychosomatometric assessments. PwDS showed increased connectivity within the left hemisphere and from left-to-right hemisphere, as well as increased physical and cognitive performance. Our findings reveal a strong adaptive neuroplastic reorganization as a result of the training that leads to a less-random network with a more pronounced hierarchical organization. Our results go beyond previous findings by indicating a transition to a healthier, more efficient, and flexible network architecture, with improved integration and segregation abilities in the brain of PwDS. Resting-state electrophysiological brain activity is used here for the first time to display meaningful relationships to underlying Down syndrome processes and outcomes of importance in a translational inquiry. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04390321.Author Summary. The effects of cognitive and physical training on the neuroplasticity attributes of people with and without cognitive impairment have been well documented via neurophysiological evaluations and network science indices. However, there is still insufficient evidence for people with Down syndrome (PwDS). We investigated the effects of a combinational training protocol on the brain network organization of 12 adult PwDS by using EEG and network indices coupled with tests assessing their cognitive and physical capacity. We report evidence of adaptational neuroplastic effects, pointing to a transitional state toward a healthier organization with an increased ability to integrate and segregate information. Our findings underline the ability of the Down syndrome brain to respond to the cognitive demands of external stimuli, reflecting the possibility of developing independent-living skills.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. At the inception of human brain mapping, two principles of functional anatomy underwrote most conceptions—and analyses—of distributed brain responses: namely, functional segregation and integration. There are currently two main approaches to characterizing functional integration. The first is a mechanistic modeling of connectomics in terms of directed effective connectivity that mediates neuronal message passing and dynamics on neuronal circuits. The second phenomenological approach usually characterizes undirected functional connectivity (i.e., measurable correlations), in terms of intrinsic brain networks, self-organized criticality, dynamical instability, and so on. This paper describes a treatment of effective connectivity that speaks to the emergence of intrinsic brain networks and critical dynamics. It is predicated on the notion of Markov blankets that play a fundamental role in the self-organization of far from equilibrium systems. Using the apparatus of the renormalization group, we show that much of the phenomenology found in network neuroscience is an emergent property of a particular partition of neuronal states, over progressively coarser scales. As such, it offers a way of linking dynamics on directed graphs to the phenomenology of intrinsic brain networks.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Brain controllability properties are normally derived from the white matter fiber tracts in which the neural substrate of the actual energy consumption, namely the gray matter, has been widely ignored. Here, we study the relationship between gray matter volume of regions across the whole cortex and their respective control properties derived from the structural architecture of the white matter fiber tracts. The data suggests that the ability of white fiber tracts to exhibit control at specific nodes not only depends on the connection strength of the structural connectome but additionally depends on gray matter volume at the host nodes. Our data indicate that connectivity strength and gray matter volume interact with respect to the brain’s control properties. Disentangling effects of the regional gray matter volume and connectivity strength, we found that frontal and sensory areas play crucial roles in controllability. Together these results suggest that structural and regional properties of the white matter and gray matter provide complementary information in studying the control properties of the intrinsic structural and functional architecture of the brain.Author Summary. Network control theory suggests that the functions of large-scale brain circuits can be partially described with respect to the ability of brain regions to steer brain activity to different states. This ability, often quantified in terms of controllability metrics, has normally been derived from the structural architecture of the white matter fiber tracts. However, gray matter as the substrate that engenders much of the neural processes is widely ignored in this context. In the present work, we study the relationship between regional gray matter volume and control properties across the whole cortex and provide evidence that control properties not only depend on the connection strength of the structural connectome but also depend on sufficient gray matter volume at the host nodes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cytosolic PSD-95 interactor (cypin) regulates many aspects of neuronal development and function, ranging from dendritogenesis to synaptic protein localization. While it is known that removal of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) from the postsynaptic density decreases synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and that cypin overexpression protects neurons from NMDA-induced toxicity, little is known about cypin’s role in AMPA receptor clustering and function. Experimental work shows that cypin overexpression decreases PSD-95 levels in synaptosomes and the PSD, decreases PSD-95 clusters/μm2, and increases mEPSC frequency. Analysis of microelectrode array (MEA) data demonstrates that cypin or cypinΔPDZ overexpression increases sensitivity to CNQX (cyanquixaline) and AMPA receptor-mediated decreases in spike waveform properties. Network-level analysis of MEA data reveals that cypinΔPDZ overexpression causes networks to be resilient to CNQX-induced changes in local efficiency. Incorporating these findings into a computational model of a neural circuit demonstrates a role for AMPA receptors in cypin-promoted changes to networks and shows that cypin increases firing rate while changing network functional organization, suggesting cypin overexpression facilitates information relay but modifies how information is encoded among brain regions. Our data show that cypin promotes changes to AMPA receptor signaling independent of PSD-95 binding, shaping neural circuits and output to regions beyond the hippocampus.Author Summary. We used lentivirus to overexpress cytosolic PSD-95 interactor (cypin) and a cypin mutant that cannot bind PSD-95 (cypinΔPDZ) to understand how cypin regulates synaptic signaling. Using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we show that cypin, but not the cypin mutant, regulates synaptic PSD-95 content. Surprisingly, cypin overexpression increases AMPA receptor function independent of its role in PSD-95 localization, while cypinΔPDZ overexpression causes networks to be resistant to CNQX-mediated changes to local efficiency. We then developed a computational model to account for the effects of cypin overexpression, finding that our simulated model also demonstrates a role for AMPA receptors in cypin-promoted changes to neural circuits. These results support a role for cypin in controlling synaptic function at synapses that is distinct from regulation of PSD-95 function.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Measures of human brain functional connectivity acquired during the resting-state track critical aspects of behavior. Recently, fluctuations in resting-state functional connectivity patterns—typically averaged across in traditional analyses—have been considered for their potential neuroscientific relevance. There exists a lack of research on the differences between traditional “static” measures of functional connectivity and newly considered “time-varying” measures as they relate to human behavior. Using functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) data collected at rest, and a battery of behavioral measures collected outside the scanner, we determined the degree to which each modality captures aspects of personality and cognitive ability. Measures of time-varying functional connectivity were derived by fitting a hidden Markov model. To determine behavioral relationships, static and time-varying connectivity measures were submitted separately to canonical correlation analysis. A single relationship between static functional connectivity and behavior existed, defined by measures of personality and stable behavioral features. However, two relationships were found when using time-varying measures. The first relationship was similar to the static case. The second relationship was unique, defined by measures reflecting trialwise behavioral variability. Our findings suggest that time-varying measures of functional connectivity are capable of capturing unique aspects of behavior to which static measures are insensitive.Author Summary. Correlated patterns of brain activity measured in the absence of any prescribed task show meaningful temporal fluctuations. However, the manner by which such fluctuations track aspects of human behavior remains unresolved. The current report takes a data-driven approach to characterize how time-varying patterns of human brain functional connectivity differ from traditional static measures in their ability to track aspects of personality and cognitive ability. We determine that time-varying patterns of functional connectivity not only track similar aspects of behavior as do static measures, but also unique behavioral qualities as well, specifically those that reflect behavioral variability. These results highlight the importance and relevance of examining time-varying measures of functional connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sex steroid hormones have been shown to alter regional brain activity, but the extent to which they modulate connectivity within and between large-scale functional brain networks over time has yet to be characterized. Here, we applied dynamic community detection techniques to data from a highly sampled female with 30 consecutive days of brain imaging and venipuncture measurements to characterize changes in resting-state community structure across the menstrual cycle. Four stable functional communities were identified, consisting of nodes from visual, default mode, frontal control, and somatomotor networks. Limbic, subcortical, and attention networks exhibited higher than expected levels of nodal flexibility, a hallmark of between-network integration and transient functional reorganization. The most striking reorganization occurred in a default mode subnetwork localized to regions of the prefrontal cortex, coincident with peaks in serum levels of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone. Nodes from these regions exhibited strong intranetwork increases in functional connectivity, leading to a split in the stable default mode core community and the transient formation of a new functional community. Probing the spatiotemporal basis of human brain–hormone interactions with dynamic community detection suggests that hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle result in temporary, localized patterns of brain network reorganization.Author Summary. Sex steroid hormones influence the central nervous system across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Estrogen and progesterone concentrations rise and fall throughout the menstrual cycle, but it remains poorly understood whether day-to-day fluctuations in hormones shape human brain dynamics. Here, we assessed the structure and stability of resting-state brain network connectivity in concordance with serum hormone levels from a female who underwent fMRI and venipuncture for 30 consecutive days. Our results reveal that while network structure is largely stable over the course of a menstrual cycle, temporary reorganization of several large-scale functional brain networks occurs during the ovulatory window. In particular, a default mode subnetwork exhibits increased connectivity with itself and with nodes belonging to the temporoparietal and limbic networks, providing novel perspective into brain-hormone interactions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Network neuroscience employs graph theory to investigate the human brain as a complex network, and derive generalizable insights about the brain’s network properties. However, graph-theoretical results obtained from network construction pipelines that produce idiosyncratic networks may not generalize when alternative pipelines are employed. This issue is especially pressing because a wide variety of network construction pipelines have been employed in the human network neuroscience literature, making comparisons between studies problematic. Here, we investigate how to produce networks that are maximally representative of the broader set of brain networks obtained from the same neuroimaging data. We do so by minimizing an information-theoretic measure of divergence between network topologies, known as the portrait divergence. Based on functional and diffusion MRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we consider anatomical, functional, and multimodal parcellations at three different scales, and 48 distinct ways of defining network edges. We show that the highest representativeness can be obtained by using parcellations in the order of 200 regions and filtering functional networks based on efficiency-cost optimization—though suitable alternatives are also highlighted. Overall, we identify specific node definition and thresholding procedures that neuroscientists can follow in order to derive representative networks from their human neuroimaging data.},

There have been successful applications of deep learning to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where fMRI data were mostly considered to be structured grids, and spatial features from Euclidean neighbors were usually extracted by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the computer vision field. Recently, CNN has been extended to graph data and demonstrated superior performance. Here, we define graphs based on functional connectivity and present a connectivity-based graph convolutional network (cGCN) architecture for fMRI analysis. Such an approach allows us to extract spatial features from connectomic neighborhoods rather than from Euclidean ones, consistent with the functional organization of the brain. To evaluate the performance of cGCN, we applied it to two scenarios with resting-state fMRI data. One is individual identification of healthy participants and the other is classification of autistic patients from normal controls. Our results indicate that cGCN can effectively capture functional connectivity features in fMRI analysis for relevant applications.},

Here, we propose an approach called filter-banked connectivity (FBC) to estimate connectivity while preserving its full frequency range and subsequently examine both static and dynamic connectivity in one unified approach.First, we demonstrate that FBC can estimate connectivity across multiple frequencies missed by a sliding-window approach. Next, we use FBC to estimate FNC in a resting-state fMRI dataset including schizophrenia patients (SZ) and typical controls (TC). The FBC results are clustered into different network states. Some states showed weak low-frequency strength and as such were not captured in the window-based approach. Additionally, we found that SZs tend to spend more time in states exhibiting higher frequencies compared with TCs who spent more time in lower frequency states. Finally, we show that FBC enables us to analyze static and dynamic connectivity in a unified way. In summary, FBC offers a novel way to unify static and dynamic connectivity analyses and can provide additional information about the frequency profile of connectivity patterns.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Data-driven parcellations are widely used for exploring the functional organization of the brain, and also for reducing the high dimensionality of fMRI data. Despite the flurry of methods proposed in the literature, functional brain parcellations are not highly reproducible at the level of individual subjects, even with very long acquisitions. Some brain areas are also more difficult to parcellate than others, with association heteromodal cortices being the most challenging. An important limitation of classical parcellations is that they are static, that is, they neglect dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks. In this paper, we proposed a new method to identify dynamic states of parcellations, which we hypothesized would improve reproducibility over static parcellation approaches. For a series of seed voxels in the brain, we applied a cluster analysis to regroup short (3 min) time windows into “states” with highly similar seed parcels. We split individual time series of the Midnight scan club sample into two independent sets of 2.5 hr (test and retest). We found that average within-state parcellations, called stability maps, were highly reproducible (over 0.9 test-retest spatial correlation in many instances) and subject specific (fingerprinting accuracy over 70\% on average) between test and retest. Consistent with our hypothesis, seeds in heteromodal cortices (posterior and anterior cingulate) showed a richer repertoire of states than unimodal (visual) cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that static functional parcellations are incorrectly averaging well-defined and distinct dynamic states of brain parcellations. This work calls to revisit previous methods based on static parcellations, which includes the majority of published network analyses of fMRI data. Our method may, thus, impact how researchers model the rich interactions between brain networks in health and disease.Author Summary. Functional brain parcellation has been a very active topic of investigation for the past two decades, yet there is no evidence to date of reproducible results at the individual level—see for example Figure 2 in Gordon, Laumann, Gilmore, et al. (2017), with a Dice coefficient plateauing around 0.7 using 40 min or more of data. In this paper, we show that highly reproducible brain parcels can be observed using short (3 min) time windows. Different modes—or states—of reproducible parcellations can be observed in a single brain region, and these modes have only little overlap with each other. We carefully quantified these individual dynamic states of parcellation using the Midnight Brain Scan dataset, featuring 5 hr of functional MRI per subject. Our results indicate that static functional parcellation are incorrectly averaging well-defined and distinct dynamic states. This brings important caution for any work based on static atlases, which is the dominant approach currently in so-called network analysis of fMRI data.},

Techniques such as exploratory factor analysis (EFA) are used by neuroscientists to reduce measurements from a large number of brain regions to a tractable number of factors. However, dimension reduction often ignores relevant a priori knowledge about the structure of the data. For example, it is well established that the brain is highly symmetric. In this paper, we (a) show the adverse consequences of ignoring a priori structure in factor analysis, (b) propose a technique to accommodate structure in EFA by using structured residuals (EFAST), and (c) apply this technique to three large and varied brain-imaging network datasets, demonstrating the superior fit and interpretability of our approach.
