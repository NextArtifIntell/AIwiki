In this article, we point out that the paradox arises in the physical sciences, for physical probability or chance. By carefully formulating the paradox in this setting, we show that it is a puzzle for everyone, regardless of one’s preferred probability formalism. We propose a treatment that is inspired by the approach that scientists took when confronted with these cases.},

Yet contrary to philosophical expectations, this practice lacked a robust theoretical justification during the first half of the nineteenth century.

  abstract     = {An increasing number of arguments for causal pluralism invoke empirical psychological data. Different aspects of causal cognition—specifically, causal perception and causal inference—are thought to involve distinct cognitive processes and representations, and they thereby distinctively support transference and dependency theories of causation, respectively. We argue that this dualistic picture of causal concepts arises from methodological differences, rather than from an actual plurality of concepts. Hence, philosophical causal pluralism is not particularly supported by the empirical data. Serious engagement with cognitive science reveals that the connection between psychological concepts of causation and philosophical notions is substantially more complicated than is traditionally presumed.},

While global hyperbolicity may fail to be true of all physically reasonable models, we analyze whether global hyperbolicity should be (i) imposed by fiat; (ii) established from weaker assumptions, as in cosmic censorship theorems; or (iii) justified by beyond-GR physics.},

First I strengthen grounds for existing criticism by outlining three categories of criticism that put into question essential requirements of the proposal. Then I provide a new argument showing that any time-independent measure on the space of models of the universe must break a gauge symmetry. The Past Hypothesis then faces a new dilemma: reject a gauge symmetry and introduce a distinction without difference or reject the time independence of the measure and lose explanatory power.},

However, in all Kochen-Specker arguments discussed in the literature either 1 or 2 is not met. Arguments meeting 1 contain commuting operators that do not represent simultaneous measurements and hence fail to physically justify the functional composition principle. Arguments meeting 2 associate some operators with more than one measurement and hence need to invoke an extra assumption different from noncontextuality.},

We find that, often, those who received false information simply fail to receive retractions because of social dynamics. Surprisingly, delaying retraction can increase its impact. Further, retractions are most successful when issued by the original source of misinformation, rather than a separate source.},

I argue that Hemmo and Shenker’s arguments fail because of several misunderstandings about statistical-mechanical and thermodynamic domains of applicability, about the nature of mixed states, and about the role of approximations in physics. As a result, their arguments fail in all cases: in the single-particle case, the finite-particles case, and the infinite-particles case.},

Particle physicists provide detailed justifications as to why their experiments should be able to detect dark matter. I show that these justifications take on a structure different from what is often the case in experimental practice, and I argue that this is because of the limited description of dark matter. By illuminating this ‘method-driven logic’, I shed new light on questions surrounding measurement robustness and methodological pluralism in the context of dark matter research.},

MMJ displays models of distinct phenomena together and fulfills different desiderata both in the individual models and by a comparison of those models. I discuss a concrete case from developmental biology, where MMJ coordinates generality and detail. I also clarify the distinction between MMJ and multiple-models idealization (MMI), which also uses multiple models to manage trade-offs among desiderata. MMJ and MMI differ in several points, such as the ways they manage trade-offs and the purposes of using multiple models.},

The leading proposal among philosophers is that models are structural representations and are therefore distinguished by their format. However, an alternative conception is suggested by recent work in artificial intelligence, on which models are distinguished by their content. This article outlines the two conceptions and argues for the content conception, against the standard philosophical view.},

As information theorists have shown, data are compressible if and only if those data exhibit a pattern. Noting that high-level models are much simpler than their low-level counterparts, Dennett interprets high-level models as compressed representations of the fine-grained behavior of their target system. As such, he argues that high-level models depend on patterns in this behavior. Unfortunately, data scientific practice complicates Dennett’s interpretation, undermining the traditional justification for real patterns and suggesting a revised research program for its defenders.},
