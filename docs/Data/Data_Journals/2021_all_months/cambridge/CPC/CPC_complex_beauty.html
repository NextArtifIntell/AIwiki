  abstract     = {In this short note, we prove the following analog of the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem for intersection graphs of boxes. If ; is the intersection graph of ; axis-parallel boxes in ; such that ; contains no copy of ; , then ; has at most ; ( log ; ); edges, where ; = ; (; )&gt;0 only depends on ; . Our proof is based on exploring connections between boxicity, separation dimension and poset dimension. Using this approach, we also show that a construction of Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao and Tran of ; -free incidence graphs of points and rectangles in the plane can be used to disprove a conjecture of Alon, Basavaraju, Chandran, Mathew and Rajendraprasad. We show that there exist graphs of separation dimension 4 having superlinear number of edges.},

  abstract     = {The notion of the capacity of a polynomial was introduced by Gurvits around 2005, originally to give drastically simplified proofs of the van der Waerden lower bound for permanents of doubly stochastic matrices and Schrijver’s inequality for perfect matchings of regular bipartite graphs. Since this seminal work, the notion of capacity has been utilised to bound various combinatorial quantities and to give polynomial-time algorithms to approximate such quantities (e.g. the number of bases of a matroid). These types of results are often proven by giving bounds on how much a particular differential operator can change the capacity of a given polynomial. In this paper, we unify the theory surrounding such capacity-preserving operators by giving tight capacity preservation bounds for all nondegenerate real stability preservers. We then use this theory to give a new proof of a recent result of Csikvári, which settled Friedland’s lower matching conjecture.},

Our main contribution addresses limitations of existing technology: while there are now methods, first appearing in work of Ellis and the third author, for using spectral machinery to tackle problems in extremal set theory involving symmetry, this machinery relies crucially on the interplay between up-sets, biased product measures, and threshold behaviour in the Boolean hypercube, features that are notably absent in the problem considered here. To circumvent these barriers, introducing ideas that seem of independent interest, we develop a variant of the sharp threshold machinery that applies at the level of products of posets.},

The vast majority of existing drift theorems yield bounds on the expected value of the hitting time for a target state, for example the set of optimal solutions, without making additional statements on the distribution of this time. We address this lack by providing a general drift theorem that includes bounds on the upper and lower tail of the hitting time distribution. The new tail bounds are applied to prove very precise sharp-concentration results on the running time of a simple EA on standard benchmark problems, including the class of general linear functions. On all these problems, the probability of deviating by an ; -factor in lower-order terms of the expected time decreases exponentially with ; . The usefulness of the theorem outside the theory of RSHs is demonstrated by deriving tail bounds on the number of cycles in random permutations. All these results handle a position-dependent (variable) drift that was not covered by previous drift theorems with tail bounds. Finally, user-friendly specializations of the general drift theorem are given.},

In 2011, Newman and Nikolov disproved a conjecture of Beck that the discrepancy of any 3-permutation family is at most a constant independent of ; . Here we give a simpler proof that Newman and Nikolov’s sequence of 3-permutation families has discrepancy ; . We also exhibit a sequence of 6-permutation families with root-mean-squared discrepancy ; that is, in any red–blue vertex colouring, the square root of the expected squared difference between the number of red and blue vertices in an interval of the system is ; .},

The construction of (; , ; ) from (; , ; ) involves rewiring a random (possibly empty) subset of edges in ; towards the newly added vertex; as a consequence ; ⊄ ; with positive probability. The key feature of the process is that the shape of ; has the same law as that of a random recursive tree, while the degree distribution of any given vertex is not monotone in the process.; We present two applications. First, while couplings between Kingman’s coalescent and random recursive trees were known for any fixed ; , this new process provides a non-standard coupling of all finite Kingman’s coalescents. Second, we use the new process and the Chen–Stein method to extend the well-understood properties of degree distribution of random recursive trees to extremal-range cases. Namely, we obtain convergence rates on the number of vertices with degree at least ; , ; ∈ (1, 2), in trees with ; vertices. Further avenues of research are discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this work we consider three well-studied broadcast protocols: ; , ; and ; . A key property of all these models, which is also an important reason for their popularity, is that they are presumed to be very robust, since they are simple, randomized and, crucially, do not utilize explicitly the global structure of the underlying graph. While sporadic results exist, there has been no systematic theoretical treatment quantifying the robustness of these models. Here we investigate this question with respect to two orthogonal aspects: (adversarial) modifications of the underlying graph and message transmission failures.; We explore in particular the following notion of ; : beginning with a graph, we investigate up to which fraction of the edges an adversary may delete at each vertex, so that the protocols need significantly more rounds to broadcast the information. Our main findings establish a separation among the three models. On one hand, ; is robust with respect to all parameters that we consider. On the other hand, ; may slow down significantly, even if the adversary may modify the degrees of the vertices by an arbitrarily small positive fraction only. Finally, ; is robust when no message transmission failures are considered, otherwise it may be slowed down.; On the technical side, we develop two novel methods for the analysis of randomized rumour-spreading protocols. First, we exploit the notion of self-bounding functions to facilitate significantly the round-based analysis: we show that for any graph the variance of the growth of informed vertices is bounded by its expectation, so that concentration results follow immediately. Second, in order to control adversarial modifications of the graph we make use of a powerful tool from extremal graph theory, namely Szemerédi’s Regularity Lemma.},
