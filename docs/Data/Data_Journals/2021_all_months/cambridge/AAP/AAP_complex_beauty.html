We prove functional limit theorems for the process in the large-intensity asymptotic regime, where the arrival rate gets large while the shot shape function, cluster sizes, delays, and noises are unscaled. In the functional central limit theorem, the limit process is a continuous Gaussian process (assuming the arrival process satisfies a functional central limit theorem with a Brownian motion limit). We discuss the impact of the dependence among the random delays and among the noises within each cluster using several examples of dependent structures. We also study infinite-server queues with cluster/batch arrivals where customers in each batch may experience random delays before receiving service, with similar dependence structures.},

  abstract     = {Regular variation provides a convenient theoretical framework for studying large events. In the multivariate setting, the spectral measure characterizes the dependence structure of the extremes. This measure gathers information on the localization of extreme events and often has sparse support since severe events do not simultaneously occur in all directions. However, it is defined through weak convergence, which does not provide a natural way to capture this sparsity structure. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse regular variation, which makes it possible to better learn the dependence structure of extreme events. This concept is based on the Euclidean projection onto the simplex, for which efficient algorithms are known. We prove that under mild assumptions sparse regular variation and regular variation are equivalent notions, and we establish several results for sparsely regularly varying random vectors.},

Our results apply to approximations of reversible chains which are geometrically ergodic, as is typically the case for applications to MCMC. The focus of our work is on determining whether the approximating kernel will preserve the geometric ergodicity of the exact chain, and whether the approximating stationary distribution will be close to the original stationary distribution. For reversible chains, our results extend the results of Johndrow ; (2015) from the uniformly ergodic case to the geometrically ergodic case, under some additional regularity conditions.

The proposed rejection algorithm uses independent neutral Wright–Fisher diffusions as candidate proposals, which are only needed at a finite number of points. Once a candidate is accepted, the remainder of the path can be recovered by sampling from neutral multivariate Wright–Fisher bridges, for which an exact sampling strategy is also provided.

Under the condition of local detailed balance, we further show that the system has a global potential defined over the whole space, which plays a central role in the large deviation theory and the Freidlin–Wentzell-type metastability theory of chemical reaction networks.

We propose an alternative importance-sampling-based rejection methodology for the perfect sampling of these models. We analyze the asymptotic expected running time complexity of the proposed method when the intensity of the reference PPP increases to infinity while the (expected) sphere radius decreases to zero at varying rates. We further compare the performance of the proposed method analytically and numerically with that of a naive rejection algorithm and of popular dominated CFTP algorithms. Our analysis relies upon identifying large deviations decay rates of the non-overlapping probability of spheres whose centers are distributed as a homogeneous PPP.},

  abstract     = {Oscillatory systems of interacting Hawkes processes with Erlang memory kernels were introduced by Ditlevsen and Löcherbach (; , 2017). They are piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP) and can be approximated by a stochastic diffusion. In this paper, first, a strong error bound between the PDMP and the diffusion is proved. Second, moment bounds for the resulting diffusion are derived. Third, approximation schemes for the diffusion, based on the numerical splitting approach, are proposed. These schemes are proved to converge with mean-square order 1 and to preserve the properties of the diffusion, in particular the hypoellipticity, the ergodicity, and the moment bounds. Finally, the PDMP and the diffusion are compared through numerical experiments, where the PDMP is simulated with an adapted thinning procedure.},

  abstract     = {Queueing networks are stochastic systems formed by interconnected resources routing and serving jobs. They induce jump processes with distinctive properties, and find widespread use in inferential tasks. Here, service rates for jobs and potential bottlenecks in the routing mechanism must be estimated from a reduced set of observations. However, this calls for the derivation of complex conditional density representations, over both the stochastic network trajectories and the rates, which is considered an intractable problem. Numerical simulation procedures designed for this purpose do not scale, because of high computational costs; furthermore, variational approaches relying on approximating measures and full independence assumptions are unsuitable. In this paper, we offer a probabilistic interpretation of variational methods applied to inference tasks with queueing networks, and show that approximating measure choices routinely used with jump processes yield ill-defined optimization problems. Yet we demonstrate that it is still possible to enable a variational inferential task, by considering a novel space expansion treatment over an analogous counting process for job transitions. We present and compare exemplary use cases with practical queueing networks, showing that our framework offers an efficient and improved alternative where existing variational or numerically intensive solutions fail.},

The model is a particular case of the one introduced by Larremore ; (; , 2012) and is mathematically equivalent to an endemic variation of the Reed–Frost epidemic model introduced by Longini (; , 1980). Two types of heuristic approximation are frequently used for models of this type in applications: a branching process for avalanches of a small size at the beginning of the process and a deterministic dynamical system once the avalanche spreads to a significant fraction of a large network. In this paper we prove several results concerning the exact relation between the avalanche model and these limits, including rates of convergence and rigorous bounds for common characteristics of the model.},

In this work, we show that some specific multivariate rough volatility models arise naturally from microstructural properties of the joint dynamics of asset prices. To do so, we use Hawkes processes to build microscopic models that accurately reproduce high-frequency cross-asset interactions and investigate their long-term scaling limits. We emphasize the relevance of our approach by providing insights on the role of microscopic features such as momentum and mean-reversion in the multidimensional price formation process.

Under some mild conditions, the solution is fully and explicitly characterised in terms of scale functions. We find that the solution has an interesting non-trivial structure: if ; is larger than a certain threshold then it is optimal to stop as soon as the difference between the running supremum and the position of the process exceeds a certain level (less than ; ), while if ; is smaller than this threshold then it is optimal to stop immediately (independent of the running supremum and position of the process).

The types of interactions that we consider include pairwise interactions, such as competition, annihilation, and cooperation; and interactions among several individuals that can be viewed as catastrophes. We call such families of processes ; . Our aim is to study their long-term behaviour under a specific regime of the pairwise interaction parameters that we introduce as the ; . Under such a regime, we prove that a process in this class comes down from infinity and has a moment dual which turns out to be a jump-diffusion that can be thought as the evolution of the frequency of a trait or phenotype, and whose parameters have a classical interpretation in terms of population genetics. The moment dual is an important tool for characterizing the stationary distribution of branching processes with interactions whenever such a distribution exists; it is also an interesting object in its own right.},

We show that the optimal stopping boundaries are determined as the maximal solutions of the associated two-dimensional systems of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

The notion of independent and consistent record-keeping in a shared ledger is important for blockchain and more generally for distributed ledger technologies. In this paper we analyze a stochastic model for the shared ledger known as the tangle, which was devised as the basis for the IOTA cryptocurrency. The model is a random directed acyclic graph, and its growth is described by a non-Markovian stochastic process. We first prove ergodicity of the stochastic process, and then derive a delay differential equation for the fluid model which describes the tangle at high arrival rate. We prove convergence in probability of the tangle process to the fluid model, and also prove global stability of the fluid model. The convergence proof relies on martingale techniques.},

In particular, we suppose that the trader wants to act in a way which is independent of any modelling assumptions, but that she observes market information in the form of the prices of vanilla call options on the asset. We also assume that both the payoff of the derivative, and the insider’s information or beliefs, which take the form of a set of impossible paths, are time-invariant. In this way we accommodate drawdown constraints, as well as information/beliefs on quadratic variation or on the levels hit by asset prices. Our setup allows us to adapt recent work of [; ] to prove duality results and a monotonicity principle. This enables us to determine geometric properties of the optimal models. Moreover, for specific types of information, we provide simple conditions for the existence of consistent models for the informed agent. Finally, we provide an example where our framework allows us to compute the impact of the information on the agent’s pricing bounds.},

The first set of results concerns the ergodic properties of the properly scaled joint Markov process with a parameter that is taken to be large. Under very weak hypotheses, we show that if the averaged process is exponentially ergodic for large values of the parameter, then the same applies to the original joint Markov process. The second set of results concerns steady-state diffusion approximations, under the assumption that the ‘averaged’ fluid limit exists. Here, we establish convergence rates for the moments of the approximating diffusion process to those of the Markov-modulated birth–death process. This is accomplished by comparing the generator of the approximating diffusion and that of the joint Markov process. We also provide several examples which demonstrate how the theory can be applied.},
