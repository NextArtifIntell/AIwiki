  abstract     = {The success of deep learning has revealed the application potential of neural networks across the sciences and opened up fundamental theoretical problems. In particular, the fact that learning algorithms based on simple variants of gradient methods are able to find near-optimal minima of highly nonconvex loss functions is an unexpected feature of neural networks. Moreover, such algorithms are able to fit the data even in the presence of noise, and yet they have excellent predictive capabilities. Several empirical results have shown a reproducible correlation between the so-called flatness of the minima achieved by the algorithms and the generalization performance. At the same time, statistical physics results have shown that in nonconvex networks a multitude of narrow minima may coexist with a much smaller number of wide flat minima, which generalize well. Here, we show that wide flat minima arise as complex extensive structures, from the coalescence of minima around “high-margin” (i.e., locally robust) configurations. Despite being exponentially rare compared to zero-margin ones, high-margin minima tend to concentrate in particular regions. These minima are in turn surrounded by other solutions of smaller and smaller margin, leading to dense regions of solutions over long distances. Our analysis also provides an alternative analytical method for estimating when flat minima appear and when algorithms begin to find solutions, as the number of model parameters varies.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of flow profiles of slowly sheared granular materials is a major geophysical and industrial challenge. Understanding the role of gravity is particularly important for future planetary exploration in varying gravitational environments. Using the principle of minimization of energy dissipation, and combining experiments and variational analysis, we disentangle the contributions of the gravitational acceleration, confining pressure, and layer thickness on shear strain localization induced by moving fault boundaries at the bottom of a granular layer. The flow profile is independent of the gravity for geometries with a free top surface. However, under a confining pressure or if the sheared layer withstands the weight of the upper layers, increasing gravity promotes the transition from closed shear zones buried in the bulk to open ones that intersect the top surface. We show that the center position and width of the shear zone and the axial angular velocity at the top surface follow universal scaling laws when properly scaled by the gravity, applied pressure, and layer thickness. Our finding that the flow profiles lie on a universal master curve opens the possibility to predict the quasistatic shear flow of granular materials in varying gravitational environments.},

  abstract     = {Dense active matter is gaining widespread interest due to its remarkable similarity with conventional glass-forming materials. However, active matter is inherently out of equilibrium and even simple models such as active Brownian particles (ABPs) and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) behave markedly differently from their passive counterparts. Controversially, this difference has been shown to manifest itself via either a speedup, slowdown, or nonmonotonic change of the glassy relaxation dynamics. Here we rationalize these seemingly contrasting views on the departure from equilibrium by identifying the ratio of the short-time length scale to the cage length, i.e., the length scale of local particle caging, as a vital and unifying control parameter for active glassy matter. In particular, we explore the glassy dynamics of both thermal and athermal ABPs and AOUPs upon increasing the persistence time. We find that for all studied systems there is an optimum of the dynamics; this optimum occurs when the cage length coincides with the corresponding short-time length scale of the system, which is either the persistence length for athermal systems or a combination of the persistence length and a diffusive length scale for thermal systems. This new insight, for which we also provide a simple physical argument, allows us to reconcile and explain the manifestly disparate departures from equilibrium reported in many previous studies of dense active materials.},

Within this model, we show that the additive size alone controls the functional form of the T dependence.

The spectral point of view developed in this work allows for a very parsimonious description of all the aspects of the finite-size coil-globule transition on the basis of the first two Rouse (cosine) modes only, shedding new light on polymer theory and reintroducing well-established spectral methods that have been surprisingly neglected in this field so far. Capturing the relevant configuration path features, the proposed approach enables one to determine the state of a polymer without the need of any information about the polymer length or interaction strength. Importantly, we propose an experimental implementation of our analysis that can be easily performed with modern fluorescent imaging techniques and would allow differentiation of coil or globule conformations by simply recording the positions of at least three discernible loci on the polymer.},

  abstract     = {Reentrance, the return of a system from an ordered phase to a previously encountered less-ordered one as a controlled parameter is continuously varied, is a recurring theme found in disparate physical systems, yet its microscopic cause is often not investigated thoroughly. Here, through detailed characterization and theoretical modeling, we uncover the microscopic mechanism behind reentrance in the strongly frustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnet Er 2 Sn 2 O 7 . We use single crystal heat capacity measurements to expose that Er 2 Sn 2 O 7 exhibits multiple instances of reentrance in its magnetic field B vs temperature T phase diagram for magnetic fields along three cubic high symmetry directions. Through classical Monte Carlo simulations, mean field theory, and classical linear spin-wave expansions, we argue that the origins of the multiple occurrences of reentrance observed in Er 2 Sn 2 O 7 are linked to soft modes. These soft modes arise from phase competition and enhance thermal fluctuations that entropically stabilize a specific ordered phase, resulting in an increased transition temperature for certain field values and thus the reentrant behavior. Our work represents a detailed examination into the mechanisms responsible for reentrance in a frustrated magnet and may serve as a template for the interpretation of reentrant phenomena in other physical systems.},

Of particular interest are magnetic Weyl semimetals originally proposed in the pyrochlore iridates, which are only expected to reveal their topological nature in thin film form. To date, however, direct experimental demonstrations of these exotic phases remain elusive, due to the lack of usable single crystals and the insufficient quality of available films. Here, we report on the discovery of signatures for the long-sought magnetic Weyl semimetallic phase in (111)-oriented Eu 2 Ir 2 O 7 high-quality epitaxial thin films. We observed an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect with colossal coercivity but vanishing net magnetization, which emerges right below the onset of a peculiar magnetic phase with all-in-all-out (AIAO) antiferromagnetic ordering. The anomalous Hall conductivity obtained experimentally is consistent with the theoretical prediction, likely arising from the nonzero Berry curvature emanated by Weyl node pairs near the Fermi level that act as sources and sinks of Berry flux, activated by broken cubic crystal symmetry at the top and bottom terminations of the thin film.},

We show that this intrinsic second-order anomalous Hall effect is associated with an intrinsic band geometric property—the dipole moment of Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) in momentum space. The effect has scaling relation and symmetry constraints that are distinct from the previously studied extrinsic contributions. Particularly, in antiferromagnets with PT symmetry, the intrinsic effect dominates. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the first quantitative evaluation of the effect in the antiferromagnet Mn 2 Au . We show that the BCP dipole and the resulting intrinsic second-order conductivity are pronounced around band near degeneracies. Importantly, the intrinsic response exhibits sensitive dependence on the Néel vector orientation with a 2 π periodicity, which offers a new route for electric detection of the magnetic order in PT -invariant antiferromagnets.},

In contrast, the Berry-curvature-dipole-induced nonlinear Hall effect depends linearly on relaxation time and is time-reversal even. We study the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect in an antiferromagnetic metal: tetragonal CuMnAs, and show that its nonlinear Hall conductivity can reach the order of mA / V 2 . The dependence on the chemical potential of such nonlinear Hall conductivity can be qualitatively explained by a tilted massive Dirac model.

The temperature dependence of the real part of the phonon self-energy shows a distinct kink at T = T B 1 g above T c due to softening, in addition to the one due to the onset of the superconductivity. T B 1 g is clearly different from the pseudogap temperature with a maximum in the underdoped region and resembles charge density wave onset temperature, T CDW . We attribute the B 1 g -phonon softening to an energy gap on the Fermi surface induced by a charge density wave order, which is consistent with the results of a recent electronic Raman scattering study. Our work demonstrates a way to investigate Fermi surface instabilities above T c via phonon Raman studies.},

Motivated by the desire to efficiently simulate many-body quantum systems with exact local gauge invariance, gauge equivariant neural-network quantum states are introduced, which exactly satisfy the local Hilbert space constraints necessary for the description of quantum lattice gauge theory with Z d gauge group and non-Abelian Kitaev D ( G ) models on different geometries. Focusing on the special case of Z 2 gauge group on a periodically identified square lattice, the equivariant architecture is analytically shown to contain the loop-gas solution as a special case. Gauge equivariant neural-network quantum states are used in combination with variational quantum Monte Carlo to obtain compact descriptions of the ground state wave function for the Z 2 theory away from the exactly solvable limit, and to demonstrate the confining or deconfining phase transition of the Wilson loop order parameter.},

However, despite the enormous potential for future applications in the field of optoelectronics, the underlying microscopic mechanism remains controversial. Here we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with microscopic many-particle theory to reveal the relevant microscopic charge transfer channels in epitaxial WS 2 / graphene heterostructures. We find that the timescale for efficient ultrafast charge separation in the material is determined by direct tunneling at those points in the Brillouin zone where WS 2 and graphene bands cross, while the lifetime of the charge separated transient state is set by defect-assisted tunneling through localized sulphur vacancies. The subtle interplay of intrinsic and defect-related charge transfer channels revealed in the present work can be exploited for the design of highly efficient light harvesting and detecting devices.},

La 2 − x Sr x NiO 4 + δ (LSNO) has attracted much attention due to its interesting spin dynamics. Recent x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy studies have revealed slow dynamics of the spin order (SO) stripes in LSNO. Here, we applied resonant soft x-ray ptychography to map the spatial distribution of the SO stripe domain inhomogeneity in real space. The reconstructed images show the SO domains are spatially anisotropic, in agreement with previous diffraction studies. For the SO stripe domains, it is found that the correlation lengths along different directions are strongly coupled in space. Surprisingly, fluctuations were observed in the real space amplitude signal, rather than the phase or position. We attribute the observed slow dynamics of the stripe domains in LSNO to thermal fluctuations of the SO domain boundaries.},

In the time domain, the chaotic photon transport to the leaky region can be suppressed, and the cavity resonant modes show stronger temporal confinement with quality factors being improved by more than 1 order of magnitude. In the spatial domain, the emission direction of the cavity field is controlled on demand through rerouting chaotic photons to a desired channel, which is verified experimentally by the far-field pattern of a quantum-dot microlaser.

We show that the produced spatial-resolved harmonic spectra reveal unique structures, such as the spatially spectral tilt and the fine interference patterns. We show these spatiospectral structures originate from both the macroscopic and microscopic effect of spatiotemporal optical singularity in HHG. Employing two-color counterspin and countervorticity STOV pulses, we further discuss a robust method to control the spatiotemporal topological charge and spectral structure of high-order harmonics. The conservation rule of photon transverse orbital angular momentum in HHG process is also discussed when mixing with photon spin angular momenta.},

Mechanically induced coherent perfect absorption and anti-lasing occur simultaneously under a critical optomechanical coupling strength. Meanwhile, the phase around the cavity resonance undergoes an abrupt π -phase transition, which further flips the phase slope in the frequency dependence. The observed infinite discontinuity in the phase slope defines a singularity, at which the group velocity is dramatically changed. Around the singularity, an abrupt transition from an infinite group advance to delay is demonstrated by measuring a Gaussian-shaped waveform propagating. Our experiment may broaden the scope of realizing extremely long group delays by taking advantage of singularities.},

  abstract     = {The ground state to ground state electron-capture Q value of Dy 159 ( 3 / 2 − ) has been measured directly using the double Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP. A value of 364.73(19) keV was obtained from a measurement of the cyclotron frequency ratio of the decay parent Dy 159 and the decay daughter Tb 159 ions using the novel phase-imaging ion-cyclotron resonance technique. The Q values for allowed Gamow-Teller transition to 5 / 2 − and the third-forbidden unique transition to 11 / 2 + state with excitation energies of 363.5449(14) keV and 362.050(40) keV in Tb 159 were determined to be 1.18(19) keV and 2.68(19) keV, respectively. The high-precision Q value of transition 3 / 2 − → 5 / 2 − from this work, revealing itself as the lowest electron-capture Q value, is used to unambiguously characterize all the possible lines that are present in its electron-capture spectrum. We performed atomic many-body calculations for both transitions to determine electron-capture probabilities from various atomic orbitals and found an order of magnitude enhancement in the event rates near the end point of energy spectrum in the transition to the 5 / 2 − nuclear excited state, which can become very interesting once the experimental challenges of identifying decays into excited states are overcome. The transition to the 11 / 2 + state is strongly suppressed and found unsuitable for measuring the neutrino mass. These results show that the electron-capture in the Dy 159 atom, going to the 5 / 2 − state of the Tb 159 nucleus, is a new candidate that may open the way to determine the electron-neutrino mass in the sub-eV region by studying electron-capture. Further experimental feasibility studies, including coincidence measurements with realistic detectors, will be of great interest.},

The Ξ c 0 baryon was reconstructed via both the semileptonic decay ( Ξ − e + ν e ) and the hadronic decay ( Ξ − π + ) channels. The Ξ c + baryon was reconstructed via the hadronic decay ( Ξ − π + π + ) channel. The branching-fraction ratio BR ( Ξ c 0 → Ξ − e + ν e ) / BR ( Ξ c 0 → Ξ − π + ) = 1.38 ± 0.14 ( stat ) ± 0.22 ( syst ) was measured with a total uncertainty reduced by a factor of about 3 with respect to the current world average reported by the Particle Data Group. The transverse momentum ( p T ) dependence of the Ξ c 0 - and Ξ c + -baryon production relative to the D 0 meson and to the Σ c 0 , + , + + - and Λ c + -baryon production are reported. The baryon-to-meson ratio increases toward low p T up to a value of approximately 0.3. The measurements are compared with various models that take different hadronization mechanisms into consideration. The results provide stringent constraints to these theoretical calculations and additional evidence that different processes are involved in charm hadronization in electron-positron ( e + e − ) and hadronic collisions.},

The nesting property is used to show the rate of complexity is bounded below by “conditional complexity,” describing a multistep optimization with intermediate and final target states. Conceptually, discretized Lorentzian flows are interpreted in terms of threads or gatelines such that complexity is equal to the minimum number of gatelines used to prepare a conformal field theory (CFT) state by an optimal tensor network (TN) discretizing the state. We propose a refined measure of complexity, capturing the role of suboptimal TNs, as an ensemble average. The bulk symplectic potential provides a “canonical” thread configuration characterizing perturbations around arbitrary CFT states. Its consistency requires the bulk to obey linearized Einstein’s equations, which are shown to be equivalent to the holographic first law of complexity, thereby advocating a notion of “spacetime complexity.”},

We also present, as a new tool in this context, constrained realization maps of the SGWBs extracted from the high-resolution CMB Planck maps.

Both detection schemes are robust against symmetry-preserving disorders, and yield consistent results with theoretical predictions. Our experiments are performed far away from any boundaries, and therefore underline non-Bloch topological invariants as intrinsic properties of the system that persist in the thermodynamic limit.

One characteristic example is the anomalous Floquet insulator, which exhibits topologically quantized chiral edge states similar to a Chern insulator, yet is amenable to bulk localization. We study the response of this topological system to time-dependent noise, which breaks the topologically protecting Floquet symmetry. Surprisingly, we find that the quantized response, given by partially filling the fermionic system and measuring charge pumped per cycle, remains quantized up to finite noise amplitude. We trace this robust topology to an interplay between diffusion and Pauli blocking of edge state decay, which we expect should be robust against interactions. We determine the boundaries of the topological phase for a system with spatial disorder numerically through level statistics, and corroborate our results in the limit of vanishing disorder through an analytical Floquet superoperator approach. This approach suggests an interpretation of the state of the system as a non-Hermitian Floquet topological phase. We comment on quantization of other topological responses in the absence of Floquet symmetry and potential experimental realizations.},

In addition, engineering of the conditioning protocol yields a reliable way to extract higher-order moments of the quantum noise distribution and robust discrimination of the input quantum states, for instance, a vacuum and a few-photon cat state.

Because the time evolution of an open quantum system employs a nonunitary operator, the simulation of open quantum systems presents a challenge for universal quantum computers constructed from only unitary operators or gates. Here, we present a general algorithm for implementing the action of any nonunitary operator on an arbitrary state on a quantum device. We show that any quantum operator can be exactly decomposed as a linear combination of at most four unitary operators. We demonstrate this method on a two-level system in both zero and finite temperature amplitude damping channels. The results are in agreement with classical calculations, showing promise in simulating nonunitary operations on intermediate-term and future quantum devices.},

The method is experimentally validated on a simulation of the Heisenberg model.

  abstract     = {A central question in resource theory is whether one can construct a set of monotones that completely characterize the allowed transitions dictated by a set of free operations. A similar question is whether two distinct sets of free operations generate the same class of transitions. These questions are part of the more general problem of whether it is possible to pass from one characterization of a resource theory to another. In the present Letter, we prove that in the context of quantum resource theories this class of problem is undecidable in general. This is done by proving the undecidability of the membership problem for completely positive trace preserving maps, which subsumes all the other results.},

  abstract     = {We report on the quantum electrodynamical analog of a Sagnac phase induced by the fast rotation of a neutral nanoparticle onto atomic waves propagating in its vicinity. The quantum vacuum Sagnac phase is a geometric Berry phase proportional to the angular velocity of rotation. The persistence of a noninertial effect into the inertial frame is also analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Here, a rotation confined to a restricted domain of space gives rise to an atomic phase even though the interferometer is at rest with respect to an inertial frame. By taking advantage of a plasmon resonance, we show that the magnitude of the induced phase can be close to the sensitivity limit of state of the art interferometers. The quantum vacuum Sagnac atomic phase is a geometric footprint of a dynamical Casimir-like effect.},

  abstract     = {Behavior of the bacterial flagellar motor depends sensitively on the external loads it drives. Motor switching, which provides the basis for the run-and-tumble behavior of flagellated bacteria, has been studied for motors under zero to high loads, revealing a nonequilibrium effect that is proportional to the motor torque. However, behavior of the motor switching at stall (with maximum torque) remains unclear. An extrapolation from previous studies would suggest the maximum nonequilibrium effect for motor switching at stall. Here, we stalled the motor using optical tweezers and studied the motor switching with a high time resolution of about 2 ms. Surprisingly, our results showed exponentially distributed counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) intervals, indicating that motor switching at stall is probably an equilibrium process. Combined with previous experiments at other loads, our result suggested that the nonequilibrium effect in motor switching arises from the asymmetry of the torque generation in the CCW and CW directions. By including this nonequilibrium effect in the general Ising-type conformation spread model of the flagellar switch, we consistently explained the motor switching over the whole range of load conditions. We expect to see a similar mechanism of nonequilibrium regulation in other molecular machines.},

  abstract     = {Suspensions of active agents with nematic interactions exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics such as mesoscale turbulence. Since the Reynolds number of microscopic flows is very small on the scale of individual agents, inertial effects are typically excluded in continuum theories of active nematic turbulence. Whether active stresses can collectively excite inertial flows is currently unclear. To address this question, we investigate a two-dimensional continuum theory for active nematic turbulence. In particular, we compare mesoscale turbulence with and without the effects of advective inertia. We find that inertial effects can influence the flow already close to the onset of the turbulent state and, moreover, give rise to large-scale fluid motion for strong active driving. A detailed analysis of the kinetic energy budget reveals an energy transfer to large scales mediated by inertial advection. While this transfer is small in comparison to energy injection and dissipation, its effects accumulate over time. The inclusion of friction, which is typically present in experiments, can compensate for this effect. The findings suggest that the inclusion of inertia and friction may be necessary for dynamically consistent theories of active nematic turbulence.},

The interplay of boundary inelasticity and geometry, either order promoting or inhibiting, controls whether it is the granular crystal or the granular fluid which makes contact with the edge.

Then we introduce an orthonormalization scheme for the modes and establish a canonical quasinormal mode framework for general nonlocal media. Explicit formalisms for metals described by a quantum hydrodynamic model and polar dielectrics with nonlocal response are exemplified. The framework enables for the first time a direct modal analysis of mode transition in the quantum tunneling regime and provides physical insights beyond usual far-field spectroscopic analysis. Applied to nonlocal polar dielectrics, the framework also unveils the important roles of longitudinal phonon polaritons in optical response.},

We explored this possibility in Y 2 Ir 2 O 7 using Raman spectroscopy to measure both the single-magnon excitations and anomalous phonon shifts.

These confirm that Y 2 Ir 2 O 7 hosts a nontrivial magnon band topology distinct from other pyrochlore iridate compounds.

No consensus has been reached in theory regarding the true ground state of this promising platform. The experimental efforts, relying mostly on one archetypal material ZnCu 3 ( OH ) 6 Cl 2 , have also led to diverse possibilities. Apart from subtle interactions in the Hamiltonian, there is the additional degree of complexity associated with disorder in the real material ZnCu 3 ( OH ) 6 Cl 2 that haunts most experimental probes. Here we resort to heat transport measurement, a cleaner probe in which instead of contributing directly, the disorder only impacts the signal from the kagome spins. For ZnCu 3 ( OH ) 6 Cl 2 , we observed no contribution by any spin excitation nor obvious field-induced change to the thermal conductivity. These results impose strong constraints on various scenarios about the ground state of this kagome compound: while certain quantum paramagnetic states other than a QSL may serve as natural candidates, a QSL state, gapless or gapped, must be dramatically modified by the disorder so that the kagome spin excitations are localized.},

  abstract     = {Unconventional superconductors are of high interest due to their rich physics, a topical example being topological edge states associated with p -wave superconductivity. A practical obstacle in studying such systems is the very low critical temperature T c that is required to realize a p -wave superconducting phase in a material. We predict that the T c of an intrinsic p -wave superconductor can be significantly enhanced by coupling to a conventional s -wave or d -wave superconductor with a higher critical temperature via an atomically thin ferromagnetic ( F ) layer. We show that this T c boost is tunable via the direction of the magnetization in F . Moreover, we show that the enhancement in T c can also be achieved using the Zeeman effect of an external magnetic field. Our findings provide a way to increase T c in p -wave superconductors in a controllable way and make the exotic physics associated with such materials more easily accessible experimentally.},

We analyze local attraction in noncovalently bonded Xe − Cs + aggregates and monolayers on Cu(111) as well as repulsion upon electron transfer. Using two-photon photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and coupled cluster calculations combined with an image-charge model, we explain the intricate impact Xe has on Cs + / Cu ( 111 ) . We find that attraction between Cs + and Xe counterbalances the screened Coulomb repulsion between Cs + ions on Cu(111). Furthermore, we observe that the Cs 6 s electron is repelled from Cu(111) due to xenon’s electron density. Together, this yields a dual, i.e., attractive or repulsive, response of Xe depending on the positive or negative charge of the respective counterparticle, which emphasizes the importance of the Coulomb interaction in these systems.},

Yet, in most cases studied to date, the interlayer interaction is considered to be a “static” property of the vdWs structures. Here we demonstrate that applying a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip pulse on twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can induce sub-Ångstrom fluctuations of the interlayer separation in the TBG, which are equivalent to dynamic vertical external pressure of about 10 GPa on the TBG. The sub-Ångstrom fluctuations of the interlayer separation result in large oscillations of the energy separations between two van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the TBG. The period of the oscillations of the VHSs spacing is extremely long, about 500–1000 sec, attributing to tip-induced local stress in the atomic-thick TBG. Our result provides an efficient method to tune and measure the physical properties of the vdWs structures dynamically.},

In this Letter, we focus on the effects of fluctuations of the order parameters describing correlated insulating states at integer fillings of the low-energy flat bands on charge transport. Motivated by the observation of heterogeneity in the order-parameter landscape at zero magnetic field in certain samples, we conjecture the existence of frustrating extended-range interactions in an effective Ising model of the order parameters on a triangular lattice. The competition between short-distance ferromagnetic interactions and frustrating extended-range antiferromagnetic interactions leads to an emergent length scale that forms stripy mesoscale domains above the ordering transition. The gapless fluctuations of these heterogeneous configurations are found to be responsible for the linear-in-temperature resistivity as well as the enhanced low-temperature entropy. Our insights link experimentally observed linear-in-temperature resistivity and enhanced entropy to the strength of frustration or, equivalently, to the emergence of mesoscopic length scales characterizing order-parameter domains.},

The Coulomb interaction projected onto narrow bands causes the charged excitations at an integer filling to disperse, forming new bands. If the excitation moves the filling away from the charge neutrality point, then it has a band minimum at the moiré Brillouin zone center with a small mass that compares well with the experiment; if towards the charge neutrality point, then it has a much larger mass and a higher degeneracy. At a nonzero density away from an integer filling the excitations interact. The system on the small mass side has a large bandwidth and forms a Fermi liquid. On the large mass side the bandwidth is narrow, the compressibility is negative and the Fermi liquid is likely unstable. This explains the observed sawtooth features in compressibility, the Landau fans pointing away from charge neutrality and their degeneracies. The framework sets the stage for superconductivity at lower temperatures.},

Here, we demonstrate the origin, evolution, and application of topological phase singularity pairs (TPSPs) resulting from BICs in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian systems. The nonreciprocity contributes to creating accidental BICs asymmetrically, each of which can split into TPSP with topological charges ± 1 in reflection phases by inserting loss. The formation, annihilation, and revival processes of these TPSPs can be selectively controlled via either material or radiative loss. The criteria to predict both number and angular positions of asymmetric BICs are established. Near-complete violation of Kirchhoff’s law of thermal radiation has been correspondingly manifested over a wide angular range. The unveiled physics synergizing nonreciprocity and topology will bring new opportunities in multidisciplinary areas like thermal science, magneto-optics, or topological metasurfaces.},

This is demonstrated by the means of two-dimensional particle in cell simulations, supported by a linear model. In particular, we show that, although they would be the same in a plane wave model, the exchange rates of energy may be significantly different whether there is a plasma flow, or a wavelength shift, especially when the waves are weakly damped. When the crossed laser beams have different frequencies, the energy exchange rate is substantially reduced compared with the predictions of the plane wave model, widely used in the hydrodynamic codes that model and interpret ICF experiments. Such effects can partly explain the disagreement of the CBET predictions compared with experimental results.},

To show the potential of this method, we apply it to observe the secular motion of the trapped ion; we demonstrate a temporal resolution up to 50 ns with a displacement detection sensitivity of 10 nm.

In turn, Rydberg interactions enable single photons to alter the optical response of the array within a potentially large blockade radius R b , which can effectively punch a large “hole” for subsequent photons. We show that such a system enables a coherent photon-photon gate or switch, with a significantly better error scaling ( ∼ R b − 4 ) than in a disordered ensemble. We also investigate the optical properties of the system in the limit of strong input intensities and show that this many-body quantum driven dissipative system can be modeled well by a semiclassical model based on holes punched in a classical mirror.},

An accurate description of the tunnel-ionized electron wave packet is central to understanding and controlling subsequent electron dynamics. Because of the anisotropic molecular structure, tunneling ionization of molecules involves considerable challenges in accurately describing the tunneling electron wave packet. Up to now, some basic properties of the tunneling electron from molecules still remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tunneling electron from a molecule is not always emitted from the geometric center of the molecule along the tunnel direction. Rather, the photoemission position depends on the molecular orientation. Using a photoelectron holographic technique, we determine the photoemission position for a nitrogen molecule relative to the molecular geometric center to be 95 ± 21 pm when the molecular axis is oriented along the tunnel direction. Our Letter poses, and answers experimentally, a fundamental question as to where the molecular photoionization actually begins, which has significant implications for time-resolved probing of valence electron dynamics in molecules.},

  abstract     = {Recent theoretical studies predict that structural disorder, serving as a bridge connecting a crystalline material to an amorphous material, can induce a topological insulator from a trivial phase. However, to experimentally observe such a topological phase transition is very challenging due to the difficulty in controlling structural disorder in a quantum material. Given experimental realization of randomly positioned Rydberg atoms, such a system is naturally suited to studying structural disorder induced topological phase transitions and topological amorphous phases. Motivated by the development, we study topological phases in an experimentally accessible one-dimensional amorphous Rydberg atom chain with random atom configurations. In the single-particle level, we find symmetry-protected topological amorphous insulators and a structural disorder induced topological phase transition, indicating that Rydberg atoms provide an ideal platform to experimentally observe the phenomenon using state-of-the-art technologies. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a gapless symmetry-protected topological phase of interacting bosons in the experimentally accessible system. The resultant many-body topological amorphous phase is characterized by a Z 2 invariant.},

The observed momentum correlations between the five particles are consistent with two sequential steps of prompt 2 p decay passing through the ground state of Ne 16 . The invariant-mass spectrum also provides evidence for an excited state at an excitation energy of 1.84(14) MeV, which is likely the first excited 2 + state. As this energy exceeds that for the 2 + state in Mg 20 , this observation provides an argument for the demise of the N = 8 shell closure in nuclei far from stability.

The dependence on collision centrality and kinematic acceptance in ( p T , y ) are analyzed. While for 27 and 54.4 GeV collisions the C 6 / C 2 values are close to zero within uncertainties, it is observed that for 200 GeV collisions, the C 6 / C 2 ratio becomes progressively negative from peripheral to central collisions. Transport model calculations without critical dynamics predict mostly positive values except for the most central collisions within uncertainties.

  abstract     = {The quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a fundamental quantity of interest in many areas from quantum metrology to quantum information theory. It can in particular be used as a witness to establish the degree of multiparticle entanglement in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we use polynomials of the density matrix to construct monotonically increasing lower bounds that converge to the QFI. Using randomized measurements we propose a protocol to accurately estimate these lower bounds in state-of-the-art quantum technological platforms. We estimate the number of measurements needed to achieve a given accuracy and confidence level in the bounds, and present two examples of applications of the method in quantum systems made of coupled qubits and collective spins.},

  abstract     = {I show that nondecreasing entropy provides a necessary and sufficient condition to convert the state of a physical system into a different state by a reversible transformation that acts on the system of interest and a further “catalyst,” whose state has to remain invariant exactly in the transition. This statement is proven both in the case of finite-dimensional quantum mechanics, where von Neumann entropy is the relevant entropy, and in the case of systems whose states are described by probability distributions on finite sample spaces, where Shannon entropy is the relevant entropy. The results give an affirmative resolution to the (approximate) catalytic entropy conjecture introduced by Boes et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 , 210402 (2019) ]. They provide a complete single-shot characterization without external randomness of von Neumann entropy and Shannon entropy. I also compare the results to the setting of phenomenological thermodynamics and show how they can be used to obtain a quantitative single-shot characterization of Gibbs states in quantum statistical mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying and verifying the control level in preparing a quantum state are central challenges in building quantum devices. The quantum state is characterized from experimental measurements, using a procedure known as tomography, which requires a vast number of resources. However, tomography for a quantum device with temporal processing, which is fundamentally different from standard tomography, has not been formulated. We develop a practical and approximate tomography method using a recurrent machine learning framework for this intriguing situation. The method is based on repeated quantum interactions between a system called quantum reservoir with a stream of quantum states. Measurement data from the reservoir are connected to a linear readout to train a recurrent relation between quantum channels applied to the input stream. We demonstrate our algorithms for representative quantum learning tasks, followed by the proposal of a quantum memory capacity to evaluate the temporal processing ability of near-term quantum devices.},

Namely, we will show that the presence of higher-order interactions may induce the appearance of a coherent state even when the oscillators are coupled negatively to the mean field. An exact solution for the description of the microscopic dynamics for forward and backward transitions is provided, which entails imperfect symmetry breaking of the population into a frequency-locked state featuring two clusters of different instantaneous phases. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the powerful potential of group interactions entailing multidimensional choices and novel dynamical states in many circumstances, such as in social systems.},

Efficient infrared light-emitting devices, however, have been challenging because band gap emission from semiconductors becomes inefficient in the mid-infrared to far-infrared spectral range. Here we investigate infrared light-emitting devices (IRLEDs) based on Luttinger liquid (LL) plasmons in one-dimensional (1D) metallic carbon nanotubes. Elementary excitations in LL are characterized by collective charge and spin excitations, i.e., plasmons and spinons. Consequently, electrons injected into the nanotubes transform efficiently into LL plasmons, a hybrid excitation of electromagnetic fields and electrons. We design nanoantennas coupled to the carbon nanotube to radiate LL plasmons into the far field. LL-based IRLEDs can be designed to selectively emit at wavelengths across the far- and mid-infrared spectra. An electrical-to-optical power conversion efficiency up to 3.2\% may be achieved. Such efficient and narrowband LL-based IRLEDs can enable novel infrared nanophotonic applications.},

The graphene carrier density is tuned across the charge neutrality point (CNP) by a gate, while the SWNT remains degenerate. At high temperatures, the drag resistance changes sign across the CNP, as expected for momentum transfer from drive to drag layer, and exhibits layer exchange Onsager reciprocity. We find that layer reciprocity is broken near the graphene CNP at low temperatures due to nonlinear drag response associated with temperature dependent drag and thermoelectric effects. The drag resistance shows power-law dependences on temperature and carrier density characteristic of 1D Fermi liquid-2D Dirac fluid drag. The 2D drag signal at high temperatures decays with distance from the 1D source slower than expected for a diffusive current distribution, suggesting additional interaction effects in the graphene in the hydrodynamic transport regime.},

For each transient phase we identify the critical fluence at which it is observed and the specific optical and Raman fingerprints to directly compare with future ultrafast pump-probe experiments.

A fascinating aspect of the FFLO state is the emergence of periodic nodal planes in real space, but its observation is still lacking. Here we investigate the superconducting order parameter at high magnetic fields H applied perpendicular to the a b plane in a high-purity single crystal of FeSe. The heat capacity and magnetic torque provide thermodynamic evidence for a distinct superconducting phase at the low-temperature/high-field corner of the phase diagram. Despite the bulk superconductivity, spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy performed on the same crystal demonstrates that the order parameter vanishes at the surface upon entering the high-field phase. These results provide the first demonstration of a pinned planar node perpendicular to H , which is consistent with a putative FFLO state.},

  abstract     = {Skin effect, where macroscopically many bulk states are aggregated toward the system boundary, is one of the most important and distinguishing phenomena in non-Hermitian quantum systems. We discuss a new aspect of this effect whereby, despite its topological origin, applying a magnetic field can largely suppress it. Skin states are pushed back into the bulk, and the skin topological area, which we define, is sharply reduced. As seen from exact solutions of representative models, this is fundamentally rooted in the fact that the applied magnetic field restores the validity of the low-energy description that is rendered inapplicable in the presence of non-Bloch skin states. We further study this phenomenon using rational gauge fluxes, which reveals a unique irrelevance of the generalized Brillouin zone in the standard non-Bloch band theory of non-Hermitian systems.},

  abstract     = {We performed in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES (SARPES) experiments to investigate the relationship between electronic band structures and ferromagnetism in SrRuO 3 (SRO) thin films. Our high quality ARPES and SARPES results show clear spin-lifted band structures. The spin polarization is strongly dependent on momentum around the Fermi level, whereas it becomes less dependent at high-binding energies. This experimental observation matches our dynamical mean-field theory results very well. As temperature increases from low to the Curie temperature, spin-splitting gap decreases and band dispersions become incoherent. Based on the ARPES study and theoretical calculation results, we found that SRO possesses spin-dependent electron correlations in which majority and minority spins are localized and itinerant, respectively. Our finding explains how ferromagnetism and electronic structure are connected, which has been under debate for decades in SRO.},

Molecular dynamics simulation of water at 298 K validates the probability density function for the intramolecular H 1 ─ H 1 dynamics.

The one-way feature of boundary states against disorders and impurities prospects great potential in applications of electronic and classical wave devices. Particularly, for the 3D higher-order topological insulators, it can host hinge states, which allow the energy to transport along the hinge channels. However, the hinge states have only been observed along a single hinge, and a natural question arises: whether the hinge states can exist simultaneously on all the three independent directions of one sample? Here we theoretically predict, numerically simulate, and experimentally observe the hinge states on three different directions of a higher-order topological phononic crystal, and demonstrate their robust one-way transport from hinge to hinge. Therefore, 3D topological hinge transport is successfully achieved. The novel sound transport may serve as the basis for acoustic devices of unconventional functions.},

We consider a vortex “scattering experiment” whereby a single vortex in a superfluid flow interacts with a circular, uniform pinning potential. By an analogy with linear dielectrics, we develop an analytical hydrodynamic approximation that predicts vortex trajectories, the vortex fixed point and the unpinning velocity. We then solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to validate this model, and build a phase portrait of vortex pinning. We identify two different dynamical pinning mechanisms marked by distinctive phonon emission signatures: one enabled by acoustic radiation and another mediated by vortex dipoles nucleated within the pin. Relative to obstacle size, we find that pinning potentials on the order of the healing length are more effective for vortex capture. Our results could be useful in mitigating the negative effects of drag due to vortices in superfluid channels, in analogy to maximizing supercurrents in type-II superconductors.},

It is yet unclear what physical processes can produce such an efficient acceleration, despite the copious radiative losses. By means of radiative particle-in-cell simulations, we show that magnetically dominated turbulence in pair plasmas subject to strong synchrotron cooling generates a nonthermal particle spectrum with a hard power-law range (slope p ∼ 1 ) within a few eddy turnover times. Low pitch-angle particles can significantly exceed the nominal radiation-reaction limit, before abruptly cooling down. The particle spectrum becomes even harder ( p &lt; 1 ) over time owing to particle cooling with an energy-dependent pitch-angle anisotropy. The resulting synchrotron spectrum is hard ( ν F ν ∝ ν s with s ∼ 1 ). Our findings have important implications for understanding the nonthermal emission from high-energy astrophysical sources, most notably the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts and gamma-ray flares from the Crab nebula.},

Here, we propose an on-chip photonic system in which an arbitrary number of exceptional points can be encircled dynamically. We reveal in experiment a robust state-switching rule for multistate systems, and extend it to an infinite-period system in which an exceptional line is encircled with outcomes being located at the Brillouin-zone boundary.

It operates on forward- and backward-propagating modes in the same way, regardless of direction. The concept of nonreciprocal quantum photonic operations, by contrast, could be used to transform quantum states in a momentum- and direction-selective fashion. Here we demonstrate the basis for such a nonreciprocal transformation in the frequency domain through intermodal Bragg scattering four-wave mixing (BSFWM). Since the total number of idler and signal photons is conserved, the process can preserve coherence of quantum optical states, functioning as a nonreciprocal frequency beam splitter. We explore the origin of this nonreciprocity and find that the phase-matching requirements of intermodal BSFWM produce an enormous asymmetry ( 76 × ) in the conversion bandwidths for forward and backward configurations, yielding ∼ 25 dB of nonreciprocal contrast over several hundred GHz. We also outline how the demonstrated efficiencies ( ∼ 10 − 4 ) may be scaled to near-unity values with readily accessible powers and pumping configurations for applications in integrated quantum photonics.},

Thus, they are not applicable whenever such interaction is not possible, for example, in astronomy or noninvasive biological imaging. Far field, linear optical superresolution techniques based on passive analysis of light coming from the object would cover these gaps. In this Letter, we present the first proof-of-principle demonstration of such a technique for 2D imaging. It works by accessing information about spatial correlations of the image optical field and, hence, about the object itself via measuring projections onto Hermite-Gaussian transverse spatial modes. With a basis of 21 spatial modes in both transverse dimensions, we perform two-dimensional imaging with twofold resolution enhancement beyond the diffraction limit.},

As an unambiguous signature, we demonstrate the emergence of a dynamical phase, in which the atoms periodically localize between the antinodes of the pump lattice, associated with an oscillating net momentum along the pump axis. We observe this dynamical phase through the periodic switching of the relative phase between the pump and cavity fields at a small fraction of the driving frequency, suggesting that it exhibits a time crystalline character.},

We carried out calculations of the energies and magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants for the low-lying states of Th 229 3 + in the framework of such a relativistic coupled-cluster single double triple method. We present a detailed study of various corrections to all calculated properties. Using the theory results and experimental data, we found the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments to be μ = 0.366 ( 6 ) μ N and Q = 3.11 ( 2 ) e b , respectively, and reduce the uncertainty of the quadrupole moment by a factor of 3.

  abstract     = {The strong suppression of high- p T jets in heavy-ion collisions is a result of elastic and inelastic energy loss suffered by the jet multiprong collection of color charges that are resolved by medium interactions. Hence, quenching effects depend on the fluctuations of the jet substructure that are probed by the cone-size dependence of the spectrum. In this Letter, we present the first complete, analytic calculation of the inclusive R -dependent jet spectrum in PbPb collisions at LHC energies, including resummation of energy loss effects from hard, vacuumlike emissions occurring in the medium and modeling of soft energy flow and recovery at the jet cone. Both the geometry of the collision and the local medium properties, such as the temperature and fluid velocity, are given by a hydrodynamic evolution of the medium, leaving only the coupling constant in the medium as a free parameter. The calculation yields a good description of the centrality and p T dependence of jet suppression for R = 0.4 together with a mild cone-size dependence, which is in agreement with recent experimental results. Gauging the theoretical uncertainties, we find that the largest sensitivity resides in the leading logarithmic approximation of the phase space of resolved splittings, which can be improved systematically, while nonperturbative modeling of the soft-gluon sector is of relatively minor importance up to large cone sizes.},

  abstract     = {The neutrino floor is a theoretical lower limit on WIMP-like dark matter models that are discoverable in direct detection experiments. It is commonly interpreted as the point at which dark matter signals become hidden underneath a remarkably similar-looking background from neutrinos. However, it has been known for some time that the neutrino floor is not a hard limit, but can be pushed past with sufficient statistics. As a consequence, some have recently advocated for calling it the “neutrino fog” instead. The downside of current methods of deriving the neutrino floor are that they rely on arbitrary choices of experimental exposure and energy threshold. Here we propose to define the neutrino floor as the boundary of the neutrino fog, and develop a calculation free from these assumptions. The technique is based on the derivative of a hypothetical experimental discovery limit as a function of exposure, and leads to a neutrino floor that is only influenced by the systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux normalizations. Our floor is broadly similar to those found in the literature, but differs by almost an order of magnitude in the sub-GeV range, and above 20 GeV.},

Such an independent determination of muon g − 2 would certainly shed light on the ∼ 2 ppm difference currently observed between spin-precession measurements and ( R -ratio based) standard model predictions. The magnetic dipole interaction between electrons and (anti)muons bound in muonium gives rise to a hyperfine splitting (HFS) of the ground state which is sensitive to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. A direct comparison of the muonium frequency measurements of the HFS at J-PARC and the 1S-2S transition at PSI with theory predictions will allow us to extract muon g − 2 with high precision. Improving the accuracy of QED calculations of these transitions by about 1 order of magnitude is also required. Moreover, the good agreement between theory and experiment for the electron g − 2 indicates that new physics interactions are unlikely to affect muonium spectroscopy down to the envisaged precision.},

  abstract     = {The Gibbs state is widely taken to be the equilibrium state of a system in contact with an environment at temperature T . However, non-negligible interactions between system and environment can give rise to an altered state. Here, we derive general expressions for this mean force Gibbs state, valid for any system that interacts with a bosonic reservoir. First, we derive the state in the weak coupling limit and find that, in general, it maintains coherences with respect to the bare system Hamiltonian. Second, we develop a new expansion method suited to investigate the ultrastrong coupling regime. This allows us to derive the explicit form for the mean force Gibbs state, and we find that it becomes diagonal in the basis set by the system-reservoir interaction instead of the system Hamiltonian. Several examples are discussed including a single qubit, a three-level V -system, and two coupled qubits all interacting with bosonic reservoirs. The results shed light on the presence of coherences in the strong coupling regime, and provide key tools for nanoscale thermodynamics investigations.},

  abstract     = {The low-temperature properties of interacting quantum systems are believed to require exponential resources to compute in the general case. Quantifying the extent to which such properties can be approximated using efficient algorithms remains a significant open challenge. Here, we consider the task of approximating the ground state energy of two-local quantum Hamiltonians with bounded-degree interaction graphs. Most existing algorithms optimize the energy over the set of product states. We propose and analyze a family of shallow quantum circuits that can be used to improve the approximation ratio achieved by a given product state. The algorithm takes as input an n -qubit product state with variance Var and improves its energy by an amount proportional to Var 2 / n . In a typical case, this results in an extensive improvement in the estimated energy. We extend our results to k -local Hamiltonians and entangled initial states.},

One of the current challenges is to go beyond 1 + 1 dimensions, where four-body (plaquette) interactions, not contained naturally in quantum simulating devices, appear. In this Letter, we propose a method to obtain them based on a combination of stroboscopic optical atomic control and the nonlocal photon-mediated interactions appearing in nanophotonic or cavity QED setups.

The non-Markovian environment is often approximated by discrete bosonic modes, thus mapping it to a Lindbladian or Hamiltonian simulation problem. While systematic constructions of such modes have been previously proposed, the resulting approximation lacks rigorous and general convergence guarantees. In this Letter, we show that under some physically motivated assumptions on the system-environment interaction, the finite-time dynamics of the non-Markovian open quantum system computed with a sufficiently large number of modes is guaranteed to converge to the true result. Furthermore, we show that this approximation error typically falls off polynomially with the number of modes.

We present a novel approach that describes the emergence of entangled states entirely in terms of independent and deterministic Ehrenfest-like classical trajectories. For a two-level quantum system in a classical environment, this is derived by mapping the quantum system onto a path-integral representation of a spin 1 2 . We demonstrate that the method correctly accounts for coherence and decoherence and thus reproduces the splitting of a wave packet in a nonadiabatic scattering problem.

In this work, we study a topological emitter array coupled to an electromagnetic environment. The photon-emitter coupling produces nonlocal interactions between emitters. Using periodic boundary conditions for all ranges of environment-induced interactions, the chiral symmetry inherent to the emitter array is preserved. This chiral symmetry protects the Hamiltonian and induces parity in the Lindblad operator. A topological phase transition occurs at a critical photon-emitter coupling related to the energy spectrum width of the emitter array. Interestingly, the critical point nontrivially changes the dissipation rates of edge states, yielding a dissipative topological phase transition. In the protected topological phase, edge states suffer from environment-induced dissipation for weak photon-emitter coupling. However, strong coupling leads to robust dissipationless edge states with a window at the emitter spacing. Our work shows the potential to manipulate topological quantum matter with electromagnetic environments.},

  abstract     = {Recently, various nonclassical properties of quantum states and channels have been characterized through an advantage they provide in quantum information tasks over their classical counterparts. Such advantage can be typically proven to be quantitative, in that larger amounts of quantum resources lead to better performance in the corresponding tasks. So far, these characterizations have been established only in the finite-dimensional setting, hence, leaving out central resources in continuous variable systems such as entanglement and nonclassicality of states as well as entanglement breaking and broadcasting channels. In this Letter, we present a fully general framework for resource quantification in infinite-dimensional systems. The framework is applicable to a wide range of resources with the only premises being that classical randomness cannot create a resource and that the resourceless objects form a closed set in an appropriate sense. As the latter may be hard to establish for the abstract topologies of continuous variable systems, we provide a relaxation of the condition with no reference to topology. This envelopes the aforementioned resources and various others, hence, giving them an interpretation as performance enhancement in so-called input-output games.},

These excess modes are crucial for the understanding of the low temperature thermal and mechanical properties of glasses, which differ from those of crystalline solids. Recent simulational studies suggest that the density of the excess modes scales with their frequency ω as ω 4 in two and higher dimensions. Here, we present extensive numerical studies of two-dimensional model glass formers over a large range of glass stabilities. We find that the density of the excess modes follows D exc ( ω ) ∼ ω 2 up to around the boson peak, regardless of the glass stability. The stability dependence of the overall scale of D exc ( ω ) correlates with the stability dependence of low-frequency sound attenuation. However, we also find that, in small systems, where the first sound mode is pushed to higher frequencies, at frequencies below the first sound mode, there are excess modes with a system size independent density of states that scales as ω 3 .},

Adding a phonon-mediated intervalley retarded attractive interaction, we obtain strong-coupling superconducting domes, whose structure is in qualitative agreement with experiments. Our model elucidates how the intricate form of the interactions and the particle-hole asymmetry of the electronic structure determine the phase diagram. It also explains how subtle differences between devices may lead to the different behaviors observed experimentally.

We study a series of devices based on different 2D systems, including mono- and bilayer T d − WTe 2 , MoTe 2 / WSe 2 moiré heterobilayers, and Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, which all share a similar graphite-gated geometry. We find that the 2D systems, when tuned near an insulating state, generically exhibit magnetoresistance oscillations corresponding to a high-density Fermi surface, in contravention of naïve band theory. Simultaneous measurement of the resistivity of the graphite gates shows that the oscillations of the sample layer are precisely correlated with those of the graphite gates. Further supporting this connection, the oscillations are quenched when the graphite gate is replaced by a low-mobility metal, TaSe 2 . The observed phenomenon arises from the oscillatory behavior of graphite density of states, which modulates the device capacitance and, as a consequence, the carrier density in the sample layer even when a constant electrochemical potential is maintained between the sample and the gate electrode. Oscillations are most pronounced near insulating states where the resistivity is strongly density dependent. Our study suggests a unified mechanism for quantum oscillations in graphite-gated 2D insulators based on electrostatic sample-gate coupling.},

Through exploiting the phenomenon of DW-surface trench (ST) parallel alignment, systems where DWs are known for becoming electrical conductors could now become useful nanocircuits using only standard lithographical techniques. Despite this clear application, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the alignment phenomenon has remained elusive. Using ultrathin PbTiO 3 films as a model system, we explore this mechanism with large scale density functional theory simulations on as many as 5,136 atoms. Although we expect multiple contributing factors, we show that parallel DW-ST alignment can be well explained by this configuration giving rise to an arrangement of electric dipole moments which best restore polar continuity to the film. These moments preserve the polar texture of the pristine film, thus minimizing ST-induced depolarizing fields. Given the generality of this mechanism, we suggest that STs could be used to engineer other exotic polar textures in a variety of FE nanostructures as supported by the appearance of ST-induced polar cycloidal modulations in this Letter. Our simulations also support experimental observations of ST-induced negative strains which have been suggested to play a role in the alignment mechanism.},

So far, bilinear spin Hamiltonians have been commonly adopted to investigate the magnetic properties of 2D magnets, neglecting higher order magnetic interactions. However, we here provide quantitative evidence of giant biquadratic exchange interactions in monolayer NiX 2 ( X = Cl , Br and I), by combining first-principles calculations and the newly developed machine learning method for constructing Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we show that the ferromagnetic ground state within NiCl 2 single layers cannot be explained by means of the bilinear Heisenberg Hamiltonian; rather, the nearest-neighbor biquadratic interaction is found to be crucial. Furthermore, using a three-orbitals Hubbard model, we propose that the giant biquadratic exchange interaction originates from large hopping between unoccupied and occupied orbitals on neighboring magnetic ions. On a general framework, our work suggests biquadratic exchange interactions to be important in 2D magnets with edge-shared octahedra.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnetism (AFM) such as Néel ordering is often closely related to Coulomb interactions such as Hubbard repulsion in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Whether Néel AFM ordering in two dimensions can be dominantly induced by electron-phonon couplings (EPC) has not been completely understood. Here, by employing numerically exact sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we show that bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) phonons with frequency ω and EPC constant λ can induce AFM ordering for a wide range of phonon frequency ω &gt; ω c . For ω &lt; ω c , a valence-bond-solid (VBS) order appears and there is a direct quantum phase transition between VBS and AFM phases at ω c . The phonon mechanism of the AFM ordering is related to the fact that SSH phonons directly couple to electron hopping whose second-order process can induce an effective AFM spin exchange. Our results shall shed new light on understanding AFM ordering in correlated quantum materials.},

In this Letter, we report the observation of an anomalous thermal Hall effect (THE) with κ x y ∼ 1 × 10 − 2 W K − 1 m − 1 in an insulating van der Waals ferromagnet VI 3 . The thermal Hall signal persists in the absence of an external magnetic field and flips sign upon the switching of the magnetization. In combination with theoretical calculations, we show that VI 3 exhibits a dual nature of the THE, i.e., dominated by topological magnons hosted by the ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice at higher temperatures and by phonons induced by the magnon-phonon coupling at lower temperatures. Our results not only position VI 3 as the first ferromagnetic system to investigate both anomalous magnon and phonon THEs, but also render it as a potential platform for spintronics-magnonics applications.},

For this purpose, we propose a concept of the energy-dependent temperature (EDT): near the energy minima this temperature is high, but it tends toward room temperature for energies approaching the barrier value. In the resulting algorithm simulation time required for the computation of the escape rate over the barrier does not increase with barrier height. Switching times computed via our EDT algorithm agree very well with those obtained with the forward flux sampling (FFS). As the simulation time required by our method does not increase with the energy barrier, we achieve a very large speed-up compared even to our strongly optimized version of FFS (and all other multistage algorithms). In addition, our approach is free from the instability occurring in all multistage “climbing” methods where a product of a large number of transition probabilities between the interfaces must be computed.},

Superconductivity is strongly enhanced when the inner and outer Fermi surfaces are close to each other. The most prevalent state has chiral p -wave symmetry, but d -wave and extended s -wave pairing are also possible. We discuss these results in the context of rhombohedral trilayer graphene, where superconductivity was recently discovered in regimes where the normal state has an annular Fermi surface. Using realistic parameters, our mechanism can account for the order of magnitude of T c , as well as its trends as a function of electron density and perpendicular displacement field. Moreover, it naturally explains some of the outstanding puzzles in this material, that include the weak temperature dependence of the resistivity above T c , and the proximity of spin singlet superconductivity to the ferromagnetic phase.},

  abstract     = {Flatbands appear in many condensed matter systems, including the two-dimensional electron gas in a high magnetic field, correlated materials, and moiré heterostructures. They are characterized by intrinsic geometric properties such as the Berry curvature and Fubini-Study metric. The influence of the band geometry on electron-electron interaction is difficult to understand analytically because the geometry is in general nonuniform in momentum space. In this work, we study the topological flatband of Chern number C = 1 with a momentum-dependent but positive definite Berry curvature that fluctuates in sync with Fubini-Study metric. We derive an exact correspondence between such ideal flatbands and Landau levels and show that the band geometry fluctuation gives rise to a new type of interaction in the corresponding Landau levels that depends on the center of mass of two particles. We characterize such interactions by generalizing the usual Haldane pseudopotentials. This mapping gives exact zero-energy ground states for short-ranged repulsive generalized pseudopotentials in flatbands, in analogy to fractional quantum Hall systems. Driving the center-of-mass interactions beyond the repulsive regime leads to a dramatic reconstruction of the ground states towards gapless phases. The generalized pseudopotential could be a useful basis for future numerical studies.},

We interpret our results in terms of a quantum Griffiths phase caused by nematic islands that result from the local distribution of Se and S atoms. At low temperatures, the Griffiths phase is masked by the emergence of a Fermi liquid phase due to a strong nematoelastic coupling and a Lifshitz transition that changes the topology of the Fermi surface.},

In ordinary liquids, a nonzero value of C ˜ T ( k , 0 ) is inevitably linked to viscous material flows. Even in solids where significant material flows are precluded due to almost frozen positional degrees of freedom, our molecular dynamics simulations reveal that C ˜ T ( k , 0 ) takes a nonzero value, whereby the time integration of the velocity field shows definite diffusive behavior with diffusivity C ˜ T ( k , 0 ) / 3 . This behavior is attributed to viscous transport accompanying a small random convection of the velocity field (the inertia effect), and the resultant viscosity is measurable in the Eulerian description: the constituent particles that substantially carry momenta fluctuate slightly around their reference positions. In the Eulerian description, the velocity field is explicitly associated with such fluctuating instantaneous particle positions, whereas in the Lagrangian description, this is not the case. The present study poses a fundamental problem for continuum mechanics: reconciling liquid and solid descriptions in the limit of the infinite structural relaxation time.},

This leads to a distinctive form of topological metastability , whereby a conserved Majorana boson localized on one edge is paired, in general, with a symmetry generator localized on the opposite edge. We argue that Majorana bosons are robust against disorder and identifiable by signatures in the zero-frequency steady-state power spectrum.

Here we identify a new regime of electron beam transport in solid-density plasma, where kinetic effects that develop on small time and space scales play a dominant role. Our three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that in this regime the electron beam can evolve into layered short microelectron bunches when collisions are relatively weak. The phenomenon is attributed to a secondary instability, on the space- and timescales of the electron skin depth (tens of nanometers) and few femtoseconds of strong electrostatic modulation of the microelectron current filaments formed by Weibel-like instability of the original electron beam. Analytical analysis on the amplitude, scale length, and excitation condition of the self-generated electrostatic fields is clearly validated by the simulations.},

Before any decision is made to pursue an ignition-scale laser system based on the octahedral hohlraum, one needs to test the concept with the existing facilities. Here, we report a proof-of-concept experiment for the novel octahedral hohlraum geometry on the cylindrically configured SGIII laser facility without a symmetry control. All polar and equatorial self-emission images of the compressed target show a near round shape of convergence ratio 15 under both square and shaped laser pulses. The observed implosion performances agree well with the ideal spherical implosion simulation.

  abstract     = {We report a new optofluidic resonating phenomenon that naturally links the optical radiation pressure, total internal reflection, capillary wave, and Rayleigh-Plateau instability together. When a transparent liquid jet is radiated by a focused continuous wave laser beam, the highly ordered periodic jet breakup is unexpectedly triggered and maintained. The capillary wave enables the liquid-gas interface to serve as a rotating mirror reflecting the laser beam in a wide range of angles, including the critical angle for total internal reflection. The liquid jet acts as an optical waveguide to periodically transmit the laser beam to the upstream of the jet. The periodic optical beam transmittance inside the liquid jet exerts time-dependent optical pressure to the jet that triggers the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. The jet breakup process locks in at the frequency corresponding to the peak growth rate of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability of the liquid jet, which agrees with the prediction from the dispersion relation of a traveling liquid jet.},

This onset problem is studied here by a novel experiment in which the centrifugal force can be varied over a wide range at fixed Rossby numbers by offsetting the apparatus from the rotation axis. Our experiment clearly shows that the centrifugal force starts to separate the hot and cold fluids at the onset Froude number 0.04. Additionally, this flow bifurcation leads to an unexpected heat transport enhancement and the existence of an optimal state. Based on the dynamical balance and characteristics of local flow structures, both the onset and optimal states are quantitatively explained.},

After a sudden start of the driving, we observe the formation of stable wave packets at the center of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) in momentum space, and we interpret these as Floquet solitons in periodically driven systems. The wave packets become unstable when we add a trapping potential along the lattice direction, leading to a redistribution of atoms within the BZ. The concept of a negative effective mass and the resulting changes to the interaction strength and effective trapping potential are used to explain the stability and the time evolution of the wave packets. We expect that similar states of matter waves exist for discrete breathers and other types of lattice solitons in periodically driven systems.},

The corresponding low-energy constant (LEC) is determined by fitting the transition amplitude of the n n → p p e − e − process to a recently proposed synthetic datum. We examine the dependence of the amplitude on similarity renormalization group scale and chiral expansion order of the nuclear interaction, finding that both dependences can be compensated to a large extent by readjusting the LEC. We evaluate the contribution of both the leading-order contact operator and standard long-range operator to the neutrinoless double-beta decays in the light nuclei He 6 , 8 and the candidate nucleus Ca 48 . Our results provide the first clear demonstration that the contact term enhances the NME in calculations with commonly used chiral two- plus three-nucleon interactions. In the case of Ca 48 , for example, the NME obtained with the EM ( 1.8 / 2.0 ) interaction is enhanced from 0.61 to 0.87(4), where the uncertainty is propagated from the synthetic datum.},

Unprecedented access to the single-particle structure of excited 1 − states below and around the neutron-separation threshold was obtained by comparing experimental data to predictions from a novel theoretical approach. The novel approach combines detailed structure input from energy-density functional plus quasiparticle-phonon model theory with reaction theory to obtain a consistent description of both the structure and reaction aspects of the process. The presented results show that the understanding of one-particle–one-hole structures of the 1 − states in the PDR region is crucial to reliably predict properties of the PDR and its contribution to nucleosynthesis processes.},

We validate our formula in simulations of U 238 + U 238 and Au 197 + Au 197 collisions at top Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy, and subsequently apply it to experimental data.

The calculation is performed at six values of the lattice spacing a , using O ( a ) -improved Wilson fermions at the SU(3)-symmetric point with m π = m K ≈ 420 MeV . Energy levels are extracted by applying a variational method to correlation matrices of bilocal two-baryon interpolating operators computed using the distillation technique. Our analysis employs Lüscher’s finite-volume quantization condition to determine the scattering phase shifts from the spectrum and vice versa, both above and below the two-baryon threshold. We perform global fits to the lattice spectra using parametrizations of the phase shift, supplemented by terms describing discretization effects, then extrapolate the lattice spacing to zero. The phase shift and the binding energy determined from it are found to be strongly affected by lattice artifacts.

Therefore, we carry out two analyses of lattice data to remove excited-state contamination, the standard one and a new one including N π and N π π states. We find that the standard analysis gives σ π N = 41.9 ( 4.9 ) MeV , consistent with previous lattice calculations, while our preferred χ PT -motivated analysis gives σ π N = 59.6 ( 7.4 ) MeV , which is consistent with phenomenological values obtained using π N scattering data.

Since the significance of detection scales steeply as t 5 / 2 for observing time t , future surveys that include angular accelerations in the astrometric solutions may be combined with Gaia to precisely measure the local dark matter density and shape of the density profile.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate unprecedented accuracy for rapid gravitational wave parameter estimation with deep learning. Using neural networks as surrogates for Bayesian posterior distributions, we analyze eight gravitational wave events from the first LIGO-Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog and find very close quantitative agreement with standard inference codes, but with inference times reduced from O ( day ) to 20 s per event. Our networks are trained using simulated data, including an estimate of the detector noise characteristics near the event. This encodes the signal and noise models within millions of neural-network parameters and enables inference for any observed data consistent with the training distribution, accounting for noise nonstationarity from event to event. Our algorithm—called “DINGO”—sets a new standard in fast and accurate inference of physical parameters of detected gravitational wave events, which should enable real-time data analysis without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract     = {High-quality optical resonant cavities require low optical loss, typically on the scale of parts per million. However, unintended micron-scale contaminants on the resonator mirrors that absorb the light circulating in the cavity can deform the surface thermoelastically and thus increase losses by scattering light out of the resonant mode. The point absorber effect is a limiting factor in some high-power cavity experiments, for example, the Advanced LIGO gravitational-wave detector. In this Letter, we present a general approach to the point absorber effect from first principles and simulate its contribution to the increased scattering. The achievable circulating power in current and future gravitational-wave detectors is calculated statistically given different point absorber configurations. Our formulation is further confirmed experimentally in comparison with the scattered power in the arm cavity of Advanced LIGO measured by in situ photodiodes. The understanding presented here provides an important tool in the global effort to design future gravitational-wave detectors that support high optical power and thus reduce quantum noise.},

We present a smart readout technique to allow the use of these sensors in visible light and other applications that require faster readout times. The method optimizes the readout noise and time by changing the number of times pixels are read out either statically, by defining an arbitrary number of regions of interest in the array, or dynamically, depending on the charge or energy of interest in the pixel. This technique is tested in a Skipper CCD showing that it is possible to obtain deep subelectron noise, and therefore, high resolution of quantized charge, while dynamically changing the readout noise of the sensor. These faster, low noise readout techniques show that the skipper CCD is a competitive technology even where other technologies such as electron multiplier charge coupled devices, silicon photo multipliers, etc. are currently used. This technique could allow skipper CCDs to benefit new astronomical instruments, quantum imaging, exoplanet search and study, and quantum metrology.},

Here we present an algorithm employing state-of-the-art results in machine-learning-based estimation of information-theoretic quantities, overcoming these challenges, and use this advance to develop a new paradigm in identifying the most relevant operators describing properties of the system. We demonstrate this on an interacting model, where the emergent degrees of freedom are qualitatively different from the microscopic constituents.

When considering particular perturbed dynamics, our relation leads to several thermodynamic uncertainty relations, indicating that our relation provides a unified perspective on classical and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations.},

These phases have no analogues in the isolated system (i.e., in absence of the baths) where the transport is perfectly ballistic. In the open system scenario, interestingly, there occurs two chemical-potential-driven subdiffusive to ballistic phase transitions at zero temperature. We discuss how these phase transitions, to our knowledge, are different from all the known nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions. We provide a clear understanding of the microscopic origin of these phases and argue that the subdiffusive phases are robust against the presence of arbitrary number-conserving many-body interactions in the system. These phases showing subdiffusive scaling of conductance with system size in a two-terminal setup are therefore universal properties of all ordered one-dimensional number-conserving fermionic systems with power-law-decaying hopping at zero temperature.},

The latter, dubbed many-body localization (MBL) phenomenon, describes the nonergodic behavior that is dynamically identified by the preservation of local information and slow entanglement growth. Here, we provide a precise observation of this same phenomenology in the case where the quenched on-site energy landscape is not disordered, but rather linearly varied, emulating the Stark MBL. To this end, we construct a quantum device composed of 29 functional superconducting qubits, faithfully reproducing the relaxation dynamics of a nonintegrable spin model. At large Stark potentials, local observables display periodic Bloch oscillations, a manifesting characteristic of the fragmentation of the Hilbert space in sectors that conserve dipole moments. The flexible programmability of our quantum emulator highlights its potential in helping the understanding of nontrivial quantum many-body problems, in direct complement to simulations in classical computers.},

Changing the signs of the stabilizer generators allows us to change how the coherent errors interfere, leading to a quantum error-correcting code which performs as well as a classical repetition code of equivalent distance against these errors. We demonstrate a factor of 3.78 ± 1.20 improvement of the logical T 2 * in a distance-3 logical qubit implemented on a trapped-ion quantum computer.

The strength of the nonlinearity in each resonator needed to achieve unconventional photon blockade is suppressed exponentially with lattice size. The analytic derivation, based on a weak drive approximation, is validated by wave function Monte Carlo simulations. These findings show that customized lattices of coupled resonators can be powerful tools for controlling multiphoton quantum states.},

In this work, we enlarge this approach and show how a coarse-grained version of self-testing is possible in which physically relevant properties of a many-body system are certified. To this aim we study a Bell scenario consisting of an arbitrary number of parties and show that the membership to a set of (entangled) quantum states whose size grows exponentially with the number of parties can be self-tested. Specifically, we prove that a many-body generalization of the chained Bell inequality is maximally violated if and only if the underlying quantum state is equal, up to local isometries, to a many-body singlet. The maximal violation of the inequality therefore certifies any statistical mixture of the exponentially many orthogonal pure states spanning the singlet manifold.},

A classic example is given by a charge qubit that is capacitively coupled to a transmission line, which leads to the celebrated spin-boson description of quantum dissipation. We show that the intrinsic multilevel structure of superconducting qubits drastically restricts the validity of the spin-boson paradigm due to phase localization, which spreads the wave function over many charge states. Numerical renormalization group simulations also show that the quantum critical point moves out of the physically accessible range in the multilevel regime.

  abstract     = {Cooper pair splitters are promising candidates for generating spin-entangled electrons. However, the splitting of Cooper pairs is a random and noisy process, which hinders further synchronized operations on the entangled electrons. To circumvent this problem, we here propose and analyze a dynamic Cooper pair splitter that produces a noiseless and regular flow of spin-entangled electrons. The Cooper pair splitter is based on a superconductor coupled to quantum dots, whose energy levels are tuned in and out of resonance to control the splitting process. We identify the optimal operating conditions for which exactly one Cooper pair is split per period of the external drive and the flow of entangled electrons becomes noiseless. To characterize the regularity of the Cooper pair splitter in the time domain, we analyze the g ( 2 ) function of the output currents and the distribution of waiting times between split Cooper pairs. Our proposal is feasible using current technology, and it paves the way for dynamic quantum information processing with spin-entangled electrons.},

We show that, in centrosymmetric nonmagnetic crystals, for which a bulk Rashba-Dresselhaus effect is symmetry-forbidden, electron-phonon interactions can induce a phonon-assisted, dynamic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting in the presence of an out-of-equilibrium phonon population. In particular, we show how Rashba, Dresselhaus, or Weyl spin textures can selectively be established by driving coherent infrared-active phonons, and we perform ab initio calculations to quantify this effect for halide perovskites.},

Here we demonstrate photonic spin lattices as a new topological construct governed by the spin-orbit coupling in an optical field. The symmetry of the electromagnetic field in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction may result in only two types of photonic spin lattices: either hexagonal spin-skyrmion or square spin-meron lattices. We show that these spin structures correspond to the lowest energy of the electromagnetic field configuration, therefore, energetically stable. We further show that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling these spin topologies are degenerated in dynamic field skyrmions, unifying the description of electromagnetic field topologies. The results provide a new understanding of electromagnetic field topology and its transformations as well as new opportunities for applications in quantum technologies, spin optics, and topological photonics.},

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy ubiquitously enables the investigation of surface chemistry, interfacial chemistry, as well as symmetry properties in solids. Polarization-resolved SHG spectroscopy in the visible to infrared regime is regularly used to investigate electronic and magnetic order through their angular anisotropies within the crystal structure. However, the increasing complexity of novel materials and emerging phenomena hampers the interpretation of experiments solely based on the investigation of hybridized valence states. Here, polarization-resolved SHG in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV-SHG) is demonstrated for the first time, enabling element-resolved angular anisotropy investigations. In noncentrosymmetric LiNbO 3 , elemental contributions by lithium and niobium are clearly distinguished by energy dependent XUV-SHG measurements. This element-resolved and symmetry-sensitive experiment suggests that the displacement of Li ions in LiNbO 3 , which is known to lead to ferroelectricity, is accompanied by distortions to the Nb ion environment that breaks the inversion symmetry of the NbO 6 octahedron as well. Our simulations show that the measured second harmonic spectrum is consistent with Li ion displacements from the centrosymmetric position while the Nb ─ O bonds are elongated and contracted by displacements of the O atoms. In addition, the polarization-resolved measurement of XUV-SHG shows excellent agreement with numerical predictions based on dipole-induced SHG commonly used in the optical wavelengths. Our result constitutes the first verification of the dipole-based SHG model in the XUV regime. The findings of this work pave the way for future angle and time-resolved XUV-SHG studies with elemental specificity in condensed matter systems.},

Electrons in DSM have zero effective mass and hence the system carries no nominal energy scale. Therefore, unlike those of ordinary materials, the electromagnetic responses of the electrons in DSM will not be overwhelmed by the physical effects related to electron mass. NRI is induced by the combination of the quantum effect of vacuum polarization and its finite temperature correction, which is proportional to T 4 at low temperature. It is a phenomenon of resonance between the incident light and the unique structure of Dirac cones, which allows numerous states to participate in electron-hole pair production excited by the incident light with a similar dispersion relation to that of Dirac cones. The NRI phenomenon of DSM manifests in an extensive range of photon frequencies and wave numbers and can be observed around the gigahertz range at room temperature.},

The spin Hall effect (SHE), which creates a spin-polarized current in the Pt layer, can inject or annihilate magnons depending on the electric current and applied field orientations. Here we demonstrate that the injection or annihilation of magnons via the SHE can prevent or promote the formation of a rapid cooling-induced magnon BEC. Depending on the current polarity, a change in the BEC threshold of − 8\% and + 6\% was detected. These findings demonstrate a new method to control macroscopic quantum states, paving the way for their application in spintronic devices.},

Here, we reveal a new type of nonmagnetic Kondo behavior generated by gauge fluctuations in strongly correlated baths. We show that a nonmagnetic bond defect not only introduces the potential scattering but also locally enhances the gauge fluctuations. The local gauge fluctuations further mediate a pseudospin exchange interaction that produces an asymmetric Kondo fixed point in low energy. The gauge-fluctuation-induced Kondo phenomena do not exhibit the characteristic resistivity behavior of the conventional Kondo effect, but display a nonmonotonous temperature dependence of thermal conductivity as well as an anisotropic pseudospin correlation. Moreover, with its origin from gauge fluctuations, the Kondo features can be regarded as promising indicators for identifying quantum spin liquids. Our work advances fundamental knowledge of novel Kondo phenomena in strongly correlated systems, which have no counterparts in thermal baths within the single-particle description.},

We resolve this uncertainty through direct calculations of all-rank intersite exchange interactions and inelastic neutron scattering cross section for the d 2 double perovskite series Ba 2 M OsO 6 ( M = Ca , Mg, Zn). Using advanced many-body first-principles methods, we show that the ground state is formed by ferro-ordered octupoles coupled by superexchange interactions within the ground-state E g doublet.

Even for equivalent adsorption sites with respect to the atomic MoS 2 lattice, we observe that Fe adatoms exhibit behaviors ranging from pure spin excitations, characteristic of negligible exchange and dominant single-ion anisotropy, to a fully developed Kondo resonance, indicating strong exchange and negligible single-ion anisotropy. This tunability emerges from a moiré structure of MoS 2 on Au(111) in conjunction with pronounced many-body renormalizations. We also find striking spectral variations in the immediate vicinity of the Fe atoms, which we explain by quantum interference reflecting the formation of Fe-S hybrid states despite the nominally inert nature of the substrate.

In this Letter, we propose a physical picture based on the Anderson localization to understand the observed Hall plateaus in disordered MnBi 2 Te 4 . Rather good consistency between the experimental and numerical results confirms that the bulk states are localized in the absence of a magnetic field and a QAH edge state emerges with C = 1 . However, under a strong magnetic field, the lowest Landau band formed with the localized bulk states, survives disorder, together with the QAH edge state, leading to a C = 2 phase. Eventually, we present a phase diagram of a disordered MnBi 2 Te 4 which indicates more coexistence states of QAH and QH to be verified by future experiments.},

Recently, vanadium-based materials with layered kagome structures were discovered to be topological metals, which exhibit charge density wave (CDW) properties, significant anomalous Hall effect, and unusual superconductivity at low temperatures. Here, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the electronic structure evolution upon the CDW transition in a vanadium-based kagome material RbV 3 Sb 5 . The CDW phase transition gives rise to a partial energy gap opening at the boundary of the Brillouin zone and, most importantly, the emergence of new van Hove singularities associated with large density of states, which are absent in the normal phase and might be related to the superconductivity observed at lower temperatures. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms for the formation of the CDW and superconducting states in these topological kagome metals.},

  abstract     = {It has recently been discovered that random quantum circuits provide an avenue to realize rich entanglement phase diagrams, which are hidden to standard expectation values of operators. Here we study ( 2 + 1 ) D random circuits with random Clifford unitary gates and measurements designed to stabilize trivial area law and topologically ordered phases. With competing single qubit Pauli-Z and toric code stabilizer measurements, in addition to random Clifford unitaries, we find a phase diagram involving a tricritical point that maps to ( 2 + 1 ) D percolation, a possibly stable critical phase, topologically ordered, trivial, and volume law phases, and lines of critical points separating them. With Pauli-Y single qubit measurements instead, we find an anisotropic self-dual tricritical point, with dynamical exponent z ≈ 1.46 , exhibiting logarithmic violation of the area law and an anomalous exponent for the topological entanglement entropy, which thus appears distinct from any known percolation fixed point. The phase diagram also hosts a measurement-induced volume law entangled phase in the absence of unitary dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The process of material cutting emerges from a series of nonlinear phenomena including frictional contact, plastic deformation, and fracture. While cutting dominated by shear deformation is of interest to achieve a smooth material removal and a high-quality surface finish, the fracture-induced chip breaking is of equal importance to prevent the formation of long chips. Here we show that discrepant observations and predictions of these two distinct cutting mechanisms can be reconciled into a unified framework. A simple analytical model is developed to predict the mechanism of chip formation in a homogeneous medium as a function of work piece intrinsic material properties, tool geometry, and the process parameters. The model reveals the existence of a critical depth of cut, below which the chip formation is gradually progressed by plastic deformation in the shear plane, and above which chips break off by abrupt crack propagation. The models’ prediction is validated by systematic in situ orthogonal cutting experiments and literature data for a wide range of materials over multiple length scales.},

  abstract     = {The removal of microbubbles from substrates is crucial for the efficiency of many catalytic and electrochemical gas evolution reactions in liquids. The current work investigates the coalescence and detachment of bubbles generated from catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Self-propelled detachment, induced by the coalescence of two bubbles, is observed at sizes much smaller than those determined by buoyancy. Upon coalescence, the released surface energy is partly dissipated by the bubble oscillations, working against viscous drag. The remaining energy is converted to the kinetic energy of the out-of-plane jumping motion of the merged bubble. The critical ratio of the parent bubble sizes for the jumping to occur is theoretically derived from an energy balance argument and found to be in agreement with the experimental results. The present results provide both physical insight for the bubble interactions and practical strategies for applications in chemical engineering and renewable energy technologies like electrolysis.},

Here, we show that in certain constrained many-body systems the structure of conservation laws can cause a drastic modification of this universal behavior. As an example, we study operator growth characterized by out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs) in a dipole-conserving fracton chain. We identify a critical point with sub-ballistically moving OTOC front, that separates a ballistic from a dynamically frozen phase. This critical point is tied to an underlying localization transition and we use its associated scaling properties to derive an effective description of the moving operator front via a biased random walk with long waiting times. We support our arguments numerically using classically simulable automaton circuits.},

The flow firstly appears near the minimum safety factor at the injection energy of neutral beams, and then moves radially inward and outward by gaining and losing energy, respectively. The flow trajectories in phase space align well with the intersection lines of the constant magnetic moment surfaces and constant E − ( ω / n ) P ζ surfaces, where E , P ζ are the energy and canonical toroidal momentum of ions; ω and n are angular frequencies and toroidal mode numbers of AEs. It is found that the flow is so destructive that the thermalization of fast ions is no longer observed in regions of strong interaction. The measured phase-space flow is consistent with nonlinear hybrid kinetic-magnetohydrodynamics simulation. Calculations of the relatively narrow phase-space islands reveal that fast ions must transition between different flow trajectories to experience large-scale phase-space transport.},

In this Letter, we remove all three approximations simultaneously for the first time and test the importance for two applications: neutral hydrogen and highly ionized magnesium and oxygen. We found 15\%–50\% change in the spectral line widths, which are sufficient to impact applications including white-dwarf mass determination, stellar-opacity research, and laboratory plasma diagnostics.},

Here, we discover a considerable chiral-dependent trapping force to separate nanometer-scale enantiomers in a new silicon-based waveguide platform. The electromagnetic chirality gradient of strongly confined evanescent fields can be largely enhanced by the counterpropagating slot waveguides so that the resulting chiral gradient forces can shift the trapping equilibrium positions of dielectric gradient forces. Especially, there exists a transitional width for the slot waveguides to exchange the trapping equilibrium positions between two opposite enantiomers. Our thoroughly numerical investigations demonstrate that the chiral-separable slot waveguides here can offer high efficiency and feasibility of separating chiral nanoparticles, and may pave a route toward new on-chip chiral optical tweezers or optofluidic transport systems for large-scale chiral separation.},

An on-chip compatible chiral interface is attractive for both fundamental studies of light-matter interactions and applications to quantum information processing. We propose such a chiral interface based on superconducting circuits, which has wide bandwidth, rich tunability, and high tolerance to fabrication variations. The proposed interface consists of a core that uses Cooper-pair boxes (CPBs) to break time-reversal symmetry, and two superconducting transmons that connect the core to a waveguide in the manner reminiscent of a “giant atom.” The transmons form a state decoupled from the core, akin to dark states of atomic physics, rendering the whole interface insensitive to the CPB charge noise. The proposed interface can be extended to realize a broadband fully passive on-chip circulator for microwave photons.},

Using a vector vortex beam, we inscribe structured atomic spin polarization in a cloud of cold rubidium atoms and record images of the resulting absorption patterns. The polar angle of an external magnetic field can then be deduced with spatial Fourier analysis.

The emergent functional describes the complete intrapair electron correlation, and the correlation between orbitals that make up both the pairs and the individual electrons. The interorbital correlation is composed of static and dynamic terms. The concept of dynamic part of the occupation numbers is introduced. To evaluate the accuracy achieved with the GNOF, calculation of a variety of properties is presented. They include the total energies and energy differences between the ground state and the lowest-lying excited state with different spin of atoms from H to Ne, ionization potentials of the first-row transition-metal atoms (Sc-Zn), and the total energies of a selected set of 55 molecular systems in different spin states. The GNOF is also applied to the homolytic dissociation of selected diatomic molecules in different spin states and to the rotation barrier of ethylene, both paradigmatic cases of systems with significant multiconfigurational character.

We then add the quantified value of A PV together with α D to our calibration dataset to optimize new functionals. Based on these results, we predict a neutron skin thickness in Pb 208 r skin = 0.19 ± 0.02 fm and the symmetry-energy slope L = 54 ± 8 MeV . These values are consistent with other estimates based on astrophysical data and are significantly lower than those recently reported using a particular set of relativistic energy density functionals.

Employing lattice simulations with constrained values of the order parameter, we demonstrate explicitly that the path integral is dominated by inhomogeneous field configurations and that these are unambiguously related to the flatness of the effective potential in the broken phase. We determine characteristic features of these inhomogeneities, including their topology and the scaling of the associated excess energy with their size. Concerning the latter we introduce the differential surface tension—the generalization of the concept of a surface tension pertaining to discrete symmetries. Within our approach, spontaneous symmetry breaking is captured merely via the existence of inhomogeneities, i.e., without the inclusion of an explicit breaking parameter and a careful double limiting procedure to define the order parameter.

Exploring various treatments of resummation, we find that the large- x asymptotics of the valence quark distribution ∼ ( 1 − x ) β v can differ significantly, with β v ranging from ≈ 1 to &gt; 2.5 at the input scale. Regardless of the specific implementation, however, the resummation induced redistribution of the momentum between valence quarks and gluons boosts the total momentum carried by gluons to ≈ 40\% , increasing the gluon contribution to the pion mass to ≈ 40 MeV .},

For the paradigmatic random field Heisenberg spin chains, many intriguing features were observed when the disorder is considerable compared to the spin interaction strength. Here, we introduce a phenomenological theory that may explain some of those features. The theory is based on the proximity to the noninteracting limit, in which the system is an Anderson insulator. Taking the spin imbalance as an exemplary observable, we demonstrate that the proximity to the local integrals of motion of the Anderson insulator determines the dynamics of the observable at infinite temperature. In finite interacting systems our theory quantitatively describes its integrated spectral function for a wide range of disorders.},

Our approach allows us to connect directly the Thouless time, t Th , determined by the spectral form factor, to transport properties and linear-response correlators. Using tensor network methods, we determine the dynamical exponent z for a number of constrained, conserving models. We find universality classes with diffusive, subdiffusive, quasilocalized, and localized dynamics, depending on the severity of the constraints. In particular, we show that quantum systems with “Fredkin” constraints exhibit anomalous transport with dynamical exponent z ≃ 8 / 3 .},

Focusing on quantum generalizations of classical nonequilibrium systems: the Domany-Kinzel cellular automaton and the Bagnoli-Boccara-Rechtman model, we estimate the universal critical exponents for both the entanglement and coherence. As these models belong to the one-dimensional directed percolation universality class, the latter provides a key new critical exponent, one that is unique to quantum systems.},

A successful approach to increase ϵ s is to incorporate polar additives (with high ϵ s ) but controlling the resulting dispersion state is difficult. Here, we show that significant ϵ s increases are realized by adding zwitterions, which are small molecules with a cation and an anion separated by covalent bonds. The increase in ϵ s with zwitterion addition is attributed to the large molecular dipole of zwitterions, ranging from 35 to 41 D, as experimentally quantified and confirmed using density functional theory. At elevated zwitterion concentration in an ethylene glycol medium, there is a nonlinear increase of ϵ s that eventually saturates due to the strong Coulombic interactions between zwitterions. The presented work provides a fundamental molecular understanding of why zwitterions are effective additives in boosting ϵ s in soft materials.},

An intensely studied direction is to realize broken-symmetry phases that are “hidden” under equilibrium conditions but can be unleashed by an ultrashort laser pulse. Despite a plethora of experimental discoveries, the nature of these orders and how they transiently appear remain unclear. To this end, we investigate a nonequilibrium charge density wave (CDW) in rare-earth tritellurides, which is suppressed in equilibrium but emerges after photoexcitation. Using a pump-pump-probe protocol implemented in ultrafast electron diffraction, we demonstrate that the light-induced CDW consists solely of order parameter fluctuations, which bear striking similarities to critical fluctuations in equilibrium despite differences in the length scale. By calculating the dynamics of CDW fluctuations in a nonperturbative model, we further show that the strength of the light-induced order is governed by the amplitude of equilibrium fluctuations. These findings highlight photoinduced fluctuations as an important ingredient for the emergence of transient orders out of equilibrium. Our results further suggest that materials with strong fluctuations in equilibrium are promising platforms to host hidden orders after laser excitation.},

Prior experiments suggest that the 4 d antiferromagnet Ca 2 RuO 4 embodies this notion, but a J = 0 nonmagnetic state as a basis of the excitonic picture remains to be confirmed. We use Ru L 3 -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal archetypal J multiplets with a J = 0 ground state in the cubic compound K 2 RuCl 6 , which are well described within the L S -coupling scheme. This result highlights the critical role of unquenched orbital moments in 4 d -electron compounds and calls for investigations of quantum criticality and excitonic magnetism on various crystal lattices.},

  abstract     = {Charge- 4 e superconductivity as a novel phase of matter remains elusive so far. Here, we show that charge-4e phase can arise as a vestigial order above the nematic superconducting transition temperature in time-reversal-invariant nematic superconductors. On the one hand, the nontrivial topological defect—nematic vortex—is energetically favored over the superconducting phase vortex when the nematic stiffness is less than the superfluid stiffness; consequently the charge- 4 e phase emerges by proliferation of nematic vortices upon increasing temperatures. On the other hand, the Ginzburg-Landau theory of the nematic superconductors has two distinct decoupling channels to either charge- 4 e orders or nematic orders; by analyzing the competition between the effective mass of the charge- 4 e order and the cubic potential of the nematic order, we find a sizable regime where the charge- 4 e order is favored. These two analyses consistently show that nematic superconductors can provide a promising route to realize charge- 4 e phases, which may apply to candidate nematic superconductors such as PbTaSe 2 and twisted bilayer graphene.},

We develop a method to compute the entanglement in spin- 1 / 2 impurity problems, based on the entanglement negativity and the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). Using the method, we study the thermal decay of the entanglement in the multichannel Kondo effects. At zero temperature, the entanglement has the maximal value independent of the number of the screening channels. At low temperature, the entanglement exhibits a power-law thermal decay. The power-law exponent equals two times of the scaling dimension of the BCFT boundary operator describing the impurity spin, and it is attributed to the energy-dependent scaling behavior of the entanglement in energy eigenstates. These agree with numerical renormalization group results, unveiling quantum coherence inside the Kondo screening length.},

  abstract     = {Grain boundaries (GBs) whose energy is larger than twice the energy of the solid-liquid interface exhibit the premelting phenomenon, for which an atomically thin liquid layer develops at temperatures slightly below the bulk melting temperature. Premelting can have a severe impact on the structural integrity of a polycrystalline material and on the mechanical high-temperature properties, also in the context of crack formation during the very last stages of solidification. The triple junction between a dry GB and the two solid-liquid interfaces of a liquid layer propagating along the GB cannot be defined from macroscopic continuum properties and surface tension equilibria in terms of Young’s law. We show how incorporating atomistic scale physics using a disjoining potential regularizes the state of the triple junction and yields an equilibrium with a well-defined microscopic contact angle. We support this finding by dynamical simulations using a multiphase field model with obstacle potential for both purely kinetic and diffusive conditions. Generally, our results should provide insights on the dynamics of GB phase transitions, of which the complex phenomena associated with liquid metal embrittlement are an example.},

Here, we demonstrate that the wavelike behavior of electrons plays an important role in solid HHG. By taking an analogy to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, an electron wave perspective on solid HHG is proposed by using the wavelet stationary-phase method. From this perspective, we have explained the deviation between the cutoff law predicted by the particlelike recollision model and the numerical simulation of semiconductor Bloch equations. Moreover, the emission times of HHG can be well predicted with our method involving the wave property of electrons. However, in contrast, the prediction with the particlelike recollision model shows obvious deviations compared to the semiconductor Bloch equations simulation. The wavelike properties of the electron motion can also be revealed by the HHG in a two-color field.},

Per fission event, in our simulations, the neutron and statistical γ -ray emissions change the spin of the fragment by 3.5 − 5 ℏ , with a large standard deviation comparable to the average value. Such wide angular momentum removal distributions can hide any underlying correlations in the fission fragment initial spin values. Within our model, we reproduce data on spin measurements from discrete transitions after neutron emissions, especially in the case of light FFs. The agreement further improves for the heavy fragments if one removes from the analysis the events that would produce isomeric states. Finally, we show that while in our model the initial FF spins do not follow a sawtoothlike behavior observed in recent measurements, the average FF spin computed after neutron and statistical γ emissions exhibits a shape that resembles a sawtooth. This suggests that the average FF spin measured after statistical emissions is not necessarily connected with the scission mechanism as previously implied.},

  abstract     = {Single-file diffusion refers to the motion in narrow channels of particles which cannot bypass each other, and leads to tracer subdiffusion. Most approaches to this celebrated many-body problem were restricted to the description of the tracer only. Here, we go beyond this standard description by introducing and providing analytical results for generalized correlation profiles (GCPs) in the frame of the tracer. In addition to controlling the statistical properties of the tracer, these quantities fully characterize the correlations between the tracer position and the bath particles density. Considering the hydrodynamic limit of the problem, we determine the scaling form of the GCPs with space and time, and unveil a nonmonotonic dependence with the distance to the tracer despite the absence of any asymmetry. Our analytical approach provides several exact results for the GCPs for paradigmatic models of single-file diffusion, such as Brownian particles with hardcore repulsion, the symmetric exclusion process and the random average process. The range of applicability of our approach is further illustrated by considering (i) extensions to general interactions between particles, (ii) the out-of-equilibrium situation of an initial step of density, and (iii) beyond the hydrodynamic limit, the GCPs at arbitrary time in the dense limit.},

Triggered by this conclusion, we investigate the 795.325 nm 3 H 6 ↔ H 3 4 transition of Tm : Y 3 Ga 5 O 12 (Tm:YGG). Most importantly, we find that the optical coherence time can reach 1.1 ms, and, using laser pulses, we demonstrate optical storage based on the atomic frequency comb protocol during up to 100 μ s as well as a memory decay time T m of 13.1 μ s . Possibilities of how to narrow the gap between the measured value of T m and its maximum of 275 μ s are discussed. In addition, we demonstrate multiplexed storage, including with feed-forward selection, shifting and filtering of spectral modes, as well as quantum state storage using members of nonclassical photon pairs. Our results show the potential of Tm:YGG for creating multiplexed quantum memories with long optical storage times, and open the path to repeater-based quantum networks with high entanglement distribution rates.},

While most experimental demonstrations of high-dimensional entanglement rely on fidelity-based witnesses, these are powerless to detect entanglement within a large class of entangled quantum states, the so-called unfaithful states. In this Letter, we introduce a highly flexible automated method to construct optimal tests for entanglement detection given a bipartite target state of arbitrary dimension, faithful or unfaithful, and a set of local measurement operators. By restricting the number or complexity of the considered measurement settings, our method outputs the most convenient protocol which can be implemented using a wide range of experimental techniques such as photons, superconducting qudits, cold atoms, or trapped ions. With an experimental quantum optics setup that can prepare and measure arbitrary high-dimensional mixed states, we implement some three-setting protocols generated by our method. These protocols allow us to experimentally certify two- and three-unfaithful entanglement in four-dimensional photonic states, some of which contain well above 50\% of noise.},

Recent experiments suggested that the mechanical stress associated with transcription-induced DNA supercoiling is responsible for the transition from cooperative to antagonistic group dynamics of RNA polymerases (RNAPs) upon promoter repression. To underpin the mechanism behind this drastic transition, we developed a continuum deterministic model for transcription under torsion. In our model, the speed of an RNAP is affected by the local DNA supercoiling, as well as two global factors: (i) the number of RNAPs on the gene affecting the torsional stress experienced by individual RNAPs and (ii) transcription factors blocking the diffusion of DNA supercoils. Our minimal model can successfully reproduce the experimental findings and helps elucidate the interplay of mechanical and biological factors in the collective dynamics of molecular machines involved in gene expression.},

The coefficients appearing in this equation can be expressed in terms of the packing fraction and of particle-level parameters. This constitutive equation rooted in the microscopic dynamic qualitatively reproduces a number of salient features of the rheology of jammed soft suspensions, including the presence of yield stresses for the shear component of the stress and for the normal stress difference. More complex protocols like the relaxation after a preshear are also considered, showing a smaller stress after relaxation for a stronger preshear.},

Here, we demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a vdW p − n junction between a WSe 2 layer and quasi-2D electron gas. After an optical illumination, the device stores the light-generated carriers for up to seven days, and then releases a very large photocurrent of 2.9 mA with bias voltage applied in darkness; this is referred to as chargeable photoconductivity (CPC), which completely differs from any previously observed photoelectric phenomenon. In normal photoconductivity, the recombination of electron-hole pairs occurs at the end of their lifetime; in contrast, infinite-lifetime photocarriers can be generated and stored in CPC devices without recombination. The photoelectric conversion and storage are completely self-excited during the charging process. The ratio between currents in full- and empty-photocarrier states below the critical temperature reaches as high as 10 9 , with an external quantum efficiency of 93.8\% during optical charging. A theoretical model developed to explain the mechanism of this effect is in good agreement with the experimental data.

Here, we show a continuous tuning of magnetic and electrical properties of a CrGeTe 3 single crystal using pressure.

  abstract     = {The study of the magnonic thermal Hall effect in magnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has recently drawn attention because of the underlying topology. Topological phase transitions may arise when there exist two or more distinct topological phases, and they are often revealed by a gap-closing phenomenon. In this work, we consider the magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian containing both an out-of-plane DMI and a Zeeman interaction. We demonstrate that the magnonic system exhibits temperature (or magnetic field) driven topological phase transitions due to magnon-magnon interactions. Specifically, when the temperature increases, the magnonic energy gap at Dirac points closes and reopens at a critical temperature, T c . By showing that the Chern numbers of the magnonic bands are distinct above and below T c , we confirm that the gap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the topological phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the thermal Hall conductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at T c , which can serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature. Our theory predicts that in CrI 3 such a phenomenon exists and is experimentally accessible.},

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional singular point that consists of two oppositely aligned emergent monopoles is identified in continuous CoTb thin films, as confirmed by complementary techniques of resonant elastic x-ray scattering, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy. This new type of topological defect can be regarded as a superposition of an emergent magnetic monopole and an antimonopole, around which the source and drain of the magnetic flux overlap in space. We experimentally prove that the observed spin twist seen in Lorentz transmission electron microscopy reveals the cross section of the superimposed three-dimensional structure, providing a straightforward strategy for the observation of magnetic singularities. Such a quasiparticle provides an excellent platform for studying the rich physics of emergent electromagnetism.},

In the superconducting state, an anticrossing gap opens between the outer- and inner-BQP bands, which we attribute primarily to interlayer single-particle hopping with possible contributions from interlayer Cooper pairing. We find that the d -wave superconducting gap of both BQP bands smoothly develops with momentum without an abrupt jump in contrast to a previous ARPES study. Hybridization between the BQPs also gradually increases in going from the off nodal to the antinodal region, which is explained by the momentum dependence of the interlayer single-particle hopping. As possible mechanisms for the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature, the hybridization between the BQPs as well as the combination of phonon modes of the triple CuO 2 layers and spin fluctuations represented by a four-well model are discussed.},

It is motivated by the adiabatic theorem and will approach the true ground state if the evolution time is long enough. We demonstrate that the AQMC algorithm enhances the average sign exponentially such that low enough temperatures can be accessed and ground-state properties probed. It is a controlled approximation that satisfies the variational theorem and provides an upper bound for the ground-state energy. We first benchmark the AQMC algorithm vis-à-vis the undoped Hubbard model on the square lattice which is known to be sign-problem-free within the conventional quantum Monte Carlo formalism. Next, we test the AQMC algorithm against the density-matrix-renormalization-group approach for the doped four-leg ladder Hubbard model and demonstrate its remarkable accuracy. As a nontrivial example, we apply our method to the Hubbard model at p = 1 / 8 doping for a 16 × 8 system and discuss its ground-state properties. We finally utilize our method and demonstrate the emergence of U ( 1 ) 2 ∼ S U ( 2 ) 1 topological order in a strongly correlated Chern insulator.},

Applications to graphene, silicene, phosphorene, boron nitride, and transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers reveal that two distinct contributions exist, respectively of purely electronic and lattice-mediated nature. Within the former, we identify a key metric term, consisting in the quadrupolar moment of the unperturbed charge density.

Our first-principles calculations and representation theory-based analyses show that rotations of anion coordinated octahedra, an archetypal example of zone-boundary phonon condensations, are induced by this bonding mechanism. The proposed mechanism is universal to any non-zone-center phonon condensations and could offer a general approach to understanding the origin of structural phase transitions in crystals.},

In amorphous solids, phonons are damped, and at low frequency D ( ω ) comprises extended modes in excess over Debye’s prediction, leading to the so-called boson peak in D ( ω ) / ω 2 at ω bp , and quasilocalized ones. Here we show that boson peak and phonon attenuation in the Rayleigh scattering regime are related, as suggested by correlated fluctuating elasticity theory, and that amorphous materials can be described as homogeneous isotropic elastic media punctuated by quasilocalized modes acting as elastic heterogeneities.

Here, we show by numerical simulations that the devitrification of quasi-hard-sphere glasses is prevented by suppressing volume-fraction inhomogeneities. A monodisperse glass known to devitrify with “avalanchelike” intermittent dynamics is subjected to small iterative adjustments to particle sizes to make the local volume fractions spatially uniform. We find that this entirely prevents structural relaxation and devitrification over aging time scales, even in the presence of crystallites. There is a dramatic homogenization in the number of load-bearing nearest neighbors each particle has, indicating that ultrastable glasses may be formed via “mechanical homogenization.” Our finding provides a physical principle for glass stabilization and opens a novel route to the formation of mechanically stabilized glasses.},

We also find that the strong electron-scale gradients close to the EDR exhibit significant oscillations at a similar frequency. Such oscillations are not expected for a crossing of a steady 2D EDR, and can be explained by a complex motion of the reconnection plane induced by current sheet kinking propagating in the out-of-reconnection-plane direction. Thus, all three spatial dimensions have to be taken into account to explain the observed perturbed EDR crossing. These results shed light on the interplay between magnetic reconnection and current sheet drift instabilities in electron-scale current sheets and highlight the need for adopting a 3D description of the EDR, going beyond the two-dimensional and steady-state conception of reconnection.},

While it was reported that these interactions can facilitate force-driven particle motion over energetic barriers, here we show the opposite effect in a flow-driven system, i.e., that hydrodynamic interactions hinder transport across barriers. We demonstrate this result by combining experiments and theory. In the experiments, we drive colloidal particles using rotating optical traps, thus creating a vortex flow in the corotating reference frame. We observe a jamminglike decrease of particle currents with density for large barriers between traps. The theoretical model shows that this jamming arises from hydrodynamic interactions between the particles. The impact of hydrodynamic interactions is reversed compared to force-driven motion, suggesting that our findings are a generic feature of flow-driven transport.},

  abstract     = {We report a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) formed by stacking identical layers of Chern insulators in a hybrid real-synthetic space. By introducing staggered interlayer hopping that respects mirror symmetry, the bulk bands possess an additional Z 2 topological invariant along the stacking dimension, which, together with the nontrivial Chern numbers, endows the system with a Z × Z 2 topology. A 4-tuple topological index characterizes the system’s bulk bands. Consequently, two distinct types of topological surface modes (TSMs) are found localized on different surfaces. Type-I TSMs are gapless and are protected by Chern numbers, whereas type-II gapped TSMs are protected by Z 2 bulk polarization in the stacking direction. Remarkably, each type-II TSM band is also topologically nontrivial, giving rise to second-order topological hinge modes (THMs). Both types of TSMs and the THMs are experimentally observed in an elastic metacrystal.},

However, the strict transition laws in crystals restrict the number of HHG channels. Quasicrystals with fractal band structures could solve this problem and produce multichannel HHG emissions, which has been rarely studied. We simulate the Fibonacci quasicrystal (FQ) HHG for the first time and investigate the electron dynamics on the attosecond timescale. Our results reveal that (i) the acceleration theorem is approximately applicable in FQ, which provides us a valuable tool to analyze the electron trajectories. (ii) Fractal bands lead to more excitation channels, analogous to the forbidden nonvertical electron transitions in crystals. (iii) The broken symmetry results in more frequent backscattering of electrons. (iv) Compared with crystals, multichannel HHG in FQ has a higher yield and wider spectral range. Our results pave the way to understand and control the HHG in quasicrystals and shed light on a potential shorter and stronger attosecond light source based on compact solids.},

Without disorder, a class of driven-dissipative cavity arrays displays directional amplification when associated with a nontrivial winding number of the NH dynamic matrix. In this work, we show analytically that the correspondence between NH topology and directional amplification holds also in the presence of disorder. We first show that a NH topological phase is preserved as long as the size of the point gap, i.e., the minimum distance of the disorderless complex spectrum from the origin, is larger than the maximum amount of disorder; the disorder is assumed to be bounded but otherwise general, i.e., complex and both local (on-site disorder) and nonlocal (disordered couplings). We then derive analytic bounds for the probability distribution of the scattering matrix elements, which show that the key features of nontrivial NH topology, namely, that the end-to-end forward (reverse) gain grows (is suppressed) exponentially with system size, are preserved in disordered systems. Our results prove that NH topology in cavity arrays is robust against disorder.},

After sequential multiphoton ionization, high charge states are obtained. For photon energies that are insufficient to directly ionize a 1 s electron, a different mechanism is required to obtain ionization to Ar 17 + . We propose this occurs through a two-color process where the second harmonic of the FEL pulse resonantly excites the system via a 1 s → 2 p transition followed by ionization by the fundamental FEL pulse, which is a type of x-ray resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI). This resonant phenomenon occurs not only for Ar 16 + , but also through lower charge states, where multiple ionization competes with decay lifetimes, making x-ray REMPI distinctive from conventional REMPI. With the aid of state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, we explain the effects of x-ray REMPI on the relevant ion yields and spectral profile.},

  abstract     = {When a diatomic molecule is exposed to intense light, the valence electron may tunnel from a higher potential (corresponding to an upfield atom) due to the suppressed internuclear barrier. This process is known as ionization enhancement and is a key mechanism in strong field ionization of molecules. Alternatively, the bound electron wave function can evolve adiabatically in the laser field, resulting in ionization from the downfield atom. Here, we introduce a method to quantify the relative contribution of these two processes. Applying this method to experimentally measured electron momenta distributions following strong field ionization of N 2 with infrared laser light, we find approximately a 2 ∶ 1 ratio of electrons ionized from a downfield atom, relative to upfield. This suggests that the bound state wave function largely adapts adiabatically to the changing laser field, although the nonadiabatic process of ionization enhancement still contributes even in neutral molecules. Our method can be applied to any diatomic neutral molecule to better understand the evolution of the initially bound electron wave packet and hence the nature of the molecular ionization process.},

The result reduces the relative uncertainty in this exceptionally long excited state lifetime by 1 order of magnitude with respect to previous experimental estimates. Our method is based on the coherent excitation of the corresponding transition and avoids limitations through competing decay processes. The explicit dependence on the laser intensity is eliminated by simultaneously measuring the resonant Rabi frequency and the induced quadratic Stark shift.

We demonstrate that effective field theories (EFTs) provide an efficient mechanism to separate the high energy dynamics that is easily calculated by traditional perturbation theory from the dynamics at low energy and show how quantum algorithms can be used to simulate the dynamics of the low energy EFT from first principles. As an explicit example we calculate the expectation values of vacuum-to-vacuum and vacuum-to-one-particle transitions in the presence of a time-ordered product of two Wilson lines in scalar field theory, an object closely related to those arising in EFTs of the standard model of particle physics.

Two disjoint regions of the latticized, massless scalar field vacuum are numerically demonstrated to become separable at distances beyond the negativity sphere, which extends to infinity in the continuum limit. The size of this quantum coherent volume is determined by the highest momentum mode supported in the identical regions, each of diameter d . More generally, effective field theories (EFTs), describing a system up to a given momentum scale Λ , are expected to share this feature—entanglement between regions of the vacuum depends upon the UV completion beyond a separation proportional to Λ . Through calculations extended to three dimensions, the magnitude of the negativity at which entanglement becomes sensitive to UV physics in an EFT (lattice or otherwise) is conjectured to scale as ∼ e − Λ d , independent of the number of spatial dimensions. It is concluded that two-region vacuum entanglement at increasing separations depends upon the structure of the theory at increasing momentum scales. This phenomenon may be manifest in perturbative QCD processes.},

During the confinement phase transition the heavy quarks are trapped inside isolated, contracting pockets of the deconfined phase, giving rise to a second stage of annihilation that dramatically suppresses the dark quark abundance. The surviving abundance is determined by the local accidental asymmetry in each pocket. The correct dark matter abundance is obtained for O ( 1 – 100 ) PeV dark quarks, above the usual unitarity bound.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement between photons at telecommunication wavelengths and long-lived quantum memories is one of the fundamental requirements of long-distance quantum communication. Quantum memories featuring on-demand readout and multimode operation are additional precious assets that will benefit the communication rate. In this Letter, we report the first demonstration of entanglement between a telecom photon and a collective spin excitation in a multimode solid-state quantum memory. Photon pairs are generated through widely nondegenerate parametric down-conversion, featuring energy-time entanglement between the telecom-wavelength idler and a visible signal photon. The latter is stored in a Pr 3 + : Y 2 SiO 5 crystal as a spin wave using the full atomic frequency comb scheme. We then recall the stored signal photon and analyze the entanglement using the Franson scheme. We measure conditional fidelities of 92(2)\% for excited-state storage, enough to violate a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, and 77(2)\% for spin-wave storage. Taking advantage of the on-demand readout from the spin state, we extend the entanglement storage in the quantum memory for up to 47.7 μ s , which could allow for the distribution of entanglement between quantum nodes separated by distances of up to 10 km.},

By loading the atoms in partially delocalized Wannier-Stark states, it is possible to cancel the undesirable inhomogeneities arising from the mismatch between the lattice and cavity fields and to generate spin squeezed states via a uniform one-axis twisting model. The quantum enhanced sensitivity of the states is combined with the subsequent application of a compound pulse sequence that allows us to separate atoms by several lattice sites. This, together with the capability to load small atomic clouds in the lattice at micrometric distances from a surface, make our setup ideal for sensing short-range forces. We show that for arrays of 10 4 atoms, our protocol can reduce the required averaging time by a factor of 10 compared to unentangled lattice-based interferometers after accounting for primary sources of decoherence.},

Both effects can be understood as arising from a global bifurcation in the underlying dynamical system at sufficiently strong coupling.

In this Letter, we introduce a model of facilitated diffusion for Cas9 and fit its parameters to single-molecule experiments. Our model confirms that Cas9 search for targets by sliding, but shows that its sliding length is rather short. We then investigate how Cas9 explores a long stretch of DNA containing randomly placed targets. We solve this problem by mapping it into the theory of Anderson localization in condensed matter physics. Our theoretical approach rationalizes experimental evidence on the distribution of Cas9 molecules along the DNA.},

However, its rationale hardly justifies rich biodiversity observed in nearly homogeneous environments. Here we consider a consumer-resource model in which a coarse-graining procedure accounts for a variety of ecological mechanisms and leads to effective spatial effects which favor species coexistence. Herein, we provide conditions for several species to live in an environment with very few resources. In fact, the model displays two different phases depending on whether the number of surviving species is larger or smaller than the number of resources. We obtain conditions whereby a species can successfully colonize a pool of coexisting species. Finally, we analytically compute the distribution of the population sizes of coexisting species. Numerical simulations as well as empirical distributions of population sizes support our analytical findings.},

In soft silicone gels, however, we observe that small-scale topographical features grow upon stretching. A quantitative analysis of the topography shows that this counterintuitive response is nearly linear, allowing us to tackle it through a small-strain analysis. We find that the surprising increase of small-scale topography with stretch is due to a delicate interplay of the bulk and surface responses to strain. Specifically, we find that surface tension changes as the material is deformed. This response is expected on general grounds for solid materials, but challenges the standard description of gel and elastomer surfaces.},

Yet generating highly polarized spin current at room temperature remains a fundamental challenge for antiferromagnets. We propose a spin circular photogalvanic effect (spin CPGE), in which circularly polarized light can produce a highly spin-polarized current at room temperature, through an “injection-current-like” mechanism in parity-time ( P T )-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators. We demonstrate this effect by first-principles simulations of bilayer CrI 3 and room-temperature-AFM hematite. The spin CPGE is significant, and the magnitude of spin photocurrent is comparable with the widely observed charge photocurrent in ferroelectric materials. Interestingly, this spin photocurrent is not sensitive to spin-orbit interactions, which were regarded as fundamental mechanisms for generating spin current. Given the fast response of light-matter interactions, large energy scale, and insensitivity to spin-orbit interactions, our work gives hope to realizing fast-dynamic and temperature-robust pure spin current in a wide range of P T -symmetric AFM materials, including topological axion insulators and weak-relativistic magnetic insulators.},

This USMR is apparently not caused by the mechanisms established in metallic bilayer, in which the ferromagnetic layer is required to be electrically conductive. From the magnetic field, current, temperature, and YIG thickness dependent measurements, the USMR is attributed to the asymmetric magnon creation and annihilation induced by the spin-orbit torque. This asymmetry and the resultant USMR are further revealed by the micromagnetic simulations combined with the spin-orbit torque and the spin drift-diffusion model.

In this Letter, we address the spatial symmetry and orbital structure of magnetic fluctuations in perovskite materials. To this aim, we develop a consistent multiorbital diagrammatic extension of dynamical mean-field theory, which we apply to an anisotropic three-orbital model of cubic t 2 g symmetry. We find that the form of spatial spin fluctuations is governed by the local Hund’s coupling. For small values of the coupling, magnetic fluctuations are anisotropic in orbital space, which reflects the symmetry of the considered t 2 g model. Large Hund’s coupling enhances collective spin excitations, which mixes orbital and spatial degrees of freedom, and magnetic fluctuations become orbitally isotropic. Remarkably, this effect can be seen only in two-particle quantities; single-particle observables remain anisotropic for any value of the Hund’s coupling. Importantly, we find that the orbital isotropy can be induced both at half filling and for the case of four electrons per lattice site, where the magnetic instability is associated with different, antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic, modes, respectively.},

We have studied the effect of temperature on a Bose polaron system performing ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations. This method is able to approach the critical temperature without losing accuracy, in contrast with perturbative approximations. We have calculated the polaron energy for the repulsive and attractive branches and we have observed an asymmetric behavior between the two branches. When the potential is repulsive, the polaron energy decreases when the temperature increases, and contrariwise for the attractive branch. Our results for the effective mass and the dynamical structure factor of the polaron show unambiguously that its quasiparticle nature disappears close to the critical temperature, in agreement with recent experimental findings. Finally, we have also estimated the fraction of bosons in the condensate as well as the superfluid fraction, and we have concluded that the impurity hinders the condensation of the rest of bosons.},

  abstract     = {He β spectral line shapes are important for diagnosing temperature and density in many dense plasmas. This work presents He β line shapes measured with high spectral resolution from solid-density plasmas with minimized gradients. The line shapes show hallmark features of Stark broadening, including quantifiable redshifts and double-peaked structure with a significant dip between the peaks; these features are compared to models through a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. Line shape theory using the dipole approximation can fit the width and peak separation of measured line shapes, but it cannot resolve an ambiguity between electron density n e and ion temperature T i , since both parameters influence the strength of quasistatic ion microfields. Here a line shape model employing a full Coulomb interaction for the electron broadening computes self-consistent line widths and redshifts through the monopole term; redshifts have different dependence on plasma parameters and thus resolve the n e − T i ambiguity. The measured line shapes indicate densities that are 80–100\% of solid, identifying a regime of highly ionized but well-tamped plasma. This analysis also provides the first strong evidence that dense ions and electrons are not in thermal equilibrium, despite equilibration times much shorter than the duration of x-ray emission; cooler ions may arise from nonclassical thermalization rates or anomalous energy transport. The experimental platform and diagnostic technique constitute a promising new approach for studying ion-electron equilibration in dense plasmas.},

Drops of the same liquid deposited on a hot concave surface coalesce practically at contact, but when drops of different liquids collide, they can bounce several times before finally coalescing when the one that evaporates faster reaches a size similar to its capillary length. The bouncing dynamics is produced because the drops are not only in Leidenfrost state with the substrate, they also experience Leidenfrost effect between them at the moment of collision. This happens due to their different boiling temperatures, and therefore, the hotter drop works as a hot surface for the drop with lower boiling point, producing three contact zones of Leidenfrost state simultaneously. We called this scenario the triple Leidenfrost effect.},

We show that with increasing the Rabi-coupling frequency Ω , the BMF energy density crosses over from the nonanalytic Lee-Huang-Yang scaling ∝ n 5 / 2 to an expansion in integer powers of density, where, in addition to a two-body BMF term ∝ n 2 Ω , there emerges a repulsive three-body contribution ∝ n 3 / Ω . We experimentally evidence these two contributions, thanks to their different scaling with Ω , in the expansion of a Rabi-coupled two-component K 39 condensate in a waveguide. By studying the expansion with and without Rabi coupling, we reveal an important feature relevant for observing BMF effects and associated phenomena in mixtures with spin-asymmetric losses: Rabi coupling helps preserve the spin composition and thus prevents the system from drifting away from the point of the vanishing mean field.},

The Bi 185 nucleus has now been studied with the Mo 95 ( Nb 93 , 3 n ) reaction in complementary experiments using the Fragment Mass Analyzer and Argonne Gas-Filled Analyzer at Argonne National Laboratory’s ATLAS facility. The experiments have established the existence of two states in Bi 185 ; the short-lived T 1 / 2 = 2.8 − 1.0 + 2.3 μ s , proton- and α -decaying ground state, and a 58 ( 2 ) − μ s γ -decaying isomer, the half-life of which was previously attributed to the ground state. The reassignment of the ground-state lifetime results in a proton-decay spectroscopic factor close to unity and represents the only known example of a ground-state proton decay to a daughter nucleus ( Pb 184 ) with a major shell closure. The data also demonstrate that the ordering of low- and high-spin states in Bi 185 is reversed relative to the heavier odd- A Bi isotopes, with the intruder-based 1 / 2 + configuration becoming the ground, similar to the lightest At nuclides.},

This method is applicable to dynamics of both open and closed quantum systems starting from arbitrary initial conditions. Our method identifies the Wigner characteristic of a reduced density matrix with the partition function of the whole system with a set of linear sources turned on only in the subsystem, and uses this to calculate the subsystem’s Renyi entropy. We use this method to study the evolution of Renyi entropy in a noninteracting open quantum system starting from an initial Fock state. We find a relation between the initial state and final density matrix which determines whether the entropy shows nonmonotonic behavior in time. For non-Markovian dynamics, we show that the entropy approaches its steady-state value as a power law with exponents governed by nonanalyticities of the bath. We illustrate that this field-theoretic method can be used to study large bosonic open quantum systems.},

Yet, this regime is not immediately accessible for experimental verification. Here, we present a general thermodynamic framework that handles the performance of PD-QTMs both before and during the limit-cycle stage of operation. It is achieved by observing that periodicity may break down at the ensemble average level, even in the limit-cycle phase. With this observation, and using conventional thermodynamic expressions for work and heat, we find that a complete description of the first law of thermodynamics for PD-QTMs requires a new contribution, which vanishes only in the limit-cycle phase under rather weak system-bath couplings. Significantly, this contribution is substantial at strong couplings even at limit cycle , thus largely affecting the behavior of the thermodynamic efficiency. We demonstrate our framework by simulating a quantum Otto engine building upon a driven resonant level model. Our results provide new insights towards a complete description of PD-QTMs, from turn-on to the limit-cycle stage and, particularly, shed light on the development of quantum thermodynamics at strong coupling.},

In this context, we develop a general framework to discuss the value of the available, nonideal magic resources, relative to those ideally required. We single out a quantity, the quantum-assisted robustness of magic (QROM), which measures the overhead of simulating the ideal resource with the nonideal ones through quasiprobability-based methods. This extends error mitigation techniques, originally developed for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, to the case where qubits are logically encoded. The QROM shows how the addition of noisy magic resources allows one to boost classical quasiprobability simulations of a quantum circuit and enables the construction of explicit protocols, interpolating between classical simulation and an ideal quantum computer.},

  abstract     = {The Eastin-Knill theorem states that no quantum error-correcting code can have a universal set of transversal gates. For Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes that can implement Clifford gates transversally, it suffices to provide one additional non-Clifford gate, such as the T gate, to achieve universality. Common methods to implement fault-tolerant T gates, e.g., magic state distillation, generate a significant hardware overhead that will likely prevent their practical usage in the near-term future. Recently, methods have been developed to mitigate the effect of noise in shallow quantum circuits that are not protected by error correction. Error mitigation methods require no additional hardware resources but suffer from a bad asymptotic scaling and apply only to a restricted class of quantum algorithms. In this Letter, we combine both approaches and show how to implement encoded Clifford + T circuits where Clifford gates are protected from noise by error correction while errors introduced by noisy encoded T gates are mitigated using the quasiprobability method. As a result, Clifford + T circuits with a number of T gates inversely proportional to the physical noise rate can be implemented on small error-corrected devices without magic state distillation. We argue that such circuits can be out of reach for state-of-the-art classical simulation algorithms.},

In superconducting circuits, tunable interactions are often implemented using flux-tunable qubits or coupling elements, adding control complexity and noise sources. Here, we realize a tunable Z Z interaction between two transmon qubits with fixed frequencies and fixed coupling, induced by driving both transmons off resonantly. We show tunable coupling over 1 order of magnitude larger than the static coupling, and change the sign of the interaction, enabling cancellation of the idle coupling. Further, this interaction is amenable to large quantum processors: the drive frequency can be flexibly chosen to avoid spurious transitions, and because both transmons are driven, it is resilient to microwave cross talk. We apply this interaction to implement a controlled phase (CZ) gate with a gate fidelity of 99.43(1)\% as measured by cycle benchmarking, and we find the fidelity is limited by incoherent errors.},

  abstract     = {A crucial subroutine for various quantum computing and communication algorithms is to efficiently extract different classical properties of quantum states. In a notable recent theoretical work by Huang, Kueng, and Preskill [ Nat. Phys. 16 , 1050 (2020) ], a thrifty scheme showed how to project the quantum state into classical shadows and simultaneously predict M different functions of a state with only O ( log 2 M ) measurements, independent of the system size and saturating the information-theoretical limit. Here, we experimentally explore the feasibility of the scheme in the realistic scenario with a finite number of measurements and noisy operations. We prepare a four-qubit GHZ state and show how to estimate expectation values of multiple observables and Hamiltonians. We compare the measurement strategies with uniform, biased, and derandomized classical shadows to conventional ones that sequentially measure each state function exploiting either importance sampling or observable grouping. We next demonstrate the estimation of nonlinear functions using classical shadows and analyze the entanglement of the prepared quantum state. Our experiment verifies the efficacy of exploiting (derandomized) classical shadows and sheds light on efficient quantum computing with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.},

Live imaging of MCCs in embryos of the frog Xenopus laevis shows that cilia bundles behave as active vortices that produce a flow field accurately represented by a local force applied to the fluid. A coarse-grained model that self-consistently couples bundles to the ambient flow reveals that hydrodynamic interactions between MCCs limit their rate of work so that they best shear the tissue at a finite but low area coverage, a result that mirrors findings for other sparse distributions such as cell receptors and leaf stomata.},

Given time series observations of intra-, inter-, or multicellular processes, a key challenge is to detect nonequilibrium behavior and quantify the rate of free energy consumption. Obtaining reliable bounds on energy consumption and entropy production directly from experimental data remains difficult in practice, as many degrees of freedom typically are hidden to the observer, so that the accessible coarse-grained dynamics may not obviously violate detailed balance. Here, we introduce a novel method for bounding the entropy production of physical and living systems which uses only the waiting time statistics of hidden Markov processes and, hence, can be directly applied to experimental data. By determining a universal limiting curve, we infer entropy production bounds from experimental data for gene regulatory networks, mammalian behavioral dynamics, and numerous other biological processes. Further considering the asymptotic limit of increasingly precise biological timers, we estimate the necessary entropic cost of heartbeat regulation in humans, dogs, and mice.},

This coexisting nematic and tetratic order is analyzed with the help of extensive Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of two-dimensional confining geometries as well as colloidal experiments, showing how the observed defect networks can be universally reconstructed from simple building blocks. We further find that the curvature of the confining wall determines the anchoring behavior of grain boundaries, such that the number of nodes in the emerging networks and the location of their end points can be tuned by changing the number and smoothness of corners, respectively.},

Here, we show that the zero-field states at odd integer filling factors in h -BN nonaligned devices are consistent with symmetry broken Chern insulators, as is evidenced by the observation of the anomalous Hall effect near moiré cell filling factor ν = + 1 . The corresponding Chern insulator has a Chern number C = ± 1 and a relatively high Curie temperature of T c ≈ 4.5 K . In a perpendicular magnetic field above B &gt; 0.5 T we observe a transition of the ν = + 1 Chern insulator from Chern number C = ± 1 to C = 3 , characterized by a quantized Hall plateau with R y x = h / 3 e 2 . These observations demonstrate that interaction-induced symmetry breaking leads to zero-field ground states that include almost degenerate and closely competing Chern insulators, and that states with larger Chern numbers couple most strongly to the B field. In addition, the device reveals strong superconducting phases with critical temperatures of up to T c ≈ 3.5 K . By providing the first demonstration of a system that allows gate-induced transitions between magnetic and superconducting phases, our observations mark a major milestone in the creation of a new generation of quantum electronics.},

Several theoretical models suggested that dopants can be understood as bound states of partons, the analogues of quarks in high-energy physics. However, direct signatures of spinon-chargon bound states are lacking, both in experiment and theory. Here we propose a rotational variant of angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) and calculate rotational spectra numerically using the density-matrix renormalization group. We identify long-lived rotational resonances for an individual dopant, which we interpret as a direct indicator of the microscopic structure of spinon-chargon bound states. Similar to Regge trajectories reflecting the quark structure of mesons, we establish a linear dependence of the rotational energy on the superexchange coupling. The rotational peaks we find are strongly suppressed in standard ARPES spectra, but we suggest a multiphoton extension of ARPES which allows us to access rotational spectra. Our findings suggest that multiphoton spectroscopy experiments should provide new insights into emergent universal features of strongly correlated electron systems.},

Recently, it was discovered that higher-order Weyl semimetals, as a novel class of higher-order topological phases, can uniquely exhibit coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. However, non-Hermitian higher-order topological semimetals have not yet been explored. Here, we identify a new type of topological semimetal, i.e., a higher-order topological semimetal with Weyl exceptional rings. In such a semimetal, these rings are characterized by both a spectral winding number and a Chern number. Moreover, the higher-order Weyl-exceptional-ring semimetal supports both surface and hinge Fermi-arc states, which are bounded by the projection of the Weyl exceptional rings onto the surface and hinge, respectively. Noticeably, the dissipative terms can cause the coupling of two exceptional rings with opposite topological charges, so as to induce topological phase transitions. Our studies open new avenues for exploring novel higher-order topological semimetals in non-Hermitian systems.},

Using a momentum microscope, we identified two distinct transitions along the Γ ¯ Y ¯ direction of the crystal. The first one is a so far unknown surface resonance of the (110) noble-metal surface, exhibiting an exceptionally large bulk character that has so far been elusive in surface sensitive experiments. The second one stems from the well-known bulklike Mahan cone oriented along the Γ L direction inside the crystal but projected onto the (110)-surface cut. The existence of the new state is confirmed by photocurrent calculations, and its character is analyzed.},

Here we extend the theorem in dynamical systems, which include the original Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem in the static limit. In contrast to the original theorem, which is a no-go theorem for bulk chiral fermions, the new theorem permits them due to bulk topology intrinsic to dynamical systems. The theorem is based on duality enabling a unified treatment of periodically driven systems and non-Hermitian ones. We also present the extended theorem for nonchiral gapless fermions protected by symmetry. Finally, as an application of our theorem and duality, we predict a new type of chiral magnetic effect—the non-Hermitian chiral magnetic skin effect.},

However, as fundamental excitations of metals, they are also quantum objects with internal structure. We demonstrate that this can induce an intrinsic dipole moment which is tied to the quantum geometry of the Hilbert space of plasmon states. This quantum geometric dipole offers a unique handle for manipulation of plasmon dynamics via density modulations and electric fields. As a concrete example, we demonstrate that scattering of plasmons with a nonvanishing quantum geometric dipole from impurities is nonreciprocal, skewing in different directions in a valley-dependent fashion. This internal structure can be used to control plasmon trajectories in two dimensional materials.},

It has implications across different fields from electrochemistry and energy storage to molecular biology. Three-dimensional AFM generates atomically resolved maps of solid-liquid interfaces. The imaging mechanism behind those maps is under debate, in particular, for concentrated ionic solutions. Theory predicts that the observed contrast should depend on the tip’s charged state. Here, by using neutrally, negatively, and positively charged tips, we demonstrate that the 3D maps depend on the tip’s polarization. A neutral tip will explore the total particle density distribution (water and ions) while a charged tip will reveal the charge density distribution. The experimental data reproduce the key findings of the theory.},

Under optimized conditions, energies per nucleon of the bulk carbon ions reached significantly higher values than the energies of contaminant protons ( 33 MeV / nucleon vs 18 MeV), unlike what is typically observed in laser-foil acceleration experiments. Experimental data, and supporting simulations, emphasize different dominant acceleration mechanisms for the two ion species and highlight an (intensity dependent) optimum thickness for radiation pressure acceleration; it is suggested that the preceding laser energy reaching the target before the main pulse arrives plays a key role in a preferential acceleration of the heavier ion species.},

We discuss a model system symmetric under time reversal based on the Navier-Stokes equations constrained to keep the enstrophy constant. It is demonstrated through highly resolved numerical experiments that the reversible model evolves to a stationary state which reproduces quite accurately all statistical observables relevant for the physics of turbulence extracted by direct numerical simulations (DNS) at different Reynolds numbers. The possibility of using reversible models to mimic turbulence dynamics is of practical importance for the coarse-grained version of Navier-Stokes equations, as used in large-eddy simulations. Furthermore, the reversible model appears mathematically simpler, since enstrophy is bounded to be constant for every Reynolds number. Finally, the theoretical interest in the context of statistical mechanics is briefly discussed.},

The sub- pT / Hz sensitivity is limited by spin projection noise (photon shot noise) at low (high) frequencies. Probe polarization squeezing both improves high-frequency sensitivity and increases measurement bandwidth, with no loss of sensitivity at any frequency, a direct demonstration of the evasion of measurement backaction noise. We provide a model for the quantum noise dynamics of the BB magnetometer, including spin projection noise, probe polarization noise, and measurement backaction effects. The theory shows how polarization squeezing reduces optical noise, while measurement backaction due to the accompanying ellipticity antisqueezing is shunted into the unmeasured spin component. The method is compatible with high-density and multipass techniques that reach extreme sensitivity.},

This problem has interesting applications in the context of dark matter, of dark energy physics, or of quantum field theory. The dynamics of fundamental fields has been studied mainly in static or stationary backgrounds, whereas most of our Universe is dynamic. In this Letter we investigate “blueshift” and parametric instabilities of scalar fields in dynamical backgrounds, which can be triggered (for instance) by oscillating stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. We discuss possible implications of our results, which include constraints on an otherwise hard-to-access parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.},

  abstract     = {Quantum coherence is a useful resource for increasing the speed and decreasing the irreversibility of quantum dynamics. Because of this feature, coherence is used to enhance the performance of various quantum information processing devices beyond the limitations set by classical mechanics. However, when we consider thermodynamic processes, such as energy conversion in nanoscale devices, it is still unclear whether coherence provides similar advantages. Here we establish a universal framework, clarifying how coherence affects the speed and irreversibility in thermodynamic processes described by the Lindblad master equation, and give general rules for when coherence enhances or reduces the performance of thermodynamic devices. Our results show that a proper use of coherence enhances the heat current without increasing dissipation; i.e., coherence can reduce friction. In particular, if the amount of coherence is large enough, this friction becomes virtually zero, realizing a superconducting-like “dissipation-less” heat current. Since our framework clarifies a general relation among coherence, energy flow, and dissipation, it can be applied to many branches of science from quantum information theory to biology. As an application to energy science, we construct a quantum heat engine cycle that exceeds the power-efficiency trade-off bound on classical engines and effectively attains the Carnot efficiency with finite power in fast cycles.},

As a consequence, the ratio between the fluctuations of the output and input currents are bounded both from above and below, where the lower (upper) bound is determined by the square of the averaged efficiency (square of the Carnot efficiency) of the engine. The saturation of the lower bound is achieved in the tight-coupling limit when the determinant of the Onsager response matrix vanishes. Our analysis can be applied to different operational regimes, including engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps. We illustrate our findings in two types of continuous engines: two-terminal coherent thermoelectric junctions and three-terminal quantum absorption refrigerators. Numerical simulations in the far-from-equilibrium regime suggest that these bounds apply more broadly, beyond linear response.},

The bound characterizes the state discrepancy induced by the nonunitary dynamics, and thus reflects the dissipative nature of irreversibility. Intriguingly, the bound can be evaluated solely in terms of the initial and final states and the system Hamiltonian, thereby providing a feasible way to estimate entropy production without prior knowledge of the underlying coupling structure.

When two such channels are used in a quantum superposition of two alternative orders, they become able to transmit some amount of classical information, but still no quantum information can pass through them. Here, we show that the ability to place N completely depolarizing channels in a superposition of N alternative causal orders enables a high-fidelity heralded transmission of quantum information with error vanishing as 1 / N . This phenomenon highlights a fundamental difference with the N = 2 case, where completely depolarizing channels are unable to transmit quantum data, even when placed in a superposition of causal orders. The ability to place quantum channels in a superposition of orders also leads to an increase of the classical communication capacity with N , which we rigorously prove by deriving an exact single-letter expression. Our results highlight the more complex patterns of correlations arising from multiple causal orders, which are similar to the more complex patterns of entanglement arising in multipartite quantum systems.},

We show that these interactions have a highly tunable anisotropy that is controlled by device design and external electric fields. This tunability enables sweet spots where the hyperfine noise is suppressed by an order of magnitude and is comparable to isotopically purified materials. We identify surprisingly simple designs where the qubits are highly coherent and are largely unaffected by both charge and hyperfine noise. We find that the large spin-orbit interaction typical of elongated quantum dots not only speeds up qubit operations, but also dramatically renormalizes the hyperfine noise, altering qualitatively the dynamics of driven qubits and enhancing the fidelity of qubit gates. Our findings serve as guidelines to design high performance qubits for scaling up quantum computers.},

In the case when the quantum Hamiltonian is quadratic in x and p , there are known optimal control techniques to drive the dynamics toward particular states, e.g., the ground state. However, for nonlinear Hamiltonian such control techniques often fail. We apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where an artificial neural agent explores and learns to control the quantum evolution of a highly nonlinear system (double well), driving the system toward the ground state with high fidelity. We consider a DRL strategy which is particularly motivated by experiment where the quantum system is continuously but weakly measured. This measurement is then fed back to the neural agent and used for training. We show that the DRL can effectively learn counterintuitive strategies to cool the system to a nearly pure “cat” state, which has a high overlap fidelity with the true ground state.},

To date, thermometry has relied on local estimation, which is useful to reduce statistical fluctuations once the temperature is very well known. In order to estimate temperatures in cases where few measurement data or no substantial prior knowledge are available, we build instead a method for global quantum thermometry. Based on scaling arguments, a mean logarithmic error is shown here to be the correct figure of merit for thermometry. Its full minimization provides an operational and optimal rule to postprocess measurements into a temperature reading, and it establishes a global precision limit. We apply these results to the simulated outcomes of measurements on a spin gas, finding that the local approach can lead to biased temperature estimates in cases where the global estimator converges to the true temperature. The global framework thus enables a reliable approach to data analysis in thermometry experiments.},

In parallel, self-excited dynamics is a prevalent characteristic of many systems, from the physics of shot noise and intermittent processes, to seismicity, financial and social systems. Motivated by activation processes of the Arrhenius form, we bring the two threads together by introducing a general class of nonlinear self-excited point processes with fast-accelerating intensities as a function of “tension.” Solving the corresponding master equations, we find that a wide class of such nonlinear Hawkes processes have the probability distribution functions of their intensities described by a power law on the condition that (i) the intensity is a fast-accelerating function of tension, (ii) the distribution of marks is two sided with nonpositive mean, and (iii) it has fast-decaying tails. In particular, Zipf’s scaling is obtained in the limit where the average mark is vanishing. This unearths a novel mechanism for power laws including Zipf’s law, providing a new understanding of their ubiquity.},

Among them, the combination t i j 0 r → i j , which couples to the spin current, remains finite in the centrosymmetric bonds, thus yielding finite P → in the case of noncollinear arrangement of spins. The form of the magnetoelectric coupling, which is controlled by r → i j , appears to be rich and is not limited to the phenomenological law P → ∼ ε i j × [ e i × e j ] with ε i j being the bond vector connecting the spins e i and e j . Using density-functional theory, we illustrate how the proposed mechanism works in the spiral magnets CuCl 2 , CuBr 2 , CuO, and α − Li 2 IrO 3 , providing a consistent explanation for the available experimental data.},

We demonstrate how absorption saturation can be engineered. In particular, we show that the saturation intensity increases linearly with the doping in the strong coupling regime, while it remains doping independent in weak coupling. Hence, countering intuition, the most suitable region to exploit low saturation intensities is not the ultrastrong coupling regime, but is instead at the onset of the strong light-matter coupling. We further derive explicit conditions for the emergence of bistability. This Letter sets the path toward, as yet, nonexistent ultrafast midinfrared semiconductor saturable absorption mirrors (SESAMs) and bistable systems. As an example, we show how to design a midinfrared SESAM with a 3 orders of magnitude reduction in saturation intensity, down to ≈ 5 kW cm − 2 .},

We find that long-range Néel antiferromagnetic order develops from the bulk crystal down to the bilayer, while it is absent in the monolayer. Before entering the long-range antiferromagnetic ordered phase in all samples, an upturn of the second harmonic generation below 200 K indicates the formation of the short-range order and magnetoelastic coupling. We also directly image the two antiphase (180°) antiferromagnetic domains and thermally induced domain switching down to bilayer. An anomalous mirror symmetry breaking shows up in samples thinner than ten layers for the temperature both above and below the Néel temperature, which indicates a structural change in few-layer samples. Minimal change of the second harmonic generation polar patterns in strain tuning experiments indicate that the symmetry crossover at ten layers is most likely an intrinsic property of MnPS 3 instead of an extrinsic origin of substrate-induced strain. Our results show that second harmonic generation microscopy is a direct tool for studying antiferromagnetic domains in atomically thin materials, and opens a new way to study two-dimensional antiferromagnets.},

Two kinds of superconducting gaps with multiple sets of coherent peaks and residual zero-energy density of states (DOS) are observed on both half-Cs and Sb surfaces, implying multiband superconductivity. In addition, in-gap states can be induced by magnetic impurities but not by nonmagnetic impurities, suggesting a sign-preserving or s -wave superconducting order parameter. Moreover, the interplay between charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity differs on various bands, resulting in different density-of-states distributions. Our results suggest that the superconducting gap is likely isotropic on the sections of Fermi surface that play little roles in CDW, and the superconducting gaps on the sections of Fermi surface with anisotropic CDW gaps are likely anisotropic as well. The residual spectral weights at zero energy are attributed to the extremely small superconducting gap on the tiny oval Fermi pockets. Our study provides critical clues for further understanding the superconductivity and its relation to CDW in CsV 3 Sb 5 .},

The proposed variational states are parameterized by the SU(2)-gauge rotation angles, as the SU(2)-gauge structure hidden in the Gutzwiller-projected mean-field Ansatz for the undoped model is broken upon doping. These variational doped states smoothly connect to the previously studied U(1) π -flux or 0-flux states, and energy minimization among them yields a chiral noncentrosymmetric nematic superconducting state with 2 × 2 -enlarged unit cell.

However, realizations in semimetals remain less explored. We ask, “Under what conditions do superconductor vortices in time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals—three-dimensional semimetals with only time-reversal symmetry—trap Majorana fermions on the surface?” If each constant- k z plane, where z is the vortex axis, contains equal numbers of Weyl nodes of each chirality, we predict a generically gapped vortex and derive a topological invariant ν = ± 1 in terms of the Fermi arc structure that signals the presence or absence of surface Majorana fermions. In contrast, if certain constant- k z planes contain a net chirality of Weyl nodes, the vortex is gapless. We analytically calculate ν within a perturbative scheme and provide numerical support with a lattice model. The criteria survive the presence of other bulk and surface bands and yield phase transitions between trivial, gapless, and topological vortices upon tilting the vortex. We propose Li ( Fe 0.91 Co 0.09 ) As and Fe 1 + y Se 0.45 Te 0.55 with broken inversion symmetry as candidates for realizing our proposals.},

The magnetic moments reside in the unpaired molecular orbital originating from interfacial charge transfers. We reported distinctive tunneling spectroscopic features of such a Kondo screened π electron impurity lattice on a superconductor in the regime of T K ≫ Δ , suggesting the formation of a two-dimensional bound states band. Moreover, moiré superlattices with tunable twist angle and the quantum confinement in the ultrathin Pb films provide easy and flexible implementations to tune the interplay between the Kondo physics and the superconductivity, which are rarely present in M / SC hybrid systems.},

Herein, we present the design of an all-dielectric platform to capture small dielectric nanoparticles without heating the nanostructure. It consists of a Si nanodisk engineered to exhibit the second-order anapole mode at the infrared regime ( λ = 980 nm ), where Si has negligible losses, with a slot at the center. A strong electromagnetic hot spot is created, thus allowing us to capture nanoparticles as small as 20 nm. The numerical calculations indicate that optical trapping in these all-dielectric nanostructures occurs without heating only in the infrared, since for visible wavelengths the heating levels are similar to those in plasmonic nanostructures.},

This implies in particular that threefold and fourfold symmetry-protected EPs are stable, respectively, in two and three dimensions. The stability of such multofold exceptional points (i.e., beyond the usual twofold EPs) is expressed in terms of the homotopy properties of a resultant vector that we introduce. Our framework also allows us to rephrase the previously proposed Z 2 index of PT and CP symmetric gapped phases beyond the realm of two-band models. We apply this general formalism to a frictional shallow water model that is found to exhibit threefold exceptional points associated with topological numbers ± 1 . For this model, we also show different non-Hermitian topological transitions associated with these exceptional points, such as their merging and a transition to a regime where propagation is forbidden, but can counterintuitively be recovered when friction is increased furthermore.},

  abstract     = {Exceptional points (EPs), at which both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, are ubiquitous and unique features of non-Hermitian systems. Second-order EPs are by far the most studied due to their abundance, requiring only the tuning of two real parameters, which is less than the three parameters needed to generically find ordinary Hermitian eigenvalue degeneracies. Higher-order EPs generically require more fine-tuning, and are thus assumed to play a much less prominent role. Here, however, we illuminate how physically relevant symmetries make higher-order EPs dramatically more abundant and conceptually richer. More saliently, third-order EPs generically require only two real tuning parameters in the presence of either a parity-time (PT) symmetry or a generalized chiral symmetry. Remarkably, we find that these different symmetries yield topologically distinct types of EPs. We illustrate our findings in simple models, and show how third-order EPs with a generic ∼ k 1 / 3 dispersion are protected by PT symmetry, while third-order EPs with a ∼ k 1 / 2 dispersion are protected by the chiral symmetry emerging in non-Hermitian Lieb lattice models. More generally, we identify stable, weak, and fragile aspects of symmetry-protected higher-order EPs, and tease out their concomitant phenomenology.},

  abstract     = {The traditional theory of magnetic moments for chiral phonons is based on the picture of the circular motion of the Born effective charge, typically yielding a small fractional value of the nuclear magneton. Here we investigate the adiabatic evolution of electronic states induced by the lattice vibration of a chiral phonon and obtain an electronic orbital magnetization in the form of a topological second Chern form. We find that the traditional theory needs to be refined by introducing a k resolved Born effective charge, and identify another contribution from the phonon-modified electronic energy together with the momentum-space Berry curvature. The second Chern form can diverge when there is a Yang’s monopole near the parameter space of interest as illustrated by considering a phonon at the Brillouin zone corner in a gapped graphene model. We also find large magnetic moments for the optical phonon in bulk topological materials where nontopological contribution is also important. Our results agree with recent observations in experiments.},

We reveal that the pressure-induced shift of optical transitions exhibits strong layer dependence. In sharp contrast to the bulk counterpart which undergoes a semiconductor to semimetal transition under ∼ 1.8 GPa , the band gap of 2 L increases with increasing pressure until beyond 2 GPa. Meanwhile, for a sample with a given layer number, the pressure-induced shift also differs for transitions with different indices. Through the tight-binding model in conjunction with a Morse potential for the interlayer coupling, this layer- and transition-index-dependent pressure effect can be fully accounted. Our study paves a way for versatile van der Waals engineering of two-dimensional BP.},

Unveiling the phase diagram of the noninterconverting binary mixture gives unprecedented insight on the phase behaviors accessible to the interconverting fluid, such as a liquid-liquid transition with a critical point, or a singularity-free scenario, exhibiting thermodynamic anomalies without polyamorphism.

In this Letter, we investigate the motion of a finite mass impurity injected into a three-dimensional quantum Bose fluid as it starts shedding Bogoliubov excitations. We uncover a transition in the dynamics as the impurity’s velocity crosses a critical value that depends on the strength of the interaction between the impurity and bosons as well as the impurity’s recoil energy. We find that in injection experiments, the two regimes differ not only in the character of the impurity velocity abatement but also exhibit qualitative differences in the Loschmidt echo, density ripples excited in the Bose-Einstein condensate, and momentum distribution of scattered bosonic particles. The transition is a manifestation of a dynamical quantum Cherenkov effect and should be experimentally observable with ultracold atoms using Ramsey interferometry, rf spectroscopy, absorption imaging, and time-of-flight imaging.},

Here, by directly measuring the dispersion of the collective excitations in a high-density optically trapped exciton-polariton condensate, we observe excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions for spinor polariton excitations.

As a consequence, both ions and electrons develop clear power-law energy spectra that contain a significant fraction of the released energy. The low-energy bounds are determined by the injection physics, while the high-energy cutoffs are limited only by the system size.

Modulation of the driver occurs via well-controlled linear processes, as confirmed by good agreement between particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and an analytic model.

In harmonic oscillators, the rate of generating squeezing is set by a quantum speed limit. Therefore, the degree to which a quantum advantage can be used in practice is limited by the time needed to create the state relative to the rate of unavoidable decoherence. Alternatively, a sudden change of harmonic oscillator’s frequency projects a ground state into a squeezed state which can circumvent the time constraint. Here, we create squeezed states of atomic motion by sudden changes of the harmonic oscillation frequency of atoms in an optical lattice. Building on this protocol, we demonstrate rapid quantum amplification of a displacement operator that could be used for detecting motion.

  abstract     = {The development of quantum technologies on nanophotonic platforms has seen momentous progress in the past decade. Despite that, a demonstration of time-frequency entanglement over a broad spectral width is still lacking. Here we present an efficient source of ultrabroadband entangled photon pairs on a periodically poled lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide. Employing dispersion engineering, we demonstrate a record-high 100 THz ( 1.2 μ m – 2 μ m ) generation bandwidth with a high efficiency of 13 GHz / mW and excellent noise performance with the coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 10 5 . We also measure strong time-frequency entanglement with over 98\% two-photon interference visibility.},

  abstract     = {We explore the possibility to overcome the standard quantum limit (SQL) in a free-fall atom interferometer using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in either of the two relevant cases of Bragg or Raman scattering light pulses. The generation of entanglement in the BEC is dramatically enhanced by amplifying the atom-atom interactions via the rapid action of an external trap, focusing the matter waves to significantly increase the atomic densities during a preparation stage—a technique we refer to as delta-kick squeezing (DKS). The action of a second DKS operation at the end of the interferometry sequence allows one to implement a nonlinear readout scheme, making the sub-SQL sensitivity highly robust against imperfect atom counting detection. We predict more than 30 dB of sensitivity gain beyond the SQL for the variance, assuming realistic parameters and 10 6 atoms .},

Here we experimentally realize the tristability in a three-mode cavity magnonic system with Kerr nonlinearity. The three stable states in the tristable region correspond to the stable solutions of the frequency shift of the cavity magnon polariton under specific driving conditions. We find that the system staying in which stable state depends on the history experienced by the system, and this state can be harnessed to store the history information. In our experiment, the memory time can reach as long as 5.11 s. Moreover, we demonstrate the ternary logic gate with good on-off characteristics using this multistable hybrid system. Our new findings pave a way towards cavity magnonics-based information storage and processing.},

Here, we demonstrate that the ultrafast electron tunneling ionization by an intense femtosecond laser pulse could induce an asymmetric transient charge localization in the valence shell of the HCl molecule during the dissociative ionization process. The transient charge localization is encoded in the laser impulse acquired by the outgoing ionic fragments, and the asymmetry is revealed by carefully examining the electron tunneling-site distinguished momentum angular distribution of the ejected H + fragments. Our work proposes a way to visualize the transient valence charge motion and will stimulate further investigations of the tunneling-site-sensitive ultrafast dynamics of molecules in strong laser fields.},

Before disintegrating into two ground state H atoms, the reaction is quenched by two-photon Doppler-free excitation to the F electronically excited state of H 2 . For J = 13 , 15, 17, 19, and 21, resonances with lifetimes in the range of nano- to milliseconds were observed with an accuracy of 30 MHz (1.4 mK). The experimental resonance positions are found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions when nonadiabatic and quantum electrodynamical corrections are included. This is the first time such effects are observed in collisions between neutral atoms. From the potential energy curve of the H 2 molecule, now tested at high accuracy over a wide range of internuclear separations, the s -wave scattering length for singlet H ( 1 s ) + H ( 1 s ) scattering is determined at a = 0.2735 31 39 a 0 .},

We then parameterize a global optical potential for each chiral force that depends smoothly on the projectile energy as well as the target nucleus mass number and isospin asymmetry. Uncertainty bands for elastic scattering observables are generated from a full covariance analysis of the parameters entering in the description of our global optical potential and benchmarked against existing experimental data for stable target nuclei. Since our approach is purely microscopic, we anticipate a similar quality of the model for nucleon scattering on unstable isotopes.},

If they are sufficiently long-lived, they lead to an early matter domination epoch, which enhances the primordial gravitational wave signal for modes that enter the horizon during this epoch. The sudden decay of the Q balls results in a rapid transition from matter to radiation domination, producing a sharp peak in the gravitational wave power spectrum. Avoiding the gravitino over-abundance problem favors scenarios where the peak frequency of the resonance is within the range of the Einstein telescope and/or DECIGO.

However, this does not imply that the M-theory metric has to obey the 11D NEC. Thus, we propose a new swampland conjecture —the 4D NEC is a consistency condition for any theory to have a completion within M theory—with an explicit derivation of it for cosmological backgrounds from a top-down perspective.

Our scenario applies to a broad range of the ALP mass m ϕ ≲ 10 − 28 eV , even smaller than the present Hubble constant. We give a simple model to realize this scenario, where dark matter is made of hidden monopoles, which give the ALP such a large effective mass through the Witten effect. The mechanism works if the ALP decay constant is of order of the grand unified theory scale without a fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle. For smaller decay constant, the hidden monopole can be a fraction of dark matter. We also study the implications for the QCD axion, and show that the domain wall problem can be solved by the effective mass.},

  abstract     = {It was recently pointed out that very energetic subclasses of supernovae (SNe), like hypernovae and superluminous SNe, might host ultrastrong magnetic fields in their core. Such fields may catalyze the production of feebly interacting particles, changing the predicted emission rates. Here we consider the case of axionlike particles (ALPs) and show that the predicted large scale magnetic fields in the core contribute significantly to the ALP production, via a coherent conversion of thermal photons. Using recent state-of-the-art supernova (SN) simulations, including magnetohydrodynamics, we find that, if ALPs have masses m a ∼ O ( 10 ) MeV , their emissivity in such rare but exciting conditions via magnetic conversions would be over 2 orders of magnitude larger than previously estimated. Moreover, the radiative decay of these massive ALPs would lead to a peculiar delay in the arrival times of the daughter photons. Therefore, high-statistics gamma-ray satellites can potentially discover MeV ALPs in an unprobed region of the parameter space and shed light on the magnetohydrodynamical nature of the SN explosion.},

We show that, following the appearance of the outer common horizon and subsequent interpenetration of the original horizons, they continue to exist for a finite period of time before they are individually annihilated by unstable marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs). The inner common horizon vanishes in a similar, though independent, way. This completes the understanding of the analog of the event horizon’s “pair of pants” diagram for the apparent horizon. Our result is facilitated by a new method for locating MOTSs based on a generalized shooting method. We also discuss the role played by the MOTS stability operator in discerning which among a multitude of MOTSs should be considered as black hole boundaries.},

This GBS is programmable by tuning the phase of the input squeezed states. The obtained samples are efficiently validated by inferring from computationally friendly subsystems, which rules out hypotheses including distinguishable photons and thermal states. We show that our GBS experiment passes a nonclassicality test based on inequality constraints, and we reveal nontrivial genuine high-order correlations in the GBS samples, which are evidence of robustness against possible classical simulation schemes.

Our protocol works rigorously with the arbitrary measurement strength, which offers improved accuracy and precision. The precision can be further improved by taking into account the completeness condition of the measurement operators, which also ensures the feasibility of our protocol for the characterization of the arbitrary quantum measurement.

  abstract     = {Recently, the possibility of inducing superconductivity for electrons in two-dimensional materials has been proposed via cavity-mediated pairing. The cavity-mediated electron-electron interactions are long range, which has two main effects: firstly, within the standard BCS-type pairing mediated by adiabatic photons, the superconducting critical temperature depends polynomially on the coupling strength, instead of the exponential dependence characterizing the phonon-mediated pairing; secondly, as we show here, the effect of photon fluctuations is significantly enhanced. These mediate novel non-BCS-type pairing processes, via nonadiabatic photons, which are not sensitive to the electron occupation but rather to the electron dispersion and lifetime at the Fermi surface. Therefore, while the leading temperature dependence of BCS pairing comes from the smoothening of the Fermi-Dirac distribution, the temperature dependence of the fluctuation-induced pairing comes from the electron lifetime. For realistic parameters, also including cavity loss, this results in a critical temperature which can be more than 1 order of magnitude larger than the BCS prediction.

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of A V 3 Sb 5 ( A = K , Rb , Cs ) has uncovered an intriguing arena for exotic Fermi surface instabilities in a kagome metal. Among them, superconductivity is found in the vicinity of multiple van Hove singularities, exhibiting indications of unconventional pairing. We show that the sublattice interference mechanism is central to understanding the formation of superconductivity in a kagome metal. Starting from an appropriately chosen minimal tight-binding model with multiple van Hove singularities close to the Fermi level for A V 3 Sb 5 , we provide a random phase approximation analysis of superconducting instabilities. Nonlocal Coulomb repulsion, the sublattice profile of the van Hove bands, and the interaction strength turn out to be the crucial parameters to determine the preferred pairing symmetry. Implications for potentially topological surface states are discussed, along with a proposal for additional measurements to pin down the nature of superconductivity in A V 3 Sb 5 .},

The latter yields an important correction to the spin diffusion and spin-charge conversion coefficients, and fully captures the so-called side-jump process without resorting to the Born approximation (which fails for resonant scattering), or to otherwise heuristic derivations. We apply our kinetic theory to a quantum impurity model with strong spin-orbit, which captures the most important features of Kondo-screened Cerium impurities in alloys such as Ce x La 1 − x Cu 6 . We find (1) a large zero-temperature spin-Hall conductivity that depends solely on the Fermi wave number and (2) a transverse spin diffusion mechanism that modifies the standard Fick’s diffusion law.

We present a viscometry technique that can, in principle, measure the multiple dissipative viscosities allowed in isotropic and anisotropic fluids alike. By applying representation theory to exploit the intrinsic symmetry of the fluid, our viscometry is also exceptionally robust to both boundary complications and ballistic effects. We present the technique via the illustrative example of dihedral symmetry, relevant in this context as the point symmetry of 2D crystals. Finally, we propose a present-day realizable experiment for detecting, in a metal, a novel hydrodynamic phenomenon: the presence of rotational dissipation in an otherwise isotropic fluid.},

Recently, second-order TIs have been attracting increasing attention, because they host topologically protected 1D hinge states in 3D or 0D corner states in 2D. A significantly critical issue is whether the second-order TIs also survive interactions, but it is still unexplored. We study the effects of weak Coulomb interactions on a 3D second-order TI, with the help of renormalization-group calculations. We find that the 3D second-order TIs are always unstable, suffering from two types of topological phase transitions. One is from second-order TI to TI, the other is to normal insulator. The first type is accompanied by emergent time-reversal and inversion symmetries and has a dynamical critical exponent κ = 1 . The second type does not have the emergent symmetries but has nonuniversal dynamical critical exponents κ &lt; 1 . Our results may inspire more inspections on the stability of higher-order topological states of matter and related novel quantum criticalities.},

In nonmagnetic materials with negligible spin-orbit coupling, the gray magnetic space groups together with SU(2) spin rotation symmetry can protect the two-dimensional eightfold degenerate fermions on a certain high-symmetry axis in the Brillouin zone, no matter whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. In antiferromagnetic materials, the eightfold degenerate fermions can also be protected by certain “spin space groups.” Furthermore, by first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that the paramagnetic phase of the monolayer LaB 8 on a suitable substrate is a two-dimensional eightfold degenerate as well as Dirac node-line semimetal. Especially, the eightfold degenerate points are close to the Fermi level, which makes monolayer LaB 8 a good platform to study the exotic physical properties of two-dimensional eightfold degenerate fermions.},

Bound states in the continuum (BICs) in photonic crystal slabs are demonstrated as vortex eigenpolarization singularities in momentum space and the circular polarization points ( C points) are also obtained based on BICs, opening up more possibilities for exotic light scattering and various topological phenomena of singular optics. Here, focusing on the nondegenerate bands, we report the generation to annihilation of two pairs of C points in momentum space in the photonic crystal slabs with inversion symmetry but broken up-down mirror symmetry. Interestingly, as the C points evolve with the structure parameter, we find two merging processes of C points, where an accidental at- Γ BIC and unidirectional radiative resonances with leaky channels of drastically different radiative lifetime emerge. The whole evolution is governed by the global charge conservation and the sum of topological charges equals to zero. Our findings suggest a novel recipe for dynamic generation and manipulation of various polarization singularities in momentum space and might shed new light to control the resonant and topological properties of light-matter interactions.},

Experiments on new fcc high entropy alloys present a paradox: these alloys absorb more H than Ni or SS304 (austenitic 304 stainless steel) while being more resistant to embrittlement. Here, a new theory of embrittlement in fcc metals is presented based on the role of H in driving an intrinsic ductile-to-brittle transition at a crack tip. The theory quantitatively predicts the H concentration at which a transition to embrittlement occurs in good agreement with experiments for SS304, SS316L, CoCrNi, CoNiV, CoCrFeNi, and CoCrFeMnNi. The theory rationalizes why CoNiV is the alloy most resistant to embrittlement and why SS316L is more resistant than the high entropy alloys CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi, which opens a path for the computationally guided discovery of new embrittlement-resistant alloys.},

Despite the success in explaining x-ray absorption data in the picosecond regime, the new femtosecond data are poorly understood through the traditional two-temperature model based on the fast thermalization concept and the static electronic structure for high-temperature metals. An improved understanding can be achieved by including the recombination dynamics of nonthermal electrons and changes in the screening of the excited d block. The population balance between the 4 s p and 3 d bands is mainly determined by the recombination rate of nonthermal electrons, and the underpopulated 3 d block is initially strongly downshifted and recovered in several hundreds of femtoseconds.},

The driver propagating at a subluminal group velocity excites the plasma wakefield with the same phase velocity. However, due to the positive density gradient, the wake phase velocity steadily increases behind the driver. As soon as the phase velocity becomes superluminal, the electrostatic wakefield couples efficiently to radiative electromagnetic modes. The period of time when the phase velocity stays above the speed of light depends on the density gradient scale length. The wake radiates at well-defined harmonics of the plasma frequency in the terahertz band. The angle of emission depends on the gradient scale and the time passed behind the driver. For appropriate plasma and driver parameters, the wake can radiate away nearly all its energy, which potentially results in an efficient, narrow-band, and tunable source of terahertz radiation.},

We show that after a short propagation distance, an asymmetric electron beam drives a stable wakefield in a hollow plasma channel that can be both accelerating and focusing for a positron beam. A high charge positron bunch placed at a suitable distance behind the drive bunch can beam-load or flatten the longitudinal wakefield and enhance the transverse focusing force, leading to high efficiency and narrow energy spread acceleration of the positrons. Three-dimensional quasistatic particle-in-cell simulations show that an over 30\% energy extraction efficiency from the wake to the positrons and a 1\% level energy spread can be simultaneously obtained.

  abstract     = {Noise and disorder are known, in certain circumstances and for certain systems, to improve the level of coherence over that of the noise-free system. Examples include cases in which disorder enhances response to periodic signals, and those where it suppresses chaotic behavior. We report a new type of disorder-enhancing mechanism, observed in a model that describes the dynamics of external cavity-coupled semiconductor laser arrays, where disorder of one type mitigates (and overcomes) the desynchronization effects due to a different disorder source. Here, we demonstrate stabilization of dynamical states due to frequency locking and subsequently frequency locking-induced phase locking. We have reduced the equations to a potential model that illustrates the mechanism behind the misalignment-induced frequency and phase synchronization.},

Stand-off magnetometry based on resonant scattering from atoms or molecules is often limited by the scarce amounts of detected light. The situation would be dramatically improved if the light emitted by excited atoms were to propagate towards the excitation light source in a directional manner. Here, we demonstrate that this is possible by means of mirrorless lasing. In a tabletop experiment, we detect free-precession signals of ground-state sodium spins under the influence of an external magnetic field by measuring backward-directed light. This method enables scalar magnetometry in the Earth field range, that can be extended to long-range remote sensing.},

Here, this is achieved by combining a homogeneous-field microstructured electric trap, rotational transitions with minimal Stark broadening at a“magic” offset electric field, and optoelectrical Sisyphus cooling of molecules to the low millikelvin temperature regime. We thereby reduce Stark broadening on the J = 5 ← 4 ( K = 3 ) transition of formaldehyde at 364 GHz to well below 1 kHz, observe Doppler-limited linewidths down to 3.8 kHz, and determine the magic-field line position with an uncertainty below 100 Hz.

The molecules are held for up to 50 ms in multiple electric traps of the decelerator. The trapped packets have a volume (FWHM) of 1 mm 3 and a velocity spread of 5 ( 1 ) m / s , which corresponds to a temperature of 60(20) mK. Our result demonstrates a factor 3 increase in the molecular mass that has been Stark decelerated and trapped.

In this Letter, we study the influence of nuclear excitations on Urca cooling (repeated back-and-forth β decay and electron capture in a pair of nuclear isotopes) in the crust and ocean of neutron stars. We provide for the first time an expression for Urca process neutrino luminosity which accounts for a thermal Boltzmann distribution of excited states in both members of an Urca pair. We use our new formula with state-of-the-art nuclear structure inputs to compute neutrino luminosities of candidate Urca cooling pairs. Our nuclear inputs consist of the latest experimental data supplemented with calculations using the projected shell model. We show that, in contrast to previous results that only consider the ground states of both nuclei in the pair, our calculated neutrino luminosities for different Urca pairs vary sensitively with the environment temperature and can be radically different from those obtained in the one-transition approximation. We find that nuclear excitations can lead to an enhancement in total Urca neutrino luminosities in the accreted neutron star crust by about 5 times as compared with the previous Urca results, which is expected to cause significant observational effects.},

The result is obtained from two-particle correlations of combined p − ϕ ⊕ p ¯ − ϕ pairs measured in high-multiplicity p p collisions at s = 13 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. The spin-averaged scattering length and effective range of the p − ϕ interaction are extracted from the fully corrected correlation function employing the Lednický-Lyuboshits approach. In particular, the imaginary part of the scattering length vanishes within uncertainties, indicating that inelastic processes do not play a prominent role for the p − ϕ interaction. These data demonstrate that the interaction is dominated by elastic p − ϕ scattering. Furthermore, an analysis employing phenomenological Gaussian- and Yukawa-type potentials is conducted. Under the assumption of the latter, the N − ϕ coupling constant is found to be g N − ϕ = 0.14 ± 0.03 ( stat ) ± 0.02 ( syst ) . This work provides valuable experimental input to accomplish a self-consistent description of the N − ϕ interaction, which is particularly relevant for the more fundamental studies on partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear medium.},

The integrand results are verified by all planar and nonplanar unitarity cuts, and they satisfy the minimal power counting of loop momenta and diagrammatic symmetries. Interestingly, these three-loop solutions, while manifesting all dual Jacobi relations, contain a large number of free parameters; in particular, there are 24 free parameters for the form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet. Such degrees of freedom are due to a new type of generalized gauge transformation associated with the operator insertion for form factors. We also perform numerical integration and obtain consistent full-color infrared divergences and the known planar remainder. The form factors we obtain can be understood as the N = 4 SYM counterparts of three-loop Higgs plus three-gluon amplitudes in QCD and are expected to provide the maximally transcendental parts of the latter.},

  abstract     = {We study the physical properties of four-dimensional, string-theoretical, horizonless “fuzzball” geometries by imaging their shadows. Their microstructure traps light rays straying near the would-be horizon on long-lived, highly redshifted chaotic orbits. In fuzzballs sufficiently near the scaling limit this creates a shadow much like that of a black hole, while avoiding the paradoxes associated with an event horizon. Observations of the shadow size and residual glow can potentially discriminate between fuzzballs away from the scaling limit and alternative models of black compact objects.},

  abstract     = {We report the observation of long-lived Floquet prethermal states in a bulk solid composed of dipolar-coupled C 13 nuclei in diamond at room temperature. For precessing nuclear spins prepared in an initial transverse state, we demonstrate pulsed spin-lock Floquet control that prevents their decay over multiple-minute-long periods. We observe Floquet prethermal lifetimes T 2 ′ ≈ 90.9 s , extended &gt; 60 000 -fold over the nuclear free induction decay times. The spins themselves are continuously interrogated for ∼ 10 min , corresponding to the application of ≈ 5.8 × 10 6 control pulses. The C 13 nuclei are optically hyperpolarized by lattice nitrogen vacancy centers; the combination of hyperpolarization and continuous spin readout yields significant signal-to-noise ratio in the measurements. This allows probing the Floquet thermalization dynamics with unprecedented clarity. We identify four characteristic regimes of the thermalization process, discerning short-time transient processes leading to the prethermal plateau and long-time system heating toward infinite temperature. This Letter points to new opportunities possible via Floquet control in networks of dilute, randomly distributed, low-sensitivity nuclei. In particular, the combination of minutes-long prethermal lifetimes and continuous spin interrogation opens avenues for quantum sensors constructed from hyperpolarized Floquet prethermal nuclei.},

  abstract     = {We propose a measure, which we call the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF), to characterize the spectral statistics of non-Hermitian (and nonunitary) matrices. We show that DSFF successfully diagnoses dissipative quantum chaos and reveals correlations between real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues up to arbitrary energy scale (and timescale). Specifically, we provide the exact solution of DSFF for the complex Ginibre ensemble (GinUE) and for a Poissonian random spectrum (Poisson) as minimal models of dissipative quantum chaotic and integrable systems, respectively. For dissipative quantum chaotic systems, we show that the DSFF exhibits an exact rotational symmetry in its complex time argument τ . Analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) behavior for Gaussian unitary ensemble, the DSFF for GinUE shows a “dip-ramp-plateau” behavior in | τ | : the DSFF initially decreases, increases at intermediate timescales, and saturates after a generalized Heisenberg time, which scales as the inverse mean level spacing. Remarkably, for large matrix size, the “ramp” of the DSFF for GinUE increases quadratically in | τ | , in contrast to the linear ramp in the SFF for Hermitian ensembles. For dissipative quantum integrable systems, we show that the DSFF takes a constant value, except for a region in complex time whose size and behavior depend on the eigenvalue density. Numerically, we verify the above claims and additionally show that the DSFF for real and quaternion real Ginibre ensembles coincides with the GinUE behavior, except for a region in the complex time plane of measure zero in the limit of large matrix size. As a physical example, we consider the quantum kicked top model with dissipation and show that it falls under the Ginibre universality class and Poisson as the “kick” is switched on or off. Lastly, we study spectral statistics of ensembles of random classical stochastic matrices or Markov chains and show that these models again fall under the Ginibre universality class.},

We simulate the protocol for the ground state of Fermi-Hubbard models in quasi-1D geometries, finding excellent agreement of the EH with Bisognano-Wichmann predictions.

It is particularly interesting to consider scenarios where sources within the network are statistically independent, which leads to so-called network nonlocality, even when parties perform fixed measurements. Here we promote certain parties to be trusted and introduce the notion of network steering and network local hidden state (NLHS) models within this paradigm of independent sources. In one direction, we show how the results from Bell nonlocality and quantum steering can be used to demonstrate network steering. We further show that it is a genuinely novel effect by exhibiting unsteerable states that nevertheless demonstrate network steering based upon entanglement swapping yielding a form of activation. On the other hand, we provide no-go results for network steering in a large class of scenarios by explicitly constructing NLHS models.},

  abstract     = {Many qubit implementations are afflicted by correlated noise not captured by standard theoretical tools that are based on Markov approximations. While independent gate operations are a key concept for quantum computing, it is actually not possible to fully describe noisy gates locally in time if noise is correlated on times longer than their duration. To address this issue, we develop a method based on the filter function formalism to perturbatively compute quantum processes in the presence of correlated classical noise. We derive a composition rule for the filter function of a sequence of gates in terms of those of the individual gates. The joint filter function allows us to efficiently compute the quantum process of the whole sequence. Moreover, we show that correlation terms arise which capture the effects of the concatenation and, thus, yield insight into the effect of noise correlations on gate sequences. Our generalization of the filter function formalism enables both qualitative and quantitative studies of algorithms and state-of-the-art tools widely used for the experimental verification of gate fidelities like randomized benchmarking, even in the presence of noise correlations.},

Here we study sequences of generalized (weak) measurements that steer a system in a closed trajectory. The readout process is marked by fluctuations, giving rise to dephasing. Rather than classifying the latter as “dynamical” and “geometrical,” we identify a contribution which is invariant under reversing the sequence ordering and, in analogy with geometrical dephasing, one which flips its sign upon the reversal of the winding direction, possibly resulting in partial suppression of dephasing (i.e., “coherency enhancement”). This dephasing asymmetry (under winding reversal) is a manifestation of intrinsic chirality, which weak measurements can (and generically do) possess. Furthermore, the dephasing diverges at certain protocol parameters, marking topological transitions in the measurement-induced phase factor.},

Besides this exponent, the resulting system presents two equilibria. The first originates from a balance between energy and entropy contributions. The second arises from the specific energy contribution through a local Potts-type interaction in combination with a long-range antiferromagnetic interaction without attenuation. Finite-size scaling analysis shows that, as a result of the second equilibrium, the critical transition balancing energy and entropy contributions at the Potts (local ferromagnetic) regime is absorbed by the transition driven by the global-antiferromagnetic interactions, as the system size increases. The phase transition balancing energy and entropy contributions at the global-antiferromagnetic regime also shows signs of criticality. Our study extends the Hamiltonian framework to a new domain of coupled human-environmental interactions.},

We use analytical calculations to describe the evolution of the morphology of the ribbon and the transitions between the different experimental regimes as a function of material properties, geometrical parameters, and stretching strain. This scale-independent phenomenon may help the manufacturing of tubular textured structures or easily controllable grippers at small scale.},

We show that the response of passive colloids to a fixed active colloid, be it attractive or repulsive, depends on the ionic strength, the ζ potential, and the size of the passive colloids. We further report that the direction of self-propulsion of Janus colloids can be reversed by decreasing their ζ potential below a critical value. By constructing an effective model that treats the colloid and ions as a whole subjected to the concentration field of generated ions and takes into account the joint effect of both generated and background ions in determining the Debye length, we demonstrate that the response of the passive colloids and the velocity of the Janus colloids can be quantitatively captured by this model under the ionic diffusiophoresis theory beyond the infinitely-thin-double-layer limit.},

The nature of motion and periodicity of the Barkhausen pulses leads to distinctive interactions between domains forming a herringbone pattern. Remarkably, the tips of the domains do not come into contact with the body of the perpendicular domain, suggesting the presence of strong electromechanical fields around the tips of the needle domains. Additionally, interactions of the domains with the lattice result in relatively free movement of the domain walls through the dielectric medium, indicating that their motion-related activation energy depends only on weak Peierls-like potentials. Control over the kinetics of ferroelastic domain wall motion can lead to novel nanoelectronic devices pertinent to computing and data storage applications.},

  abstract     = {Confinement is an ubiquitous phenomenon when matter couples to gauge fields, which manifests itself in a linear string potential between two static charges. Although gauge fields can be integrated out in one dimension, they can mediate nonlocal interactions which in turn influence the paradigmatic Luttinger liquid properties. However, when the charges become dynamical and their densities finite, understanding confinement becomes challenging. Here we show that confinement in 1D Z 2 lattice gauge theories, with dynamical matter fields and arbitrary densities, is related to translational symmetry breaking in a nonlocal basis. The exact transformation to this string-length basis leads us to an exact mapping of Luttinger parameters reminiscent of a Luther-Emery rescaling. We include the effects of local, but beyond contact, interactions between the matter particles, and show that confined mesons can form a Mott-insulating state when the deconfined charges cannot. While the transition to the Mott state cannot be detected in the Green’s function of the charges, we show that the metallic state is characterized by hidden off-diagonal quasi-long-range order. Our predictions provide new insights to the physics of confinement of dynamical charges, and can be experimentally addressed in Rydberg-dressed quantum gases in optical lattices.},

The DMI coupling mediated by Pt causes effective magnetic fields on either layer of up to 10–15 mT, which decrease monotonically with increasing Pt thickness. Ru, Ta, and Ti spacers mediate a significantly smaller coupling compared to Pt, highlighting the essential role of Pt in inducing the interlayer DMI.

However, robust superconductivity has been measured only in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-TBG) and magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MA-TTG). The absence of a superconducting phase in certain moiré flat bands raises a question on the superconducting mechanism. In this work, we investigate electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling in graphene moiré superlattices based on atomistic calculations. We show that electron-phonon coupling strength λ is dramatically different among graphene moiré flat bands. The total strength λ is very large ( λ &gt; 1 ) for MA-TBG and MA-TTG, both of which display robust superconductivity in experiments. However, λ is an order of magnitude smaller in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) and twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (TMBG) where superconductivity is reportedly rather weak or absent. We find that the Bernal-stacked layers in TDBG and TMBG induce sublattice polarization in the flat-band states, suppressing intersublattice electron-phonon matrix elements. We also obtain the nonadiabatic superconducting transition temperature T c that matches well with the experimental results. Our results clearly show a correlation between strong electron-phonon coupling and experimental observations of robust superconductivity.},

From tunneling spectra and their variation across the atomic lattice we establish that the helium can be reversibly ejected from the tunneling junction by the tunneling electrons. The energy of the tunneling electrons required to eject the helium depends on the relative spin polarization of the tip and sample, making the microscope sensitive to the magnetic exchange interactions.

The drag resistance is then dominated by Andreev-like scattering of charge carriers between layers at the grains that transfers momentum between layers.

Importantly, the results do not rely on any assumptions of the microscopic magnetic interactions such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Kitaev, or biquadratic interactions, and we obtain a model independent estimate of the gap between acoustic and optical magnons of 0.3 meV.

The tunability arises from a field-induced band inversion due to an opposite response of the conduction- and valence-band states to the electric field. With a spatially varying applied field, segments of GNRs of distinct topological phases are created, resulting in a field-programmable array of topological junction states, each may be occupied with charge or spin.

The method consistently identifies low-energy structures, which are likely to be the global minima of the energy. For the investigated systems with 23–66 atoms, the number of required energy and force calculations is in the range 3–75.},

Here, we report a time-domain interferometer that measures and distinguishes the pure and ensemble coherences of a free-electron beam in a transmission electron microscope via symmetry-breaking shifts of photon-order sideband peaks. This result is a free-electron analog to the reconstruction of attosecond busts and photoemission delays in optical attosecond spectroscopy. We find a substantial pure electron coherence that is connected to the thermodynamics of the emitter material and a lower ensemble coherence that is governed by space-charge effects.

While the magnitude of the spin signal is the indicator of the magnetic field strength created by the longitudinal electron current, the asymmetry of electron polarization is found to gauge the islandlike magnetic distribution which emerges due to the transverse current induced by the laser wave front. Our studies demonstrate that the spin degree of freedom of ejected electrons could potentially serve as an efficient tool to retrieve the features of strong plasma fields.},

Experiments found that unstable modulation growth is faster in an external magnetic field. This result was reproduced by a magnetohydrodynamic simulation based on a Braginskii model of electron thermal transport. An external magnetic field reduces the electron thermal conduction across the magnetic field lines because the Larmor radius of the thermal electrons in the field is much shorter than the temperature scale length. Thermal conduction suppression leads to spatially nonuniform pressure and reduced thermal ablative stabilization, which in turn increases the growth of ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability.},

By employing this phenomenon, referred to as saturable absorption, we successfully reduce the duration of x-ray free-electron laser pulses (photon energy: 9.000 keV, duration: 6–7 fs, fluence: 2.0 – 3.5 × 10 5 J / cm 2 ) by ∼ 35\% .

We show that above the localization-delocalization transition the threshold power for soliton excitation is drastically reduced relative to uniform media. Also, the geometry of the moiré pattern shifts the condition for phase matching between the waves to the value that matches the edges of the eigenmode bands, thereby shifting the properties of all soliton families. Moreover, the phase-mismatch bandwidth for soliton generation is dramatically broadened in the moiré patterns relative to latticeless structures.},

A spatially narrow defect at rest is used to excite sound waves in the fluid of light and measure the sound speed. The critical velocity for superfluidity is probed by looking at the threshold in the deposited energy by a moving defect, above which the apparent superfluid behavior breaks down. Our observations establish optical mesh lattices as a promising platform to study fluids of light in novel regimes of interdisciplinary interest, including non-Hermitian and/or topological physics.},

In this Letter, we consider the weak-coupling expansion of the dense QCD equation of state and compute the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order contribution arising from the non-Abelian interactions among long-wavelength, dynamically screened gluonic fields. Accounting for these interactions requires an all-loop resummation, which can be performed using hard-thermal-loop (HTL) kinematic approximations. Concretely, we perform a full two-loop computation using the HTL effective theory, valid for the long-wavelength, or soft, modes. We find that the soft sector is well behaved within cold quark matter, contrary to the case encountered at high temperatures, and find that the new contribution decreases the renormalization-scale dependence of the equation of state at high density.},

  abstract     = {Studying spin-momentum correlations in hadronic collisions offers a glimpse into a three-dimensional picture of proton structure. The transverse single-spin asymmetry for midrapidity isolated direct photons in p ↑ + p collisions at s = 200 GeV is measured with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Because direct photons in particular are produced from the hard scattering and do not interact via the strong force, this measurement is a clean probe of initial-state spin-momentum correlations inside the proton and is in particular sensitive to gluon interference effects within the proton. This is the first time direct photons have been used as a probe of spin-momentum correlations at RHIC. The uncertainties on the results are a 50-fold improvement with respect to those of the one prior measurement for the same observable, from the Fermilab E704 experiment. These results constrain gluon spin-momentum correlations in transversely polarized protons.},

Studies of this phenomenon have, so far, been restricted mainly to the study of the tachyonic instability and stationary scalarized black holes and neutron stars. To date, no realistic physical mechanism for the formation of isolated scalarized black holes and neutron stars has been proposed. We study, for the first time, the spherically symmetric fully nonlinear stellar core collapse to a black hole and a neutron star in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories allowing for a spontaneous scalarization. We show that the core collapse can produce scalarized black holes and scalarized neutron stars starting with a nonscalarized progenitor star. The possible paths to reach the end (non)scalarized state are quite rich leading to interesting possibilities for observational manifestations.},

Its standard training procedure appears, however, delicate and obscure in many respects. We bring some new insights to it by considering the situation where the data have low intrinsic dimension, offering the possibility of an exact treatment and revealing a fundamental failure of the standard training procedure. The reasons for this failure—like the occurrence of first-order phase transitions during training—are clarified thanks to a Coulomb interactions reformulation of the model. In addition, a convex relaxation of the original optimization problem is formulated, thereby resulting in a unique solution, obtained in precise numerical form on d = 1 , 2 study cases, while a constrained linear regression solution can be conjectured on the basis of an information theory argument.},

For a prototypical random recurrent network model with continuous-valued units, we show that the effective action is identical to the rate function and derive the latter using field theory. This rate function takes the form of a Kullback-Leibler divergence which enables data-driven inference of model parameters and calculation of fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. Lastly, we expose a regime with fluctuation-induced transitions between mean-field solutions.},

Standard epidemic models fail to capture the potential complexity of this scenario by (1) neglecting the higher-order structure of contacts that typically occur through environments like workplaces, restaurants, and households, and (2) assuming a linear relationship between the exposure to infected contacts and the risk of infection. Here, we leverage a hypergraph model to embrace the heterogeneity of environments and the heterogeneity of individual participation in these environments. We find that combining heterogeneous exposure with the concept of minimal infective dose induces a universal nonlinear relationship between infected contacts and infection risk. Under nonlinear infection kernels, conventional epidemic wisdom breaks down with the emergence of discontinuous transitions, superexponential spread, and hysteresis.},

The dense suspensions are comprised of sterically stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) colloids that are spherically symmetric and have varied surface roughness. Confocal rheometry and dissipative particle dynamics simulations show that the shear thickening strength β scales exponentially with the scaled deficit contact number and the scaled jamming distance. Rough colloids, which experience additional rotational constraints, require an average of 1.5–2 fewer particle contacts as compared to smooth colloids, in order to generate the same β . This is because the surface roughness enhances geometric friction in such a way that the rough colloids do not experience a large change in the free volume near the jamming point. The available free volume for colloids of different roughness is related to the deficiency from the maximum number of nearest neighbors at jamming under shear. Our results further suggest that the force per contact is different for particles with different morphologies.},

A common approach tracks fluctuations of micrometer-sized beads embedded in the medium to be characterized. This approach yields results that depend on probe size when the medium has structure on comparable length scales. Here, we introduce filament-based microrheology using high-aspect-ratio semiflexible filaments as probes. Such quasi-1D probes are much less invasive than beads due to their small cross sections. Moreover, by imaging transverse bending modes, we simultaneously determine the micromechanical response of the medium on multiple length scales corresponding to the mode wavelengths. We use semiflexible single-walled carbon nanotubes as probes that can be accurately and rapidly imaged based on their stable near-IR fluorescence. We find that the viscoelastic properties of sucrose, polyethylene oxide, and hyaluronic acid solutions measured in this way are in good agreement with those measured by conventional micro- and macrorheology.},

In this instability, there is thermally activated pair production of topological defects that generate localized regions of bending—kinks. These kinks shorten the bundle’s effective length, thereby reducing the elastic energy of the mechanically loaded structure. This effect is the thermal analog of the Schwinger effect, in which a sufficiently large electric field causes electron-positron pair production.

However, laser-driven currents carried by surface and bulk states can propagate in different directions in nonsymmorphic crystals, allowing for the two components to be easily separated. Motivated by a recent theoretical prediction G. Chang et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 124 , 166404 (2020) , we have measured the linear and circular photogalvanic effect currents deriving from the Fermi arcs of the nonsymmorphic, chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi over the 0.45–1.1 eV incident photon energy range. Our data are in good agreement with the predicted spectral shape of the circular photogalvanic effect as a function of photon energy, although the direction of the surface photocurrent departed from the theoretical expectation over the energy range studied. Surface currents arising from the linear photogalvanic effect were observed as well, with the unexpected result that only two of the six allowed tensor element were required to describe the measurements, suggesting an approximate emergent mirror symmetry inconsistent with the space group of the crystal.},

  abstract     = {Probing optical excitations with high resolution is important for understanding their dynamics and controlling their interaction with other photonic elements. This can be done using state-of-the-art electron microscopes, which provide the means to sample optical excitations with combined meV–sub-nm energy-space resolution. For reciprocal photonic systems, electrons traveling in opposite directions produce identical signals, while this symmetry is broken in nonreciprocal structures. Here, we theoretically investigate this phenomenon by analyzing electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence (CL) for structures consisting of magnetically biased InAs as an instance of gyrotropic nonreciprocal material. We find that the spectral features associated with excitations of InAs films depend on the electron propagation direction in both EELS and CL, and can be tuned by varying the applied magnetic field within a relatively modest subtesla regime. The magnetic field modifies the optical field distribution of the sampled resonances, and this in turn produces a direction-dependent coupling to the electron. The present results pave the way to the use of electron microscope spectroscopies to explore the near-field characteristics of nonreciprocal systems with high spatial resolution.},

Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we find that exciton decoherence occurs on a much faster timescale in MoSe 2 bilayers than that in the monolayers. We further identify two population relaxation channels in the bilayer, a coherent and an incoherent one. Our microscopic model reveals that phonon-emission processes facilitate scattering events from the K valley to other lower-energy Γ and Λ valleys in the bilayer. Our combined experimental and theoretical studies unequivocally establish different microscopic mechanisms that determine exciton quantum dynamics in TMDC monolayers and bilayers. Understanding exciton quantum dynamics provides critical guidance to the manipulation of spin-valley degrees of freedom in TMDC bilayers.},

The resulting resonance, taking place when the rf field frequency approaches the laser pulse repetition frequency, has a width determined by the spin coherence time T 2 that is free from the effects of inhomogeneity and slow nuclear spin fluctuations. We measure a 50-Hz-narrow electron spin resonance and milliseconds-long T 2 for electrons in the ground state of Ce 3 + ions in the yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lattice at low temperatures, while the inhomogeneous spin dephasing time T 2 * is only 25 ns.

  abstract     = {The combination of electride state and superconductivity within the same compound, e.g., [ Ca 24 Al 28 O 6 ] 4 + ( 4 e − ) , opens up a new category of conventional superconductors. However, neither the underlying causations to explain superconducting behaviors nor effects of interstitial quasiatoms (ISQs) on superconductivity remain unclear. Here we have designed an efficient and resource-saving method to identify superconducting electrides only by chemical compositions and bonding characteristics. A representative superconducting electride Li 6 C with a noteworthy T c of 10 K below 1 Mbar among the known binary electrides has been revealed. Our first-principles studies unveil that the anomalous s p -hybridized cage-state ISQs, as a guest in Li 6 C , exhibit unexpected ionic and covalent bonds, which act as a chemical precompression to lower dynamically stable pressure. More importantly, we uncover that, contrary to common expectations, the high T c is attributed to the strong electron-phonon coupling derived from the synergy of interatomic coupling effect, phonon softening caused by Fermi surface nesting, and phonon-coupled bands, which are mainly dominated by host s p -hybridized electrons, rather than the ISQs. Our present results elucidate a new superconducting mechanism of electrides and shed light on the way for seeking a high- T c superconductor at lower pressures in cage-state electrides.},

Here, we identify a large intrinsic Hall response that can be probed through the polar Kerr effect measurement as a convenient signature of the T -broken phase. Our modeling predicts the Kerr angle θ K to be in the range of 10 – 100 μ rad , which is a factor of 10 3 to 10 4 times larger than what is expected for the leading chiral superconductor candidate Sr 2 RuO 4 . In addition, we show that the optical Hall conductivity σ H ( ω ) can be used to distinguish between the topological d x 2 − y 2 ± i d x y phase and the d x 2 − y 2 ± i s phase, which is also expected to be present in the phase diagram but is topologically trivial.},

Lately, this avenue has found a growing interest in classical wave physics by using engineered artificial lattices. Here, we demonstrate an acoustic 3D honeycomb lattice that features a Dirac hierarchy comprising an eightfold bulk Dirac cone, a 2D fourfold surface state Dirac cone, and a 1D twofold hinge state Dirac cone. The lifting of the Dirac degeneracy in each hierarchy authorizes the 3D lattice to appear as a first-order TI with 2D topological surface states, a second-order TI exhibiting 1D hinge states, and a third-order TI of 0D midgap corner states. Analytically we discuss the topological origin of the surface, hinge, and corner states, which are all characterized by out-of-plane and in-plane winding numbers. Our study offers new routes to control sound and vibration for acoustic steering and guiding, on-chip ultrasonic energy concentration, and filtering to name a few.},

In this Letter, we describe a universal binding energy of scrolls determined solely by their material parameters, the bending stiffness, and the Hamaker coefficient. Aiming to predict the stability of functionalized scrolls in water solutions, we consider the electrostatic double-layer repulsion force that may overcome the binding energy and flatten the scrolls. Our predictions are represented as comprehensive maps indicating the stable and unstable regions of a rolled-up conformation state in the space of material and external parameters. While focusing mostly on functionalized graphene in this work, our approach is applicable to the whole range of 2D materials able to form scrolls.},

It was, however, recently argued that including three-body (or even four-body) features is incomplete to distinguish specific local structures. Utilizing an embedded density descriptor made by linear combinations of neighboring atomic orbitals and realizing that each orbital coefficient physically depends on its own local environment, we propose a recursively embedded atom neural network model. We formally prove that this model can efficiently incorporate complete many-body correlations without explicitly computing high-order terms. This model not only successfully addresses challenges regarding local completeness and nonlocality in representative systems, but also provides an easy and general way to update local many-body descriptors to have a message-passing form without changing their basic structures.},

In small-scale turbulence, magnetic structures associated with intense current sheets are limited in all dimensions. And since the coupling of ions are constrained by a minimum length scale, the dynamics of electron reconnection is likely to be 3D. Here, both 2D and 3D kinetic particle-in-cell simulations are used to investigate electron-only reconnection, focusing on the reconnection rate and associated electron flows. A new form of 3D electron-only reconnection spontaneously develops where the magnetic X-line is localized in the out-of-plane ( z ) direction. The consequence is an enhancement of the reconnection rate compared with two dimensions, which results from differential mass flux out of the diffusion region along z , enabling a faster inflow velocity and thus a larger reconnection rate. This outflow along z is due to the magnetic tension force in z just as the conventional exhaust tension force, allowing particles to leave the diffusion region efficiently along z unlike the 2D configuration.},

Experimental observations of particle dynamics are sparse given the difficulty of generating high-velocity flows of many particles. Ejecta microjets are micron-scale jets formed by strong shocks interacting with imprinted surfaces to generate particle plumes traveling at several kilometers per second. As such, the interaction of two ejecta microjets provides a novel experimental methodology to study interacting particle streams. In this Letter, we report the first time sequences of x-ray radiography images of two interacting tin ejecta microjets taken on a platform designed for the OMEGA Extended Performance (OMEGA EP) laser. We observe that the microjets pass through each other unattenuated for the case of 11.7 ± 3.2 GPa shock pressures and jet velocities of 2.2 ± 0.5 km / s but show strong interaction dynamics for 116.0 ± 6.1 GPa shock pressures and jet velocities of 6.5 ± 0.5 km / s . We find that radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the experiments are able to capture many aspects of the collisional behavior, such as the attenuation of jet velocity in the direction of propagation, but are unable to match the full spread of the strongly interacting cloud.},

The large scale organization of a dune field is believed to be controlled by pairwise (either remote or direct) dune-dune interactions. Recent studies have shown that remote long-range feedback is closely related to the turbulent wake structure forming downstream of a dune. Here, we study the stability of an idealized two-dune system arising as a consequence of such remote, wake-induced interactions. The system is realized in a subaqueous quasi-2D laboratory experiment and the results are compared with a qualitative dynamical systems model. Despite its simplicity, the system exhibits rich dynamical behavior. In particular, we show that, depending on the parameter regime, the dune-dune feedback can either stabilize or destabilize the symmetric dune configuration, and we demonstrate the existence of an asymmetric attracting state coupling dunes of different sizes.},

By exploiting the peculiar sensitivity to polarization of EENZ materials, we achieve superior control over the spatial coherence of the emitted laser light, which can be switched at will between nearly incoherent and fully coherent, solely by means of polarization optics. Our EENZ cavity design is expected to be an efficient, compact, reconfigurable, and easily scalable source of light for illumination and speckle contrast imaging, as well as any other application that benefits from controlled spatial coherence.},

  abstract     = {Boosting second-order optical nonlinear frequency conversion over subwavelength thickness has long been pursued through optical resonance in micro- and nanophotonics. However, the availability of thin film materials with high second-order nonlinearity is limited to III-V semiconductors, which have low transparency in the visible. Here, we experimentally demonstrated strongly enhanced second harmonic generation in one-dimensional heterostructure cavities on thin film lithium niobate. A guided-mode resonance resonator and distributed Bragg reflectors are combined for both efficient coupling and electromagnetic field localization. Over 1200 times second harmonic generation enhancement is experimentally realized compared with flat thin film lithium niobate through optimizing the trade-off between quality factor and mode volume, leading to a record high normalized conversion efficiency of 2.0 3 × 10 − 5 cm 2 / GW under 1.92 MW / cm 2 pump intensity. Our approach could inspire the miniaturization and integration of compact resonant nonlinear photonic devices on thin film lithium niobate.},

  abstract     = {One of the main neutron sources for the astrophysical s process is the reaction C 13 ( α , n ) O 16 , taking place in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars at temperatures around 90 MK. To model the nucleosynthesis during this process the reaction cross section needs to be known in the 150–230 keV energy window (Gamow peak). At these sub-Coulomb energies, cross section direct measurements are severely affected by the low event rate, making us rely on input from indirect methods and extrapolations from higher-energy direct data. This leads to an uncertainty in the cross section at the relevant energies too high to reliably constrain the nuclear physics input to s -process calculations. We present the results from a new deep-underground measurement of C 13 ( α , n ) O 16 , covering the energy range 230–300 keV, with drastically reduced uncertainties over previous measurements and for the first time providing data directly inside the s -process Gamow peak. Selected stellar models have been computed to estimate the impact of our revised reaction rate. For stars of nearly solar composition, we find sizeable variations of some isotopes, whose production is influenced by the activation of close-by branching points that are sensitive to the neutron density, in particular, the two radioactive nuclei Fe 60 and Pb 205 , as well as Gd 152 .},

In this case spatially modulated regimes with a “moat” spectrum can arise, where the minimum of the energy is over a sphere at nonzero momentum. We show that if the matter created in heavy-ion collisions freezes out in such a regime, particle numbers and their correlations peak at nonzero, instead of zero, momentum. This effect is much more dramatic for multiparticle correlations than for single-particle spectra. Our results can serve as a first guideline for a systematic search of spatially modulated phases in heavy-ion collisions.},

By comparing theory predictions with collider data, one can directly test perturbative QCD, extract fundamental parameters like the strong coupling α s , and search for physics beyond the standard model. In this work we calculate, for the first time, the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to typical three-jet observables and to differential three-to-two jet ratios. The calculation is complete apart from the three-jet double virtual contributions which are included in the leading-color approximation. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the NNLO corrections significantly reduces the dependence of those observables on the factorization and renormalization scales. Besides its phenomenological value, this proof-of-principle computation represents a milestone in perturbative QCD.},

Our formalism applies for several common benchmark models, including spin-independent interactions through scalar and vector mediators of arbitrary mass. We discuss the consequences for standard semiconductor and superconductor targets and find that the true reach of superconductor detectors for light mediators exceeds previous estimates by several orders of magnitude, with further enhancements possible due to the low-energy tail of the plasmon. Using a heavy-fermion superconductor as an example, we show how our formulation allows a rapid and systematic investigation of novel electron scattering targets.},

Relying on a simple geometrical analysis based on conic hulls, we show here a solution to this important problem. Our method can be applied to resonant (i.e., logarithmic) and nonresonant cases and, depending on the form of the MB integrand, it gives rise to convergent series representations or diverging asymptotic ones. When convergent series are obtained, the method also allows, in general, the determination of a single “master series” for each series representation, which considerably simplifies convergence studies and/or numerical checks. We provide, along with this Letter, a Mathematica implementation of our technique with examples of applications. Among them, we present the first evaluation of the hexagon and double box conformal Feynman integrals with unit propagator powers.},

  abstract     = {We present a search for gravitational waves from the coalescence of subsolar-mass black hole binaries using data from the first half of Advanced LIGO and Virgo’s third observing run. The observation of a subsolar-mass black hole merger may be an indication of primordial origin; primordial black holes may contribute to the dark matter distribution. We search for black hole mergers where the primary mass is 0.1 – 7 M ⊙ and the secondary mass is 0.1 – 1 M ⊙ . A variety of models predict the production and coalescence of binaries containing primordial black holes; some involve dynamical assembly, which may allow for residual eccentricity to be observed. For component masses &gt; 0.5 M ⊙ , we also search for sources in eccentric orbits, measured at a reference gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz, up to e 10 ∼ 0.3 . We find no convincing candidates and place new upper limits on the rate of primordial black hole mergers. The merger rate of 0.5–0.5 ( 1.0 – 1.0 ) M ⊙ sources is &lt; 7100 ( 1200 ) Gpc − 3 yr − 1 . Our limits are ∼ 3 – 4 times more constraining than prior analyses. Finally, we demonstrate how our limits can be used to constrain arbitrary models of the primordial black hole mass distribution and merger rate.},

We then show how, under an appropriate scaling, mixing passive steps with active ones leads to a well-defined continuous-time limit that however differs from standard active dynamics. Finally, we propose new KMC algorithms whose continuous-time limits lead to the dynamics of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, active Brownian, and run-and-tumble particles.},

  abstract     = {Quantum many-body scars have been put forward as counterexamples to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. These atypical states are observed in a range of correlated models as long-lived oscillations of local observables in quench experiments starting from selected initial states. The long-time memory is a manifestation of quantum nonergodicity generally linked to a subextensive generation of entanglement entropy, the latter of which is widely used as a diagnostic for identifying quantum many-body scars numerically as low entanglement outliers. Here we show that by adding kinetic constraints to a fractionalized orthogonal metal, we can construct a minimal model with orthogonal quantum many-body scars leading to persistent oscillations with infinite lifetime coexisting with rapid volume-law entanglement generation. Our example provides new insights into the link between quantum ergodicity and many-body entanglement while opening new avenues for exotic nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly correlated multicomponent quantum systems.},

Therefore, the question emerges as to which observables are best suited to study the dynamics in such quantum many-body systems. Using machine learning techniques, we investigate the dynamics and, in particular, the thermalization behavior of an interacting quantum system that undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition from an ergodic to a many-body localized phase. We employ supervised and unsupervised training methods to distinguish nonequilibrium from equilibrium data, using the network performance as a probe for the thermalization behavior of the system. We test our methods with experimental snapshots of ultracold atoms taken with a quantum gas microscope. Our results provide a path to analyze highly entangled large-scale quantum states for system sizes where numerical calculations of conventional observables become challenging.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement of pure states is usually quantified via the entanglement entropy, the von Neumann entropy of the reduced state. Entanglement entropy is closely related to entanglement distillation, a process for converting quantum states into singlets, which can then be used for various quantum technological tasks. The relation between entanglement entropy and entanglement distillation has been known only for the asymptotic setting, and the meaning of entanglement entropy in the single-copy regime has so far remained open. Here we close this gap by considering entanglement catalysis. We prove that entanglement entropy completely characterizes state transformations in the presence of entangled catalysts. Our results imply that entanglement entropy quantifies the amount of entanglement available in a bipartite pure state to be used for quantum information processing, giving asymptotic results an operational meaning also in the single-copy setup.},

  abstract     = {Protocols for discriminating between a pair of channels or for estimating a channel parameter can often be aided by adaptivity or by entanglement between the probe states. This can make it difficult to bound the best possible performance for such protocols. In this Letter, we introduce a quantity that we call the relative fidelity of a given pair of channels and a pair of input states to those channels. Constraining the allowed input states to all pairs of states whose fidelity is greater than some minimum “input fidelity” and minimizing this quantity over the valid pairs of states, we get the minimum relative fidelity for that input fidelity constraint. We are then able to lower bound the fidelity between the possible output states of any protocol acting on one of two possible channels in terms of the minimum relative fidelity. This allows us to bound the performance of the most general, adaptive discrimination and parameter estimation protocols. By finding a continuity bound for the relative fidelity, we also provide a simple confirmation that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the output of an N -use protocol is no more than N 2 times the one-shot QFI.},

  abstract     = {Counter-diabatic driving (CD) is a technique in quantum control theory designed to counteract nonadiabatic excitations and guide the system to follow its instantaneous energy eigenstates, and hence has applications in state preparation, quantum annealing, and quantum thermodynamics. However, in many practical situations, the effect of the environment cannot be neglected, and the performance of the CD is expected to degrade. To arrive at general bounds on the resulting error of CD in this situation we consider a driven spin-boson model as a prototypical setup. The inequalities we obtain, in terms of either the Bures angle or the fidelity, allow us to estimate the maximum error solely characterized by the parameters of the system and the bath. By utilizing the analytical form of the upper bound, we demonstrate that the error can be systematically reduced through optimization of the external driving protocol of the system. We also show that if we allow a time-dependent system-bath coupling angle, the obtained bound can be saturated and realizes unit fidelity.},

Such a shear-induced transition is often associated with a nonmonotonic stress response in the form of a stress maximum referred to as “stress overshoot.” This ubiquitous phenomenon is characterized by the coordinates of the maximum in terms of stress σ M and strain γ M that both increase as weak power laws of the applied shear rate. Here we rationalize such power-law scalings using a continuum model that predicts two different regimes in the limit of low and high applied shear rates. The corresponding exponents are directly linked to the steady-state rheology and are both associated with the nucleation and growth dynamics of a fluidized region. Our work offers a consistent framework for predicting the transient response of soft glassy materials upon startup of shear from the local flow behavior to the global rheological observables.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrate that, for vibrated granular media, such a transition genuinely exists, and we characterize it as a function of the outlet size and vibration intensity. We confirm the suitability of the “flowing parameter” as the order parameter, and we find out that the rescaled maximum acceleration of the system should be replaced as the control parameter by a dimensionless velocity that can be seen as the square root of the ratio between kinetic and potential energy. In all the investigated scenarios, we observe that, for a critical value of this control parameter S c , there seems to be a continuous transition to an unclogged state. The data can be rescaled with this critical value, which, as expected, decreases with the orifice size D . This leads to a phase diagram in the S − D plane in which clogging appears as a concave surface.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic states offer extended possibilities to control the properties of quantum matter. Recent efforts are focused on studying the ordered states which appear exclusively under the time-dependent drives. Here, we demonstrate a class of systems which feature dynamic spin-triplet superconducting order stimulated by the alternating electric field. The effect is based on the interplay of ferromagnetism, interfacial spin-orbital coupling, and the condensate motion driven by the field, which converts hidden static p -wave order, produced by the joint action of the ferromagnetism and the spin-orbital coupling, into dynamic s -wave equal-spin-triplet correlations. We demonstrate that the critical current of Josephson junctions hosting these states is proportional to the electromagnetic power, supplied either by the external irradiation or by the ac current source. Based on these unusual properties we propose the scheme of a Josephson transistor which can be switched by the ac voltage and demonstrates an even-numbered sequence of Shapiro steps. Combining the photoactive Josephson junctions with recently discovered Josephson phase batteries we find photomagnetic SQUID devices which can generate spontaneous magnetic fields while being exposed to irradiation.},

Among these, Group IV-vacancy defect centers have attracted great interest as coherent and stable optical interfaces to long-lived spin states. Theory indicates that their inversion symmetry provides first-order insensitivity to stray electric fields, a common limitation for optical coherence in any host material. Here we experimentally quantify this electric field dependence via an external electric field applied to individual tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in diamond. These measurements reveal that the permanent electric dipole moment and polarizability are at least 4 orders of magnitude smaller than for the diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, representing the first direct measurement of the inversion symmetry protection of a Group IV defect in diamond. Moreover, we show that by modulating the electric-field-induced dipole we can use the SnV as a nanoscale probe of local electric field noise, and we employ this technique to highlight the effect of spectral diffusion on the SnV.},

One-dimensional lattices are deemed to be protected by chiral symmetry, exhibiting quantized Zak phases and protected edge states, but not for all cases. Here, we experimentally realize an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with broken chiral symmetry by engineering one-dimensional zigzag photonic lattices, where the long-range hopping breaks chiral symmetry but ensures the existence of inversion symmetry. By the averaged mean displacement method, we detect topological invariants directly in the bulk through the continuous-time quantum walk of photons. Our results demonstrate that inversion symmetry protects the quantized Zak phase but edge states can disappear in the topological nontrivial phase, thus breaking the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. Our photonic lattice provides a useful platform to study the interplay among topological phases, symmetries, and the bulk-boundary correspondence.},

  abstract     = {Exotic high-rank multipolar order parameters have been found to be unexpectedly active in more and more correlated materials in recent years. Such multipoles are usually dubbed “hidden orders” since they are insensitive to common experimental probes. Theoretically, it is also difficult to predict multipolar orders via ab initio calculations in real materials. Here, we present an efficient method to predict possible multipoles in materials based on linear response theory under random phase approximation. Using this method, we successfully predict two pure metastable magnetic octupolar states in monolayer α − RuCl 3 , which is confirmed by self-consistent unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations. We then demonstrate that these octupolar states can be stabilized in monolayer α − RuI 3 , one of which becomes the octupolar ground state. Furthermore, we also predict a fingerprint of an orthogonal magnetization pattern produced by the octupole moment that can be easily detected by experiment. The method and the example presented in this Letter serve as a guide for searching multipolar order parameters in other correlated materials.},

Our detailed magnetometry results reveal that single crystal CoRu alloy films, in which the predefined depth dependent exchange coupling strength follows a V-shaped profile, exhibit critical scaling behavior over many orders of magnitude. Their critical exponents, however, can be designed and controlled by modifying their specific nanoscale structures, thus demonstrating full tunability of critical behavior. The reason for this tunability and the disappearance of universality is shown to be the competing relevance of collective versus interface propagating progression of ferromagnetic phase transitions, whose balance we find to be dependent on the specifics of the underlying exchange coupling strength profile.},

However, its realization in experiment is yet to be achieved. In this Letter, we propose a minimum model to construct a spinless higher-order Dirac semimetal protected by C 6 v symmetry. By breaking different symmetries, this parent phase transitions into a variety of novel topological phases including higher-order topological insulator, higher-order Weyl semimetal, and higher-order nodal-ring semimetal. Furthermore, for the first time, we experimentally realize this unprecedented higher-order topological phase in a sonic crystal and present an unambiguous observation of the desired hinge states via momentum-space spectroscopy and real-space visualization.

While the aggregation of holes is stabilized by the formation of ferromagnetic clusters through Hund’s coupling between charge carriers and local magnetic moments, this stabilization also creates confining potentials for holes when antiferromagnetic spin-spin correlation is well developed in the background. The dramatically reduced mobility of the self-trapped holes prematurely disrupts further growth of the ferromagnetic clusters, leading to an arrested phase separation.

Despite observations of plasticity-induced-dissolution and dissolution-induced-plasticity that are consistent with macroscale experiments, dissolution-induced-blunting is found to be independent of mechanical loading magnitude.

Consequently, the degree of phase evolution in the thin flakes is quite variable for the selected specimen and for a repeated measurement sequence, representing the emergence of complexity in the phase evolution. In the ∼ 20 − μ m 3 -volume specimen, the complex phase evolution results in the emergent coexistence of a superconducting phase that originally requires chemical doping to become thermodynamically stable.

  abstract     = {Microscale Janus emulsions represent a versatile material platform for dynamic refractive, reflective, and light-emitting optical components. Here, we present a mechanism for droplet actuation that exploits thermocapillarity. Using optically induced thermal gradients, an interfacial tension differential is generated across the surfactant-free internal capillary interface of Janus droplets. The interfacial tension differential causes droplet-internal Marangoni flows and a net torque, resulting in a predictable and controllable reorientation of the droplets. The effect can be quantitatively described with a simple model that balances gravitational and thermal torques. Occurring in small thermal gradients, these optothermally induced Marangoni dynamics represent a promising mechanism for controlling droplet-based micro-optical components.},

  abstract     = {Despite a long history of studies, acoustic waves are generally regarded as spinless scalar waves, until recent research revealed their rich structures. Here, we report the experimental observation of skyrmion configurations in acoustic waves. We find that surface acoustic waves trapped by a designed hexagonal acoustic metasurface give rise to skyrmion lattice patterns in the dynamic acoustic velocity fields (i.e., the oscillating acoustic air flows). Using an acoustic velocity sensing technique, we directly visualize a Néel-type skyrmion configuration of the acoustic velocity fields. We further demonstrate, respectively, the controllability and robustness of the acoustic skyrmion lattices by tuning the phase differences between the acoustic sources and by introducing local perturbations in our setup. Our study unveils a fundamental acoustic phenomenon that may enable unprecedented manipulation of acoustic waves and may inspire future technologies including advanced acoustic tweezers for the control of small particles.},

Our method extends the well-known ground state depletion (GSD) technique to the coherent regime. Here, we use a hollow beam to strongly saturate a coherently driven dipole-forbidden transition around a subdiffraction limited area at its center and observe state dependent fluorescence. By spatially scanning this laser beam over a single trapped Ca + 40 ion, we are able to measure the wave packet sizes of cooled ions. Using a depletion beam waist of 4.2 ( 1 ) μ m we reach a spatial resolution which allows us to determine a wave packet size of 39(9) nm for a near ground state cooled ion. This value matches an independently deduced value of 32(2) nm, calculated from resolved sideband spectroscopy measurements. Finally, we discuss the ultimate resolution limits of our adapted GSD imaging technique in view of applications to direct quantum wave packet imaging.},

Because of the short cavity length, the longitudinal mode-matching conditions found in previously explored, large path-length whispering gallery resonators are absent. Nonetheless, for cross-polarized scattering a strong and broadband suppression of one sideband is observed. This arises due to an interference between the Faraday and second-order Cotton-Mouton effects. To fully account for the suppression of the cross-polarized scattering, it is necessary to consider the squeezing of magnon modes intrinsic to thin-film geometry. A copolarized scattering due to Cotton-Mouton effect is also observed. In addition, the magnon modes involved are identified as Damon-Eshbach surface modes, whose nonreciprocal propagation could be exploited in device applications. This Letter experimentally demonstrates the important role of second-order Cotton-Mouton effect for optomagnonic devices.},

A specific lattice depth and filling configuration is designed to allow the p x and p y excited orbital degrees of freedom to act as a pseudospin. Starting from the full Hamiltonian for p -wave interactions in a periodic potential, we derive an extended Hubbard-type model that describes the anisotropic lattice dynamics of the excited orbitals at low energy. We then show how dispersion engineering can provide a viable route to realizing collective behavior driven by p -wave interactions. In particular, Bragg dressing and lattice depth can reduce single-particle dispersion rates, such that a collective many-body gap is opened with only moderate Feshbach enhancement of p -wave interactions. Physical insight into the emergent gap-protected collective dynamics is gained by projecting the Hamiltonian into the Dicke manifold, yielding a one-axis twisting model for the orbital pseudospin that can be probed using conventional Ramsey-style interferometry. Experimentally realistic protocols to prepare and measure the many-body dynamics are discussed, including the effects of band relaxation, particle loss, spin-orbit coupling, and doping.},

For quantum computing with large circuit depth and quantum simulation with long evolution time, it is of crucial importance to cool large ion crystals at runtime without affecting the internal states of the computational qubits, thus the necessity of sympathetic cooling. Here, we report multi-ion sympathetic cooling on a long ion chain using a narrow cooling beam focused on two adjacent ions, and optimize the choice of the cooling ions according to the collective oscillation modes of the chain. We show that, by cooling a small fraction of ions, cooling effects close to the global Doppler cooling limit can be achieved.

This shear-induced polarization (SIP) can be viewed as the fluid analog of strain-induced polarization observed in elastic and nematic materials. We obtain the explicit expression for SIP using the quantum kinetic equation and linear response theory. Based on a realistic hydrodynamic model, we compute the differential spin polarization along both the beam direction z ^ and the out-plane direction y ^ in noncentral heavy-ion collisions at s N N = 200 GeV , including both SIP and thermal vorticity effects. We find that SIP contribution always shows the same azimuthal angle dependence as experimental data and competes with thermal vorticity effects. In the scenario that Λ inherits and memorizes the spin polarization of a strange quark, SIP wins the competition, and the resulting azimuthal angle dependent spin polarization P y and P z agree qualitatively with the experimental data.},

No significant deviation from the expected background is observed in the data. Inspired by the B -meson decay anomalies, a four-fermion contact interaction between two quarks ( b , s ) and two leptons ( e e or μ μ ) is used as a benchmark signal model, which is characterized by the energy scale and coupling, Λ and g * , respectively. Contact interactions with Λ / g * lower than 2.0 (2.4) TeV are excluded for electrons (muons) at the 95\% confidence level, still far below the value that is favored by the B -meson decay anomalies. Model-independent limits are set as a function of the minimum dilepton invariant mass, which allow the results to be reinterpreted in various signal scenarios.},

We allow N and M to assume general real values, which results in them functioning as bifurcation parameters. In studying the behavior of the model in the space of M and N , we demarcate the region where the RG flow is nonmonotonic and determine curves along which Hopf bifurcations take place. At a number of points in the space of M and N we find that the model exhibits an interesting phenomenon: at these points the RG flow possesses a fixed point located at real values of the coupling constants g i but with a stability matrix ( ∂ β i / ∂ g j ) that is not diagonalizable and has a Jordan block of size two with zero eigenvalue. Such points correspond to logarithmic conformal field theories and represent Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations, a type of bifurcation known to give rise to a nearby homoclinic orbit—an RG flow that originates and terminates at the same fixed point. In the present example, we are able to employ analytic and numeric evidence to display the existence of the homoclinic RG flow.},

Oftentimes, this discrepancy is addressed by adding a break to the source spectrum or the diffusion coefficient in an ad hoc fashion, with a convincing physical explanation yet to be provided. Here, we argue that the discrete nature of cosmic ray sources, which is usually ignored, is instead a more likely explanation. We model the distribution of intensities expected from a statistical model of discrete sources and show that its expectation value is not representative but has a spectral shape different from that for a typical configuration of sources.

  abstract     = {With subrecoil-laser-cooled atoms, one may reach nanokelvin temperatures while the ergodic properties of these systems do not follow usual statistical laws. Instead, due to an ingenious trapping mechanism in momentum space, power-law-distributed sojourn times are found for the cooled particles. Here, we show how this gives rise to a statistical-mechanical framework based on infinite ergodic theory, which replaces ordinary ergodic statistical physics of a thermal gas of atoms. In particular, the energy of the system exhibits a sharp discontinuous transition in its ergodic properties. Physically, this is controlled by the fluorescence rate, but, more profoundly, it is a manifestation of a transition for any observable, from being an integrable to becoming a nonintegrable observable, with respect to the infinite (non-normalized) invariant density.},

  abstract     = {Periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems have recently been a focus of nonequilibrium physics by virtue of their rich dynamics. Time-periodic systems not only exhibit symmetries that resemble those in spatially periodic systems, but also display novel behavior that arises from symmetry breaking. Characterization of such dynamical symmetries is crucial, but often challenging due to limited driving strength and lack of an experimentally accessible characterization technique. Here, we show how to reveal dynamical symmetries, namely, parity, rotation, and particle-hole symmetries, by observing symmetry-induced Floquet selection rules. Notably, we exploit modulated driving to reach the strong light-matter coupling regime, and we introduce a protocol to experimentally extract the transition matrix elements between Floquet states from the system coherent evolution. By using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as an experimental test bed, we execute our protocol to observe symmetry-protected dark states and dark bands, and coherent destruction of tunneling. Our work shows how one can exploit the quantum control toolkit to study dynamical symmetries that arise in the topological phases of strongly driven Floquet systems.},

In particular, we show that there exists an effective Hamiltonian that captures the dynamics of ensembles of classical trajectories despite the breakdown of this description at the single trajectory level. In addition, we prove that the effective Hamiltonian can host emergent symmetries protected by the discrete time-translation symmetry of the drive. The spontaneous breaking of such an emergent symmetry leads to a subharmonic response, characteristic of time crystalline order, that survives to exponentially late times in the frequency of the drive. To this end, we numerically demonstrate the existence of classical prethermal time crystals in systems with different dimensionalities and ranges of interaction. Extensions to higher order and fractional time crystals are also discussed.},

Because of the notorious computational challenges of quantum many-body systems, numerical investigations in this direction have remained limited to one spatial dimension, in which long-range interactions have been proven a necessity. Here, we show that prethermal nonequilibrium phases of matter are not restricted to the quantum domain. Studying the Hamiltonian dynamics of a large three-dimensional lattice of classical spins, we provide the first numerical proof of prethermal phases of matter in a system with short-range interactions. Concretely, we find higher-order as well as fractional discrete time crystals breaking the time-translational symmetry of the drive with unexpectedly large integer as well as fractional periods. Our work paves the way toward the exploration of novel prethermal phenomena by means of classical Hamiltonian dynamics with virtually no limitations on the system’s geometry or size, and thus with direct implications for experiments.},

We analytically derive the effective action in the large- N limit and show that an entanglement transition is caused by the symmetry breaking in the enlarged replica space. In the noninteracting case with SYK 2 chains, the model features a continuous O ( 2 ) symmetry between two replicas and a transition corresponding to spontaneous breaking of that symmetry upon varying the measurement rate. In the symmetry broken phase at low measurement rate, the emergent replica criticality associated with the Goldstone mode leads to a log-scaling entanglement entropy that can be attributed to the free energy of vortices. In the symmetric phase at higher measurement rate, the entanglement entropy obeys area-law scaling. In the interacting case, the continuous O ( 2 ) symmetry is explicitly lowered to a discrete C 4 symmetry, giving rise to volume-law entanglement entropy in the symmetry-broken phase due to the enhanced linear free energy cost of domain walls compared to vortices. The interacting transition is described by C 4 symmetry breaking. We also verify the large- N critical exponents by numerically solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation.},

By focusing on integer factorization, we show a reduction by several orders of magnitude of the number of processing qubits compared with a standard architecture using a planar grid of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity. This is achieved by taking advantage of a temporally and spatially multiplexed memory to store the qubit states between processing steps. Concretely, for a characteristic physical gate error rate of 10 − 3 , a processor cycle time of 1 microsecond, factoring a 2 048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible in 177 days with 3D gauge color codes assuming a threshold of 0.75\% with a processor made with 13 436 physical qubits and a memory that can store 28 million spatial modes and 45 temporal modes with 2 hours’ storage time. By inserting additional error-correction steps, storage times of 1 second are shown to be sufficient at the cost of increasing the run-time by about 23\%. Shorter run-times (and storage times) are achievable by increasing the number of qubits in the processing unit. We suggest realizing such an architecture using a microwave interface between a processor made with superconducting qubits and a multiplexed memory using the principle of photon echo in solids doped with rare-earth ions.},

We augment a CGAN with custom neural-network layers that enable conversion of output from any standard neural network into a physical density matrix. To reconstruct the density matrix, the generator and discriminator networks train each other on data using standard gradient-based methods. We demonstrate that our QST-CGAN reconstructs optical quantum states with high fidelity, using orders of magnitude fewer iterative steps, and less data, than both accelerated projected-gradient-based and iterative maximum-likelihood estimation. We also show that the QST-CGAN can reconstruct a quantum state in a single evaluation of the generator network if it has been pretrained on similar quantum states.},

The utility of a quantum state | ψ ⟩ for these applications is often directly related to the degree or type of entanglement present in | ψ ⟩ . Therefore, efficiently quantifying and characterizing multipartite entanglement is of paramount importance. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures, called concentratable entanglements. Several well-known entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of our family of measures, and hence we provide a general framework for quantifying multipartite entanglement. We prove that the entire family does not increase, on average, under local operations and classical communications. We also provide an operational meaning for these measures in terms of probabilistic concentration of entanglement into Bell pairs. Finally, we show that these quantities can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer by implementing a parallelized SWAP test, opening up a research direction for measuring multipartite entanglement on quantum devices.},

A general postselection that is decided after communication between parties can mimic nonlocality, even though the complete data are local. Here, we establish conditions under which GMN is demonstrable even if observations are postselected collectively. Intriguingly, certain postselection strategies that require communication among several parties still offer a demonstration of GMN shared between all parties. The results are derived using the causal structure of the experiment and the no-signaling condition imposed by relativity.

It arises from the notably inhomogeneous flexural rigidity of ssDNA and causes high friction via transient DNA desorption costs exacerbated by solvation effects. For a similarly sized pore in bilayer h-BN, its self-passivated atomically smooth edge enables continuous ssDNA transport.

However, the physical processes and mechanisms governing ocular morphogenesis are not well understood. Here, using analytical theory and nonlinear shell finite-element simulations, we show, for optic vesicles experiencing matrix-constrained growth, that elastic instabilities govern the optic cup morphogenesis. By capturing the stress amplification owing to mass increase during growth, we show that the morphogenesis is driven by two elastic instabilities analogous to the snap through in spherical shells, where the second instability is sensitive to the optic cup geometry. In particular, if the optic vesicle is too slender, it will buckle and break axisymmetry, thus, preventing normal development. Our results shed light on the morphogenetic mechanisms governing the formation of a functional biological system and the role of elastic instabilities in the shape selection of soft biological structures.},

  abstract     = {The spatiotemporal organization of bacterial cells is crucial for the active segregation of replicating chromosomes. In several species, including Caulobacter crescentus , the ATPase ParA binds to DNA and forms a gradient along the long cell axis. The ParB partition complex on the newly replicated chromosome translocates up this ParA gradient, thereby contributing to chromosome segregation. A DNA-relay mechanism—deriving from the elasticity of the fluctuating chromosome—has been proposed as the driving force for this cargo translocation, but a mechanistic theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we propose a minimal model to describe force generation by the DNA-relay mechanism over a broad range of operational conditions. Conceptually, we identify four distinct force-generation regimes characterized by their dependence on chromosome fluctuations. These relay force regimes arise from an interplay of the imposed ParA gradient, chromosome fluctuations, and an emergent friction force due to chromosome-cargo interactions.},

  abstract     = {Under an applied traction, highly concentrated suspensions of solid particles in fluids can turn from a state in which they flow to a state in which they counteract the traction as an elastic solid: a shear-jammed state. Remarkably, the suspension can turn back to the flowing state simply by inverting the traction. A tensorial model is presented and tested in paradigmatic cases. We show that, to reproduce the phenomenology of shear jamming in generic geometries, it is necessary to link this effect to the elastic response supported by the suspension microstructure rather than to a divergence of the viscosity.},

  abstract     = {Modification of surface properties by polymer adsorption is a widely used technique to tune interactions in molecular experiments such as nanopore sensing. Here, we investigate how the ionic current noise through solid-state nanopores reflects the adsorption of short, neutral polymers to the pore surface. The power spectral density of the noise shows a characteristic change upon adsorption of polymer, the magnitude of which is strongly dependent on both polymer length and salt concentration. In particular, for short polymers at low salt concentrations no change is observed, despite the verification of comparable adsorption in these systems using quartz crystal microbalance measurements. We propose that the characteristic noise is generated by the movement of polymers on and off the surface and perform simulations to assess the feasibility of this model. Excellent agreement with experimental data is obtained using physically motivated simulation parameters, providing deep insight into the shape of the adsorption potential and underlying processes. This paves the way toward using noise spectral analysis for in situ characterization of functionalized nanopores.},

The van der Waals interaction between the atomic layers of hexagonal boron nitride induces flat bands along specific lines of the Brillouin zone. The macroscopic degeneracy along these lines leads to van Hove singularities with divergent joint density of states, resulting in outstanding optical properties of the excitonic states. For the direct exciton, we report a giant oscillator strength with a longitudinal-transverse splitting of 420 meV, a record value, confirmed by our ab initio calculations. For the fundamental indirect exciton, flat bands result in phonon-assisted processes of exceptional efficiency, that compete with direct absorption in reflectivity, and that make the internal quantum efficiency close to values typical of direct band gap semiconductors.},

Spin pumping from a ferromagnet into an adjacent nonmagnetic material is a powerful technique to generate pure-spin currents, wherein spin transport is unaccompanied by net charge transport. It is therefore interesting to study pure-spin transport at the interface of two materials with different spin transport properties. Here we demonstrate asymmetric transport of pure-spin currents across an interface of dissimilar nonmagnetic materials Au/Pt. We exploit Py/Au/Pt/Co structures where spin pumping can generate pure-spin current from either Py or Co independently. We find that the transmission of pure-spin current from Au into Pt is twice as efficient as transmission from Pt into Au. Experimental results are interpreted by extending conventional spin-pumping, spin-diffusion theory to include boundary conditions of reflected and transmitted spin current at the Au/Pt interface that are proportional to the established spin chemical potentials on either side of the interface.},

Here, we study the magnetic field induced superconductor–metal transition in ultrathin crystalline PdTe 2 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Remarkably, the QGS emerges under both perpendicular and parallel magnetic field in four-monolayer PdTe 2 films. The direct activated scaling analysis with a new irrelevant correction has been proposed, providing important evidence of QGS. With increasing film thickness to six monolayers, the QGS disappears under perpendicular field but persists under parallel field, and this discordance may originate from the differences in microscopic processes. Our work demonstrates the universality of parallel field induced QGS and can stimulate further investigations on novel quantum phase transitions under parallel magnetic field.},

By reversing the polarization of a ferroelectric polymer top layer, we induce a conductivity switching ratio of &gt; 1.5 × 10 8 in the ReS 2 channel at 300 K. Characterizing the domain-defined conducting nanowires in an insulating background shows that the conductivity ratio between the directions along and perpendicular to the Re chain can exceed 5.5 × 10 4 in monolayer ReS 2 . Theoretical modeling points to the band origin of the transport anomaly and further reveals the emergence of a flat band in few-layer ReS 2 .

Here we experimentally mimic the celebrated Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with cold atoms, and then measure the spin Chern number with the linear response theory. We observe that, although the Chern number for each spin component is ill defined, the spin Chern number measured by their difference is still well defined when both energy and spin gaps are nonvanished.},

In crystals with two degenerate valleys, a perpendicular magnetic field lifts the valley degeneracy via a Zeeman effect due to these magnetic moments, leading to magnetoelectric effects which can be leveraged for creating valleytronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate that trilayer graphene with Bernal stacking (ABA TLG), hosts topological magnetic moments with a large and widely tunable valley g factor ( g ν ), reaching a value g ν ∼ 1050 at the extreme of the studied parametric range. The reported experiment consists in sublattice-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy under perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that control the TLG bands. The tunneling spectra agree very well with the results of theoretical modeling that includes the full details of the TLG tight-binding model and accounts for a quantum-dot-like potential profile formed electrostatically under the scanning tunneling microscope tip.},

The general analytical form of these space-charge regions is known only in the dilute limit, where defect-defect correlations can be neglected. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Coulomb lattice gas, we show that grain boundary space-charge regions in nondilute solid electrolytes exhibit overscreening—damped oscillatory space-charge profiles—and underscreening—decay lengths that are longer than the corresponding Debye length and that increase with increasing defect-defect interaction strength. Overscreening and underscreening are known phenomena in concentrated liquid electrolytes, and the observation of functionally analogous behavior in solid electrolyte space-charge regions suggests that the same underlying physics drives behavior in both classes of systems. We therefore expect theoretical approaches developed to study nondilute liquid electrolytes to be equally applicable to future studies of solid electrolytes.},

In this work, the new orthorhombic polymorph of yttrium carbide, γ − Y 4 C 5 γ−Y4C5 , was synthesized from yttrium and paraffin oil in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell at ∼ 5 0 GPa ∼50  GPa . The structure of γ − Y 4 C 5 γ−Y4C5 was solved and refined using in situ synchrotron single-crystal x-ray diffraction.

Here, we report a rigid two-frequency torsional oscillator study on the second layer as a function of temperature and He 4 atomic density. For the first time, we show experimentally that the superfluid density is independent of frequency, which can be interpreted as unequivocal evidence of genuine superfluidity. The phase diagram established in this work reveals that a superfluid phase coexists with hexatic density-wave correlation and a registered solid phase. This suggests the second layer as a candidate for hosting two exotic quantum ground states: the spatially modulated superfluid and supersolid phases resulting from the interplay between superfluid and structural orders.},

While inertialess elastic instabilities have been predicted for curvilinear shear flows, this is the first ever report of a purely elastic linear instability in a rectilinear shear flow. The novel instability continues up to a Reynolds number (Re) of O ( 1000 ) , corresponding to the recently identified elasto-inertial turbulent state believed to underlie the maximum-drag-reduced regime. Thus, for highly elastic ultradilute polymer solutions, a single linearly unstable modal branch may underlie transition to elastic turbulence at zero Re and to elasto-inertial turbulence at moderate Re, implying the existence of continuous pathways connecting the turbulent states to each other and to the laminar base state.},

Significant advances have been made recently in achieving micro-OFC devices based on parametric frequency conversion or electro-optic phase modulation. Here, we demonstrate a new kind of microcomb using a cavity optomechanical system with giant oscillation amplitude. We observe both optical and microwave frequency combs in a microtoroid resonator, which feature a flat OFC with 938 comb lines and a repetition rate as low as 50.22 MHz, as well as a flat microwave frequency comb with 867 comb lines. To generate such giant oscillation amplitude, we excite an overcoupled optical mode with a large blue detuning that is assisted with the thermo-optic nonlinearity. A new type of nonlinear oscillation, induced by competition between the optomechanical oscillation and thermo-optic nonlinearity, is also observed.},

The modification of the dynamics employs an exterior product of gradients of the original quantities, and often evolves the system toward asymptotic linear dependence of these gradients in a nontrivial state. The process both generalizes and provides additional structure to existing techniques for selective dissipation in the literature on fluids and plasmas, nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and nonlinear controls. It may be iterated or adapted to obtain any reduction in the degree of integrability. It may enable discovery of extremal states, limit cycles, or solitons, and the construction of new integrable systems from superintegrable systems. We briefly illustrate the approach by its application to the cyclic three-body Toda lattice, driven from an aperiodic orbit toward a limit cycle.},

In this Letter, we show that a single organic molecule acts as an extremely efficient nonlinear optical element in the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Employing homodyne detection of photons emitted from a laser-driven emitter ensemble into the modes of a waveguide allows for the generation of intricate dynamical phases. In particular, we show the emergence of a time-crystal phase, the transition to which is controlled by the feedback strength. Feedback enables furthermore the control of many-body quantum correlations, which become manifest in spin squeezing in the emitter ensemble. Developing a theory for the dynamics of fluctuation operators we discuss how the feedback strength controls the squeezing and investigate its temporal dynamics and dependence on system size. The largely analytical results allow to quantify spin squeezing and fluctuations in the limit of large number of emitters, revealing critical scaling of the squeezing close to the transition to the time crystal. Our study corroborates the potential of integrated emitter-waveguide systems—which feature highly controllable photon emission channels—for the exploration of collective quantum phenomena and the generation of resources, such as squeezed states, for quantum enhanced metrology.},

We observe that atoms generally spend less time tunneling through higher barriers and that this time decreases for lower energy particles. For the lowest measured incident energy, at least 90\% of transmitted atoms tunneled through the barrier, spending an average of 0.59 ± 0.02 ms inside.

  abstract     = {We show that axions interacting with Abelian gauge fields obtain a potential from loops of magnetic monopoles. This is a consequence of the Witten effect: the axion field causes the monopoles to acquire an electric charge and alters their energy spectrum. The axion potential can also be understood as a type of instanton effect due to a Euclidean monopole worldline winding around its dyon collective coordinate. We calculate this effect, which has features in common with both non-Abelian instantons and Euclidean brane instantons. To provide consistency checks, we argue that this axion potential vanishes in the presence of a massless charged fermion and that it is robust against the presence of higher-derivative corrections in the effective Lagrangian. Finally, as a first step toward connecting with particle phenomenology and cosmology, we discuss the regime in which this potential is important in determining the dark matter relic abundance in a hidden sector containing an Abelian gauge group, monopoles, and axions.},

  abstract     = {We propose a worldsheet description for the AdS 5 × S 5 string theory dual to large N , free N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. The worldsheet theory is a natural generalization of the recently investigated tensionless string on AdS 3 × S 3 × T 4 . As in the case of AdS 3 it has a free field description, with spectrally flowed sectors, and is closely related to an (ambi-)twistor string theory. Here, however, we view it as a critical N = 4 (closed) string background. We argue that the corresponding worldsheet gauge constraints reduce the degrees of freedom to a finite number of oscillators (string bits) in each spectrally flowed sector. Imposing a set of residual gauge constraints on this reduced oscillator Fock space then determines the physical spectrum of the string theory. Quite remarkably, we find that this prescription reproduces precisely the entire planar spectrum—of single trace operators—of the free supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.},

We quantify the properties of these encounters and find that they occur frequently [ O ( 1 – 100 ) day − 1 ], last between a day and a few months, are spatially clustered toward the Galactic Center, and can reach observable fluxes. These radio transients are within reach of current generation telescopes and therefore offer a promising pathway to discovering QCD axion dark matter.},

The Standard Model prediction for the rate for these decays is extremely small, but it can be enhanced if new physics increases the neutrino electromagnetic moments. The decay photons will appear as an interloper of astrophysical spectral lines. We propose that the neutrino-decay line can be identified with anisotropies in LIM clustering and also with the voxel intensity distribution. Ongoing and future LIM experiments will have—depending on the neutrino hierarchy, transition, and experiment considered—a sensitivity to an effective electromagnetic transition moment ∼ 10 − 12 − 10 − 8 ( m i c 2 / 0.1 eV ) 3 / 2 μ B , where m i is the mass of the decaying neutrino and μ B is the Bohr magneton. This will be significantly more sensitive than cosmic microwave background spectral distortions, and it will be competitive with stellar cooling studies.

General relativity equations are solved numerically in a periodic box with a diagonal metric tensor depending on two space coordinates only, g i j ≡ g i i ( x , y , t ) δ i j , and with an additional small-scale dissipative term. We limit ourselves to weak gravitational waves and to a freely decaying turbulence. We find that an initial metric excitation at intermediate wave number leads to a dual cascade of energy and wave action. When the direct energy cascade reaches the dissipative scales, a transition is observed in the temporal evolution of energy from a plateau to a power-law decay, while the inverse cascade front continues to propagate toward low wave numbers. The wave number and frequency-wave-number spectra are found to be compatible with the theory of weak wave turbulence and the characteristic timescale of the dual cascade is that expected for four-wave resonant interactions. The simulation reveals that an initially weak gravitational wave turbulence tends to become strong as the inverse cascade of wave action progresses with a selective amplification of the fluctuations g 11 and g 22 .},

These processes can follow surprising relaxation paths due to, e.g., memory effects, which significantly alter the expected equilibration routes. The Kovacs effect can take place when a thermalization process is suddenly interrupted by a change of the bath temperature, leading to a nonmonotonic evolution of the energy of the system. Here, we demonstrate that the Kovacs effect can be observed in the thermalization of the center of mass motion of a levitated nanoparticle. The temperature is controlled during the experiment through an external source of white Gaussian noise that mimics an effective thermal bath at a temperature that can be changed faster than any relaxation time of the system. We describe our experiments in terms of the dynamics of a Brownian particle in a harmonic trap without any fitting parameter, suggesting that the Kovacs effect can appear in a large variety of systems.},

Hence, the ESQPT critical energy splits the spectrum into one phase where the equilibrium expectation values of physical observables crucially depend on this constant of motion and another phase where the energy is the only relevant thermodynamic magnitude. The trademark feature of this operator is that it has two different eigenvalues ± 1 , and, therefore, it acts as a discrete symmetry in the first of these two phases. This scenario is observed in systems with and without an additional discrete symmetry; in the first case, C ^ explains the change from degenerate doublets to nondegenerate eigenlevels upon crossing the critical line. We present stringent numerical evidence in the Rabi and Dicke models, suggesting that this result is exact in the thermodynamic limit, with finite-size corrections that decrease as a power law.},

  abstract     = {The scope of analog simulation in atomic, molecular, and optical systems has expanded greatly over the past decades. Recently, the idea of synthetic dimensions—in which transport occurs in a space spanned by internal or motional states coupled by field-driven transitions—has played a key role in this expansion. While approaches based on synthetic dimensions have led to rapid advances in single-particle Hamiltonian engineering, strong interaction effects have been conspicuously absent from most synthetic dimensions platforms. Here, in a lattice of coupled atomic momentum states, we show that atomic interactions result in large and qualitative changes to dynamics in the synthetic dimension. We explore how the interplay of nonlinear interactions and coherent tunneling enriches the dynamics of a one-band tight-binding model giving rise to macroscopic self-trapping and phase-driven Josephson dynamics with a nonsinusoidal current-phase relationship, which can be viewed as stemming from a nonlinear band structure arising from interactions.},

The key to our approach is development of an analytical method for solving this multivalued inverse problem. Such sheets open the door to fabricating machines that can perform complex tasks through cyclic transitions between multiple shapes.

This means the interlayer electrical current is related to the phase of the excitonic order parameter as J = J c sin 2 θ instead of J = J c sin θ and that the system has two degenerate ground states at θ = 0 , π that can be switched by an interlayer voltage pulse. When generalized to a three dimensional stack of alternating electron-hole planes or a two dimensional stack of chains, the ac Josephson effect implies that electric field pulses perpendicular to the layers and chains can steer the order parameter phase between the two degenerate ground states, making these devices ultrafast memories. The order parameter steering also applies to the excitonic insulator candidate Ta 2 NiSe 5 .},

The theory relies on solving simultaneously Maxwell’s equations coupled to the driven localized spins taking into account their spatial topology and spatial anisotropic interactions.

We show via explicit real-time dynamical calculations that the effect of the applied electric field on the electronic order parameter leads to a strong enhancement of the bulk photovoltaic effect relative to the values obtained in a conventional insulator. The enhancements include both resonant enhancements at sub-band-gap frequencies, arising from excitation of optically active collective modes, and broadband enhancements arising from nonresonant deformations of the electronic order. The deformable electronic order parameter produces an injection current contribution to the bulk photovoltaic effect that is entirely absent in a rigid-band approximation to a time-reversal symmetric material. Our findings establish that correlation effects can lead to the bulk photovoltaic effect and demonstrate that the collective behavior of ordered states can yield large nonlinear optical responses.},

Here, we provide the first experimental demonstration of its profound effect on spin properties in semiconductor nanostructures. We show that electron spin generation in InAs/GaAs quantum-dot structures is completely quenched upon spin injection from adjacent InGaAs wetting layers at the Fano resonance due to coupling of light-hole excitons and the heavy-hole continuum of the interband optical transitions, mediated by an anisotropic exchange interaction. Using a master equation approach, we show that such quenching of spin generation is robust and independent of Fano parameters. This work therefore identifies spin-dependent Fano resonance as a universal spin loss channel in quantum-dot systems with an inherent symmetry-breaking effect.},

If the DM vector contains in-plane components, then the spinons gain nonzero Berry phase. The resultant thermal conductances κ x x and κ x y qualitatively agree with the experimental results on the material EtMe 3 Sb [ Pd ( dmit ) 2 ] 2 . Furthermore, owing to perfect nesting of the Fermi surface, a spin density wave state is triggered by larger DM interactions. On the other hand, when the ring-exchange interaction decreases, another antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with 120° order shows up which is proximate to a U(1) Dirac QSL.

A notable example is the interface between polar and nonpolar materials, where valence discontinuities lead to otherwise inaccessible charge and spin states. This approach paved the way for the discovery of numerous unconventional properties absent in the bulk constituents. However, control of the geometric structure of the electronic wave functions in correlated oxides remains an open challenge. Here, we create heterostructures consisting of ultrathin SrRuO 3 , an itinerant ferromagnet hosting momentum-space sources of Berry curvature, and LaAlO 3 , a polar wide-band-gap insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals an atomically sharp LaO / RuO 2 / SrO interface configuration, leading to excess charge being pinned near the LaAlO 3 / SrRuO 3 interface. We demonstrate through magneto-optical characterization, theoretical calculations and transport measurements that the real-space charge reconstruction drives a reorganization of the topological charges in the band structure, thereby modifying the momentum-space Berry curvature in SrRuO 3 . Our results illustrate how the topological and magnetic features of oxides can be manipulated by engineering charge discontinuities at oxide interfaces.},

When nanohole defects are uniformly dispersed in the atomic layer, the superfluid density monotonically decreases as a function of defect density (from 0.7\% to 5\% of the surface area) with minor change in the transition temperature T C , measured both microscopically and macroscopically. With a slight increase in the defect density from 5\% to 6\%, these point defects are organized into defect chains that enclose individual two-dimensional patches. This new geometric arrangement of defects dramatically impacts the superconductivity, leading to the total disappearance of macroscopic superfluid density and the collapse of the microscopic superconducting gap. This study sheds new light on the understanding of how local defects and their geometric arrangements impact superconductivity in the two-dimensional limit.},

  abstract     = {Superconductivity and Anderson localization represent two extreme cases of electronic behavior in solids. Surprisingly, these two competing scenarios can occur in the same quantum system, e.g., in an amorphous superconductor. Although the disorder-driven quantum phase transition has attracted much attention, its structural origins remain elusive. Here, we discovered an unambiguous correlation between superconductivity and density in amorphous Sb 2 Se 3 at high pressure. Superconductivity first emerges in the high-density amorphous (HDA) phase at about 24 GPa, where the density of glass unexpectedly exceeds its crystalline counterpart, and then shows an enhanced critical temperature when pressure induces crystallization at 51 GPa. Ab initio simulations reveal that the bcc-like local geometry motifs form in the HDA phase, arising from distinct “metavalent bonds.” Our results demonstrate that HDA phase is critical for the incipient superconductive behavior.},

This was interpreted as strong evidence for exotic nematic superconductivity instead of the widely proposed chiral superconductivity. Counterintuitively, we demonstrate that in two-dimensional chiral superconductors the in-plane magnetic field can hybridize the two chiral superconducting order parameters to induce a phase that shows nematicity in the transport response. Its paraconductivity is modulated as cos ( 2 θ B ) , with θ B being the direction of the in-plane magnetic field, consistent with experiment in twisted bilayer graphene. We therefore suggest that the nematic response reported by Cao et al. does not rule out a chiral superconducting ground state.},

These currents, in second-order perturbation theory, are inversely proportional to the relaxation rate, and, therefore, naively diverge in the ideal clean limit. Employing a combination of the nonequilibrium Green function technique and Floquet theory, we show that this is an artifact of perturbation theory, and that there is a well-defined periodic steady state akin to Rabi oscillations leading to finite rectified currents in the limit of weak coupling to a thermal bath. In this Rabi regime the rectified current scales as the square root of the radiation intensity, in contrast with the linear scaling of the perturbative regime, allowing us to readily diagnose it in experiments. More generally, our description provides a smooth interpolation from the ideal periodic Gibbs ensemble describing the Rabi oscillations of a closed system to the perturbative regime of rapid relaxation due to strong coupling to a thermal bath.},

Performing large-scale numerical experiments, we observe no trace of many-body localization even at large disorder. Analyzing the role of quenched disorder terms in constrained systems we show that they act in two, distinct and competing ways: as an on-site disorder term for the basic excitations of the system, and as an interaction between excitations. The two contributions are of the same order, and as they compete (one towards localization, the other against it), one does never enter a truly strong disorder, weak interaction limit, where many-body localization occurs. Such a mechanism is further clarified in the case of XY -type constrained models: there, a term which would represent a bona fide local quenched disorder term acting on the excitations of the clean model must be written as a series of nonlocal terms in the unconstrained variables. Our observations provide a simple picture to interpret the role of quenched disorder that could be immediately extended to other constrained models or quenched gauge theories.},

A distribution of crystalline grains of different handedness is obtained via location-sensitive electrical transport measurements. The sum rule holds in the conversion coefficient in the current-voltage characteristics. A diamagnetic nature of the crystals supports that the spin polarization is not due to localized electron spins but due to itinerant electron spins. A large difference in the strength of antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction associated with 4 d electrons in Nb and 5 d ones in Ta is oppositely correlated with that of the spin polarization. A robust protection of the spin polarization occurs over long distances in chiral crystals.},

  abstract     = {We predict the generation of bulk photocurrents in materials driven by bichromatic fields that are circularly polarized and corotating. The nonlinear photocurrents have a fully controllable directionality and amplitude without requiring carrier-envelope-phase stabilization or few-cycle pulses, and can be generated with photon energies much smaller than the band gap (reducing heating in the photoconversion process). We demonstrate with ab initio calculations that the photocurrent generation mechanism is universal and arises in gaped materials (Si, diamond, MgO, hBN), in semimetals (graphene), and in two- and three-dimensional systems. Photocurrents are shown to rely on sub-laser-cycle asymmetries in the nonlinear response that build-up coherently from cycle to cycle as the conduction band is populated. Importantly, the photocurrents are always transverse to the major axis of the co-circular lasers regardless of the material’s structure and orientation (analogously to a Hall current), which we find originates from a generalized time-reversal symmetry in the driven system. At high laser powers ( ∼ 10 13 W / cm 2 ) this symmetry can be spontaneously broken by vast electronic excitations, which is accompanied by an onset of carrier-envelope-phase sensitivity and ultrafast many-body effects. Our results are directly applicable for efficient light-driven control of electronics, and for enhancing sub-band-gap bulk photogalvanic effects.},

Here, we survey published scanning tunneling microscope measurements to prove that near the magic-angle, native heterostrain, the relative deformations between the layers, dominates twist in determining the flat bands as opposed to the common belief. This is demonstrated at full filling where electronic correlations have a weak effect and where we also show that tip-induced strain can have a strong influence.

First-principles approaches enable accurate calculations of e − ph interactions in a wide range of solids. However, they remain an open challenge in correlated electron systems (CES), where density functional theory often fails to describe the ground state. Therefore reliable e − ph calculations remain out of reach for many transition metal oxides, high-temperature superconductors, Mott insulators, planetary materials, and multiferroics. Here we show first-principles calculations of e − ph interactions in CES, using the framework of Hubbard-corrected density functional theory ( DFT + U ) and its linear response extension ( DFPT + U ), which can describe the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of many CES. We showcase the accuracy of this approach for a prototypical Mott system, CoO, carrying out a detailed investigation of its e − ph interactions and electron spectral functions. While standard DFPT gives unphysically divergent and short-ranged e − ph interactions, DFPT + U is shown to remove the divergences and properly account for the long-range Fröhlich interaction, allowing us to model polaron effects in a Mott insulator. Our work establishes a broadly applicable and affordable approach for quantitative studies of e − ph interactions in CES, a novel theoretical tool to interpret experiments in this broad class of materials.},

Here, combining spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we report distinct spin-momentum-layer locking phenomena in a centrosymmetric, layered material, BiOI. The measured spin is highly polarized along the Brillouin zone boundary, while the same effect almost vanishes around the zone center due to its nonsymmorphic crystal structure.

The simulations reveal that the interplay between shear-driven amorphization and recrystallization results in an amorphous shear interface with constant thickness. Different shear elastic responses of the two anisotropic crystals can lead to the migration of the amorphous interface normal to the sliding plane, causing the crystal with lowest elastic energy density to grow at the expense of the other one. This triboepitaxial growth can be achieved by crystal misorientation or exploiting elastic finite-size effects, enabling the direct deposition of homoepitaxial silicon nanofilms by a crystalline tip rubbing against a substrate.},

  abstract     = {In two-dimensional insulators with time-reversal (TR) symmetry, a nonzero local Berry curvature of low-energy massive Dirac fermions can give rise to nontrivial spin and charge responses, even though the integral of the Berry curvature over all occupied states is zero. In this Letter, we present a new effect induced by the electronic Berry curvature. By studying electron-phonon interactions in BaMnSb 2 , a prototype two-dimensional Dirac material possessing two TR-related massive Dirac cones, we find that the nonzero local Berry curvature of electrons can induce a phonon angular momentum. The direction of this phonon angular momentum is locked to the phonon propagation direction, and thus we refer to it as “phonon helicity” in a way that is reminiscent of electron helicity in spin-orbit-coupled electronic systems. We discuss possible experimental probes of such phonon helicity.},

Here, we report the discovery of the sudden collapse of three-dimensional order in the low-temperature phase of V 1 − x Mo x O 2 at x = 0.17 and the emergence of a novel frustrated two-dimensional order at x = 0.19 , with only a slight change in electronic properties. Single crystal diffuse x-ray scattering reveals that this transition from the 3D M 1 phase to a 2D variant of the M 2 phase results in long-range structural correlations along symmetry-equivalent ( 11 L ) planes of the tetragonal rutile structure, yet extremely short-range correlations transverse to these planes. These findings suggest that this two dimensionality results from a novel form of geometric frustration that is essentially structural in origin.},

Surface forces and interfacial tension control the last stage of film drainage. A scaling analysis shows that h d is a function of the drop size R and the capillary numbers of the film ( Ca f ) and drop ( Ca d ), which we estimate by h d = 0.5 R Ca f / ( 1 + 2 Ca d ) . This equation clearly indicates that the drop viscosity needs to be considered when Ca d &gt; 0.1 . These results have implications for industrial systems where very viscous liquids are involved, for example, in 3D printing and heavy oil extraction process.},

We propose to understand the onset of this so-called Leidenfrost effect through an analogy to nonequilibrium systems exhibiting a directed percolation phase transition. When performing impacts on superheated solids, we observe a regime of spatiotemporal intermittency in which localized wet patches coexist with dry regions on the substrate. We report a critical surface temperature, which marks the upper bound of a large range of temperatures in which levitation and contact coexist. In this range, with decreasing temperature, the equilibrium wet fraction increases continuously from zero to one. Also, the statistical properties of the spatiotemporally intermittent regime are in agreement with that of the directed percolation universality class. This analogy allows us to redefine the Leidenfrost temperature and shed light on the physical mechanisms governing the transition to the Leidenfrost state.},

Here, we report the first realization of three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic void space by an all-dielectric photonic crystal possessing vanishing permittivity and permeability simultaneously. The 3D electromagnetic void space offers distinctive functionalities inaccessible to its 2D or acoustic counterparts because of the fundamental changes in topology, which comes from the ascension of dimensionality as well as the transverse nature of electromagnetic waves. In particular, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that the transmission through such a 3D void space is unaffected by its inner boundaries, but highly sensitive to the outer boundaries. This enables many applications such as the impurity “antidoping” effect, outer-boundary-controlled switching, and 3D perfect wave steering.

The persisting localization ensues from a combination of bistability and complex spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics that together permit a locally induced domain of MI to be pinned by a shallow modulation on the plane wave background. We further show that the localized domains of spatiotemporal chaos can be individually addressed—turned on and off at will—and we explore their transport behavior as the strength of the pinning is controlled. Our results reveal new fundamental dynamics at the interface of front dynamics and MI, and offer a route for tailored patterns of noiselike bursts of light.},

Moreover, the precision and throughput of chemical synthesis can ensure a viable route to quantum technological applications. The challenge, however, is that the coupling of molecular vibrations to environmental phonons limits their coherence to picosecond time scales. Here, we improve the optomechanical quality of a molecule by several orders of magnitude through phononic engineering of its surrounding. By dressing a molecule with long-lived high-frequency phonon modes of its nanoscopic environment, we achieve storage and retrieval of photons at millisecond timescales and allow for the emergence of single-photon strong coupling in optomechanics.

Inhomogeneous broadening due to the differential polarizability between the qubit states is suppressed by tuning the tweezer polarization and applied magnetic field to a “magic” angle.

This shielding from the environment in turn hampers a direct electronic access to the magnetic moment. Here, we present the indirect readout of the Dy moment in Bis(phthalocyaninato)dysprosium ( DyPc 2 ) molecules on Au(111) using milli-Kelvin scanning tunneling microscopy. Because of an unpaired electron on the exposed Pc ligand, the molecules show a Kondo resonance that is, however, split by the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the unpaired electron and the Dy angular momentum. Using spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we read out the Dy magnetic moment as a function of the applied magnetic field, exploiting the spin polarization of the exchange-split Kondo state.},

  abstract     = {Tracing ultrafast processes induced by interaction of light with matter is often very challenging. In molecular systems, the initially created electronic coherence becomes damped by the slow nuclear rearrangement on a femtosecond timescale which makes real-time observations of electron dynamics in molecules particularly difficult. In this work, we report an extension of the theory underlying the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) for the case of molecules, including a full account for the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics in the initially created wave packet, and apply it to probe the oscillations of the positive charge created after outer-valence ionization of the propiolic acid molecule. By taking advantage of element-specific core-to-valence transitions induced by x-ray radiation, we show that the resolution of ATAS makes it possible to trace the dynamics of electron density with atomic spatial resolution.},

While the leading order forward positivity bounds are commonly derived from the elastic scattering of two (superposed) external states, we show that, for a generic EFT containing three or more low-energy modes, this approach only gives incomplete bounds. We then identify the allowed parameter space as the dual to a spectrahedron, constructed from crossing symmetries of the amplitude, and show that finding the optimal bounds for a given number of modes is equivalent to a geometric problem: finding the extremal rays of a spectrahedron. We show how this is done analytically for simple cases and numerically formulated as semidefinite programming (SDP) problems for more complicated cases. We demonstrate this approach with a number of well-motivated examples in particle physics and cosmology, including EFTs of scalars, vectors, fermions, and gravitons. In all these cases, we find that the SDP approach leads to results that either improve the previous ones or are completely new. We also find that the SDP approach is numerically much more efficient.},

The standard scenario is that the two-point correlation algebraically decreases with the distance r as g ( r ) ∼ r 2 − d − η , with d the spatial dimension and η the anomalous dimension. Very recently, a logarithmic universality was proposed to describe the extraordinary surface transition of the O ( N ) system. In this logarithmic universality, g ( r ) decays in a power of logarithmic distance as g ( r ) ∼ ( ln r ) − η ^ , dramatically different from the standard scenario. We explore the three-dimensional X Y model by Monte Carlo simulations, and provide strong evidence for the emergence of logarithmic universality. Moreover, we propose that the finite-size scaling of g ( r , L ) has a two-distance behavior: simultaneously containing a large-distance plateau whose height decays logarithmically with L as g ( L ) ∼ ( ln L ) − η ^ ′ as well as the r -dependent term g ( r ) ∼ ( ln r ) − η ^ , with η ^ ′ ≈ η ^ − 1 . The critical exponent η ^ ′ , characterizing the height of the plateau, obeys the scaling relation η ^ ′ = ( N − 1 ) / ( 2 π α ) with the RG parameter α of helicity modulus. Our picture can also explain the recent numerical results of a Heisenberg system. The advances on logarithmic universality significantly expand our understanding of critical universality.},

Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum approximate optimization algorithms that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea of using a classical computer to train a parametrized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that, for every polynomial time algorithm, there are instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large assuming that P ≠ NP . Even for classically tractable systems composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show the optimization to be NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima This means gradient and higher order descent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.},

This is achieved by using strong microwave fields to dress nearby Rydberg states, leading to asymmetric blockade in which control-target interactions are much stronger than control-control and target-target interactions. The implementation of these multiqubit gates can drastically simplify both quantum algorithms and state preparation. To illustrate this, we show that a 25-atom Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state can be created using only three gates with an error of 5.8\%.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the densest random disc packing fraction is an unsolved paradigm problem relevant to a number of disciplines and technologies. One difficulty is that it is ill defined without setting a criterion for the disorder. Another is that the density depends on the packing protocol and the multitude of possible protocol parameters has so far hindered a general solution. A new approach is proposed here. After formulating a well-posed form of the general protocol-independent problem for planar packings of discs, a systematic criterion is proposed to avoid crystalline hexagonal order as well as further topological order. The highest possible random packing fraction is then derived exactly: ϕ RCP = 0.852 525 … . The solution is based on the cell order distribution that is shown to (i) yield directly the packing fraction; (ii) parametrize all possible packing protocols; (iii) make it possible to define and limit all topological disorder. The method is further useful for predicting the highest packing fraction in specific protocols, which is illustrated for a family of simply sheared packings that generate maximum-entropy cell order distributions.},

We show that it is favorable for vacancies to assemble in crystallographic planes, and that such clustering is accompanied by the formation of a charged domain wall. The domain wall has negative bound charge, which compensates the nominal positive charge of the vacancies and leads to a vanishing density of free charge at the wall. This is in contrast to the positively charged domain walls, which are nearly completely compensated by free charge from the bulk. The results thus explain the experimentally observed difference in electronic conductivity of the two types of domain walls, as well as the generic prevalence of charged domain walls in ferroelectrics. Moreover, the explicit demonstration of vacancy driven domain wall formation implies that specific charged domain wall configurations may be realized by bottom-up design for use in domain wall based information processing.},

  abstract     = {Condensed-matter systems provide alternative “vacua” exhibiting emergent low-energy properties drastically different from those of the standard model. A case in point is the emergent quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the fractionalized topological magnet known as quantum spin ice, whose magnetic monopoles set it apart from the familiar QED of the world we live in. Here, we show that the two greatly differ in their fine structure constant α , which parametrizes how strongly matter couples to light: α QSI is more than an order of magnitude greater than α QED ≈ 1 / 137 . Furthermore, α QSI , the emergent speed of light, and all other parameters of the emergent QED, are tunable by engineering the microscopic Hamiltonian. We find that α QSI can be tuned all the way from zero up to what is believed to be the strongest possible coupling beyond which QED confines. In view of the small size of its constrained Hilbert space, this marks out quantum spin ice as an ideal platform for studying exotic quantum field theories and a target for quantum simulation. The large α QSI implies that experiments probing candidate condensed-matter realizations of quantum spin ice should expect to observe phenomena arising due to strong interactions.},

This control has previously been enabled by altering the nanomagnet size and the geometry of their placement. Here we demonstrate that the interactions in artificial spin ice can be further controlled by including a soft ferromagnetic underlayer below the moments. Such a substrate also breaks the symmetry in the array when magnetized, introducing a directional component to the correlations. Using spatially resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy to image the demagnetized ground states, we show that the correlation of the demagnetized states depends on the direction of the underlayer magnetization. Further, the relative interaction strength of nearest and next-nearest neighbors varies significantly with the array geometry. We exploit this feature to induce frustration in an inherently unfrustrated square lattice geometry, demonstrating new possibilities for effective geometries in two-dimensional nanomagnetic systems.},

Systematic angle and frequency-dependent measurements demonstrate that the observed spin-pumping signals arise from resonance-induced spin injection and inverse spin Hall effect in α − Fe 2 O 3 —metal heterostructures, mimicking the behavior of spin pumping in conventional ferromagnet-nonmagnet systems. The pure spin current nature is further corroborated by reversal of the polarity of spin-pumping signals when the spin detector is switched from platinum to tungsten which has an opposite sign of the spin Hall angle.

Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 exhibits highly anisotropic magnon dispersions and linewidths below T C , and paramagnetic excitations above T C .

In contrast to rapidly expanding theoretical studies, high-pressure experiments on hydride superconductors are expensive and technically challenging. Here, we experimentally discovered superconductivity in two new phases, F m 3 ¯ m − CeH 10 (SC-I phase) and P 6 3 / m m c − CeH 9 (SC-II phase) at pressures that are much lower ( &lt; 1 0 0 GPa ) than those needed to stabilize other polyhydride superconductors. Superconductivity was evidenced by a sharp drop of the electrical resistance to zero and decreased critical temperature in deuterated samples and in external magnetic field. SC-I has T c = 1 1 5 K at 95 GPa, showing an expected decrease in further compression due to the decrease of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) coefficient λ (from 2.0 at 100 GPa to 0.8 at 200 GPa). SC-II has T c = 5 7 K at 88 GPa, rapidly increasing to a maximum T c ∼ 1 0 0 K at 130 GPa, and then decreasing in further compression. According to the theoretical calculation, this is due to a maximum of λ at the phase transition from P 6 3 / m m c − CeH 9 into a symmetry-broken modification C 2 / c − CeH 9 . The pressure-temperature conditions of synthesis affect the actual hydrogen content and the actual value of T c . Anomalously low pressures of stability of cerium superhydrides make them appealing for studies of superhydrides and for designing new superhydrides with stability at even lower pressures.},

To unveil the origin of boundary sensitivity, we present exact solutions for one-dimensional non-Hermitian models with generalized boundary conditions and study rigorously the interplay effect of lattice size and boundary terms. Besides the open boundary condition, we identify the existence of non-Hermitian skin effect when one of the boundary hopping terms vanishes. Apart from this critical line on the boundary parameter space, we find that the skin effect is fragile under any tiny boundary perturbation in the thermodynamic limit, although it can survive in a finite size system. Moreover, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian Su-Schreieffer-Heeger model exhibits a new phase diagram in the boundary critical line, which is different from either open or periodical boundary case.},

These “zero Landau level” quantum oscillations (ZQOs) appear in the nodal limit where the zero-field Fermi volume vanishes and have distinctive periodicity and temperature dependence. We link the Landau spectrum of a two-dimensional (2D) nodal semimetal to the Rabi model, and show by exact solution that, across the entire Landau fan, pairs of opposite-parity Landau levels are intertwined in a “serpentine” manner. We propose 2D surfaces of topological crystalline insulators as natural settings for ZQOs. In certain 3D nodal semimetals, ZQOs lead to oscillations of anomaly physics. We propose a transport measurement capable of observing such oscillations, which we demonstrate numerically.},

  abstract     = {Memory or transistor devices based on an electron’s spin rather than its charge degree of freedom offer certain distinct advantages and comprise a cornerstone of spintronics. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new field, valleytronics, which seeks to exploit an electron’s valley index rather than its spin. An important component in this quest would be the ability to control the valley index in a convenient fashion. Here we show that the valley polarization can be switched from zero to 1 by a small reduction in density, simply tuned by a gate bias, in a two-dimensional electron system. This phenomenon, which is akin to Bloch spin ferromagnetism, arises fundamentally as a result of electron-electron interaction in an itinerant, dilute electron system. Essentially, the kinetic energy favors an equal distribution of electrons over the available valleys, whereas the interaction between electrons prefers single-valley occupancy below a critical density. The gate-bias-tuned transition we observe is accompanied by a sudden, twofold change in sample resistance, making the phenomenon of interest for potential valleytronic transistor device applications. Our observation constitutes a quintessential demonstration of valleytronics in a very simple experiment.},

Through the analysis of Berry curvature and topological charge, the QSVHK states are found to be topologically protected by the valley-inversion and time-reversal symmetries. Remarkably, the conductance of QSVHK states remains quantized against both nonmagnetic short- and long-range and magnetic long-range disorder, verified by the Green-function calculations. Based on first-principles results and our fabricated samples, we show that QSVHK states, protected with a gap up to 287 meV, can be realized in bismuthene by alloy engineering, surface functionalization, or electric field, supporting nonvolatile applications of spin-valley filters, valves, and waveguides even at room temperature.},

For long capillaries, with a 1 , condensation is always of type II. In all regimes, capillary condensation is completely suppressed for sufficiently large contact angles. We show that there is an additional continuous phase transition in the condensed liquidlike phase, associated with the depinning of each meniscus as they round the upper open edges of the slit. Finite-size scaling predictions are developed for these transitions and phase boundaries which connect with the fluctuation theories of wetting and filling transitions.

The number of quantum vortices, which are spontaneously created in the quenched gas, exhibits a Poissonian distribution not only for a slow quench in the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling regime but also for a fast quench, in which case the mean vortex number is saturated. This shows that the saturation is not caused by destructive vortex collisions, but by the early-time coarsening in an emerging condensate, which is further supported by the observation that the condensate growth lags the quenching in the saturation regime. Our results demonstrate that the defect saturation is an effect beyond the KZ mechanism, opening a path for studying critical phase transition dynamics using the defect number distribution.},

By suddenly changing the trapping frequency, an axial breathing oscillation is generated, whose behavior changes drastically at the critical Raman coupling. Above the transition, a single mode of hybridized density and spin nature is excited, while below it, we predict a beating effect signaling the excitation of a Goldstone spin-dipole mode.

Two-dimensional star-shaped patterns with l -fold symmetry, ranging from quadrupole ( l = 2 ) to heptagon modes ( l = 7 ), are parametrically excited by modulating the scattering length near the Feshbach resonance. An effective Mathieu equation and Floquet analysis are utilized, relating the instability conditions to the dispersion of the surface modes in a trapped superfluid. Identifying the resonant frequencies of the patterns, we precisely measure the dispersion relation of the collective excitations. The oscillation amplitude of the surface excitations increases exponentially during the modulation. We find that only the l = 6 mode is unstable due to its emergent coupling with the dipole motion of the cloud. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with the mean-field framework. Our work opens a new pathway for generating higher-lying collective excitations with applications, such as the probing of exotic properties of quantum fluids and providing a generation mechanism of quantum turbulence.},

For the first time, an MR-TOF-MS was used on line simultaneously as an isobar separator and as a mass spectrometer, extending the measurements to two isotopes further away from stability than otherwise possible. The ground state masses of Yb 150 , 153 and the excitation energy of Yb m 151 were measured for the first time. As a result, the persistence of the N = 82 shell with almost unmodified shell gap energies is established up to the proton drip line. Furthermore, the puzzling systematics of the h 11 / 2 -excited isomeric states of the N = 81 isotones are unraveled using state-of-the-art mean field calculations.},

In addition, due to the high density of neutron star matter, we should account for nucleon interactions rather than modeling the nucleons as an ideal Fermi gas. Properly incorporating these effects is found to suppress the dark matter capture rate by up to 3 orders of magnitude for the heaviest stars.},

This DM candidate would cause observable departures from standard cosmological evolution. In this work, we combine data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), Lyman- α forest, quasar lensing, stellar streams, and Milky Way satellite abundances to set limits on freeze-in DM masses up to ∼ 20 keV , with the exact constraint depending on whether the DM thermalizes in its own sector.

Random encounters of traveling photons, losses, and technical imperfections make noise an inevitable part of any quantum communication scheme, severely limiting distance, key rate, and environmental conditions in which quantum key distribution can be employed. Using photons entangled in their spatial degree of freedom, we show that the increased noise resistance of high-dimensional entanglement can indeed be harnessed for practical key distribution schemes. We perform quantum key distribution in eight entangled paths at various levels of environmental noise and show key rates that, even after error correction and privacy amplification, still exceed 1 bit per photon pair and furthermore certify a secure key at noise levels that would prohibit comparable qubit based schemes from working.},

Our sampling protocol uses randomized measurement settings generated by a discrete group of fermionic Gaussian unitaries, implementable with linear-depth circuits. We prove that estimating all k -RDM elements to additive precision ϵ requires on the order of ( n k ) k 3 / 2 log ( n ) / ϵ 2 repeated state preparations, which is optimal up to the logarithmic factor. Furthermore, numerical calculations show that our protocol offers a substantial improvement in constant overheads for k ≥ 2 , as compared to prior deterministic strategies.

However, many cases exist in which a sparse representation of the Hamiltonian is known but there is no efficient Pauli representation. We extend VQE to general sparse Hamiltonians. We provide a decomposition of a fermionic second-quantized Hamiltonian into a number of one-sparse, self-inverse, Hermitian terms linear in the number of ladder operator monomials in the second-quantized representation. We provide a decomposition of a general d -sparse Hamiltonian into O ( d 2 ) such terms. In both cases, a single sample of any term can be obtained using two ansatz state preparations and at most six oracle queries. The number of samples required to estimate the expectation value to precision ε scales as ε − 2 as for Pauli-based VQE. This widens the domain of applicability of VQE to systems whose Hamiltonian and other observables are most efficiently described in terms of sparse matrices.},

A fundamental challenge in this context originates from experimental imperfections, which critically limits the number of attainable gates within a reasonable accuracy and therefore the achievable system sizes and simulation times. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm to systematically build optimized quantum circuits for digital quantum simulation upon imposing a strong constraint on the number of quantum gates. With this we consistently obtain quantum circuits that reproduce physical observables with as little as three entangling gates for long times and large system sizes up to 16 qubits. As concrete examples we apply our formalism to a long-range Ising chain and the lattice Schwinger model. Our method demonstrates that digital quantum simulation on noisy intermediate scale quantum devices can be pushed to much larger scale within the current experimental technology by a suitable engineering of quantum circuits using reinforcement learning.},

This raises the question of whether quantum theory can produce results that would be impossible to replicate with any classical causal model, thereby violating a causal inequality. This would be a temporal analog of Bell inequality violation, which proves that no local hidden variable model can replicate quantum results. However, unlike the case of nonlocality, we show that quantum experiments can be simulated by a classical causal model, and therefore cannot violate a causal inequality.},

We elucidate a regime where an ultrathin shell with vanishing bending rigidity imposes its own rest shape on a liquid surface, using experiment and theory. Conceptually, the pressure across the interface “inflates” the shell into its original shape.

While their structural equilibrium properties have attracted wide attention, insight into their dynamics has proven challenging. Here, we investigate the polymerization dynamics of semiflexible polymers in 2D by direct observation of assembling divalent particles, bonded by critical Casimir forces. The reversible critical Casimir force creates living polymerization conditions with tunable chain dissociation, association, and bending rigidity. We find that unlike dilute polymers that show exponential size distributions in excellent agreement with Flory theory, concentrated samples exhibit arrest of rotational and translational diffusion due to a continuous isotropic-to-nematic transition in 2D, slowing down the growth kinetics. These effects are circumvented by the addition of higher-valency particles, cross linking the polymers into networks. Our results connecting polymer flexibility, polymer interactions, and the peculiar isotropic-nematic transition in 2D offer insight into the polymerization processes of synthetic two-dimensional polymers and biopolymers at membranes and interfaces.},

Because of the combination of long coherence times and large interaction strengths, one of the leading experimental platforms for cavity QED involves coupling a superconducting circuit to a 3D microwave cavity. In this work, we realize a 3D multimode circuit QED system with single photon lifetimes of 2 ms across 9 modes of a novel seamless cavity. We demonstrate a variety of protocols for universal single-mode quantum control applicable across all cavity modes, using only a single drive line. We achieve this by developing a straightforward flute method for creating monolithic superconducting microwave cavities that reduces loss while simultaneously allowing control of the mode spectrum and mode-qubit interaction. We highlight the flexibility and ease of implementation of this technique by using it to fabricate a variety of 3D cavity geometries, providing a template for engineering multimode quantum systems with exceptionally low dissipation. This work is an important step towards realizing hardware efficient random access quantum memories and processors, and for exploring quantum many-body physics with photons.},

So far, the full QGT has been measured only in Hermitian systems, where the role of the quantum metric is mostly limited to corrections. On the contrary, in non-Hermitian systems, and, in particular, near exceptional points, the quantum metric is expected to diverge and to often play a dominant role, for example, in the enhanced sensing and in wave packet dynamics. In this Letter, we report the first experimental measurement of the quantum metric in a non-Hermitian system. The specific platform under study is an organic microcavity with exciton-polariton eigenstates, which demonstrate exceptional points. We measure the quantum metric’s divergence, and we determine the scaling exponent n = − 1.01 ± 0.08 , which is in agreement with the theoretical description of second-order exceptional points.},

With phonon pumping, a finite time delay exists for the spin reorientation, reflecting the energy transfer between the lattice and 4 f system. In contrast, an instantaneous response is found for resonant f − f excitation. This suggests that 4 f electronic pumping can directly alter the magnetic anisotropy due to the modification of 4 f − 3 d exchange at femtosecond timescales, without involving lattice thermalization.},

This leads to pair creation, and coalescence, of topological defects of an underlying vector field. The latter makes higher-rank spin liquids, of recent interest in the context of fracton theories, with attendant multifold pinch points in the structure factor, appear naturally. New Coulomb liquids with an abundance of pinch points also arise. We thus establish a new and general route to uncovering exotic Coulomb liquids, via the manipulation of topological defects in momentum space.},

Whereas both regimes have been investigated separately, no study has attempted to reconcile them. For instance, the paradigmatic quantum Heisenberg spin- 1 / 2 chain falls at low temperature within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid framework, while its high-temperature dynamics is superdiffusive and relates to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in 1 + 1 dimensions. This Letter aims at reconciling the two regimes. Building on large-scale matrix product state simulations, we find that they are connected by a temperature-dependent spatiotemporal crossover. As the temperature T is reduced, we show that the onset of superdiffusion takes place at longer length and timescales ∝ 1 / T . This prediction has direct consequences for experiments including nuclear magnetic resonance: it is consistent with earlier measurements on the nearly ideal Heisenberg S = 1 / 2 chain compound Sr 2 CuO 3 , yet calls for new and dedicated experiments.},

In the case of MoS 2 / WSe 2 heterobilayers, the moiré trapping potential has honeycomb symmetry and, consequently, the moiré exciton band structure is the same as that of a Dirac-Weyl fermion, whose mass can be further tuned down to zero with a perpendicularly applied field. Here we show that, analogously to other Dirac-like particles, the moiré exciton exhibits a trembling motion, also known as Zitterbewegung , whose long timescales are compatible with current experimental techniques for exciton dynamics. This promotes the study of the dynamics of moiré excitons in van der Waals heterostructures as an advantageous solid-state platform to probe Zitterbewegung , broadly tunable by gating and interlayer twist angle.},

For Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), which has a tunable band gap, the existence of midgap states induced by dopants or adatoms has been investigated theoretically and observed indirectly in electron transport experiments. Here, we characterize BLG midgap states in real space, with atomic-scale resolution with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We show that the midgap states in BLG—for which we demonstrate gate tunability—appear when the dopant is hosted on the nondimer sublattice sites. We further evidence the presence of narrow resonances at the onset of the high-energy bands (valence or conduction, depending on the dopant type) when the dopants lie on the dimer sublattice sites. Our results are supported by tight-binding calculations that agree remarkably well with the experimental findings.},

An immediate outcome of this view is a prediction for a new mechanical transition: the buckling-fracture transition. Using responsive gel strips that are subjected to nonuniform osmotic stress, we show the existence of the transition: Thin plates do not fracture. Instead, they release energy via buckling, even at strains that can be orders of magnitude larger than the Griffith fracture criterion. The analysis of the system reveals the dependence of the transition on system’s parameters and agrees well with experimental results. Finally, we suggest a new description of a mode I crack as a line distribution of Gaussian curvature. It is thus exchangeable with extrinsic generation of curvature via buckling. The work opens the way for the study of mechanical problems within a single nonlinear framework. It suggests that fracture driven by internal stresses can be completely avoided by a proper geometrical design.},

The one space, one time ( 1 + 1 ) nonlinear Schrödinger equation is often used to model rogue waves; it is an envelope description of plane waves and admits the so-called Pergerine and Kuznetov-Ma soliton solutions. However, in deep water waves and certain electromagnetic systems where there are two significant transverse dimensions, the 2 + 1 hyperbolic nonlinear Schrödinger equation is the appropriate wave envelope description. Here we show that these rogue wave solutions suffer from strong transverse instability at long and short frequencies. Moreover, the stability of the Peregrine soliton is found to coincide with that of the background plane wave. These results indicate that, when applicable, transverse dimensions must be taken into account when investigating rogue wave pheneomena.},

We base these conclusions on coupled-channel statistical calculations that include the effects of hyperfine contact and magnetic-field-induced Zeeman interactions on ultracold chemical reactions of hyperfine-resolved ground-state Na and the triplet NaLi ( a Σ 3 + ) producing singlet Na 2 ( Σ 1 g + ) and a Li atom. We find that the reaction rates are sensitive to the initial hyperfine states of the reactants. The chemical reaction of fully spin-polarized, high-spin states of rotationless NaLi ( a Σ 3 + , v = 0 , N = 0 ) molecules with fully spin-polarized Na is suppressed by a factor of 10–100 compared to that of unpolarized reactants. We interpret these findings within the adiabatic state model, which treats the reaction as a sequence of nonadiabatic transitions between the initial nonreactive high-spin state and the final low-spin states of the reaction complex. In addition, we show that magnetic Feshbach resonances can similarly change reaction rate coefficients by several orders of magnitude. Some of these resonances are due to resonant trimer bound states dissociating to the N = 2 rotational state of NaLi ( a Σ 3 + , v = 0 ) and would thus exist in systems without hyperfine interactions.},

Here we present a detailed study of heavy polarons in a one-dimensional Bose gas by formulating a nonperturbative theory and complementing it with exact numerical simulations. We develop an analytic approach for weak boson-boson interactions and arbitrarily strong impurity-boson couplings. Our approach is based on a mean-field theory that accounts for deformations of the superfluid by the impurities and in this way minimizes quantum fluctuations. The mean-field equations are solved exactly in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, leading to an analytic expression for the interaction potential of heavy polarons, which is found to be in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results. In the strong coupling limit, the potential substantially deviates from the exponential form valid for weak coupling and has a linear shape at short distances. Taking into account the leading-order Born-Huang corrections, we calculate bipolaron binding energies for impurity-boson mass ratios as low as 3 and find excellent agreement with QMC results.},

Here, we provide a novel method to search for magnetic monopoles by detecting the monopole moment of Earth’s magnetic field. Using over six years of public geomagnetic field data obtained by the Swarm satellites, we apply Gauss’s law to measure the total magnetic flux, which is proportional to the total magnetic charge inside Earth. To account for the secular variation of satellite altitudes, we define an altitude-rescaled magnetic flux to reduce the dominant magnetic dipole contribution. The measured magnetic flux is consistent with the existing magnetic field model that does not contain a monopole moment term. We therefore set an upper limit on the magnetic field strength at Earth’s surface from magnetic monopoles to be | B m | &lt; 0.13 nT at 95\% confidence level, which is less than 2 × 10 − 6 of Earth’s magnetic field strength. This constrains the abundance of magnetically charged objects, including magnetic black holes with large magnetic charges.},

  abstract     = {Holographic duality provides a description of strongly coupled quantum systems in terms of weakly coupled gravitational theories in a higher-dimensional space. It is a challenge, however, to quantitatively determine the physical parameters of the quantum systems corresponding to generic holographic theories. Here, we address this problem for the two-dimensional holographic superfluid, known to exhibit strong dissipation. We numerically simulate the motion of a vortex dipole and perform a high-precision matching of the corresponding dynamics resulting from the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Excellent agreement is found for the vortex core shape and the spatiotemporal trajectories. A further comparison to the Hall-Vinen-Iordanskii equations for point vortices interacting with the superfluid allows us to determine the friction parameters of the holographic superfluid. Our results suggest that holographic vortex dynamics can be applied to experimentally accessible superfluids like strongly coupled ultracold Bose gases or thin helium films with temperatures in the Kelvin range. This would make holographic far-from-equilibrium dynamics and turbulence amenable to experimental tests.},

We remove the spurious contributions from the conversion of intensity into temperature and arrive at measurements that are independent from the CMB dipole itself for both temperature and polarization maps and both SMICA and NILC component-separation methods. Combining these new measurements with the dipole one, we get the first constraints on the intrinsic CMB dipole. Assuming a standard dipolar lensing contribution, we can put an upper limit on the intrinsic amplitude: 3.7 mK (95\% confidence interval). We estimate the peculiar velocity of the Solar System without assuming a negligible intrinsic dipole contribution: v = ( 300 − 93 + 111 ) km / s with ( l , b ) = ( 276 ± 33 , 51 ± 19 ) ° (SMICA), and v = ( 296 − 88 + 111 ) km / s with ( l , b ) = ( 280 ± 33 , 50 ± 20 ) ° (NILC) with negligible systematic contributions.

For one sign of the coupling parameter, nonspinning vacuum black holes are unstable to developing scalar hair, while for the other, instability only sets in for black holes with sufficiently large spin. We study scalarization in both cases, demonstrating that there is a range of parameter space where the theory maintains hyperbolic evolution and for which the instability saturates in a scalarized black hole that is stable without symmetry assumptions. However, this parameter space range is significantly smaller than the range for which stationary scalarized black hole solutions exist. We show how different choices for the subleading behavior of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling affect the dynamics of the instability and the final state, or lack thereof. Finally, we present mergers of binary black holes and demonstrate the imprint of the scalar hair in the gravitational radiation.},

Generators of the Love symmetry are globally well defined for any value of black hole spin. Generic regular solutions of the near zone equation for linearized perturbations form infinite-dimensional S L ( 2 , R ) representations. In some special cases, these are highest weight representations. This situation corresponds to vanishing Love numbers.

When the units are prepared in a mixture of energy eigenstates, the energy gain in the battery can be described by a classical random walk, where both average energy and variance grow linearly with time. Conversely, when the qubits contain quantum coherence, interference effects buildup in the battery and lead to a faster spreading of the energy distribution, reminiscent of a quantum random walk. This can be exploited for faster and more efficient charging of a battery initialized in the ground state. Specifically, we show that coherent protocols can yield higher charging power than any possible incoherent strategy, demonstrating a quantum speed-up at the level of a single battery. Finally, we characterize the amount of extractable work from the battery through the notion of ergotropy.},

Our approach connects computational complexity with phase transitions, providing a physical interpretation of quantum speedup.

As hardware platforms for quantum computing continue to mature in size and capability, it is imperative to enable quantum circuits beyond their conventional construction. Here we break into the realm of dynamic quantum circuits on a superconducting-based quantum system. Dynamic quantum circuits not only involve the evolution of the quantum state throughout the computation but also periodic measurements of qubits midcircuit and concurrent processing of the resulting classical information on timescales shorter than the execution times of the circuits. Using noisy quantum hardware, we explore one of the most fundamental quantum algorithms, quantum phase estimation, in its adaptive version, which exploits dynamic circuits, and compare the results to a nonadaptive implementation of the same algorithm. We demonstrate that the version of real-time quantum computing with dynamic circuits can yield results comparable to an approach involving classical asynchronous postprocessing, thus opening the door to a new realm of available algorithms on real quantum systems.},

The bound leads to further insights beyond the previous bounds on concrete evolution modes of the quantum system, such as horizontal or parallel transition or horizontal joining of the two quantum states in Hilbert space. The bound is linked to the feasibility of the evolutions of the state vectors, and provides a tighter upper bound. In addition, the generalized Margolus-Levitin bound is discussed.},

In this Letter, we demonstrate a new kind of dissipationless phenomenon arising in mixtures of interacting bosons in optical lattices. We point out that for a particular class of optical lattices, bosons condense in a state where one of the components’ superflow results in dissipationless mass flow of the other component, in a direction different from either of the components’ superfluid velocities. The free-energy density of these systems contains a vector productlike interaction of superfluid velocities, producing the dissipationless noncollinear entrainment.

  abstract     = {The quantum regression theorem (QRT) is the most widely used tool for calculating multitime correlation functions for the assessment of quantum emitters. It is an approximate method based on a Markov assumption for environmental coupling. In this Letter we quantify properties of photons emitted from a single quantum dot coupled to phonons. For the single-photon purity and the indistinguishability, we compare numerically exact path-integral results with those obtained from the QRT. It is demonstrated that the QRT systematically overestimates the influence of the environment for typical quantum dots used in quantum information technology.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to light, matter-wave optics of quantum gases deals with interactions even in free space and for ensembles comprising millions of atoms. We exploit these interactions in a quantum degenerate gas as an adjustable lens for coherent atom optics. By combining an interaction-driven quadrupole-mode excitation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with a magnetic lens, we form a time-domain matter-wave lens system. The focus is tuned by the strength of the lensing potential and the oscillatory phase of the quadrupole mode. By placing the focus at infinity, we lower the total internal kinetic energy of a BEC comprising 101(37) thousand atoms in three dimensions to 3 / 2 k B · 3 8 − 7 + 6 pK . Our method paves the way for free-fall experiments lasting ten or more seconds as envisioned for tests of fundamental physics and high-precision BEC interferometry, as well as opens up a new kinetic energy regime.},

Based on the investigations of the linear responses of native proteins, the origin of such a correspondence is elucidated. It is essential that the noise- and mutation-induced deformations of the proteins are restricted on a common low-dimensional subspace, as confirmed from the data. These results suggest an evolutionary mechanism of the proteins gaining both dynamical flexibility and evolutionary structural variability.},

Physically, fibrosis can be viewed as a large number of small obstacles in an excitable medium, which may create nonlinear wave turbulence or reentry. The relation between the specific texture of fibrosis and the onset of reentry is of great theoretical and practical importance. Here, we present a conceptual framework which combines functional aspects of propagation manifested as conduction blocks, with reentry wavelength and geometrical clusters of fibrosis. We formulate them into the single concept of minimal functional cluster and through extensive simulations show that it characterizes the path of reexcitation accurately, and importantly its size distribution quantitatively predicts the reentry probability for different fibrosis densities and tissue excitabilities.},

Over the large part of field and temperature values corresponding to almost 6 orders of magnitude in time, multiferroic domain inversion is thus dominated by a single process, the domain wall motion.

The results reveal an increase of electron thermalization time with excitation energy density, contrary to the Fermi-liquid behavior of the decrease of thermalization time associated with the heating of conduction electrons. This is attributed to the severe mitigation of photoexcitation by Auger decay. The study also uncovers the shortening of 5 d hole lifetime with the increase of photoexcitation rates.

The dynamics of the changes are apparent in time-resolved synchrotron x-ray scattering studies of the domain diffuse scattering. Tilting occurs at 298 K, a temperature at which the a / b and a / c domain phases coexist but is absent at 343 K in the better ordered single-phase a / c regime. Phase coexistence at 298 K leads to increased domain-wall charge density, and thus a larger screening effect than in the single-phase regime.

We develop a microscopic model of the strong coupling in the two-dimensional magnetic lattice, which enables us to elucidate the nature of the emergent quasiparticle.

In this Letter, we propose an alternative source of migration barrier for skyrmion transport, i.e., a local lattice distortion field due to spin-lattice coupling, which can lead to the same Arrhenius diffusion behavior in defect-free skyrmion materials.

To explore the possible superconducting state in a doped Mott insulator, we study the square-lattice t − J model with both the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor electron hoppings and spin interactions. By using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation with imposing charge U ( 1 ) and spin S U ( 2 ) symmetries on the six-leg cylinders, we establish a quantum phase diagram including three phases: a stripe charge density wave phase, a superconducting phase without static charge order, and a superconducting phase coexistent with a weak charge stripe order. Crucially, we demonstrate that the superconducting phase has a power-law pairing correlation that decays much slower than the charge density and spin correlations, which is a quasi-1D descendant of the uniform d -wave superconductor in two dimensions. These findings reveal that enhanced charge and spin fluctuations with optimal doping is able to produce robust d -wave superconductivity in doped Mott insulators, providing a foundation for connecting theories of superconductivity to models of strongly correlated systems.},

Jarillo-Herrero, Pauli-limit violation and re-entrant superconductivity in moiré graphene, Nature (London) 595 , 526 (2021).] that superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene survives to in-plane magnetic fields that are well in excess of the Pauli limit, and much stronger than the in-plane critical magnetic fields of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. The difference is surprising because twisted bilayers and trilayers both support the magic-angle flat bands thought to be the fountainhead of twisted graphene superconductivity. We show here that the difference in critical magnetic fields can be traced to a C 2 M h symmetry in trilayers that survives in-plane magnetic fields, and also relative displacements between top and bottom layers that are not under experimental control at present. An gate electric field breaks the C 2 M h symmetry and therefore limits the in-plane critical magnetic field.},

Here, we investigate radiation properties of physical systems composed of a single ultrahigh permittivity dielectric hollow disk excited by electric or magnetic pointlike dipole antennas, placed inside the inner bore. Using analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate that such systems can support anapole states with total suppression of far-field radiation and thereby exhibit the properties of electric or magnetic nonradiating sources. It is shown that the suppression of the far-field radiated power is a result of the destructive interference between radiative contributions of the pointlike dipole antennas and the corresponding induced dipole moments of the hollow disk. The experimental investigation of the nonradiating electric source has been performed to confirm our theoretical predictions. Our results pave the way to create and realize compact nonradiative sources for applications in modern wireless power transfer systems, sensors, RFID tags, and medical technologies.},

Existing theories, however, are restricted to either weakly coupled nanostructures or phase-coherent transport in mesoscopic conductors. Here, we consider an interacting quantum dot and develop a real-time diagrammatic theory of waiting time distributions that can treat the interesting regime, in which both interaction effects and higher-order tunneling processes are important. Specifically, we find that our quantum-mechanical theory captures higher-order tunneling processes at low temperatures, which are not included in a classical description, and which dramatically affect the waiting times by allowing fast tunneling processes inside the Coulomb blockade region. Our work paves the way for systematic investigations of temporal fluctuations in interacting quantum systems, for example close to a Kondo resonance or in a Luttinger liquid.},

In addition to the nanosize effect, the surface-diffusion-mediated topology evolution and the large-scale crystal-lattice coherency arising from the large grain size are also decisive to the mechanical response of dealloyed NPGs, which might be universal for self-organized nanonetwork materials.},

Critical HQV shedding is further investigated using a pulsed linear motion of the obstacle, and we identify two critical velocities to create HQVs with different core magnetization.},

  abstract     = {In a 2D turbulent fluid containing pointlike vortices, Lars Onsager predicted that adding energy to the fluid can lead to the formation of persistent clusters of like-signed vortices, i.e., Onsager vortex (OV) clusters. In the evolution of 2D superfluid turbulence in a uniform disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), it was discovered that a pair of OV clusters with opposite signs can form without any energy input. This striking spontaneous order was explained as being due to a vortex evaporative-heating mechanism, i.e., annihilations of vortex-antivortex pairs which remove the lowest-energy vortices and thereby boost the mean energy per vortex. However, in our search for exotic OV states in a boundaryless 2D spherical BEC, we found that OV clusters never form despite the annihilations of vortex pairs. Our analysis reveals that contrary to the general belief, vortex-pair annihilation emits intense sound waves, which damp the motion of all vortices and hence suppress the formation of OV clusters. We also present unequivocal evidence showing that the true mechanism underlying the observed spontaneous OV state is the vortices exiting the BEC boundaries. Uncovering this mechanism paves the way for a comprehensive understanding of emergent vortex orders in 2D manifolds of superfluids driven far from equilibrium.},

Understanding their dynamics is important in a variety of situations ranging from industrial processes to pure and applied science. In all these fields, a deep knowledge of the statistical structure of temperature and velocity space-time fluctuations is of paramount importance to construct models of chemical reaction (in chemistry) and of condensation of virus-containing droplets (in virology and/or biophysics) and optimal mixing strategies in industrial applications. As a matter of fact, results of turbulence in a puff are confined to bulk properties (i.e., average puff velocity and typical decay or growth time) and date back to the second half of the 20th century. There is, thus, a huge gap to fill to pass from bulk properties to two-point statistical observables. Here, we fill this gap by exploiting theory and numerics in concert to predict and validate the space-time scaling behaviors of both velocity and temperature structure functions including intermittency corrections. Excellent agreement between theory and simulations is found. Our results are expected to have a profound impact on developing evaporation models for virus-containing droplets carried by a turbulent puff, with benefits to the comprehension of the airborne route of virus contagion.},

We develop a self-consistent theoretical model that considers all aspects of comb dynamics: band structure, electron transport, and cavity dynamics. In quantum cascade lasers, Bloch gain gives rise to a giant Kerr nonlinearity, which enables frequency modulated combs and serves as the physical origin of the linewidth enhancement factor.

  abstract     = {Synthetic-space topological insulators are topological systems with at least one spatial dimension replaced by a periodic arrangement of modes, in the form of a ladder of energy levels, cavity modes, or some other sequence of modes. Such systems can significantly enrich the physics of topological insulators, in facilitating higher dimensions, nonlocal coupling, and more. Thus far, all synthetic-space topological insulators relied on active modulation to facilitate transport in the synthetic dimensions. Here, we propose dynamically invariant synthetic-space photonic topological insulators: a two-dimensional evolution-invariant photonic structure exhibiting topological properties in synthetic dimensions. This nonmagnetic structure is static, lacking any kind of modulation in the evolution coordinate, yet it displays an effective magnetic field in synthetic space, characterized by a Chern number of one. We study the evolution of topological states along the edge, and on the interface between two such structures with opposite synthetic-space chirality, and demonstrate their robust unidirectional propagation in the presence of defects and disorder. Such topological structures can be realized in photonics and cold atoms and provide a fundamentally new mechanism for topological insulators.},

  abstract     = {Franson interferometry is a well-known quantum measurement technique for probing photon-pair frequency correlations that is often used to certify time-energy entanglement. We demonstrate, for the first time, the complementary technique in the time basis called conjugate-Franson interferometry. It measures photon-pair arrival-time correlations, thus providing a valuable addition to the quantum toolbox. We obtain a conjugate-Franson interference visibility of 96 ± 1\% without background subtraction for entangled photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Our measured result surpasses the quantum-classical threshold by 25 standard deviations and validates the conjugate-Franson interferometer (CFI) as an alternative method for certifying time-energy entanglement. Moreover, the CFI visibility is a function of the biphoton’s joint temporal intensity, and is therefore sensitive to that state’s spectral phase variation: something that is not the case for Franson interferometry or Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry. We highlight the CFI’s utility by measuring its visibilities for two different biphoton states: one without and the other with spectral phase variation, observing a 21\% reduction in the CFI visibility for the latter. The CFI is potentially useful for applications in areas of photonic entanglement, quantum communications, and quantum networking.},

We show that using a fully quantum parametric amplifier can cause the simultaneous decay of two atoms and, in turn, create stabilized atomic Schrödinger cat states. Remarkably, even with modest parameters these intracavity atomic cat states can have an extremely long lifetime, up to 4 orders of magnitude longer than that of intracavity photonic cat states under the same parameter conditions, reaching tens of milliseconds . This lifetime of atomic cat states is ultimately limited to several seconds by extremely weak spin relaxation and thermal noise. Our work opens up a new way toward the long-standing goal of generating large-size and long-lived cat states, with immediate interests both in fundamental studies and noise-immune quantum technologies.},

First, we experimentally demonstrate that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement source coded on OAM modes can be used in a single channel to realize the QDC scheme. Then, we implement the OAM MQDC scheme by using the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement source coded on OAM superposition modes. In the end, we make an explicit comparison of channel capacities for four different schemes and find that the channel capacity of the OAM MQDC scheme is substantially enhanced compared to the conventional QDC scheme without multiplexing. The channel capacity of our OAM MQDC scheme can be further improved by increasing the squeezing parameter and the number of multiplexed OAM modes in the channel. Our results open an avenue to construct high-capacity quantum communication networks.},

We show that the timing of multiple ionization steps leading to a particular reaction product and, thus, the product’s final kinetic energy, is determined by the pulse duration rather than the pulse energy or intensity. While the overall degree of ionization is mainly defined by the pulse energy, our measurement reveals that the yield of the fragments with the highest charge states is enhanced for short pulse durations, in contrast to earlier observations for atoms and small molecules in the soft x-ray domain. We attribute this effect to a decreased charge transfer efficiency at larger internuclear separations, which are reached during longer pulses.},

A significant enhancement, relative to a pythia simulation of p + p collisions, is observed in the D s ± / D 0 yield ratio in Au + Au collisions over a large range of collision centralities. Model calculations incorporating abundant strange-quark production in the quark-gluon plasma and coalescence hadronization qualitatively reproduce the data. The transverse-momentum integrated yield ratio of D s ± / D 0 at midrapidity is consistent with a prediction from a statistical hadronization model with the parameters constrained by the yields of light and strange hadrons measured at the same collision energy.

As a paradigmatic model, we consider the three-dimensional Abelian-Higgs (AH) model with an N -component scalar field and a noncompact gauge field, which is invariant under U(1) gauge and SU ( N ) transformations. We consider gauge-symmetry breaking perturbations that are quadratic in the gauge field, such as a photon mass term and determine their effect on the critical behavior of the gauge-invariant model, focusing mainly on the continuous transitions associated with the charged fixed point of the AH field theory. We discuss their relevance and compute the (gauge-dependent) exponents that parametrize the departure from the critical behavior (continuum limit) of the gauge-invariant model. We also address the critical behavior of lattice AH models with broken gauge symmetry, showing an effective enlargement of the global symmetry, from U ( N ) to O ( 2 N ) , which reflects a peculiar cyclic renormalization-group flow in the space of the lattice AH parameters and of the photon mass.},

Recently, quench experiments in Rydberg atom arrays [Bluvstein et al. Science 371 , 1355 (2021) ] demonstrated that coherent revivals associated with quantum many-body scars can be stabilized by periodic driving, generating stable subharmonic responses over a wide parameter regime. We analyze a simple, related model where these phenomena originate from spatiotemporal ordering in an effective Floquet unitary, corresponding to discrete time-crystalline behavior in a prethermal regime. Unlike conventional discrete time crystals, the subharmonic response exists only for Néel-like initial states, associated with quantum scars. We predict robustness to perturbations and identify emergent timescales that could be observed in future experiments. Our results suggest a route to controlling entanglement in interacting quantum systems by combining periodic driving with many-body scars.},

We numerically study dynamics of fermions on disordered one-dimensional potentials exhibiting localization and find dynamical one-parameter scaling for surface roughness, which represents particle-number fluctuations at a given length scale, and for entanglement entropy when the system is in delocalized phases. This dynamical scaling corresponds to the Family-Vicsek scaling originally developed in classical surface growth, and the associated scaling exponents depend on the type of disorder. Notably, we find that partially localized states in the delocalized phase of the random-dimer model lead to anomalous scaling, where destructive interference unique to quantum systems leads to exponents unknown for classical systems and clean systems.},

The crucial idea is using the quantum Hilbert space as a quantum-enhanced feature space in machine learning models. Although the quantum feature map has demonstrated its capability when combined with linear classification models in some specific applications, its expressive power from the theoretical perspective remains unknown. We prove that the machine learning models induced from the quantum-enhanced feature space are universal approximators of continuous functions under typical quantum feature maps. We also study the capability of quantum feature maps in the classification of disjoint regions. Our work enables an important theoretical analysis to ensure that machine learning algorithms based on quantum feature maps can handle a broad class of machine learning tasks.

This family increases the complexity of ancilla construction in exchange for reducing the rounds of measurement required to fault tolerantly measure the error. We then apply this construction to the toric code of size L × L and find that blocks of size m × m can be used to decode errors in O ( L / m ) rounds of measurements. Our method can be applied to any Calderbank-Shor-Steane code and presents a new direction for optimizing fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

Atom gas microscopes are crucial for this as they offer single-site density resolution, unparalleled in other quantum many-body systems. However, currently a direct measurement of local coherent currents is out of reach. In this Letter, we show how to achieve that by measuring densities that are altered in response to quenches to noninteracting dynamics, e.g., after tilting the optical lattice. For this, we establish a data analysis method solving the closed set of equations relating tunneling currents and atom number dynamics, allowing us to reliably recover the full covariance matrix, including off-diagonal terms representing coherent currents. The signal processing builds upon semidefinite optimization, providing bona fide covariance matrices optimally matching the observed data. We demonstrate how the obtained information about noncommuting observables allows one to quantify entanglement at finite temperature, which opens up the possibility to study quantum correlations in quantum simulations going beyond classical capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Several techniques have been recently introduced to mitigate errors in near-term quantum computers without the overhead required by quantum error correcting codes. While most of the focus has been on gate errors, measurement errors are significantly larger than gate errors on some platforms. A widely used transition matrix error mitigation (TMEM) technique uses measured transition probabilities between initial and final classical states to correct subsequently measured data. However from a rigorous perspective, the noisy measurement should be calibrated with perfectly prepared initial states, and the presence of any state-preparation error corrupts the resulting mitigation. Here we develop a measurement error mitigation technique, a conditionally rigorous TMEM, that is not sensitive to state-preparation errors and thus avoids this limitation. We demonstrate the importance of the technique for high-precision measurement and for quantum foundations experiments by measuring Mermin polynomials on IBM Q superconducting qubits. An extension of the technique allows one to correct for both state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors in expectation values as well; we illustrate this by giving a protocol for fully SPAM-corrected quantum process tomography.},

From the measured spin textures with varying parameters, we observe both integer and fractional winding numbers. The non-Hermitian topological phase with fractional winding number cannot be continuously deformed to any Hermitian topological phase and is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems.

Recent years have seen an explosion of methods for making such a prediction, often via the application of increasingly complex machine learning techniques. The best predictions so far have involved so-called Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) whose accuracy comes at a cost of models that involve on the order of 10 5 fit parameters. In this Letter, we propose that the key structural ingredient to the GNN method is its ability to consider not only the local structure around a central particle, but also averaged structural features centered around nearby particles. We demonstrate that this insight can be exploited to design a significantly more efficient model that provides essentially the same predictive power at a fraction of the computational complexity (approximately 1000 fit parameters), and demonstrate its success by fitting the dynamic propensity of Kob-Andersen and binary hard-sphere mixtures. We then use this to make predictions regarding the importance of radial and angular descriptors in the dynamics of both models.},

The nonequilibrium drive breaks the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the 2D XY model into a mosaic of ordered domains of controllable size and results in self-propelled vortices that generically unbind at any temperature, featuring superdiffusion ⟨ r 2 ( t ) ⟩ ∼ t 3 / 2 with a Gaussian distribution of displacements. Our work provides a simple framework to investigate topological defects in nonequilibrium matter and sheds new light on the problem of synchronization of locally coupled oscillators.},

The lowest one elastically transforms to the ferroelectric orthorhombic structure via a shear deformation, overcoming an energy barrier, which is more than twice lower than in the stoichiometric hafnia.

In particular, remote generation and manipulation of Schrödinger cat states are particularly interesting for the development of long-distance and large-scale quantum information processing. Here, we propose an approach to remotely prepare magnon even or odd cat states by performing local non-Gaussian operations on the optical mode that is entangled with the magnon mode through pulsed optomagnonic interaction. By evaluating key properties of the resulting cat states, we show that for experimentally feasible parameters, they are generated with both high fidelity and nonclassicality, as well as with a size large enough to be useful for quantum technologies. Furthermore, the effects of experimental imperfections such as the error of projective measurements and dark count when performing single-photon operations have been discussed, where the lifetime of the created magnon cat states is expected to be t ∼ 1 μ s .},

Utilizing a subangstrom convergent electron beam in the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), beam-position-dependent chiral electron energy-loss spectra (EELS), carrying the EMCD signals referring to magnetization in three Cartesian directions, can be obtained during the scanning across the atomic planes. The atomic resolution EMCD signals from all of three directions can be separately obtained simply by moving the EELS detector. Moreover, the EMCD signals can be remarkably enhanced using a defocused electron beam, relieving the issues of low signal intensity and signal-to-noise-ratio especially at atomic resolution. Our proposed method is compatible with the setup of the widely used atomic resolution STEM-EELS technique and provides a straightforward way to achieve 3D magnetic measurement at atomic scale on newly developing magnetic-field-free TEM.},

However, the origin of the interfacial electron gas, which becomes superconducting at low temperatures, remains elusive. Taking the LaAlO 3 / KTaO 3 ( 1 1 1 ) interface as an example, we have demonstrated that there exists a critical LaAlO 3 thickness of ∼ 3 nm . Namely, a thinner LaAlO 3 film will give rise to an insulating but not conducting (or superconducting) interface. By in situ transport measurements during growth, we have also revealed that the critical thickness can be suppressed if exposure to oxygen is avoided. These observations, together with other control experiments, suggest strongly that the origination of the electron gas is dominated by the electron transfer that is from oxygen vacancies in the LaAlO 3 film to the KTaO 3 substrate.},

  abstract     = {In a closed system, it is well known that the time-reversal symmetry can lead to Kramers degeneracy and protect nontrivial topological states such as the quantum spin Hall insulator. In this Letter, we address the issue of whether these effects are stable against coupling to the environment, provided that both the environment and the coupling to the environment also respect time-reversal symmetry. By employing a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with the Langevin noise term and utilizing the non-Hermitian linear response theory, we show that the spectral functions for Kramers degenerate states can be split by dissipation, and the backscattering between counterpropagating edge states can be induced by dissipation. The latter leads to the absence of accurate quantization of conductance in the case of the quantum spin Hall effect. As an example, we demonstrate this concretely with the Kane-Mele model. Our study can also include interacting topological phases protected by time-reversal symmetry.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing mystery of fundamental importance in correlated electron physics is to understand strange non-Fermi liquid metals that are seen in diverse quantum materials. A striking experimental feature of these metals is a resistivity that is linear in temperature ( T ). In this Letter we ask what it takes to obtain such non-Fermi liquid physics down to zero temperature in a translation invariant metal. If in addition the full frequency ( ω ) dependent conductivity satisfies ω / T scaling, we argue that the T -linear resistivity must come from the intrinsic physics of the low energy fixed point. Combining with earlier arguments that compressible translation invariant metals are “ersatz Fermi liquids” with an infinite number of emergent conserved quantities, we obtain powerful and practical conclusions. We show that there is necessarily a diverging susceptibility for an operator that is odd under inversion and time reversal symmetries, and has zero crystal momentum. We discuss a few other experimental consequences of our arguments, as well as potential loopholes, which necessarily imply other exotic phenomena.},

  abstract     = {According to Landau’s Fermi liquid theory, the main properties of the quasiparticle excitations of an electron gas are embodied in the effective mass m * , which determines the energy of a single quasiparticle, and the Landau interaction function, which indicates how the energy of a quasiparticle is modified by the presence of other quasiparticles. This simple paradigm underlies most of our current understanding of the physical and chemical behavior of metallic systems. The quasiparticle effective mass of the three-dimensional homogeneous electron gas has been the subject of theoretical controversy, and there is a lack of experimental data. In this Letter, we deploy diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods to calculate m * as a function of density for paramagnetic and ferromagnetic three-dimensional homogeneous electron gases. The DMC results indicate that m * decreases when the density is reduced, especially in the ferromagnetic case. The DMC quasiparticle energy bands exclude the possibility of a reduction in the occupied bandwidth relative to that of the free-electron model at density parameter r s = 4 , which corresponds to Na metal.},

This holds, in particular, for the ordered phases: DCFs contain information about the local structure including defects and encode the thermodynamic properties of crystalline solids; they open a route to the elastic constants beyond low temperature expansions. Via a demanding numerical approach, we have explicitly calculated for the first time the DCF of a solid: based on the fundamental measure concept, we provide results for the DCF of a hard sphere crystal. We demonstrate that this function differs at coexistence significantly from its liquid counterpart—both in shape as well as in its order of magnitude—because it is dominated by vacancies. We provide evidence that the traditional use of liquid DCFs in functional Taylor expansions of the free energy is conceptually wrong and show that the emergent elastic constants are in good agreement with simulation-based results.},

Its generation has attracted much attention recently. It was reported that N two-level systems (TLSs) located near a one-dimensional waveguide can generate SS by using the mediation effect of the waveguide. However, a coherent driving on each TLS is used to stabilize the SS, which raises a high requirement for experiments. We here propose a scheme to generate stable SS resorting to neither the spin-spin coupling nor the coherent driving on the TLSs. Incorporating the mediation role of the common waveguide and the technique of squeezed-reservoir engineering, our scheme exhibits the advantages over previous ones in the scaling relation of the SS parameter with the number of the TLSs. The long-range correlation feature of the generated SS along the waveguide in our scheme may endow it with certain superiority in quantum sensing, e.g., improving the sensing efficiency of spatially unidentified weak magnetic fields.},

On this basis, we observe the phase transition at exceptional points, energy-difference conservation, and synchronized power oscillation.

Using this framework, we develop a new, general protocol for trapped ion transport, separation, and merging. We show that motional squeezing can prepare an ion wave packet to enable transfer from the ground state of one trapping potential to another. The framework and protocol are applicable if the potential is harmonic over the extent of the ion wave packets at all times. As illustrations, we discuss two specific operations: changing the strength of the confining potential for a single ion and separating same-species ions with their mutual Coulomb force. Both of these operations are, ideally, free of residual motional excitation.},

With a mass too close to and a width smaller than the axial-vector ground state a 1 ( 1260 ) , it was immediately interpreted as a new light exotic meson, similar to the X , Y , Z states in the hidden-charm sector. We show that a resonancelike signal fully matching the experimental data is produced by the decay of the a 1 ( 1260 ) resonance into K * ( → K π ) K ¯ and subsequent rescattering through a triangle singularity into the coupled f 0 ( 980 ) π channel. The amplitude for this process is calculated using a new approach based on dispersion relations. The triangle-singularity model is fitted to the partial-wave data of the COMPASS experiment. Despite having fewer parameters, this fit shows a slightly better quality than the one using a resonance hypothesis and thus eliminates the need for an additional resonance in order to describe the data. We thereby demonstrate for the first time in the light-meson sector that a resonancelike structure in the experimental data can be described by rescattering through a triangle singularity, providing evidence for a genuine three-body effect.},

New experimental data on Z -hadron correlation in Pb + Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider show, however, an enhancement of soft hadrons in the direction of both the Z and the jet. Using a coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model, we demonstrate that medium modification of partons from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) gives rise to a soft hadron enhancement that is uniform in azimuthal angle while jet-induced medium response and soft gluon radiation dominate the enhancement in the jet direction. After subtraction of the contributions from MPI with a mixed-event procedure, the diffusion wake becomes visible in the near-side Z -hadron correlation. We further employ the longitudinal and transverse gradient jet tomography for the first time to localize the initial jet production positions in Z / γ -jet events in which the effect of the diffusion wake is apparent in Z / γ -hadron correlation even without the subtraction of the MPI contribution.},

A new 1 + X ( 4685 ) state decaying to the J / ψ ϕ final state is also observed with high significance. In addition, the four previously reported J / ψ ϕ states are confirmed and two more exotic states, Z c s ( 4220 ) + and X ( 4630 ) , are observed with significance exceeding 5 standard deviations.},

  abstract     = {When a nucleus in an atom undergoes a collision, there is a small probability of an electron being excited inelastically as a result of the Migdal effect. In this Letter, we present the first complete derivation of the Migdal effect from dark matter-nucleus scattering in semiconductors, which also accounts for multiphonon production. The rate of the Migdal effect can be expressed in terms of the energy loss function of the material, which we calculate with density functional theory methods. Because of the smaller gap for electron excitations, we find that the rate for the Migdal effect is much higher in semiconductors than in atomic targets. Accounting for the Migdal effect in semiconductors can therefore significantly improve the sensitivity of experiments such as DAMIC, SENSEI, and SuperCDMS to sub-GeV dark matter.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter (DM) scattering with nuclei in solid-state systems may produce elastic nuclear recoil at high energies and single-phonon excitation at low energies. When the DM momentum is comparable to the momentum spread of nuclei bound in a lattice, q 0 = 2 m N ω 0 where m N is the mass of the nucleus and ω 0 is the optical phonon energy, an intermediate scattering regime characterized by multiphonon excitations emerges. We study a greatly simplified model of a single nucleus in a harmonic potential and show that, while the mean energy deposited for a given momentum transfer q is equal to the elastic value q 2 / ( 2 m N ) , the phonon occupation number follows a Poisson distribution and thus the energy spread is Δ E = q ω 0 / ( 2 m N ) . This observation suggests that low-threshold calorimetric detectors may have significantly increased sensitivity to sub-GeV DM compared to the expectation from elastic scattering, even when the energy threshold is above the single-phonon energy, by exploiting the tail of the Poisson distribution for phonons above the elastic energy. We use a simple model of electronic excitations to argue that this multiphonon signal will also accompany ionization signals induced from DM-electron scattering or the Migdal effect. In well-motivated models where DM couples to a heavy, kinetically mixed dark photon, we show that these signals can probe experimental milestones for cosmological DM production via thermal freeze-out, including the thermal target for Majorana fermion DM.},

However, if these points are causally related in a bulk metric, then the bulk calculation of the commutator will be nonzero. It would appear that the integral over all metrics of this commutator must vanish exactly for holography to hold. This is puzzling since it must also be true if the commutator is multiplied by any other operator.

We find that falling bodies in gravity are subject to random fluctuations (“noise”) whose characteristics depend on the quantum state of the gravitational field. We derive a stochastic equation for the separation of two falling particles. Detection of this fundamental noise, which may be measurable at gravitational wave detectors, would vindicate the quantization of gravity, and reveal important properties of its sources.},

We provide numerical results for atoms relevant for direct dark matter searches (O, Na, Ar, Ca, Ge, I, Xe, W and Tl). We identify a crucial flaw in previous calculations and show that they overestimated the ionization cross sections by several orders of magnitude due to violation of the orthogonality of the bound and continuum electron wave functions. Using our computed cross sections, we interpret the recent data from the Xenon1T experiment, establishing the first direct bounds on coupling of scalars to electrons. We argue that the Xenon1T excess can be explained by the emission of scalars from the Sun. Although our finding is in a similar tension with astrophysical bounds as the solar axion hypothesis, we establish direct limits on scalar DM for the ∼ 1 – 10 keV mass range.

Extracting the highest precision science from these signals is expected to be challenging owing to both high signal-to-noise ratios and long-duration signals. We demonstrate that current Bayesian inference paradigms can be extended to the analysis of binary neutron star signals without breaking the computational bank. We construct reduced-order models for ∼ 90 -min-long gravitational-wave signals covering the observing band (5–2048 Hz), speeding up inference by a factor of ∼ 1.3 × 10 4 compared to the calculation times without reduced-order models. The reduced-order models incorporate key physics including the effects of tidal deformability, amplitude modulation due to Earth’s rotation, and spin-induced orbital precession. We show how reduced-order modeling can accelerate inference on data containing multiple overlapping gravitational-wave signals, and determine the speedup as a function of the number of overlapping signals. Thus, we conclude that Bayesian inference is computationally tractable for the long-lived, overlapping, high signal-to-noise-ratio events present in 3G observatories.},

As an example, we find an analytically exact renormalization circuit for a finite-temperature two-dimensional toric code that maps it to a coarse-grained system with a renormalized higher temperature, thus explicitly demonstrating its lack of topological order. Furthermore, we apply this scheme to one-dimensional free boson models at a finite temperature and find that the thermofield double corresponding to the critical thermal state is described by a Lifshitz theory. We numerically demonstrate the relevance and irrelevance of various perturbations under real space renormalization.},

In particular, we demonstrate that the TUR bounds subdiffusion in a single file confined to a ring as well as a dragged Gaussian polymer chain even when detailed balance is satisfied. Conversely, the TUR bounds the onset of superdiffusion in the active comb model. Remarkably, the fluctuations in a comb model evolving from a steady state behave anomalously as soon as detailed balance is broken. Our work establishes a link between stochastic thermodynamics and the field of anomalous dynamics that will fertilize further investigations of thermodynamic consistency of anomalous diffusion models.},

In superconducting qubit architectures, tunable buses have been explored as a means to higher-fidelity gates. However, these buses introduce new pathways for leakage. Here we present a modified tunable bus architecture appropriate for fixed-frequency qubits in which the adiabaticity restrictions on gate speed are reduced. We characterize this coupler on a range of 2-qubit devices, achieving a maximum gate fidelity of 99.85\%. We further show the calibration is stable over one day.},

  abstract     = {The ground-state criticality of many-body systems is a resource for quantum-enhanced sensing, namely, the Heisenberg precision limit, provided that one has access to the whole system. We show that, for partial accessibility, the sensing capabilities of a block of spins in the ground state reduces to the sub-Heisenberg limit. To compensate for this, we drive the Hamiltonian periodically and use a local steady state for quantum sensing. Remarkably, the steady-state sensing shows a significant enhancement in precision compared to the ground state and even achieves super-Heisenberg scaling for low frequencies. The origin of this precision enhancement is related to the closing of the Floquet quasienergy gap. It is in close correspondence with the vanishing of the energy gap at criticality for ground-state sensing with global accessibility. The proposal is general to all the integrable models and can be implemented on existing quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we address fundamental limitations of quantum teleportation—the process of transferring quantum information using classical communication and preshared entanglement. We develop a new teleportation protocol based upon the idea of using ancillary entanglement catalytically, i.e., without depleting it. This protocol is then used to show that catalytic entanglement allows for a noiseless quantum channel to be simulated with a quality that could never be achieved using only entanglement from the shared state, even for catalysts with a small dimension. On the one hand, this allows for a more faithful transmission of quantum information using generic states and fixed amount of consumed entanglement. On the other hand, this shows, for the first time, that entanglement catalysis provides a genuine advantage in a generic quantum-information processing task. Finally, we show that similar ideas can be directly applied to study quantum catalysis for more general problems in quantum mechanics. As an application, we show that catalysts can activate so-called passive states, a concept that finds widespread application, e.g., in quantum thermodynamics.},

Our approach is general in that properties such as self-avoidance, branching, and looping can all be specified in terms of quadratic interactions of the tensors. Microstates’ realizations of different lattice polymer ensembles are then seamlessly generated by solving suitable discrete energy-minimization problems. This approach enables us to capitalize on the strengths of quantum annealing machines, as we demonstrate by sampling polymer mixtures from low to high densities, using the D-Wave quantum annealer. Our systematic approach offers a promising avenue to harness the rapid development of quantum machines for sampling discrete models of filamentous soft-matter systems.},

Because of the spin-spin interactions, information flows from the central spin to the surrounding ones forming clusters of multispin correlations that grow in time. We design a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment that directly measures the amplitudes of the multispin correlations and use them to compute the evolution of what we call correlation Rényi entropy. This entropy keeps growing even after the equilibration of the entanglement entropy. We also analyze how the saturation point and the timescale for the equilibration of the correlation Rényi entropy depend on the system size.},

Our intuitive analysis based on second-order perturbation theory shows that large entanglements between doubly occupied and half filled orbitals play a key role in stabilizing the FM order in Ce 2 O 2 FeSe 2 . In addition, via many-body computational techniques applied to a multiorbital Hubbard model, the phase diagram confirms the proposed FM mechanism.},

Monitoring phonon-assisted recombination of dark states, we find a highly unusual case of exciton diffusion. While at 5 K the diffusivity is intrinsically limited by acoustic phonon scattering, we observe a pronounced decrease of the diffusion coefficient with increasing temperature, far below the activation threshold of higher-energy phonon modes. This behavior corresponds neither to well-known regimes of semiclassical free-particle transport nor to the thermally activated hopping in systems with strong localization. Its origin is discussed in the framework of both microscopic numerical and semiphenomenological analytical models illustrating the observed characteristics of nonclassical propagation.

We instead study the conductance of Dirac surface states subjected to an in-plane magnetic field in the presence of a barrier potential. Strikingly, we find that, in the case of large barrier potentials, the surface states exhibit pronounced oscillations in the conductance when varying the magnetic field, in the absence of Landau levels or the Aharonov-Bohm effect. These novel magnetic oscillations are attributed to the emergence of super-resonant transport by tuning the magnetic field, in which many propagating modes cross the barrier with perfect transmission. In the case of small and moderate barrier potentials, we identify a positive magnetoconductance due to the increase of the Fermi surface by tilting the surface Dirac cone. Moreover, we show that for weak magnetic fields, the conductance displays a shifted sinusoidal dependence on the field direction with period π and phase shift determined by the tilting direction with respect to the field direction. Our predictions can be applied to various topological insulators, such as HgTe and Bi 2 Se 3 , and provide important insights into exploring and understanding exotic magnetotransport properties of topological surface states.},

  abstract     = {The anisotropic optical response of the layered, nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS at ambient and high pressure is investigated by frequency-dependent reflectivity measurements for the polarization along and perpendicular to the layers. The highly anisotropic optical conductivity is in very good agreement with results from density-functional theory calculations and confirms the anisotropic character of ZrSiS. Whereas the in-plane optical conductivity shows only modest pressure-induced changes, we found strong effects on the out-of-plane optical conductivity spectrum of ZrSiS, with the appearance of two prominent excitations. These pronounced pressure-induced effects can neither be attributed to a structural phase transition according to our single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements, nor can they be explained by electronic correlation and electron-hole pairing effects, as revealed by theoretical calculations. Our findings are discussed in the context of the recently proposed excitonic insulator phase in ZrSiS.},

  abstract     = {Although topological artificial systems, like acoustic and photonic crystals and cold atoms in optical lattices were initially motivated by simulating topological phases of electronic systems, they have their own unique features such as the spinless time-reversal symmetry and tunable Z 2 gauge fields. Hence, it is fundamentally important to explore new topological phases based on these features. Here, we point out that the Z 2 gauge field leads to two fundamental modifications of the conventional k · p method: (i) The little co-group must include the translations with nontrivial algebraic relations. (ii) The algebraic relations of the little co-group are projectively represented. These give rise to higher-dimensional irreducible representations and therefore highly degenerate Fermi points. Breaking the primitive translations can transform the Fermi points to interesting topological phases. We demonstrate our theory by two models: a rectangular π -flux model exhibiting graphenelike semimetal phases, and a graphite model with interlayer π flux that realizes the real second-order nodal-line semimetal phase with hinge helical modes. Their physical realizations with a general bright-dark mechanism are discussed. Our finding opens a new direction to explore novel topological phases unique to crystalline systems with gauge fields and establishes the approach to analyze these phases.},

Each beam is smoothed using orthogonal polarizations obtained by passing the laser beams through distributed polarization rotators (DPRs). Observations of light scattered from OMEGA implosions do not show the expected symmetry and have much larger variation than standard predictions. For the first time, we have quantified the scattered-light nonuniformity from individual beams and identified the DPRs as the source of the enhanced nonuniformity. An instrument was invented that isolated and measured the variation in the intensity and polarization of the light scattered from each OMEGA beam. The asymmetric intensity and polarization measurements are explained when the on-target offsets between the two orthogonal polarizations produced by the DPRs are modeled using a 3D cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) code that tracks the polarizations of each beam. The time-integrated nonuniformity in laser absorption and scattered light due to CBET and the DPR polarization offsets during high-performance OMEGA implosions is predicted to be significant and dominated by low spherical harmonic mode numbers. The nonuniformity is predicted to be greatly reduced by replacing the DPRs with new optics that create smaller offsets.},

Here, we demonstrate a miniaccelerator powered by terahertz pulses with wavelengths 100 times shorter than radio-frequency pulses. By injecting a short relativistic electron bunch to a 30-mm-long dielectric-lined waveguide and tuning the frequency of a 20-period terahertz pulse to the phase-velocity-matched value, precise and sustained acceleration for nearly 100\% of the electrons is achieved with the beam energy spread essentially unchanged. Furthermore, by accurately controlling the phase of two terahertz pulses, the beam is stably accelerated successively in two dielectric waveguides with close to 100\% charge coupling efficiency. Our results demonstrate stable and scalable beam acceleration in a multistage miniaccelerator and pave the way for functioning terahertz-driven high-energy accelerators.},

Using simulation, we find a surprising variety of long-time transport behavior—random walks, ballistic transport, and trapping—depending upon the filament’s relative length and effective flexibility. Moreover, we find that filaments execute Lévy walks whose diffusion exponents generally decrease with increasing filament length, until transitioning to Brownian walks. Lyapunov exponents likewise increase with length. Even completely rigid filaments, whose dynamics is finite dimensional, show a surprising variety of transport states and chaos. Fast filament dispersal is related to an underlying geometry of “conveyor belts.” Evidence for these various transport states is found in experiments using arrays of counterrotating rollers, immersed in a fluid and transporting a flexible ribbon.},

High-speed digital Schlieren imaging is used to quantify the evolution of Lagrangian features in the jet revealing a rich sequence of transitional and turbulent states. At high levels of viscoelasticity, we identify a new distinct transitional pathway to elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) that does not feature the conventional turbulent bursts and instead proceeds via a shear-layer instability that produces elongated filaments of polymer due to the nonlinear effects of viscoelasticity. Even though the pathways to the EIT state can be different, and within EIT the spatial details of the turbulent structures vary systematically with polymer microstructure and concentration, there is a universality in the power-law spectral decay of EIT with frequency, f − 3 , independent of fluid rheology and flow parameters.},

However, the ultrafast dynamics of these nanoparticles are primarily investigated by multiphoton photoluminescence on picoseconds or photoemission on femtoseconds independently. Here, we presented two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) measurements on individual Au nanobipyramids (AuNP) to reveal their ultrafast dynamics by double-pulse excitation on a global timescale ranging from subfemtosecond to tens of picoseconds. Two orders of magnitude photoluminescence enhancement, namely, coherent interference fringes, has been demonstrated. Power-dependent measurements uncovered the transform of the nonlinearity from 1 to 2 when the interpulse delay varied from tens of femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds. We proved that the real intermediate state plays a critical role in the observed phenomena, supported by numerical simulations with a three-state model. Our results provide insight into the role of intermediate states in the ultrafast dynamics of noble metal nanoparticles. The presence of the intermediate states in AuNP and the coherent control of state populations offer interesting perspectives for imaging, sensing, nanophotonics, and in particular, for preparing macroscopic superposition states at room temperature and low-power superresolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy.},

Like in photonic lasers, phonon lasing normally occurs in a single mechanical mode. We show here that mode-locked, multimode phonon lasing can be established in a multimode optomechanical system through Floquet dynamics induced by a temporally modulated laser drive. We demonstrate this concept in a suitably engineered silicon photonic nanocavity coupled to multiple GHz-frequency mechanical modes. We find that the long-term frequency stability is significantly improved in the multimode lasing state as a result of the mode locking. These results provide a path toward highly stable ultracompact oscillators, pulsed phonon lasing, coherent waveform synthesis, and emergent many-mode phenomena in oscillator arrays.},

For R L in Ca 40 we obtain a very good agreement with experiment in the quasielastic peak up to intermediate momentum transfers, and we find that final state interactions are essential for an accurate description of the data.

Therefore, to search for physics beyond the SM (BSM) via G F , the constraining power is determined by the precision of the second-best independent determination of G F . The best alternative extractions of G F proceed either via the global electroweak (EW) fit or from superallowed β decays in combination with the Cabibbo angle measured in kaon, τ , or D decays. Both variants display some tension with G F from muon decay, albeit in opposite directions, reflecting the known tensions within the EW fit and hints for the apparent violation of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity, respectively. We investigate how BSM physics could bring the three determinations of G F into agreement using SM effective field theory and comment on future perspectives.},

In both run 1 and run 2, two modes were simultaneously monitored. Across both runs, the third overtone of the fast shear mode (3B) operating at 5.506 MHz was monitored; whereas in run 1, the second mode was chosen to be the fifth overtone of the slow shear mode (5C) operating at 8.392 MHz. However, in run 2, the second mode was selected to be closer in frequency to the first mode; and it was chosen to be the third overtone of the slow shear mode (3C) operating at 4.993 MHz. Two strong events were observed as transients responding to energy deposition within acoustic modes of the cavity. The first event occurred during run 1 on 12 May 2019 (UTC), and it was observed in the 5.506 MHz mode; whereas the second mode at 8.392 MHz observed no event. During run 2, a second event occurred on 27 November 2019 (UTC) and was observed by both modes. Timings of the events were checked against available environmental observations as well as data from other detectors. Various possibilities explaining the origins of the events are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The sensitivity of current and planned gravitational wave interferometric detectors is limited, in the most critical frequency region around 100 Hz, by a combination of quantum noise and thermal noise. The latter is dominated by Brownian noise: thermal motion originating from the elastic energy dissipation in the dielectric coatings used in the interferometer mirrors. The energy dissipation is a material property characterized by the mechanical loss angle. We have identified mixtures of titanium dioxide ( TiO 2 ) and germanium dioxide ( GeO 2 ) that show internal dissipations at a level of 1 × 10 − 4 , low enough to provide improvement of almost a factor of 2 on the level of Brownian noise with respect to the state-of-the-art materials. We show that by using a mixture of 44\% TiO 2 and 56\% GeO 2 in the high refractive index layers of the interferometer mirrors, it would be possible to achieve a thermal noise level in line with the design requirements. These results are a crucial step forward to produce the mirrors needed to meet the thermal noise requirements for the planned upgrades of the Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and Virgo detectors.},

We find that the energy resolution limit, pointed out in recent literature as a relevant benchmark for most classes of magnetometers, can be surpassed by many orders of magnitude. Moreover, similarly to the case of a ferromagnetic gyroscope, it is also possible to surpass the standard quantum limit for magnetometry with independent spins, arising from spin-projection noise. Our finding indicates that magnetomechanical systems optimized for magnetometry can achieve a magnetic field resolution per unit volume several orders of magnitude better than any conventional magnetometer. We discuss possible implications, focusing on fundamental physics problems such as the search for exotic interactions beyond the standard model.},

A natural realization of a search process with long-lasting memory is a migrating cell that is repelled from the diffusive chemotactic signal that it secretes on its way, denoted as an autochemotactic searcher. To analyze the efficiency of this class of non-Markovian search processes, we present a general formalism that allows one to compute the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a given set of conditional transition probabilities for non-Markovian random walks on a lattice. We show that the optimal choice of the n -step transition probabilities decreases the MFPT systematically and substantially with an increasing number of steps. It turns out that the optimal search strategies can be reduced to simple cycles defined by a small parameter set and that mirror-asymmetric walks are more efficient. For the autochemotactic searcher, we show that an optimal coupling between the searcher and the chemical reduces the MFPT to 1 / 3 of the one for a Markovian random walk.},

We investigate the relaxation processes of a quantum dissipative system that exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, which means that the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian are localized exponentially close to the boundary of the system, and find that the timescale for the system to reach a steady state depends not only on the Liouvillian gap Δ , but also on the localization length ξ of the eigenmodes. In particular, we show that the longest relaxation time τ that is maximized over initial states and local observables is given by τ ∼ Δ − 1 ( 1 + L / ξ ) with L being the system size. This implies that the longest relaxation time can diverge for L → ∞ without gap closing.},

We show that these phenomena are governed by two different tensions in active systems, and compute the capillary tension σ cw which sets the relaxation rate of interfacial fluctuations in accordance with capillary wave theory. We discover that strong enough activity can cause negative σ cw . In this regime, depending on the global composition, the system self-organizes, either into a microphase-separated state in which coalescence is highly inhibited, or into an “active foam” state. Our results are obtained for Active Model B + , a minimal continuum model which, although generic, admits significant analytical progress.},

Our core underlying technical result is the establishment of a duality between the theory of elastic plates and a fractonic gauge theory with a second rank symmetric electric field tensor, a scalar magnetic field, a vector charge, and a symmetric tensor current. Bending moment and momentum of the plate are dual to the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. While the flexural waves correspond to the quadratically dispersing photon of the gauge theory, a fold defect is dual to its vector charge. Crucially, the fractonic condition constrains the latter to move only along its direction, i.e., the fold’s growth direction. By contrast, fracton motion in the perpendicular direction amounts to tearing the paper.},

Here, we generalize this framework to include dynamical screening from phonons at lowest order in the electron-phonon interaction. We apply this generalized BSE approach to a series of inorganic lead halide perovskites, CsPb X 3 , with X = Cl , Br, and I. We find that inclusion of screening from phonons significantly reduces the computed exciton binding energies of these systems. By deriving a simple expression for phonon screening effects, we reveal general trends for their importance in semiconductors and insulators, based on a hydrogenic exciton model. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the phonon screening correction in isotropic materials can be reliably predicted using four material specific parameters: the reduced effective mass, static and optical dielectric constants, and frequency of the most strongly coupled longitudinal-optical phonon mode. This framework helps to elucidate the importance of phonon screening and its relation to excitonic properties in a broad class of semiconductors.},

By exploring a large parameter space, we propose two skyrmion qubit variants depending on their quantized state. We discuss appropriate microwave pulses required to generate single-qubit gates for quantum computing, and skyrmion multiqubit schemes for a scalable architecture with tailored couplings. Scalability, controllability by microwave fields, operation time scales, and readout by nonvolatile techniques converge to make the skyrmion qubit highly attractive as a logical element of a quantum processor.},

Here, we present measurements from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results emphasize the key role played by the Ce 4 f electrons for the low-temperature Fermi surface, highlighting a band-dependent conduction- f electron hybridization. In particular, we find a very heavy quasi-two-dimensional electron band near the bulk X point and moderately heavy three-dimensional hole pockets near the Z point. Comparison with theoretical calculations reveals the strong local correlation in this compound, calling for further theoretical studies. Our results provide the electronic basis to understand the heavy-fermion behavior and superconductivity; implications for the enigmatic superconductivity of this compound are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Recently, higher-order topological matter and 3D quantum Hall effects have attracted a great amount of attention. The Fermi-arc mechanism of the 3D quantum Hall effect proposed to exist in Weyl semimetals is characterized by the one-sided hinge states, which do not exist in all the previous quantum Hall systems, and more importantly, pose a realistic example of the higher-order topological matter. The experimental effort so far is in the Dirac semimetal Cd 3 As 2 , where, however, time-reversal symmetry leads to hinge states on both sides of the top and bottom surfaces, instead of the aspired one-sided hinge states. We propose that under a tilted magnetic field, the hinge states in Cd 3 As 2 -like Dirac semimetals can be one sided, highly tunable by field direction and Fermi energy, and robust against weak disorder. Furthermore, we propose a scanning tunneling Hall measurement to detect the one-sided hinge states. Our results will be insightful for exploring not only the quantum Hall effects beyond two dimensions, but also other higher-order topological insulators in the future.},

We perform a full characterization of an asymmetric double-well-like potential and implement a scan method to effectively map the dynamics along the propagation coordinate. Our fundamental observation also constitutes a direct solution for a spatial mode converter device, which could be located in any position inside a photonic glass chip. By taking advantage of the phase structure of higher-order photonic modes and the effective negative coupling generated, we propose a trimer configuration as a phase beam splitter, which could be of great relevance for multiplexing and interference-based photonic concatenated operations.},

This results in disclination-induced non-Hermitian skin effects. By doubling a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to a Hermitian three-dimensional chiral topological insulator, we show that the disclination-induced skin modes are zero modes of the effective surface Dirac fermion(s) in the presence of a pseudomagnetic flux induced by disclinations.

However, the toughening and crack healing mechanisms at the atomic scale and the associated crack propagation process of nanotwinned diamond composites remain mysterious. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of crack propagation in nanotwinned diamond composites to explore the underlying toughening and crack healing mechanisms in nanotwinned diamond composites. Our simulation results show that nanotwinned diamond composites have a higher fracture energy than single-crystalline and nanotwinned diamonds, which originates from multiple toughening mechanisms, including twin boundary and phase boundary impeding crack propagation, crack deflection and zigzag paths in nanotwins and sinuous paths in polytypes, and the formation of disordered atom clusters. More remarkably, our simulations reproduce more detailed crack propagation processes at the atomic scale, which is inaccessible by experiments. Moreover, our simulations reveal that crack healing occurs due to the rebonding of atoms on fracture surfaces during unloading and that the extent of crack healing is associated with whether the crack surfaces are clean. Our current study provides mechanistic insights into a fundamental understanding of toughening and crack healing mechanisms in nanotwinned diamond composites.},

Our results show that, under these conditions, the dominant instability is convective stimulated Raman scatter with experimental evidence of two plasmon decay (TPD) only when the density scale length is reduced. Particle-in-cell simulations indicate this is due to TPD being shifted to lower densities, removing the experimental back-scatter signature and reducing the hot-electron temperature. The experimental laser energy-coupling to hot electrons was found to be 1\%–2.5\%, with electron temperatures between 35 and 45 keV.

This thermoacoustic streaming produces a velocity amplitude nearly 100 times higher than the boundary-driven Rayleigh streaming and the Rayleigh-Bénard convection at a temperature gradient of 10 K / mm in the channel. The Rayleigh streaming is altered by the acoustic body force at a temperature gradient of only 0.5 K / mm . The thermoacoustic streaming allows for modular flow control and enhanced heat transfer at the microscale. Our study provides the groundwork for studying microscale acoustic streaming coupled with temperature fields.},

Ramsey interferometry is used to probe the coherence of the qubit, as well as to test the robustness to external perturbations. We show that qubit coherence is preserved even as we lose atoms from the polariton mode, preserving Ramsey fringe visibility. We show that dephasing due to electric field noise scales as the fourth power of field amplitude.

To explore the nature of emerging phases, we study a quantum Rabi triangle system as an elementary building block for synthesizing an artificial magnetic field. We develop an analytical approach to study the rich phase diagram and the associated quantum criticality. Of particular interest is the emergence of a chiral-coherent phase, which breaks both the Z 2 and the chiral symmetry. In this chiral phase, photons flow unidirectionally and the chirality can be tuned by the artificial gauge field, exhibiting a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry. The finite-frequency scaling analysis further confirms the associated phase transition to be in the universality class of the Dicke model. This model can simulate a broad range of physical phenomena of light-matter coupling systems, and may have an application in future developments of various quantum information technologies.},

We demonstrate that normalizing flows are particularly well suited as a Monte Carlo integration framework for quantum many-body calculations that require the repeated evaluation of high-dimensional integrals across smoothly varying integrands and integration regions. As an example, we consider the finite-temperature nuclear equation of state. An important advantage of normalizing flows is the ability to build highly expressive models of the target integrand, which we demonstrate enables precise evaluations of the nuclear free energy and its derivatives. Furthermore, we show that a normalizing flow model trained on one target integrand can be used to efficiently calculate related integrals when the temperature, density, or nuclear force is varied. This work will support future efforts to build microscopic equations of state for numerical simulations of supernovae and neutron star mergers that employ state-of-the-art nuclear forces and many-body methods.},

Based on this finding, the authors concluded that the spins are therefore determined only after scission has occurred. We show here that the nucleon-exchange mechanism, as implemented in the well-established event-by-event fission model freya , while agitating collective rotational modes in which the two spins are highly correlated, nevertheless leads to fragment spins that are largely uncorrelated. This counterexample invalidates the conclusion in [J. Wilson et al. ] that uncorrelated spins must necessarily have been generated after scission (a potentious conclusion that would rule out all models that generate the fragment spins prior to scission). Furthermore, it was reported [J. Wilson et al. ] that the mass dependence of the average fragment spin has a sawtooth structure. We demonstrate that such a behavior naturally emerges when shell and deformation effects are included in the moments of inertia of the fragments at scission.},

We combine these results with a TOTEM analysis of the same C -odd exchange based on the total cross section and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the forward elastic strong interaction scattering amplitude in p p scattering for which the significance is between 3.4 σ and 4.6 σ .

In this work we study a new, powerful probe of mirror neutrons: neutron star temperatures. When neutrons in the neutron star core convert to mirror neutrons during collisions, the vacancies left behind in the nucleon Fermi seas are refilled by more energetic nucleons, releasing immense amounts of heat in the process. We derive a new constraint on the allowed strength of neutron-mirror-neutron mixing from observations of the coldest (sub-40 000 Kelvin) neutron star, PSR 2144 − 3933 2144−3933 . Our limits compete with laboratory searches for neutron-mirror-neutron transitions but apply to a range of mass splittings between the neutron and mirror neutron that is 19 orders of magnitude larger. This heating mechanism, also pertinent to other neutron disappearance channels such as exotic neutron decay, provides a compelling physics target for upcoming ultraviolet, optical, and infrared telescopes to study thermal emissions of cold neutron stars.},

In particular, these systems can be used to detect energy depositions many orders of magnitude below typical ionization scales. As illustrations, we suggest some applications in particle physics. We outline a nondestructive time-of-flight measurement capable of sub-eV energy resolution for slowly moving, collimated particles.

  abstract     = {Significant deviations from the standard model are observed in semileptonic charged and neutral-current B decays, the muon magnetic moment, and the extraction of the Cabibbo angle. We propose that these deviations point towards a coherent pattern of new physics effects induced by two scalar mediators, a leptoquark S 1 and a charged singlet ϕ + . While S 1 can provide solutions to charged-current B decays and the muon magnetic moment, and ϕ + can accommodate the Cabibbo-angle anomaly independently, their one-loop level synergy can also address neutral-current B decays. This framework provides the most minimal explanation to the above-mentioned anomalies, while being consistent with all other phenomenological constraints.},

Identifying systems where at least some eigenstates are nonthermal is an outstanding question. In this Letter we show that interacting quantum models that have a nullspace—a degenerate subspace of eigenstates at zero energy (zero modes), which corresponds to infinite temperature, provide a route to nonthermal eigenstates. We analytically show the existence of a zero mode which can be represented as a matrix product state for a certain class of local Hamiltonians. In the more general case we use a subspace disentangling algorithm to generate an orthogonal basis of zero modes characterized by increasing entanglement entropy. We show evidence for an area-law entanglement scaling of the least-entangled zero mode in the broad parameter regime, leading to a conjecture that all local Hamiltonians with the nullspace feature zero modes with area-law entanglement scaling and, as such, break the strong thermalization hypothesis. Finally, we find zero modes in constrained models and propose a setup for observing their experimental signatures.},

Both methods commonly aim to represent the Gibbs state by a highly expressive neural-network wave function, exemplifying the idea of purification. The first method is an entirely deterministic approach to generate deep Boltzmann machines representing the purified Gibbs state exactly. This strongly assures the remarkable flexibility of the ansatz which can fully exploit the quantum-to-classical mapping. The second method employs stochastic sampling to optimize the network parameters such that the imaginary time evolution is well approximated within the expressibility of neural networks. Numerical demonstrations for transverse-field Ising models and Heisenberg models show that our methods are powerful enough to investigate the finite-temperature properties of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, even when the problematic effect of frustration is present.},

We experimentally implement an entangling CR gate by using a microwave-only control in a tunable coupling superconducting circuit, where the tunable coupler provides extra degrees of freedom to verify optimal conditions for constructing a CR gate. By developing a three-qubit Hamiltonian tomography protocol, we systematically investigate the dependency of gate fidelities on spurious qubit interactions and present the first experimental approach to the evaluation of the perturbation impact arising from spectator qubits. Our results reveal that the spectator qubits lead to reductions in CR gate fidelity dependent on Z Z interactions and particular frequency detunings between spectator and gate qubits. The target spectator demonstrates a more serious impact than the control spectator under a standard echo pulse scheme, whereas the degradation of gate fidelity is observed up to 22.5\% as both the spectators are present with a modest ZZ coupling to the computational qubits. Our experiments uncover an optimal CR operation regime, and the method we develop here can readily be applied to improving other kinds of two-qubit gates in large-scale quantum circuits.},

In this context, it has been shown that locally randomized measurements on a multiparticle quantum system can be used to obtain valuable information on the so-called moments of the partially transposed quantum state. This allows one to infer some separability properties of a state, but how to use the given information in an optimal and systematic manner has yet to be determined. We propose two general entanglement detection methods based on the moments of the partially transposed density matrix. The first method is based on the Hankel matrices and provides a family of entanglement criteria, of which the lowest order reduces to the known p 3 -positive-partial-transpose criterion proposed in A. Elben et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 200501 (2020) ].

  abstract     = {When multiple quantum emitters radiate, their emission rate may be enhanced or suppressed due to collective interference in a process known as super- or subradiance. Such processes are well known to occur also in light emission from free electrons, known as coherent cathodoluminescence. Unlike atomic systems, free electrons have an unbounded energy spectrum, and, thus, all their emission mechanisms rely on electron recoil, in addition to the classical properties of the dielectric medium. To date, all experimental and theoretical studies of super- and subradiance from free electrons assumed only classical correlations between particles. However, dependence on quantum correlations, such as entanglement between free electrons, has not been studied. Recent advances in coherent shaping of free-electron wave functions motivate the investigation of such quantum regimes of super- and subradiance. In this Letter, we show how a pair of coincident path-entangled electrons can demonstrate either super- or subradiant light emission, depending on the two-particle wave function. By choosing different free-electron Bell states, the spectrum and emission pattern of the light can be reshaped, in a manner that cannot be accounted for by a classical mixed state. We show these results for light emission in any optical medium and discuss their generalization to many-body quantum states. Our findings suggest that light emission can be sensitive to the explicit quantum state of the emitting matter wave and possibly serve as a nondestructive measurement scheme for measuring the quantum state of many-body systems.},

  abstract     = {Ergodicity breaking and slow relaxation are intriguing aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics both in classical and quantum settings. These phenomena are typically associated with phase transitions, e.g., the emergence of metastable regimes near a first-order transition or scaling dynamics in the vicinity of critical points. Despite being of fundamental interest the associated divergent timescales are a hindrance when trying to explore steady-state properties. Here we show that the relaxation dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems can be accelerated exponentially by devising an optimal unitary transformation that is applied to the quantum system immediately before the actual dynamics. This initial “rotation” is engineered in such a way that the state of the quantum system no longer excites the slowest decaying dynamical mode. We illustrate our idea—which is inspired by the so-called Mpemba effect, i.e., water freezing faster when initially heated up—by showing how to achieve an exponential speeding-up in the convergence to stationarity in Dicke models, and how to avoid metastable regimes in an all-to-all interacting spin system.},

By applying large deviation theory to a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we define the climatology of persistent heatwaves and cold spells in key target geographical regions by estimating the rate functions for the surface temperature, and we assess the impact of increasing CO 2 concentration on such persistent anomalies. Hence, we can better quantify the increasing hazard due to heatwaves in a warmer climate. We show that two 2010 high impact events—summer Russian heatwave and winter Dzud in Mongolia—are associated with atmospheric patterns that are exceptional compared to the typical ones but typical compared to the climatology of extremes. Their dynamics is encoded in the natural variability of the climate. Finally, we propose and test an approximate formula for the return times of large and persistent temperature fluctuations from easily accessible statistical properties.},

  abstract     = {Superdiffusive finite-temperature transport has been recently observed in a variety of integrable systems with non-Abelian global symmetries. Superdiffusion is caused by giant Goldstone-like quasiparticles stabilized by integrability. Here, we argue that these giant quasiparticles remain long-lived and give divergent contributions to the low-frequency conductivity σ ( ω ) , even in systems that are not perfectly integrable. We find, perturbatively, that σ ( ω ) ∼ ω − 1 / 3 for translation-invariant static perturbations that conserve energy and σ ( ω ) ∼ | log ω | for noisy perturbations. The (presumable) crossover to regular diffusion appears to lie beyond low-order perturbation theory. By contrast, integrability-breaking perturbations that break the non-Abelian symmetry yield conventional diffusion. Numerical evidence supports the distinction between these two classes of perturbations.},

This behavior appears to be directly connected with spatial correlations: stripes fluctuate slowly when stripe correlation lengths are large and become faster when spatial correlations decrease. A low-temperature decay of nickelate stripe correlations, reminiscent of what occurs in cuprates as a result of a competition between stripes and superconductivity, hence occurs via loss of both spatial and temporal correlations.},

Understanding the mechanisms of electron scattering in TBG has, however, proven challenging, raising many questions about the origins of resistivity in this system. Here we show that TBG exhibits high-temperature magneto-oscillations originating from the scattering of charge carriers between TBG minivalleys. The amplitude of these oscillations reveals that interminivalley scattering is strong, and its characteristic timescale is comparable to that of its intraminivalley counterpart. Furthermore, by exploring the temperature dependence of these oscillations, we estimate the electron-electron collision rate in TBG and find that it exceeds that of monolayer graphene. Our study demonstrates the consequences of the relatively small size of the superlattice Brillouin zone and Fermi velocity reduction on lateral transport in TBG.},

One of the fractional quantum Hall effect’s most fundamental characteristics is the energy gap separating the incompressible ground state from its excitations. Yet, despite nearly four decades of investigations, a quantitative agreement between the theoretically calculated and experimentally measured energy gaps is lacking. Here we report a systematic experimental study that incorporates very high-quality two-dimensional electron systems confined to GaAs quantum wells with fixed density and varying well widths. The results demonstrate a clear decrease of the energy gap as the electron layer is made thicker and the short-range component of the Coulomb interaction is weakened. We also provide a quantitative comparison between the measured energy gaps and the available theoretical calculations that takes into account the role of finite layer thickness and Landau level mixing. All the measured energy gaps fall below the calculations, but as the electron layer thickness increases, the results of experiments and calculations come closer. Accounting for the role of disorder in a phenomenological manner, we find better overall agreement between the measured and calculated energy gaps, although some puzzling discrepancies remain.},

Such surface Berry curvature appears whenever the bulk Weyl dispersion has a velocity tilt toward the surface of interest. This divergence is reflected in a variety of Berry curvature mediated effects that are readily accessible experimentally and, in particular, leads to a surface Berry curvature dipole that grows linearly with the thickness of a slab of a Weyl semimetal material in the limit of the long lifetime of surface states. This implies the emergence of a gigantic contribution to the nonlinear Hall effect in such devices.},

Here, we demonstrate the controlled design of thermal expansion in a family of R 2 ( Fe , Co ) 17 materials ( R = rare Earth). We find that adjusting the Fe-Co content tunes the thermal expansion behavior and its optimization leads to a record-wide SIV with good cyclic stability from 3–461 K, almost twice the range of currently known SIV. In situ neutron diffraction, Mössbauer spectra and first-principles calculations reveal the 3 d bonding state transition of the Fe-sublattice favors extra lattice stress upon magnetic ordering. On the other hand, Co content induces a dramatic enhancement of the internal molecular field, which can be manipulated to achieve “ultrawide” SIV over broad temperature, composition and magnetic field windows.

We demonstrate that when dissipation is introduced to one of the two superfluids coupled via a Josephson junction, it gives rise to a nonequilibrium dynamical phase transition characterized by the vanishing dc Josephson current.

This condition applies for all m i / m e , including m i / m e = 1 , where the Hall regime vanishes and a direct phase transition from the collisional to the kinetic regime occurs. In the limit m e / m i → 0 , this condition is equivalent to there being a critical electron temperature T e ≈ m i Ω i 2 δ 2 , where Ω i is the ion cyclotron frequency and δ is the current sheet half-thickness. The heat capacity of the current sheet changes discontinuously across the phase transition, and a critical power law is identified in an effective heat capacity.

This new observation of this seeding mechanism has important implications for future reactors that must operate in stable plasma equilibria, free of disruptive 2,1 islands.},

  abstract     = {Hot electrons generated by laser-plasma instabilities degrade the performance of laser-fusion implosions by preheating the DT fuel and reducing core compression. The hot-electron energy deposition in the DT fuel has been directly measured for the first time by comparing the hard x-ray signals between DT-layered and mass-equivalent ablator-only implosions. The electron energy deposition profile in the fuel is inferred through dedicated experiments using Cu-doped payloads of varying thickness. The measured preheat energy accurately explains the areal-density degradation observed in many OMEGA implosions. This technique can be used to assess the viability of the direct-drive approach to laser fusion with respect to the scaling of hot-electron preheat with laser energy.},

Owing to the relatively high conversion efficiency, up to 23\%, under the condition that the frequency shift is sufficiently larger than the bandwidth of the incident pulse, the rapid variation of the THz frequency around the temporal boundary is directly observed in the time domain.},

The crystal functions electromagnetically as a narrowband cryogenic load, removing photons from the otherwise room-temperature mode via stimulated absorption. The noise temperature of the microwave mode dropped to 50 − 32 + 18 K (as directly inferred by noise-power measurements), while the metal walls of the cavity enclosing the mode remained at room temperature. Simulations based on the same system’s behavior as a maser (which could be characterized more accurately) indicate the possibility of the mode’s temperature sinking to ∼ 10 K (corresponding to ∼ 140 microwave photons). These observations, when combined with engineering improvements to deepen the cooling, identify the system as a narrowband yet extremely convenient platform—free of cryogenics, vacuum chambers, and strong magnets—for realizing low-noise detectors, quantum memory, and quantum-enhanced machines (such as heat engines) based on strong spin-photon coupling and entanglement at microwave frequencies.},

In the quantum domain, time-dependent media can be used to convert vacuum fluctuations (virtual photons) into pairs of real photons. We refer to these processes broadly as “dynamical vacuum effects” (DVEs). Despite interest for their potential applications as sources of quantum light, DVEs are generally very weak, presenting many opportunities for enhancement through modern techniques in nanophotonics, such as using media which support excitations such as plasmon and phonon polaritons. Here, we present a theory of weakly modulated DVEs in arbitrary nanostructured, dispersive, and dissipative systems. A key element of our framework is the simultaneous incorporation of time-modulation and “dispersion” through time-translation-breaking linear response theory. As an example, we use our approach to propose a highly efficient scheme for generating entangled surface polaritons based on time-modulation of the optical phonon frequency of a polar insulator.},

Notably, the detector operates at room temperature, near-infrared wavelength. Using this detector, we demonstrate high-resolution and low-noise NLOS imaging.

The most precisely measured parameter, the N 14 quadrupole coupling P , is given by − 494 575 4.9 ( 8 ) Hz , whose precision is improved by nearly 4 orders of magnitude compared with previous measurements.

Here, we study the effective spatial dimensions d IR of Dirac low-energy modes in this phase, in the context of pure-glue QCD. Our d IR is based on the scaling of mode support toward thermodynamic limit, and hence is an IR probe. Ordinary extended modes, such as those at high energy, have d IR = 3 . We find d IR &lt; 3 in the spectral range whose lower edge coincides with λ IR = 0 , the singularity of spectral density defining the IR phase, and the upper edge with λ A , the previously identified Anderson-like nonanalyticity. Details near λ IR are unexpected in that only exact zero modes are d IR = 3 , while a thin spectral layer near zero is d IR = 2 , followed by an extended layer of d IR = 1 modes. With only integer values appearing, d IR may have a topological origin. We find similar structure at λ A , and associate its adjacent thin layer ( d IR ⪆ 2 ) with Anderson-like criticality. Our analysis reveals the manner in which nonanalyticities at λ IR and λ A , originally identified in other quantities, appear in d IR ( λ ) . This dimension structure may be important for understanding the near-perfect fluidity of the quark-gluon medium seen in accelerator experiments. The role of λ A in previously conjectured decoupling of IR component is explained.},

We demonstrate how the case of the free fermion in 1 + 1 dimensions reveals the details of the density matrix of the radiation produced by a moving mirror. Using the resolvent method rather than standard conformal field theory techniques we derive the Rényi entropies, modular Hamiltonian, and flow of the radiation and determine when mirrors generate unitary transformations.},

This construction relies on the so-called twisted heterotic string, which admits only gauge multiplets, a gravitational multiplet, and a single massive supermultiplet in its spectrum. In this simplified model, we determine the moduli-space integrand of all amplitudes with one massive state using Berends-Giele currents of the gauge multiplet. These integrands are then straightforwardly mapped to gravitational amplitudes in the twisted heterotic string and to the corresponding massive amplitudes of the conventional type-I and type-II superstrings.},

If sterile neutrinos are DM then they may slowly decay into active neutrinos and photons, giving rise to the possibility of their detection through narrow spectral features in astrophysical x-ray data sets. In this Letter, we perform the most sensitive search to date for this and other decaying DM scenarios across the mass range from 5 to 16 keV using archival XMM-Newton data. We reduce 547 Ms of data from both the MOS and PN instruments using observations taken across the full sky and then use this data to search for evidence of DM decay in the ambient halo of the Milky Way. We determine the instrumental and astrophysical baselines with data taken far away from the Galactic Center, and use Gaussian process modeling to capture additional continuum background contributions. No evidence is found for unassociated x-ray lines, leading us to produce the strongest constraints to date on decaying DM in this mass range.},

While recent progress for periodically driven (Floquet) systems has yielded a number of rigorous results, our understanding on quantum many-body systems driven by rapidly varying but aperiodic and quasiperiodic driving is still limited. Here, we derive rigorous, nonperturbative, bounds on the heating rate in quantum many-body systems under Thue-Morse quasiperiodic driving and under random multipolar driving, the latter being a tunably randomized variant of the former. In the process, we derive a static effective Hamiltonian that describes the transient prethermal state, including the dynamics of local observables. Our bound for Thue-Morse quasiperiodic driving suggests that the heating time scales like ( ω / g ) − C ln ( ω / g ) with a positive constant C and a typical energy scale g of the Hamiltonian, in agreement with our numerical simulations.},

Concretely, we use this approach to describe the spatiotemporal buildup of many-body localized spin-glass order in random Ising chains. We observe a fundamental difference to a noninteracting Anderson insulating Ising chain, where the order only develops over a finite spatial range. We further apply the approach to strongly disordered two-dimensional Ising models, highlighting that our method can be used also for the description of the real-time dynamics of nonergodic quantum matter in a general context.},

  abstract     = {Device-independent quantum key distribution is a secure quantum cryptographic paradigm that allows two honest users to establish a secret key, while putting minimal trust in their devices. Most of the existing protocols have the following structure: first, a bipartite nonlocal quantum state is distributed between the honest users, who perform local projective measurements to establish nonlocal correlations. Then, they announce the implemented measurements and extract a secure key by postprocessing their measurement outcomes. We show that no protocol of this form allows for establishing a secret key when implemented on any correlation obtained by measuring local projective measurements on certain entangled nonlocal states, namely, on a range of entangled two-qubit Werner states. To prove this result, we introduce a technique for upper bounding the asymptotic key rate of device-independent quantum key distribution protocols, based on a simple eavesdropping attack. Our results imply that either different reconciliation techniques are needed for device-independent quantum key distribution in the large-noise regime, or Bell nonlocality is not sufficient for this task.},

  abstract     = {Strong nonlinear coupling of superconducting qubits and/or photons is a critical building block for quantum information processing. Because of the perturbative nature of the Josephson nonlinearity, linear coupling is often used in the dispersive regime to approximate nonlinear coupling. However, this dispersive coupling is weak and the underlying linear coupling mixes the local modes, which, for example, distributes unwanted self-Kerr nonlinearity to photon modes. Here, we use the quarton to yield purely nonlinear coupling between two linearly decoupled transmon qubits. The quarton’s zero ϕ 2 potential enables an ultrastrong gigahertz-level cross-Kerr coupling, which is an order of magnitude stronger compared to existing schemes, and the quarton’s positive ϕ 4 potential can cancel the negative self-Kerr nonlinearity of qubits to linearize them into resonators. This ultrastrong cross-Kerr coupling between bare modes of qubit-qubit, qubit-photon, and even photon-photon is ideal for applications such as single microwave photon detection, ultrafast two-qubit gates, and readout.},

We conjecture that this constraint is universal, i.e., it is valid for all quantum dynamical semigroups. The conjecture is supported by numerical analysis. Moreover, we show that the conjectured constraint is tight by providing a concrete model that saturates the bound. This universality marks an essential step toward the physical characterization of complete positivity as the constraint is directly verifiable in experiments. It provides, therefore, a physical manifestation of complete positivity. Our conjecture also has two important implications: it provides (i) a universal constraint for the spectra of quantum channels and (ii) a necessary condition to decide whether a given channel is consistent with Markovian evolution.},

Here, we present such first-principles microscopic Hamiltonian theory, valid for both 2D and 3D, showing that odd viscosity is present in any system, even at zero temperature, with globally or locally aligned spinning components. Our work substantially extends the applicability of odd viscosity into 3D fluids, and specifically to internally driven active materials, such as living matter (e.g., actomyosin gels). We find intriguing 3D effects of odd viscosity such as propagation of anisotropic bulk shear waves and breakdown of Bernoulli’s principle.},

While the energy is linearly dispersed in the direction parallel to the dipole in plane, the perpendicular direction is dispersionless up to linear order, which can be explained by the quantum interference effect of the interaction among the constituents of 1D subsystems. The anisotropic dispersion results in a E ∼ 0.5 scaling of the system density of states and predicts unique spectroscopic signatures including: (1) disorder-induced absorption linewidth, W ( σ ) ∼ σ 2.8 , with σ the disorder strength, (2) temperature dependent absorption linewidth, W ( T ) ∼ T s + 1.5 , with s the exponent of the environment spectral density, and (3) the out-of-plane angular θ dependence of the peak splittings in absorption spectra, Δ E ( θ ) ∝ sin 2 θ .

Upon initially imprinting a lattice of vortices in the quantum fluid, we track the vortex core positions on picosecond timescales. We observe an accelerated stretching of the lattice and an outward bending of the linear trajectories of the vortices, due to the repulsive polariton interactions. Access to the full density and phase fields allows us to detect a small deviation from the Feynman-Onsager rule in terms of a transverse velocity component, due to the density gradient of the fluid envelope acting on the vortex lattice.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic textures are often treated as quasiparticles following Thiele’s equation of motion. We demonstrate via spin model simulations of the current-driven and Brownian motion of ferromagnetic skyrmions that the existing theory based on Thiele’s equation is insufficient to describe the dynamics of skyrmions at finite temperatures. We propose an extended equation of motion that goes beyond Thiele’s equation by taking into account the coupling of the skyrmion to the magnonic heat bath leading to an additional dissipative term that is linear in temperature. Our results indicate that this so-far-neglected magnon-induced friction dominates for finite temperatures and Gilbert damping values typical for thin films and multilayers.},

With conventional materials, coherent spin precession has been observed in the ballistic regime and at low temperatures only. However, the strong spin anisotropy and the valley character of the electronic states in 2D materials provide unique control knobs to manipulate spin precession. Here, by manipulating the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling in bilayer graphene by the proximity effect to WSe 2 , we achieve coherent spin precession in the absence of an external magnetic field, even in the diffusive regime. Remarkably, the sign of the precessing spin polarization can be tuned by a back gate voltage and by a drift current. Our realization of a spin field-effect transistor at room temperature is a cornerstone for the implementation of energy efficient spin-based logic.},

In the recent experiment of α − RuCl 3 , the signature of a nematic transition to the gapped toric code phase, which breaks the C 3 symmetry of the system, has been observed through the angle dependence of the heat capacity. We here propose a mechanism by which the nematic transition can be detected electrically. This is seemingly impossible because J eff = 1 / 2 spins do not have an electric quadrupole moment (EQM). However, in the second-order perturbation, the virtual state with a nonzero EQM appears, which makes the nematic order parameter detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The purely magnetic origin of the EQM is different from conventional electronic nematic phases, allowing the direct detection of the realization of Kitaev’s toric error-correction code.},

The charge- 4 e state, which is a condensate of four-electron bound states that preserve the rotational symmetry of the lattice, is nearly degenerate with a competing vestigial nematic state, which is nonsuperconducting and breaks the rotational symmetry. This robust result is the consequence of a hidden discrete symmetry in the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which permutes quantities in the gauge sector and in the crystalline sector of the symmetry group. We argue that random strain generally favors the charge- 4 e state over the nematic phase, as it acts as a random mass to the former but as a random field to the latter. Thus, we propose that two-dimensional inhomogeneous systems displaying nematic superconductivity, such as twisted bilayer graphene, provide a promising platform to realize the elusive charge- 4 e superconducting phase.},

Motivated by recent experiments, we develop a scaling theory for the metal-insulator transitions in the strong-magnetic-field quantum limit of a 3D system. By using a renormalization-group calculation to treat electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon interactions, and disorder on the same footing, we obtain the critical exponent that characterizes the scaling relations of the resistivity to temperature and magnetic field. By comparing the critical exponent with those in a recent experiment [F. Tang et al. , Nature (London) 569 , 537 (2019) ], we conclude that the insulating ground state was not only a charge-density wave driven by electron-phonon interactions but also coexisting with strong electron-electron interactions and backscattering disorder. We also propose a current-scaling experiment for further verification. Our theory will be helpful for exploring the emergent territory of 3D metal-insulator transitions under strong magnetic fields.},

Here we demonstrate that a combination of sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo sampling and quantum loop topography, a physics-inspired machine-learning approach, can map out the emergence of non-Fermi liquid physics in the vicinity of a quantum critical point (QCP) with little prior knowledge. Using only three parameter points for training the underlying neural network, we are able to robustly identify a stable non-Fermi liquid regime tracing the fans of metallic QCPs at the onset of both spin-density wave and nematic order. In particular, we establish for the first time that a spin-density wave QCP commands a wide fan of non-Fermi liquid region that funnels into the quantum critical point. Our study thereby provides an important proof-of-principle example that new physics can be detected via unbiased machine-learning approaches.},

The nature of the CDW phase and its relation to superconductivity remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the electronic and structural properties of CDW by first-principles calculations. We reveal an inverse Star of David deformation as the 2 × 2 × 2 CDW ground state of the kagome lattice. The kagome lattice shows softening breathing-phonon modes, indicating the structural instability. However, electrons play an essential role in the CDW transition via Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularity. The inverse Star of David structure agrees with recent experiments by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The CDW phase inherits the nontrivial Z 2 -type topological band structure. Further, we find that the electron-phonon coupling is too weak to account for the superconductivity T c in all three materials. It implies the existence of unconventional pairing of these kagome metals. Our results provide essential knowledge toward understanding the superconductivity and topology in kagome metals.},

Canonical candidates for deconfined quantum criticality are quantum antiferromagnets with competing magnetic orders, captured by the easy-plane CP 1 model. A delicate issue however is that numerics indicates the easy-plane CP 1 antiferromagnet to exhibit a first-order transition. Here we show that an additional topological Chern-Simons term in the action changes this picture completely in several ways. We find that the topological easy-plane antiferromagnet undergoes a second-order transition with quantized critical exponents.

First, frost was preferentially grown on the tops of hydrophilic aluminum pillars due to their sharp corners and elevation over the noncondensable gas barrier. Subsequently, Cassie ice was formed by virtue of the impacting droplets getting arrested by the upper frost tips. A scaling model reveals that the dynamic pressure of an impacting droplet causes the water to wick inside the porous frost faster than the timescale to impale between the pillars.},

  abstract     = {Scattering immune propagation of light in topological photonic systems may revolutionize the design of integrated photonic circuits for information processing and communications. In optics, various photonic topological circuits have been developed, which were based on classical emulation of either quantum spin Hall effect or quantum valley Hall effect. On the other hand, the combination of both the valley and spin degrees of freedom can lead to a new kind of topological transport phenomenon, dubbed spin-valley Hall effect (SVHE), which can further expand the number of topologically protected edge channels and would be useful for information multiplexing. However, it is challenging to realize SVHE in most known material platforms, due to the requirement of breaking both the (pseudo)fermionic time-reversal ( T ) and parity symmetries ( P ) individually, but leaving the combined symmetry S ≡ T P intact. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible platform to realize SVHE for light, based on coupled ring resonators mediated by optical Kerr nonlinearity. Thanks to the inherent flexibility of cross-mode modulation, the coupling between the probe light can be engineered in a controllable way such that spin-dependent staggered sublattice potential emerges in the effective Hamiltonian. With delicate yet experimentally feasible pump conditions, we show the existence of spin-valley Hall-induced topological edge states. We further demonstrate that both degrees of freedom, i.e., spin and valley, can be manipulated simultaneously in a reconfigurable manner to realize spin-valley photonics, doubling the degrees of freedom for enhancing the information capacity in optical communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Accessing subwavelength information about a scene from the far-field without invasive near-field manipulations is a fundamental challenge in wave engineering. Yet it is well understood that the dwell time of waves in complex media sets the scale for the waves’ sensitivity to perturbations. Modern coded-aperture imagers leverage the degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) offered by complex media as natural multiplexor but do not recognize and reap the fundamental difference between placing the object of interest outside or within the complex medium. Here, we show that the precision of localizing a subwavelength object can be improved by several orders of magnitude simply by enclosing it in its far field with a reverberant passive chaotic cavity. We identify deep learning as a suitable noise-robust tool to extract subwavelength localization information encoded in multiplexed measurements, achieving resolutions well beyond those available in the training data. We demonstrate our finding in the microwave domain: harnessing the configurational d.o.f. of a simple programmable metasurface, we localize a subwavelength object along a curved trajectory inside a chaotic cavity with a resolution of λ / 76 using intensity-only single-frequency single-pixel measurements. Our results may have important applications in photoacoustic imaging as well as human-machine interaction based on reverberating elastic waves, sound, or microwaves.},

Using gauge transformation, we experimentally evaluate the phase diagram of a high-dimensional spin-glass equilibrium system with 100 fully connected spins. We observe the presence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and spin-glass phases and determine the critical temperature T c and the critical probability p c of the phase transitions, which agree well with the mean-field theory predictions. Thus, the approximation of the mean-field model is experimentally verified in the spatial photonic Ising machine. Furthermore, we discuss the phase transition in parallel with solving combinatorial optimization problems during the cooling process and identify that the spatial photonic Ising machine is robust with sufficient many-spin interactions even when the system is associated with optical aberrations and measurement uncertainty.},

We further uncover that the polarization singularities of photonic quasicrystal slab correspond to quasibound states in the continuum with exceptionally high-quality factors.

Such solutions exist for arbitrary single qubit-photon coupling strength with constant eigenenergy, while still being qubit-photon entangled states.

Here, we introduce the concept of space-time quantum metasurfaces for arbitrary control of the spectral, spatial, and spin properties of nonclassical light using a compact photonic platform. We show that space-time quantum metasurfaces allow on-demand tailoring of entanglement among all degrees of freedom of a single photon. We also show that spatiotemporal modulation induces asymmetry at the fundamental level of quantum fluctuations, resulting in the generation of steered and vortex photon pairs out of vacuum. Space-time quantum metasurfaces have the potential to enable novel photonic functionalities, such as encoding quantum information into high-dimensional color qudits using designer modulation protocols, sculpting multispectral and multispatial modes in spontaneous emission, and generating reconfigurable hyperentanglement for high-capacity quantum communications.},

This results from collective spin-mixing scattering events, where spontaneously produced pairs of atoms with opposite momentum facilitates additional spin-mixing collisions as they pass through the condensates. The matter-wave jets of different spin states ( | F = 1 , m F = ± 1 ⟩ ) can be a macroscopic Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state with spacelike separation. Its spin-momentum correlations are studied by using the angular correlation function for each spin state. Rotating the spin axis, the inter- and intraspin-momentum correlation peaks display a high-contrast oscillation, indicating collective coherence of the atomic ensembles.

Its formation is facilitated by an additional attractive force induced by the density fluctuation of a third component, which enlarges the mean-field collapse region in comparison to the binary case and renders the formation of a Borromean droplet after incorporating the repulsive force from quantum fluctuations. Outside the Borromean regime, we demonstrate an interesting phenomenon of droplet phase separation due to the competition between ternary and binary droplets. We further show that the transition between different droplets and gas phase can be conveniently tuned by boson numbers and interaction strengths.

The 295(2) K spectrum shows a large increase in the cross section with an onset about 200 cm − 1 below threshold, which is explained by significant vibrational excitation of the trapped ions at room temperature. This excitation disappears at cryogenic temperatures leading to an almost steplike onset of the cross section at threshold, which cannot be adequately described with a Wigner threshold law. Instead, we show that the model developed by O’Malley for photodetachment from neutrals with large permanent dipoles [ Phys. Rev. 137 , A1668 (1965) ] fits very well to the data. A high-resolution scan of the threshold region yields additional features, which we assign to the rotational P and R branches of an electronic transition to a dipole-bound state with Σ + 1 symmetry. This state is found 2 ( 1 ) cm − 1 below threshold in very good agreement with a recent computational prediction.

  abstract     = {A novel approach for isomer depletion in ion-atom collisions is proposed and considered theoretically. Analyses are performed for the depletion of the Mo 93 m isomer for which an unexpectedly large probability was measured in the beam-based experiment of Chiara et al. [ Nature (London) 554 , 216 (2018) ]. The subsequent attempt at a theoretical description based on state-of-the-art atomic theory did not reproduce the experimental result [Wu et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 , 212501 (2019) ] and showed a dramatic disagreement with the experiment (by many orders of magnitude). This conflict calls for further research on the nature of isomer depletion mechanisms occurring in atomic processes. Here, we propose to consider the Mo 93 m isomer depletion as the nuclear excitation by electron capture in resonant transfer process taking into account the momentum distribution of the target electrons. Although our results only slightly shift the upper theoretical limit for the total Mo 93 m isomer depletion probability toward the experimental value, they show the importance of considering the Compton profile in the theoretical description, in particular for the L shell, for which the depletion probability increases by many orders of magnitude.},

To this end, we use well-known observables: cumulants of the baryon number distribution. In analyses aimed at uncovering the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter, cumulants gather considerable attention as their qualitative behavior along the explored range of collision energies is expected to aid in detecting the QCD critical point. We show that the cumulants may also reveal the behavior of the speed of sound in the temperature and baryon chemical potential plane.

  abstract     = {A measurement of dielectron production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at s = 13 TeV , recorded with the ALICE detector at the CERN LHC, is presented in this Letter. The data set was recorded with a reduced magnetic solenoid field. This enables the investigation of a kinematic domain at low dielectron (ee) invariant mass m ee and pair transverse momentum p T , ee that was previously inaccessible at the LHC. The cross section for dielectron production is studied as a function of m ee , p T , ee , and event multiplicity d N ch / d η . The expected dielectron rate from hadron decays, called hadronic cocktail, utilizes a parametrization of the measured η / π 0 ratio in pp and proton-nucleus collisions, assuming that this ratio shows no strong dependence on collision energy at low transverse momentum. Comparison of the measured dielectron yield to the hadronic cocktail at 0.15 &lt; m ee &lt; 0.6 GeV / c 2 and for p T , ee &lt; 0.4 GeV / c indicates an enhancement of soft dielectrons, reminiscent of the “anomalous” soft-photon and soft-dilepton excess in hadron-hadron collisions reported by several experiments under different experimental conditions. The enhancement factor over the hadronic cocktail amounts to 1.61 ± 0.13 ( stat ) ± 0.17 ( syst , data ) ± 0.34 ( syst , cocktail ) in the ALICE acceptance. Acceptance-corrected excess spectra in m ee and p T , ee are extracted and compared with calculations of dielectron production from hadronic bremsstrahlung and thermal radiation within a hadronic many-body approach.},

  abstract     = {When a black hole first forms, the properties of the emitted radiation as measured by observers near future null infinity are very close to the 1974 prediction of Hawking. However, deviations grow with time and become of order unity after a time t ∼ M i 7 / 3 , where M i is the initial mass in Planck units. After an evaporation time, the corrections are large: the angular distribution of the emitted radiation is no longer dominated by low multipoles, with an exponential falloff at high multipoles. Instead, the radiation is redistributed as a power-law spectrum over a broad range of angular scales, all the way down to the scale Δ θ ∼ 1 / M i , beyond which there is exponential falloff. This effect is a quantum gravitational effect, whose origin is the spreading of the wave function of the black hole’s center-of-mass location caused by the kicks of the individual outgoing quanta, discovered by Page in 1980. The modified angular distribution of the Hawking radiation has an important consequence: the number of soft hair modes that can effectively interact with outgoing Hawking quanta increases from the handful of modes at low multipoles l to a large number of modes, of order ∼ M i 2 . We argue that this change unlocks the Hawking-Perry-Strominger mechanism for purifying the Hawking radiation.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational waves from a source moving relative to us can suffer from special-relativistic effects such as aberration. The required velocities for these to be significant are on the order of 1000 km s − 1 . This value corresponds to the velocity dispersion that one finds in clusters of galaxies. Hence, we expect a large number of gravitational-wave sources to have such effects imprinted in their signals. In particular, the signal from a moving source will have its higher modes excited, i.e., (3,3) and beyond. We derive expressions describing this effect and study its measurability for the specific case of a circular, nonspinning extreme-mass-ratio inspiral. We find that the excitation of higher modes by a peculiar velocity of 1000 km s − 1 is detectable for such inspirals with signal-to-noise ratios of ≳ 20 . Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we show that the velocity of the source can be measured to a precision of just a few percent for a signal-to-noise ratio of 100. If the motion of the source is ignored, parameter estimates could be biased, e.g., the estimated masses of the components through a Doppler shift. Conversely, by including this effect in waveform models, we could measure the velocity dispersion of clusters of galaxies at distances inaccessible to light.},

These functions capture the full crossover from the ground-state entanglement regime at low energies and small subsystem size (area or log-area law) to the extensive volume-law regime at high energies or large subsystem size. For critical one-dimensional systems, a universal scaling function follows from conformal field theory and can be adapted for nonlinear dispersions. We use it to also deduce the crossover scaling function for Fermi liquids in d &gt; 1 dimensions. The analytical results are complemented by numerics for large noninteracting systems of fermions in d ≤ 3 dimensions and have also been confirmed for bosonic systems and nonintegrable spin chains.},

By using analytical arguments, we show that, when the effective interaction compares with the kinetic energy, the system forms a Wigner crystal undergoing a first-order quantum phase transition. This transition is a condensation in the space of the states and belongs to the class of quantum phase transitions discussed in [M. Ostilli and C. Presilla, J. Phys. A 54 , 055005 (2021) .]. The transition takes place at a critical value r s c of the usual dimensionless parameter r s (radius of the volume available to each electron divided by effective Bohr radius) for which we are able to provide rigorous lower and upper bounds. For large screening length these bounds can be expressed in a closed analytical form. Demanding Monte Carlo simulations allow to estimate r s c ≃ 2.3 ± 0.2 at lattice filling 3 / 10 and screening length 10 lattice constants. This value is well within the rigorous bounds 0.7 ≤ r s c ≤ 4.3 . Finally, we show that if screening is removed after the thermodynamic limit has been taken, r s c tends to zero. In contrast, in a bare unscreened Coulomb potential, Wigner crystallization always takes place as a smooth crossover, not as a quantum phase transition.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of entanglement marks one of the furthest departures from classical physics and is indispensable for quantum information processing. Despite its fundamental importance, the distribution of entanglement over long distances through photons is unfortunately hindered by unavoidable decoherence effects. Entanglement distillation is a means of restoring the quality of such diluted entanglement by concentrating it into a pair of qubits. Conventionally, this would be done by distributing multiple photon pairs and distilling the entanglement into a single pair. Here, we turn around this paradigm by utilizing pairs of single photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom. Specifically, we make use of the polarization and the energy-time domain of photons, both of which are extensively field tested. We experimentally chart the domain of distillable states and achieve relative fidelity gains up to 13.8\%. Compared to the two-copy scheme, the distillation rate of our single-copy scheme is several orders of magnitude higher, paving the way towards high-capacity and noise-resilient quantum networks.},

  abstract     = {We present a stochastic quantum computing algorithm that can prepare any eigenvector of a quantum Hamiltonian within a selected energy interval [ E − ε , E + ε ] . In order to reduce the spectral weight of all other eigenvectors by a suppression factor δ , the required computational effort scales as O [ | log δ | / ( p ε ) ] , where p is the squared overlap of the initial state with the target eigenvector. The method, which we call the rodeo algorithm, uses auxiliary qubits to control the time evolution of the Hamiltonian minus some tunable parameter E . With each auxiliary qubit measurement, the amplitudes of the eigenvectors are multiplied by a stochastic factor that depends on the proximity of their energy to E . In this manner, we converge to the target eigenvector with exponential accuracy in the number of measurements. In addition to preparing eigenvectors, the method can also compute the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the performance with several examples. For energy eigenvalue determination with error ε , the computational scaling is O [ ( log ε ) 2 / ( p ε ) ] . For eigenstate preparation, the computational scaling is O ( log Δ / p ) , where Δ is the magnitude of the orthogonal component of the residual vector. The speed for eigenstate preparation is exponentially faster than that for phase estimation or adiabatic evolution.},

  abstract     = {Quantum target detection is an emerging application that utilizes entanglement to enhance the sensing of the presence of an object. Although several experimental demonstrations for certain situations have been reported recently, the single-shot detection limit imposed by the Helstrom limit has not been reached because of the unknown optimum measurements. Here we report an experimental demonstration of quantum target detection, also known as quantum illumination, in the single-photon limit. In our experiment, one photon of the maximally entangled photon pair is employed as the probe signal and the corresponding optimum measurement is implemented at the receiver. We explore the detection problem in different regions of the parameter space and verify that the quantum advantage exists even in a forbidden region of the conventional illumination, where all classical schemes become useless. Our results indicate that quantum illumination breaks the classical limit for up to 40\%, while approaching the quantum limit imposed by the Helstrom limit. These results not only demonstrate the advantage of quantum illumination, but also manifest its valuable potential of target detection.},

The typical approach has been to cascade transducers: converting to optical frequencies at the transmitter and to microwave frequencies at the receiver. However, the small microwave-optical coupling and added noise have proven formidable obstacles. Instead, we propose optical networking via heralding end-to-end entanglement with one detected photon and teleportation. This new protocol can be implemented on standard transduction hardware while providing significant performance improvements over transduction. In contrast to cascaded direct transduction, our scheme absorbs the low optical-microwave coupling efficiency into the heralding step, thus breaking the rate-fidelity trade-off. Moreover, this technique unifies and simplifies entanglement generation between superconducting devices and other physical modalities in quantum networks.},

The scheme utilizes high-dimensional auxiliary entanglement to perform entangling nonlocal measurements and determine the number and positions of errors in an ensemble in a controlled and efficient way, without disturbing the entanglement of good pairs. Our protocols can deal with arbitrary errors, but are best suited for few errors, and work particularly well for decay noise.

It is compared with other existing measures and is found superior to previous attempts for different reasons. A specific example is illustrated to show that two tripartite entanglement measures can be inequivalent due to the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space. The properties of the triangle measure make it a candidate in potential quantum tasks and available to be used in any multiparty entanglement problems.},

The use of the polarization-resolving camera enables parallel measurements in the position and polarization basis and as a result, the data acquisition time of our protocol does not increase with the dimension of the Hilbert space and is solely determined by the camera exposure time (on the order of 10 ms). Our method is potentially useful for the real-time monitoring of the dynamics of quantum states and paves the way for the development of high-dimensional, time-efficient quantum metrology techniques.},

Here, we focus on finite sets of measurements on quantum states (hereafter called quantum data), and we propose an approach which, given a particular spatial partitioning of the system of interest, can effectively ascertain whether or not the dataset is compatible with a separable state. When compatibility is disproven, the approach produces the optimal entanglement witness for the quantum data at hand. Our approach is based on mapping separable states onto equilibrium classical field theories on a lattice and on mapping the compatibility problem onto an inverse statistical problem, whose solution is reached in polynomial time whenever the classical field theory does not describe a glassy system. Our results pave the way for systematic entanglement certification in quantum devices, optimized with respect to the accessible observables.},

We introduce a simple absorbing-state model, biased random organization (BRO), which exhibits a Manna class dynamical phase transition between absorbing and active states that has as its densest critical point ϕ c max ≈ 0.64 ≈ ϕ R C P and, like other Manna class models, is hyperuniform at criticality. The configurations we obtain from BRO appear to be structurally identical to RCP configurations from other protocols. This leads us to conjecture that the highest-density absorbing state for an isotropic biased random organization model produces an ensemble of configurations that characterizes the state conventionally known as RCP.},

We show that these correlations can be successfully probed by introducing a correlation function weighted on the density-density fluctuations. The results of this analysis can be further improved by introducing a representation of the system based on the contact points between particles. In particular, we find evidence that the weak forces and the Δ Z fluctuations support the hypothesis of randomly jammed packings of spherical particles being hyperuniform by exhibiting an anomalous long-range decay. Moreover, we find that the large-scale structure of the density-density correlation exhibits a complex behavior due to the superimposition of two exponentially damped oscillating signals propagating with linearly depending frequencies.},

Data analysis combined with numerical modeling shows that the dynamics corresponds to the exchange mode excited by the Zeeman interaction of the THz magnetic field with the spins. We argue that THz-pump–IR-probe experiments on ferrimagnets offer a unique tool for quantitative studies of dynamics and mechanisms to control antiferromagnetically coupled spins.},

  abstract     = {An optical frequency comb consists of a set of discrete and equally spaced frequencies and has found wide applications in the synthesis over a broad range of spectral frequencies of electromagnetic waves and precise optical frequency metrology. Despite the analogies between magnons and photons in many aspects, the analog of an optical frequency comb in magnonic systems has not been reported. Here, we theoretically study the magnon-skyrmion interaction and find that a magnonic frequency comb (MFC) can be generated above a threshold driving amplitude, where the nonlinear scattering process involving three magnons prevails. The mode spacing of the MFC is equal to the breathing-mode frequency of the skyrmion and is thus tunable by either electric or magnetic means. The theoretical prediction is verified by micromagnetic simulations, and the essential physics can be generalized to a large class of magnetic solitons. Our findings open a new pathway to observe frequency comb structures in magnonic devices that may inspire the study of fundamental nonlinear physics in spintronic platforms in the future.},

We perform high-resolution INS measurements on Cs 2 CoCl 4 Cs2CoCl4 , a close realization of the S = 1 / 2 S=1/2 transverse-field X X Z XXZ spin chain, where we can control entanglement using the magnetic field, and compare with density-matrix renormalization group calculations for validation.

This transverse resistance depends on the local domain wall configuration and hence changes with temperature, gate voltage, thermal cycling, and position along the sample and can even change sign as a function of these parameters. The transverse resistance is observed below ≃ 70 K but grows and changes significantly below ≃ 40 K , the temperature at which the domain walls become increasingly polar. Surprisingly, the transverse resistance is much larger in (111) oriented heterostructures in comparison to (001) oriented heterostructures. Measurements of the capacitance between the conducting interface and an electrode applied to the substrate, which reflect the dielectric constant of the STO, indicate that this difference may be related to the greater variation of the temperature-dependent dielectric constant with electric field when the electric field is applied in the [111] direction. The finite transverse resistance can be explained inhomogeneous current flow due to the preferential transport of current along domain walls that are askew to the nominal direction of the injected current.},

  abstract     = {The interaction of electrons with quantized phonons and photons underlies the ultrafast dynamics of systems ranging from molecules to solids, and it gives rise to a plethora of physical phenomena experimentally accessible using time-resolved techniques. Green’s function methods offer an invaluable interpretation tool since scattering mechanisms of growing complexity can be selectively incorporated in the theory. Currently, however, real-time Green’s function simulations are either prohibitively expensive due to the cubic scaling with the propagation time or do neglect the feedback of electrons on the bosons, thus violating energy conservation. We put forward a computationally efficient Green’s function scheme which overcomes both limitations. The numerical effort scales linearly with the propagation time while the simultaneous dressing of electrons and bosons guarantees the fulfillment of all fundamental conservation laws. We present a real-time study of the phonon-driven relaxation dynamics in an optically excited narrow band-gap insulator, highlighting the nonthermal behavior of the phononic degrees of freedom. Our formulation paves the way to first-principles simulations of electron-boson systems with unprecedented long propagation times.},

Our measurements demonstrate the applicability of the classical equation of motion of cracks at a discontinuity of fracture energy: the crack speed jumps at the entrance and exit of an obstacle, as predicted by the crack-tip energy balance within the brittle fracture framework. The speed jump amplitude is governed by the fracture energy contrast and by the combination of the rate dependency of the fracture energy and the inertia of the medium, which allows the crack to cross a fracture energy discontinuity at a constant energy release rate. This discontinuous dynamics and the rate dependence cause higher effective toughness, which governs the coarse-grained behavior of these cracks.},

We identify limits on the injected impurity density and magnetic perturbation level for which the runaway seed current is acceptable without excessive thermal energy being lost to the wall via particle impact. The consistent modeling of generation and losses shows that runaway beams tend to form near the edge of the plasma, where they could be deconfined via external perturbations.},

Here, we study a parabola-shaped trajectory formed by EPs with both theory and acoustic experiments. By obtaining both the DNs and Berry phases through the measurement of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we show that the EP trajectory endows the parameter space with a nontrivial fundamental group.

The scheme makes use of Raman transitions within an entire atomic ground-state hyperfine level and operates with laser and cavity fields detuned from the atomic transition by much more than the excited-state hyperfine splitting. This enables reduction of the dynamics to that of a simple, cavity-damped Tavis-Cummings model with the collective spin determined by the total angular momentum of the ground hyperfine level.},

  abstract     = {The quantum system under periodical modulation is the simplest path to understand the quantum nonequilibrium system because it can be well described by the effective static Floquet Hamiltonian. Under the stroboscopic measurement, the initial phase is usually irrelevant. However, if two uncorrelated parameters are modulated, their relative phase cannot be gauged out so that the physics can be dramatically changed. Here, we simultaneously modulate the frequency of the lattice laser and the Rabi frequency in an optical lattice clock (OLC) system. Thanks to the ultrahigh precision and ultrastability of the OLC, the relative phase could be fine-tuned. As a smoking gun, we observed the interference between two Floquet channels. Finally, by experimentally detecting the eigenenergies, we demonstrate the relation between the effective Floquet Hamiltonian and the one-dimensional topological insulator with a high winding number. Our experiment not only provides a direction for detecting the phase effect but also paves a way in simulating the quantum topological phase in the OLC platform.},

When the impurity-boson interactions are short-ranged, we show that boson-boson interactions induce a quantum blockade effect, where a single boson can effectively block or screen the impurity potential. Since this behavior depends on the quantum granular nature of the Bose gas, it cannot be captured within a standard classical-field description. Using a combination of exact quantum Monte Carlo methods and a truncated basis approach, we show how the quantum correlations between bosons lead to universal few-body bound states and a logarithmically slow dependence of the polaron ground-state energy on the boson-boson scattering length. Moreover, we expose the link between the polaron energy and the spatial structure of the quantum correlations, spanning the infrared to ultraviolet physics.},

For the spin-polarized case, extreme band lifetimes above 10 s are observed, reflecting the suppression of collisions by Pauli’s exclusion principle. For spin mixtures, lifetimes are reduced by an order of magnitude by two-body collisions between different spin components, but still remarkably large values of about 1 s are found. By analyzing momentum spectra, we can directly observe the orbital character of the optical lattice.

In particular, for estimating any L low-weight Pauli observables, a deterministic measurement on only of order log ( L ) copies of a quantum state suffices. In some cases, for example, when some of the Pauli observables have high weight, the derandomized procedure is substantially better than the randomized one. Specifically, numerical experiments highlight the advantages of our derandomized protocol over various previous methods for estimating the ground-state energies of small molecules.},

To this aim, the trace-distance revivals between distinct evolved system states have been shown to be subordinated to the establishment of system-environment correlations or changes in the environmental state. We show that this interpretation can be substantiated also for a class of entropic quantifiers. We exploit a suitably regularized version of Umegaki’s quantum relative entropy, known as telescopic relative entropy, that is tightly connected to the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. In particular, we derive general upper bounds on the telescopic relative entropy revivals conditioned and determined by the formation of correlations and changes in the environment. We illustrate our findings by means of examples, considering in particular the Jaynes-Cummings model and a phase covariant dynamics.},

However, direct measurements of these parameters are experimentally challenging. Here, we present a constant-extension method integrated into an angular optical trap to directly measure torque during DNA supercoiling. We measured the twist persistence length of extended DNA to be 22 nm under an extremely low force ( ∼ 0.02 pN ) and the twist persistence length of plectonemic DNA to be 24 nm. In addition, we implemented a rigorous data analysis scheme that bridged our measurements with existing theoretical models of DNA torsional behavior. This comprehensive set of torsional parameters demonstrates that at least 20\% of DNA supercoiling is partitioned into twist for both extended DNA and plectonemic DNA. This work provides a new experimental methodology, as well as an analytical and interpretational framework, which will enable, expand, and enhance future studies of DNA torsional properties.},

  abstract     = {The compression of soft elastic matter and biological tissue can lead to creasing, an instability where a surface folds sharply into periodic self-contacts. Intriguingly, the unfolding of the surface upon releasing the strain is usually not perfect: small scars remain that serve as nuclei for creases during repeated compressions. Here we present creasing experiments with sticky polymer surfaces, using confocal microscopy, which resolve the contact line region where folding and unfolding occurs. It is found that surface tension induces a second fold, at the edge of the self-contact, which leads to a singular elastic stress and self-similar crease morphologies. However, these profiles exhibit an intrinsic folding-unfolding asymmetry that is caused by contact line pinning, in a way that resembles wetting of liquids on imperfect solids. Contact line pinning is therefore a key element of creasing: it inhibits complete unfolding and gives soft surfaces a folding memory.},

  abstract     = {How superconductivity interacts with charge or nematic order is one of the great unresolved issues at the center of research in quantum materials. Ba 1 − x Sr x Ni 2 As 2 (BSNA) is a charge ordered pnictide superconductor recently shown to exhibit a sixfold enhancement of superconductivity due to nematic fluctuations near a quantum phase transition (at x c = 0.7 ) [1]. The superconductivity is, however, anomalous, with the resistive transition for 0.4 &lt; x &lt; x c occurring at a higher temperature than the specific heat anomaly. Using x-ray scattering, we discovered a new charge density wave (CDW) in BSNA in this composition range. The CDW is commensurate with a period of two lattice parameters, and is distinct from the two CDWs previously reported in this material [1,2]. We argue that the anomalous transport behavior arises from heterogeneous superconductivity nucleating at antiphase domain walls in this CDW. We also present new data on the incommensurate CDW, previously identified as being unidirectional [2], showing that it is a rotationally symmetric “ 4 Q ” state with C 4 symmetry. Our study establishes BSNA as a rare material containing three distinct CDWs, and an exciting test bed for studying coupling between CDW, nematic, and SC orders.},

Quantum interference patterns in the two-terminal conductance of this interferometer are controllable not only by tuning the strength but also, particularly, by rotating the direction of the magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the transport direction. Remarkably, the conductance exhibits a characteristic beating pattern with multiple frequencies depending on the field strength and direction in a unique fashion. Our novel interferometer thus provides feasible and robust magnetotransport signatures for hinge states of higher-order topological insulators.},

The SFF is determined by the leading eigenvalues of this transfer matrix. In the MBL phase, the leading eigenvalue is unique, as in a symmetry-unbroken phase, while in the ergodic phase and at late times the leading eigenvalues are asymptotically degenerate, as in a system with degenerate symmetry-breaking phases. We identify the broken symmetry of the transfer matrix, introduce a local order parameter for the transition, and show that the associated correlation functions are long-ranged only in the ergodic phase.},

In particular, by eliminating the need for numerical analytic continuation from a Matsubara representation, our scheme allows us to study spectral densities of arbitrary complexity with controlled accuracy in models with frequency-dependent effective interactions.

We demonstrate that TTG hosts extended and localized modes with an electronic structure that can be controlled by interlayer bias. In the presence of interactions, the existence of localized modes leads to the development of local moments, which are Kondo coupled to coexisting extended states. By electrically controlling the effective exchange between local moments, the system can be driven from a magnetic into a heavy fermion regime, passing through a quantum critical point, allowing one to electrically explore a generalized Doniach phase diagram. Our results put forward twisted graphene multilayers as a platform for the realization of strongly correlated heavy fermion physics in a purely carbon-based platform.},

  abstract     = {Anomalous heat transport in one-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanotubes and nanowires, is a widely debated problem in condensed matter and statistical physics, with contradicting pieces of evidence from experiments and simulations. Using a comprehensive modeling approach, comprised of lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations, we proved that the infinite length limit of the thermal conductivity of a (10,0) single-wall carbon nanotube is finite but this limit is reached only for macroscopic lengths due to a thermal phonon mean free path of several millimeters. Our calculations showed that the extremely high thermal conductivity of this system at room temperature is dictated by quantum effects. Modal analysis showed that the divergent nature of thermal conductivity, observed in one-dimensional model systems, is suppressed in carbon nanotubes by anharmonic scattering channels provided by the flexural and optical modes with polarization in the plane orthogonal to the transport direction.},

  abstract     = {We use unbiased computational methods to elucidate the onset and properties of pair superfluidity in two-species fermionic and bosonic systems with onsite interspecies attraction loaded in a uniform, i.e., with no confining potential, one-dimensional optical lattice. We compare results from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), emphasizing the one-to-one correspondence between the Drude weight tensor, calculated with DMRG, and the various winding numbers extracted from the QMC. Our results show that, for any nonvanishing attractive interaction, pairs form and are the sole contributors to superfluidity; there are no individual contributions due to the separate species. For weak attraction, the pair size diverges exponentially, i.e., Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing, requiring huge systems to bring out the pair-only nature of the superfluid. This crucial property is largely overlooked in many studies, thereby misinterpreting the origin and nature of the superfluid. We compare and contrast this with the repulsive case and show that the behavior is very different, contradicting previous claims about drag superfluidity and the symmetry of properties for attractive and repulsive interactions. Finally, our results show that the situation is similar for soft-core bosons: superfluidity is due only to pairs, even for the smallest attractive interaction strength compatible with the largest system sizes that we could attain.},

As demonstrated through state-of-the-art global electrostatic and electromagnetic simulations, the F-ATB is characterized by a full suppression of the turbulent transport—caused by strongly sheared, axisymmetric E × B flows—and an increase of the neoclassical counterpart, albeit keeping the overall fluxes at significantly reduced levels. The trigger mechanism is shown to be a mainly electrostatic resonant interaction between suprathermal particles, generated via ion-cyclotron-resonance heating, and plasma microturbulence. These findings are obtained by realistic simulations of the ASDEX Upgrade discharge No. 36637—properly designed to maximized the beneficial role of the wave-particle resonance interaction—which exhibits the expected properties of improved confinement produced by energetic particles.},

The modes are excited over a wide spatial range from macroscopic device size to microturbulence size and the perturbation energy propagates across multiple spatial scales. The radial mode structure is able to expand from local to global in ∼ 0.1 ms and it causes magnetic topology changes in the plasma edge, which can lead to a minor disruption event. Since the mode is typically observed in the high ion temperature ≳ 10 keV and high- β plasma regime, the manifestation of the mode in future reactors should be studied with development of mitigation strategies, if needed.

  abstract     = {Small multicomponent droplets are of increasing importance in a plethora of technological applications ranging from the fabrication of self-assembled hierarchical patterns to the design of autonomous fluidic systems. While often far away from equilibrium, involving complex and even chaotic flow fields, it is commonly assumed that in these systems with small drops surface tension keeps the shapes spherical. Here, studying picoliter volatile binary-mixture droplets of isopropanol and 2-butanol, we show that the dominance of surface tension forces at small scales can play a dual role: Minute variations in surface tension along the interface can create Marangoni flows that are strong enough to significantly deform the drop, forming micron-thick pancakelike shapes that are otherwise typical of large puddles. We identify the conditions under which these flattened shapes form and explain why, universally, they relax back to a spherical-cap shape toward the end of drop lifetime. We further show that the formation of pancakelike droplets suppresses the “coffee-ring” effect and leads to uniform deposition of suspended particles. The quantitative agreement between theory and experiment provides a predictive capability to modulate the shape of tiny droplets with implications in a range of technologies from fabrication of miniature optical lenses to coating, printing, and pattern deposition.},

We confirm scale invariance by observing the collapse of solitary-wave density profiles onto a single curve in a dimensionless coordinate rescaled according to their peak densities and observe that the scale-invariant profiles measured at different coupling constants g can further collapse onto the universal profile of Townes solitons. The reported scaling behavior is tested with a nearly 60-fold difference in soliton interaction energies and allows us to discuss the impact of a non-negligible magnetic dipole-dipole interaction (MDDI) on 2D scale invariance.

We show that this fast loop protocol can be used to enhance force sensing as well as to dramatically boost the entangling rate of two weakly interacting nanoparticles. We parameterize the performance of the protocol, and therefore the macroscopic quantum regime that could be explored, as a function of displacement and frequency noise in the nanoparticle’s center-of-mass motion.

The entangled light-matter character of metastable Autler-Townes multiplets, which makes them autoionizing polaritons, however, is still largely unexplored. We employ attosecond transient-absorption spectroscopy in argon to study the formation of polariton multiplets between the 3 s − 1 4 p and several light-induced states. We measure a controllable stabilization of the polaritons against ionization, in excellent agreement with ab initio theory. Using an extension of the Jaynes-Cummings model to autoionizing states, we show that this stabilization is due to the destructive interference between the Auger decay and the radiative ionization of the polaritonic components. These results give new insights into the optical control of electronic structure in the continuum and unlock the door to applications of radiative stabilization in metastable polyelectronic systems.},

  abstract     = {We have realized optical excitation, trapping, and detection of the radioisotope Kr 81 with an isotopic abundance of 0.9 ppt. The 124 nm light needed for the production of metastable atoms is generated by a resonant discharge lamp. Photon transport through the optically thick krypton gas inside the lamp is simulated and optimized to enhance both brightness and resonance. We achieve a state-of-the-art Kr 81 loading rate of 1800 atoms / h , which can be further scaled up by adding more lamps. The all-optical approach overcomes the limitations on precision and sample size of radiokrypton dating, enabling new applications in the earth sciences, particularly for dating of polar ice cores.},

These conical intersections can occur when the Rydberg atom’s quantum defect is similar in size to the electron–ground-state atom scattering phase shift divided by π , a condition satisfied in several commonly studied atomic species. The conical intersections have an observable consequence in the rate of ultracold l -changing collisions of the type Rb ( n f ) + Rb ( 5 s ) → Rb ( n l &gt; 3 ) + Rb ( 5 s ) . In the vicinity of a conical intersection, this rate is strongly suppressed, and the Rydberg atom becomes nearly transparent to the ground-state atom.},

This phenomenon has been demonstrated theoretically in hardcore and anyonic Tonks-Girardeau gases and was recently experimentally observed in a strongly interacting Bose gas. We extend this study to a one-dimensional spinor gas of arbitrary spin in the strongly interacting regime and analytically prove that the total momentum distribution after the harmonic trap is turned off approaches that of a spinless ideal Fermi gas, while the asymptotic momentum distribution of each spin component takes the same shape of the initial real space density profile of that spin component. Our work demonstrates the rich physics arising from the interplay between the spin and the charge degrees of freedom in a spinor system.},

Various obstacles which historically have doomed such an approach to be unfeasible are overcome. First, we resort to a generalization of the Ritz variational principle to ensemble states with fixed weights. This in combination with the constrained search formalism allows us to establish a universal functional of the one-particle reduced density matrix. Second, we employ tools from convex analysis to circumvent the too involved N -representability constraints. Remarkably, this identifies Valone’s pioneering work on RDMFT as a special case of convex relaxation and reveals that crucial information about the excitation structure is contained in the functional’s domain. Third, to determine the crucial latter object, a methodology is developed which eventually leads to a generalized exclusion principle. The corresponding linear constraints are calculated for systems of arbitrary size.},

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proven to be a flexible tool to approximate quantum many-body states in condensed matter and chemistry problems. In this work we introduce a neural-network quantum state ansatz to model the ground-state wave function of light nuclei, and approximately solve the nuclear many-body Schrödinger equation. Using efficient stochastic sampling and optimization schemes, our approach extends pioneering applications of ANNs in the field, which present exponentially scaling algorithmic complexity. We compute the binding energies and point-nucleon densities of A ≤ 4 nuclei as emerging from a leading-order pionless effective field theory Hamiltonian. We successfully benchmark the ANN wave function against more conventional parametrizations based on two- and three-body Jastrow functions, and virtually exact Green’s function Monte Carlo results.},

This provides, for the first time, evidence that the standard model Higgs couples to second generation fermions. This measurement is particularly interesting in the context of the intriguing hints for lepton flavor universality violation, accumulated within recent years, as new physics explanations could also be tested in the h → μ + μ − decay mode. Leptoquarks are prime candidates to account for the flavor anomalies. In particular, they can provide the necessary chiral enhancement (by a factor m t / m μ ) to address a μ with tera-electron-volt scale new physics. In this Letter we point out that such explanations of a μ also lead to enhanced effects in h → μ + μ − and we examine the correlations between h → μ + μ − and a μ within leptoquark models. We find that the effect in the branching ratio of h → μ + μ − ranges from several percent up to a factor of 3, if one aims at accounting for a μ at the 2 σ level. Hence, the new ATLAS and CMS Collaboration measurements already provide important constraints on the parameter space, rule out specific a μ explanations, and will be very important to test the flavor anomalies in the future.},

We found that Na and Al, together with nitrogen (N), belong to a distinct cosmic ray group. In this group, we observe that, similar to the N flux, both the Na flux and Al flux are well described by the sums of a primary cosmic ray component (proportional to the silicon flux) and a secondary cosmic ray component (proportional to the fluorine flux). The fraction of the primary component increases with rigidity for the N, Na, and Al fluxes and becomes dominant at the highest rigidities.

To prove the analogy with a standard large spacing optical lattice we study Bloch oscillations of a Bose Einstein condensate with negligible interactions in the presence of a small force. The observed dynamics between sites separated by ten microns for times exceeding one second proves the high stability of the potential. This novel lattice is the ideal candidate for the coherent manipulation of atomic samples at large spatial separations and might find direct application in atom-based technologies like trapped-atom interferometers and quantum simulators.},

By Trotterizing the quantum Liouvillians, the continuous evolution of an open quantum system is effectively realized, and its application in error mitigation is demonstrated by adjusting the simulated noise intensities. High-order Trotter for open quantum dynamics is also experimentally investigated and shows higher accuracy.

Using arrays of up to 19 Yb + 171 ions, we demonstrate that the structural phase boundaries of such crystals are well described by the pseudopotential approximation, despite the time-dependent ion positions driven by intrinsic micromotion. We further observe that micromotion-induced heating of the radial-2D crystal is confined to the radial plane. Finally, we verify that the transverse motional modes, which are used in most ion-trap quantum simulation schemes, are well-predictable numerically and remain decoupled and cold in this geometry.

  abstract     = {Notions of circuit complexity and cost play a key role in quantum computing and simulation where they capture the (weighted) minimal number of gates that is required to implement a unitary. Similar notions also become increasingly prominent in high energy physics in the study of holography. While notions of entanglement have in general little implications for the quantum circuit complexity and the cost of a unitary, in this work, we discuss a simple such relationship when both the entanglement of a state and the cost of a unitary take small values, building on ideas on how values of entangling power of quantum gates add up. This bound implies that if entanglement entropies grow linearly in time, so does the cost. The implications are twofold: It provides insights into complexity growth for short times. In the context of quantum simulation, it allows us to compare digital and analog quantum simulators. The main technical contribution is a continuous-variable small incremental entangling bound.},

  abstract     = {We investigate whether paradigmatic measurements for quantum state tomography, namely mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete measurements, can be employed to certify quantum correlations. For this purpose, we identify a simple and noise-robust correlation witness for entanglement detection, steering, and nonlocality that can be evaluated based on the outcome statistics obtained in the tomography experiment. This allows us to perform state tomography on entangled qutrits, a test of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and a Bell inequality test, all within a single experiment. We also investigate the trade-off between quantum correlations and subsets of tomographically complete measurements as well as the quantification of entanglement in the different scenarios. Finally, we perform a photonics experiment in which we demonstrate quantum correlations under these flexible assumptions, namely with both parties trusted, one party untrusted and both parties untrusted.},

  abstract     = {For two molecules to react they first have to meet. Yet, reaction times are rarely on par with the first-passage times that govern such molecular encounters. A prime reason for this discrepancy is stochastic transitions between reactive and nonreactive molecular states, which results in effective gating of product formation and altered reaction kinetics. To better understand this phenomenon we develop a unifying approach to gated reactions on networks. We first show that the mean and distribution of the gated reaction time can always be expressed in terms of ungated first-passage and return times. This relation between gated and ungated kinetics is then explored to reveal universal features of gated reactions. The latter are exemplified using a diverse set of case studies which are also used to expose the exotic kinetics that arises due to molecular gating.},

At high impurity densities, the 2D crystal breaks into polycrystalline domains separated by grain boundaries where the impurity particles aggregate. This transition is accompanied by a decrease in the elastic moduli, and it is associated with strong heterogeneous dynamics in the system.

  abstract     = {Self-dual structures whose dual counterparts are themselves possess unique hidden symmetry, beyond the description of classical spatial symmetry groups. Here we propose a strategy based on a nematic monolayer of attractive half-cylindrical colloids to self-assemble these exotic structures. This system can be seen as a 2D system of semidisks. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we discover two isostatic self-dual crystals, i.e., an unreported crystal with p m g space-group symmetry and the twisted kagome crystal. For the p m g crystal approaching the critical point, we find the double degeneracy of the full phononic spectrum at the self-dual point and the merging of two tilted Weyl nodes into one critically tilted Dirac node. The latter is “accidentally” located on the high-symmetry line. The formation of this unconventional Dirac node is due to the emergence of the critical flatbands at the self-dual point, which are linear combinations of “finite-frequency” floppy modes. These modes can be understood as mechanically coupled self-dual rhombus chains vibrating in some unique uncoupled ways. Our work paves the way for designing and fabricating self-dual materials with exotic mechanical or phononic properties.},

At lower temperature, we observe a rapid rise of c / T , followed by a drop to zero as the system becomes superconducting. The spin susceptibility begins to drop at roughly the same temperature where the enhancement of c / T onsets, most likely due to the opening of a gap associated with superconducting fluctuations. These findings suggest that superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid behavior (manifested in an enhancement of the effective mass) onset at comparable energy scales.

Alternatively, it has also been recently proposed that such replica bands might instead originate from extrinsic final state losses associated with the photoemission process. Here, we perform a quantitative examination of replica bands in monolayer FeSe / SrTi O 3 , where we are able to conclusively demonstrate that the replica bands are indeed signatures of intrinsic electron-boson coupling, and not associated with final state effects. A detailed analysis of the energy splittings and relative peak intensities between the higher-order replicas, as well as other self-energy effects, allows us to determine that the interfacial electron-phonon coupling in the system corresponds to a value of λ = 0.19 ± 0.02 , providing valuable insights into the enhancement of superconductivity in monolayer FeSe / SrTi O 3 .

Because of the short duration of the x-ray probe pulse and precise control of the pulse delay, the excitation-induced dynamics during the first picosecond after the pump can be resolved with unprecedented time resolution. By comparing with density functional theory spectrum calculations, we find high excitation of the internal stretch and frustrated rotation modes occurring within 200 fs of laser excitation, as well as thermalization of the system in the picosecond regime. The ∼ 100 fs initial excitation of these CO vibrational modes is not readily rationalized by traditional theories of nonadiabatic coupling of adsorbates to metal surfaces, e.g., electronic frictions based on first order electron-phonon coupling or transient population of adsorbate resonances. We suggest that coupling of the adsorbate to nonthermalized electron-hole pairs is responsible for the ultrafast initial excitation of the modes.},

We derive this conclusion from general arguments, from classical percolation theory, and from the numerical study of a 3D quantum network model simulating a disordered axion insulator through a layer construction. We find the localization length critical exponent near the delocalization transition to be ν = 1.42 ± 0.12 .

  abstract     = {The microscopic mechanism by which amorphous solids yield plastically under an externally applied stress or deformation has remained elusive in spite of enormous research activity in recent years. Most approaches have attempted to identify atomic-scale structural “defects” or spatiotemporal correlations in the undeformed glass that may trigger plastic instability. In contrast, in this Letter we show that the topological defects that correlate with plastic instability can be identified, not in the static structure of the glass, but rather in the nonaffine displacement field under deformation. These dislocation-like topological defects (DTDs) can be quantitatively characterized in terms of Burgers circuits (and the resulting Burgers vectors) that are constructed on the microscopic nonaffine displacement field. We demonstrate that (i) DTDs are the manifestation of incompatibility of deformation in glasses as a result of violation of Cauchy-Born rules (nonaffinity); (ii) the resulting average Burgers vector displays peaks in correspondence of major plastic events, including a spectacular nonlocal peak at the yielding transition, which results from self-organization into shear bands due to the attractive interaction between antiparallel DTDs; and (iii) application of Schmid’s law to the DTDs leads to prediction of shear bands at 45° for uniaxial deformations, as widely observed in experiments and simulations.},

The state exists in three-dimensional two-band models. We demonstrate that the Hopf insulator can be naturally realized in lattices of dipolar-interacting spins, where spin exchange plays the role of particle hopping. The long-ranged, anisotropic nature of the dipole-dipole interactions allows for the precise detail required in the momentum-space structure, while different spin orientations ensure the necessary structure of the complex phases of the hoppings. Our model features robust gapless edge states at both smooth edges, as well as sharp edges obeying a certain crystalline symmetry, despite the breakdown of the two-band picture at the latter.

An accompanying analysis confirms that the formation of strong shocks is fully captured. The exhibited lack of a steady state induced by indefinite expansion of a disordered transition zone points to the absence of local thermodynamic equilibrium and resurfaces lingering questions on the validity of continuum assumptions in the presence of strong shocks.},

We unveil a previously unrecognized regime: By increasing the nonlinearity, the system self-organizes into an incoherent localized structure that contains “hidden” coherent soliton states. The solitons are hidden in the sense that they are fully immersed in random wave fluctuations: The radius of the soliton is much larger than the correlation radius of the incoherent fluctuations, while its peak amplitude is of the same order of such fluctuations. Accordingly, the solitons can hardly be identified in the usual spatial or spectral domains, while their existence is clearly unveiled in the phase-space representation. Our multiscale theory based on coupled coherent-incoherent wave turbulence formalisms reveals that the hidden solitons are stabilized and trapped by the incoherent localized structure. Furthermore, hidden binary soliton systems are identified numerically and described theoretically. The regime of hidden solitons is of potential interest for self-gravitating Boson models of “fuzzy&quot; dark matter. It also sheds new light on the quantum-to-classical correspondence with gravitational interactions. The hidden solitons can be observed in nonlocal nonlinear optics experiments through the measurement of the spatial spectrogram.},

Unlike previous works that focus on the Fermi arc surface states of a single Weyl structure, we can experimentally construct arbitrary interfaces between two Weyl structures whose orientations can be freely rotated in the synthetic parameter space. This intriguing system was difficult to realize in usual 3D Weyl semimetals due to lattice mismatch. We found whether the interface can host gapless topological interface states or not is determined by the relative rotational directions of the two Weyl structures. In the experiment, we have probed the local characteristics of the TISs through linear optical transmission and nonlinear second harmonic generation.

Using a rigorous quantization of the macroscopic Maxwell equations in the presence of arbitrary linear media, we derive a corrected Fermi’s golden rule and master equation for a quantum two-level system (TLS) that yields a quantum pumping term and a modified decay rate that is net positive. We show rigorous numerical results of the temporal dynamics of the TLS for an example of two coupled microdisk resonators, forming a gain-loss medium, and demonstrate the clear failure of the commonly adopted formulas based solely on the local density of states.},

Our technique enables measurement-based quantum control of nuclear spins, such as the preparation of spin-squeezed states.

In this work, we compute dipolar frequency shifts accounting for the intrinsic atomic multilevel structure in standard Ramsey spectroscopy. When interrogating the transitions featuring the smallest Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, we find that a simplified two-level treatment becomes inappropriate, even in the presence of large Zeeman shifts. For these cases, we show a net suppression of dipolar frequency shifts and the emergence of dominant nonclassical effects for experimentally relevant parameters. Our findings are pertinent to current generations of optical lattice and optical tweezer clocks, opening a way to further increase their current accuracy, and thus their potential to probe fundamental and many-body physics.},

The clock states are nondegenerate and completely immune to nonscalar perturbations, including first order Zeeman and electric quadrupole shifts. Additionally, the proposed clock is relatively insusceptible to other frequency shifts (blackbody radiation, second order Zeeman, Doppler), accommodates “magic” rf trapping, and is robust against decoherence mechanisms that can otherwise limit clock stability. By driving the transition as a two-photon E 1 + M 1 process, the accompanying probe Stark shift is appreciable yet manageable for practical Rabi frequencies.},

Whereas beams of e ± , μ ± , π ± , K ± , protons, antiprotons, and various heavy ions have been produced and have enabled many scientific breakthroughs, beams of antineutrons, hyperons ( Λ , Σ , and Ξ ) and their antiparticles are typically not easy to obtain. Here we point out and investigate a new high-quality source of these particles: a super- J / ψ factory with the capability of accumulating trillions of J / ψ decays each year. In the relevant J / ψ decays, the desired particle is produced together with other final-state particles that can be tagged. This allows accurate determination of the flux and momentum of the projectile, enabling unprecedented precision in the study of the corresponding interactions with a broad range of targets. These novel high-statistics sources of baryons and antibaryons with precisely known kinematics open fresh opportunities for applications in particle and nuclear physics, including antinucleon-nucleon interaction, a nonvalence s s ¯ component of the nucleon, (anti)hyperon-nucleon interaction, OZI violation, (multistrange) hypernuclei, exotic light hadron spectroscopy, and many others, as well as calibration of Monte Carlo simulation for hadronic and medical physics.},

The mixing of the new quarks with the SM ones, after electroweak symmetry breaking, does not only explain Z → b b ¯ data, but also generates a lepton flavor universal contribution to b → s ℓ + ℓ − transitions. Together with the lepton flavor universality violating effect, generated by loop-induced Z ′ penguins involving the charged scalar and the heavy quarks, it gives an excellent fit to data ( 6.1 σ better than the SM). Furthermore, the charged scalar (neutral vector) gives a necessarily constructive tree-level (loop) effect in μ → e ν ν ( τ → μ ν ν ), which can naturally account for the CAA ( Br [ τ → μ ν ν ] / Br [ τ → e ν ν ] and Br [ τ → μ ν ν ] / Br [ μ → e ν ν ] ).},

Thinking of GFE as a potential tracer of new, isotropy- and/or parity-violating physics, we apply our formalism to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarized anisotropy power spectra, providing a simple framework to easily compute their observed modifications. In so doing, we re-interpret previously known results, namely, the in vacuo rotation of the linear polarization plane of CMB photons (or cosmic birefringence) but also point out that GFE could lead to the partial conversion of linear into circular polarization. We notice that GFE can be seen as an effect of light propagating in an anisotropic and/or chiral medium (a “dark crystal”) and recast its parameters as the components of an effective “cosmic susceptibility tensor.” For a wave number-independent susceptibility tensor, this allows us to set an observational bound on a GFE-induced CMB circularly polarized power spectrum, or VV, at C ℓ V V &lt; 2 × 10 − 5 μ K 2 (95\% C.L.), at its peak ℓ ≃ 370 , which is some 3 orders of magnitude better than presently available direct VV measurements. We argue that, unless dramatic technological improvements will arise in direct V -modes measurements, cosmic variance-limited linear polarization surveys expected within this decade should provide, as a byproduct, superior bounds on GFE-induced circular polarization of the CMB.},

  abstract     = {Detonation initiation in a reactive medium can be achieved by an externally created shock wave. Supersonic flow onto a gravitating center, known as Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion, is a natural shock wave creating process, but, to our knowledge, a reactive medium has never been considered in the literature. Here, we conduct an order of magnitude analysis to investigate under which conditions the shock-induced reaction zone recouples to the shock front. We derive three semianalytical criteria for self-sustained detonation ignition. We apply these criteria to the special situation where a primordial black hole (PBH) of asteroid mass traverses a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD). Since detonations in carbon-oxygen WDs are supposed to produce normal thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia), the observed SN Ia rate constrains the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs as log 10 ( f PBH ) &lt; 0.8 log 10 ( M BH / 3 × 1 0 22 g ) in the range 10 21 – 10 22 g ( 10 20 – 10 22 g ) from a conservative (optimistic) analysis. Most importantly, these encounters can account for both the rate and the median explosion mass of normal sub-Chandrasekhar SNe Ia if a significant fraction of DM is in the form of PBHs with mass 10 23 g .},

  abstract     = {The theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics has been an important tool for analyzing macroscopic behavior in nonlinear lattices. However, despite its practical success, its microscopic derivation is still incomplete. In this work, we provide the microscopic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics, using the coarse-graining and projection technique; the equivalence of ensembles turns out to be critical. The Green-Kubo (GK)-like formula for the bare transport coefficients are presented in a numerically computable form. Our numerical simulations show that the bare transport coefficients exist for a sufficiently large but finite coarse-graining length in the infinite lattice within the framework of the GK-like formula. This demonstrates that the bare transport coefficients uniquely exist for each physical system.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of gravitational wave detectors employing squeezed light, quantum waveform estimation—estimating a time-dependent signal by means of a quantum-mechanical probe—is of increasing importance. As is well known, backaction of quantum measurement limits the precision with which the waveform can be estimated, though these limits can, in principle, be overcome by “quantum nondemolition” (QND) measurement setups found in the literature. Strictly speaking, however, their implementation would require infinite energy, as their mathematical description involves Hamiltonians unbounded from below. This raises the question of how well one may approximate nondemolition setups with finite energy or finite-dimensional realizations. Here we consider a finite-dimensional waveform estimation setup based on the “quasi-ideal clock” and show that the estimation errors due to approximating the QND condition decrease slowly, as a power law, with increasing dimension. As a result, we find that approximating QND with this system requires large energy or dimensionality. We argue that this result can be expected to also hold for setups based on truncated oscillators or spin systems.},

This yields a practical method for quantifying entanglement in realistic experimental situations, in particular, when only few measurements of simple observables are available. As a concrete application of this method, we quantify bipartite and multipartite entanglement in spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensates of ∼ 500 atoms , by lower bounding the best separable approximation and the generalized robustness only from measurements of first and second moments of the collective spin operator.},

Our theoretical analysis, valid for symmetric interactions, shows that for sufficiently heterogeneous interactions and low demographic noise the system displays a multiple equilibria phase, which we fully characterize. In particular, we show that in this phase the number of locally stable equilibria is exponential in the number of species. Upon further decreasing the demographic noise, we unveil the presence of a second transition like the so-called “Gardner” transition to a marginally stable phase similar to that observed in the jamming of amorphous materials. We confirm and complement our analytical results by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we extend their relevance by showing that they hold for other interacting random dynamical systems such as the random replicant model. Finally, we discuss their extension to the case of asymmetric couplings.},

To understand how multiple condensates with distinct compositions can self-assemble in such a heterogeneous system, which may not be at thermodynamic equilibrium, we study a minimal model in which we can “program” the pairwise interactions among hundreds of species. We show that the number of distinct condensates that can be reliably assembled grows superlinearly with the number of species in the mixture when the condensates share components. Furthermore, we show that we can predict the maximum number of distinct condensates in a mixture without knowing the details of the pairwise interactions. Simulations of condensate growth confirm these predictions and suggest that the physical rules governing the achievable complexity of condensate-mediated spatial organization are broadly applicable to biomolecular mixtures.},

In this Letter, we demonstrate the controlled generation of magnon drift currents in heterostructures of yttrium iron garnet and platinum. By performing electrical injection and detection of incoherent magnons, we find magnon drift currents that stem from the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We can further control the magnon drift by the orientation of the magnetic field. The drift current changes the magnon propagation length by up to ± 6\% relative to diffusion. We generalize the magnonic spin transport theory to include a finite drift velocity resulting from any inversion asymmetric interaction and obtain results consistent with our experiments.},

  abstract     = {We report the observation of discrete bound states with the energy levels deviating from the widely believed ratio of 1 ∶ 3 ∶ 5 in the vortices of an iron-based superconductor KCa 2 Fe 4 As 4 F 2 through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Meanwhile Friedel oscillations of vortex bound states are also observed for the first time in related vortices. By doing self-consistent calculations of Bogoliubov–de Gennes equations, we find that at extreme quantum limit, the superconducting order parameter exhibits a Friedel-like oscillation, which modifies the energy levels of the vortex bound states and explains why it deviates from the ratio of 1 ∶ 3 ∶ 5 . The observed Friedel oscillations of the bound states can also be roughly interpreted by the theoretical calculations, however some features at high energies could not be explained. We attribute this discrepancy to the high energy bound states with the influence of nearby impurities. Our combined STM measurement and the self-consistent calculations illustrate a generalized feature of vortex bound states in type-II superconductors.},

  abstract     = {The major obstacle preventing Feynman diagrammatic expansions from accurately solving many-fermion systems in strongly correlated regimes is the series slow convergence or divergence problem. Several techniques have been proposed to address this issue: series resummation by conformal mapping, changing the nature of the starting point of the expansion by shifted action tools, and applying the homotopy analysis method to the Dyson-Schwinger equation. They emerge as dissimilar mathematical procedures aimed at different aspects of the problem. The proposed homotopic action offers a universal and systematic framework for unifying the existing—and generating new—methods and ideas to formulate a physical system in terms of a convergent diagrammatic series. It eliminates the need for resummation, allows one to introduce effective interactions, enables a controlled ultraviolet regularization of continuous-space theories, and reduces the intrinsic polynomial complexity of the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method. We illustrate this approach by an application to the Hubbard model.},

  abstract     = {Achieving Bloch oscillations of free carriers under a direct current, a long-sought-after collective many-body behavior, has been challenging due to stringent constraints on the band properties. We argue that the flat bands in moiré graphene fulfill the basic requirements for observing Bloch oscillations, offering an appealing alternative to the stacked quantum wells used in previous work aiming to access this regime. Bloch-oscillating moiré superlattices emit a comblike spectrum of incommensurate frequencies, a property of interest for converting direct currents into high-frequency currents and developing broadband amplifiers in terahertz domain. The oscillations can be synchronized through coupling to an oscillator mode in a photonic or plasmonic resonator. Phase-coherent collective oscillations in the resonant regime provide a realization of current-pumped terahertz lasing.},

In the four-mode regime, all modes are ballistic and acquire Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like broadening with asymmetric power-law tails. “Heads” and “tails” of the waves contribute equally to thermal conductivity, leading to ω − 1 / 3 scaling of its real part.

In the 1 T − TaS 2 layer of 4 H b − TaS 2 , we observe a narrow electronic band located near the Fermi level, and its spatial distribution is consistent with the tight-binding calculations for two-dimensional 1 T − TaS 2 layers. The weak electronic hybridization between the 1 T − TaS 2 and 1 H − TaS 2 layers in 4 H b − TaS 2 shifts the narrow electronic band to be slightly above the Fermi level, which suppresses the electronic correlation-induced band splitting. In contrast, in bulk 1 T − TaS 2 , there is an interlayer CDW coupling-induced insulating gap. In comparison with the spatial distributions of the electronic states in bulk 1 T − TaS 2 and 4 H b − TaS 2 , the insulating gap in bulk 1 T − TaS 2 results from the formation of a bonding band and an antibonding band due to the overlap of the narrow electronic bands in the dimerized 1 T − TaS 2 layers.},

Here, we visualize the impurity pinning evolution of the CDW in ZrTe 3 using the variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. At low temperatures, we observe a quasi-1D incommensurate CDW modulation moderately correlated to the impurity positions, indicating a weak impurity pinning. As we raise the sample temperature, the CDW modulation gets progressively weakened and distorted, while the correlation with the impurities becomes stronger. Above the CDW transition temperature, short-range modulations persist with the phase almost all pinned by impurities. The evolution from weak to strong impurity pinning through the CDW transition can be understood as a result of losing phase rigidity.},

  abstract     = {Tantalum was once thought to be the canonical bcc metal, but is now predicted to transition to the Pnma phase at the high pressures and temperatures expected along the principal Hugoniot. Furthermore, there remains a significant discrepancy between a number of static diamond anvil cell experiments and gas gun experiments in the measured melt temperatures at high pressures. Our in situ x-ray diffraction experiments on shock compressed tantalum show that it does not transition to the Pnma phase or other candidate phases at high pressure. We observe incipient melting at approximately 254 ± 15 GPa and complete melting by 317 ± 10 GPa . These transition pressures from the nanosecond experiments presented here are consistent with what can be inferred from microsecond gas gun sound velocity measurements. Furthermore, the observation of a coexistence region on the Hugoniot implies the lack of significant kinetically controlled deviation from equilibrium behavior. Consequently, we find that kinetics of phase transitions cannot be used to explain the discrepancy between static and dynamic measurements of the tantalum melt curve. Using available high pressure thermodynamic data for tantalum and our measurements of the incipient and complete melting transition pressures, we are able to infer a melting temperature 8070 − 750 + 1250 K at 254 ± 15 GPa , which is consistent with ambient and a recent static high pressure melt curve measurement.},

Though of great significance for various applications, chirality extremization (maximized or minimized) with respect to incident directions or structure orientations has not been explored, especially in a systematic manner. In this study we examine the chiral responses of open photonic structures from perspectives of quasinormal modes and polarization singularities of their far-field radiations. The nontrivial topology of the momentum sphere secures the existence of generic singularity directions along which mode radiations are either circularly or linearly polarized. When plane waves are incident along those directions, the reciprocity ensures ideal maximization and minimization of optical chiralities, for corresponding mode radiations of circular and linear polarizations, respectively. For directions of general elliptical polarizations, we have unveiled the subtle equality of a Stokes parameter and the circular dichroism, showing that an intrinsically (geometrically) chiral structure can unexpectedly exhibit no optical chirality at all or even optical chiralities of opposite handedness for different incident directions. The framework we establish can be applied to not only finite scattering bodies but also infinite structures, encompassing both intrinsic and extrinsic optical chiralities. We have effectively merged two vibrant disciplines of chiral and singular optics, which can potentially trigger more optical chirality-singularity related interdisciplinary studies.},

For an optimized temporal filter, we observe a large Wigner logarithmic negativity, in excess of 0.08, in agreement with theory. The fidelity between the theoretical predictions and the states generated experimentally is up to 99\%, reaching state-of-the-art realizations in the microwave frequency domain. Our results provide a new way to generate and control nonclassical states, and may enable promising applications such as quantum networks and quantum computation based on waveguide quantum electrodynamics.},

  abstract     = {Harmonic oscillators count among the most fundamental quantum systems with important applications in molecular physics, nanoparticle trapping, and quantum information processing. Their equidistant energy level spacing is often a desired feature, but at the same time a challenge if the goal is to deterministically populate specific eigenstates. Here, we show how interference in the transition amplitudes in a bichromatic laser field can suppress the sequential climbing of harmonic oscillator states (Kapitza-Dirac blockade) and achieve selective excitation of energy eigenstates, cat states, and other non-Gaussian states. This technique can transform the harmonic oscillator into a coherent two-level system or be used to build a large-momentum-transfer beam splitter for matter waves. To illustrate the universality of the concept, we discuss feasible experiments that cover many orders of magnitude in mass, from single electrons over large molecules to dielectric nanoparticles.},

Populated states of Ca 54 were investigated through γ -ray and invariant-mass spectroscopy. Level energies were calculated from the nuclear shell model employing a phenomenological internucleon interaction. Theoretical cross sections to states were calculated from distorted-wave impulse approximation estimates multiplied by the shell model spectroscopic factors, which describe the wave function overlap of the Sc 55 ground state with states in Ca 54 . Despite the calculations showing a significant amplitude of excited neutron configurations in the ground-state of Sc 55 , valence proton removals populated predominantly the ground state of Ca 54 . This counterintuitive result is attributed to pairing effects leading to a dominance of the ground-state spectroscopic factor. Owing to the ubiquity of the pairing interaction, this argument should be generally applicable to direct knockout reactions from odd-even to even-even nuclei.},

Predictions for the modification of these observables in electron-gold relative to electron-proton collisions reveal how the flexible center-of-mass energies and kinematic coverage at this new facility can be used to enhance the signal and maximize the impact of the electron-nucleus program.

I demonstrate that chiral symmetry is dynamically broken for N f ≤ 3 2 N c while the theories lead to nontrivial infrared fixed points for larger number of flavors. While there may be a phase transition as m is increased beyond Λ , qualitative agreements with expectations in QCD are encouraging and suggest that two limits m ≪ Λ and m ≫ Λ may be in the same universality class.},

We present long-term general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a typical postmerger accretion disk at initial accretion rates of M ˙ ∼ 1 M ⊙ s − 1 over 400 ms postmerger. We include neutrino radiation transport that accounts for the effects of neutrino fast flavor conversions dynamically. We find ubiquitous flavor oscillations that result in a significantly more neutron-rich outflow, providing lanthanide and 3rd-peak r-process abundances similar to solar abundances. This provides strong evidence that postmerger accretion disks are a major production site of heavy r-process elements. A similar flavor effect may allow for increased lanthanide production in collapsars.},

Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) has attracted considerable attention because of its outstanding key rates over long distances. Recently, several demonstrations of TF-QKD have been realized. Nevertheless, those experiments are implemented in the laboratory, and therefore a critical question remains about whether the TF-QKD is feasible in real-world circumstances. Here, by adopting the sending-or-not-sending twin-field QKD (SNS-TF-QKD) with the method of actively odd parity pairing (AOPP), we demonstrate a field-test QKD over 428 km of deployed commercial fiber and two users are physically separated by about 300 km in a straight line. To this end, we explicitly measure the relevant properties of the deployed fiber and develop a carefully designed system with high stability. The secure key rate we achieved breaks the absolute key rate limit of repeaterless QKD. The result provides a new distance record for the field test of both TF-QKD and all types of fiber-based QKD systems. Our work bridges the gap of QKD between laboratory demonstrations and practical applications and paves the way for an intercity QKD network with measurement-device-independent security.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement underpins a variety of quantum-enhanced communication, sensing, and computing capabilities. Entanglement-assisted communication (EACOMM) leverages entanglement preshared by communicating parties to boost the rate of classical information transmission. Pioneering theory works showed that EACOMM can enable a communication rate well beyond the ultimate classical capacity of optical communications, but an experimental demonstration of any EACOMM advantage remains elusive. In this Letter we report the implementation of EACOMM surpassing the classical capacity over lossy and noisy bosonic channels. We construct a high-efficiency entanglement source and a phase-conjugate quantum receiver to reap the benefit of preshared entanglement, despite entanglement being broken by channel loss and noise. We show that EACOMM beats the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland capacity of classical communication by up to 16.3\%, when both protocols are subject to the same power constraint at the transmitter. As a practical performance benchmark, we implement a classical communication protocol with the identical characteristics for the encoded signal, showing that EACOMM can reduce the bit-error rate by up to 69\% over the same bosonic channel. Our work opens a route to provable quantum advantages in a wide range of quantum information processing tasks.},

In this Letter, starting from active model H * , the general hydrodynamics of a pseudoscalar in a momentum-conserving fluid, we demonstrate that chirality qualitatively modifies the dynamics of layered liquid crystals in active systems in both two and three dimensions due to an active “odder” elasticity. In three dimensions, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamics of active cholesterics differs fundamentally from smectic-A liquid crystals, unlike their equilibrium counterpart. This distinction can be used to engineer a columnar array of vortices, with an antiferromagnetic vorticity alignment, that can be switched on and off by external strain. A two-dimensional chiral layered state—an array of lines on an incompressible, freestanding film of chiral active fluid with a preferred normal direction—is generically unstable. However, this instability can be tuned in easily realizable experimental settings when the film is either on a substrate or in an ambient fluid.},

Magnetization M ∼ E 5 ( ω ) × E 5 * ( ω ) appears as a result of the transfer of the angular momentum of the axial electric field E 5 ( t ) into the magnetic moment in Dirac and Weyl semimetals. We point out similarities and differences between the proposed AMEE and a conventional inverse Faraday effect. As an example, we estimated the AMEE generated by circularly polarized acoustic waves and find it to be on the scale of microgauss for gigahertz frequency sound. In contrast to a conventional inverse Faraday effect, magnetization rises linearly at small frequencies and fixed sound intensity as well as demonstrates a nonmonotonic peak behavior for the AMEE. The effect provides a way to investigate unusual axial electromagnetic fields via conventional magnetometry techniques.},

These are the signatures of a peculiar correlated paramagnetic phase which can be considered as a new example of Coulomb phase.

Here, we study the interplay between CDW and SC in CsV 3 Sb 5 via measurements of resistivity, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility under various pressures up to 6.6 GPa. We find that the CDW transition decreases with pressure and experience a subtle modification at P c 1 ≈ 0.6 – 0.9 GPa before it vanishes completely at P c 2 ≈ 2 GPa . Correspondingly, T c ( P ) displays an unusual M -shaped double dome with two maxima around P c 1 and P c 2 , respectively, leading to a tripled enhancement of T c to about 8 K at 2 GPa. The obtained temperature-pressure phase diagram resembles those of unconventional superconductors, illustrating an intimated competition between CDW-like order and SC. The competition is found to be particularly strong for the intermediate pressure range P c 1 ≤ P ≤ P c 2 as evidenced by the broad superconducting transition and reduced superconducting volume fraction. The modification of CDW order around P c 1 has been discussed based on the band structure calculations. This work not only demonstrates the potential to raise T c of the V-based kagome superconductors, but also offers more insights into the rich physics related to the electron correlations in this novel family of topological kagome metals.},

These gauge connections behave as non-Abelian antisymmetric tensor gauge fields in momentum space and naturally generalize Abelian tensor Berry connections and ordinary non-Abelian (vector) Berry connections. We build these novel gauge fields from momentum-space Higgs fields, which emerge from the degenerate band structure of multiband models. First, we show that the conventional topological invariants of two-dimensional topological insulators and three-dimensional Dirac semimetals can be derived from the winding number associated with the Higgs field. Second, through the non-Abelian tensor Berry connections we construct higher-dimensional Berry-Zak phases and show their role in the topological characterization of several gapped and gapless systems, ranging from two-dimensional Euler insulators to four-dimensional Dirac semimetals. Importantly, through our new theoretical formalism, we identify and characterize a novel class of models that support space-time inversion and chiral symmetries. Our work provides a unifying framework for different multiband topological systems and sheds new light on the emergence of non-Abelian gauge fields in condensed matter physics, with direct implications on the search for novel topological phases in solid-state and synthetic systems.},

In this work, combining magnetotransport measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and first principles calculations, we find that MnSb 4 Te 7 , the n = 1 member of the MnSb 2 Te 4 / ( Sb 2 Te 3 ) n family, is a magnetic topological system with versatile topological phases that can be manipulated by both carrier doping and magnetic field. Our calculations unveil that its A -type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state stays in a Z 2 AFM topological insulator phase, which can be converted to an inversion-symmetry-protected axion insulator phase when in the ferromagnetic (FM) state. Moreover, when this system in the FM phase is slightly carrier doped on either the electron or hole side, it becomes a Weyl semimetal with multiple Weyl nodes in the highest valence bands and lowest conduction bands, which are manifested by the measured notable anomalous Hall effect. Our work thus introduces a new magnetic topological material with different topological phases that are highly tunable by carrier doping or magnetic field.},

We study a one-dimensional gas at rest with instantaneous localized release of energy for which the hydrodynamic Euler equations admit a self-similar scaling solution. Our microscopic model consists of hard point particles with alternating masses, which is a nonintegrable system with strong mixing dynamics. Our extensive microscopic simulations find a remarkable agreement with Euler hydrodynamics, with deviations in a small core region that are understood as arising due to heat conduction.},

Their evolution is described by the system of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations with Lee-Huang-Yang quantum corrections. Such droplets resemble whispering-gallery modes localized in the polar direction due to nonlinear interactions and, depending on their chemical potential and rotation frequency, they appear in rich variety of shapes, ranging from nearly flat-top or strongly localized rotating wave packets, to crescentlike objects extending nearly over the entire range of polar angles. Above critical rotation frequency quantum droplets transform into vortex droplets (in two dimensions) or vortex tori (in three dimensions), whose topological charge gradually increase with the increase of the modulus of chemical potential, and therefore they belong to the family of nonlinear modes connecting fundamental and vortex quantum droplets. Rotating quantum droplets are exceptionally robust objects, stable practically in the entire range of their existence.},

Most importantly, we calculate both local densities and integral values of the spin and orbital angular momenta, and predict observable spin-orbit interaction phenomena related to the coupling between the transverse spin and orbital angular momentum. Our analysis is readily extended to spatiotemporal vortex pulses of other natures (e.g., acoustic).},

The interplay of Floquet states and strong interactions is particularly intriguing, which we study using time-periodic fields in a one-dimensional quantum gas, modeled by a Luttinger liquid with periodically changing interactions. By developing a time-periodic operator algebra, we are able to solve and analyze the complete set of nonequilibrium steady states in terms of a Floquet-Bogoliubov ansatz and known analytic functions. Complex valued Floquet eigenenergies occur when integer multiples of the driving frequency approximately match twice the dispersion energy, which correspond to resonant states. In experimental systems of Lieb-Liniger bosons we predict a change from power-law correlations to dominant collective density wave excitations at the corresponding wave numbers as the frequency is lowered below a characteristic cutoff.},

Here, we study a mobile ion immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate and show that the long-range nature of the ion-atom interaction gives rise to an intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. This leads to the existence of several polaronic and molecular states due to the binding of an increasing number of bosons to the ion, which is well beyond what can be described by a short-range pseudopotential. We use a complementary set of techniques including a variational ansatz and field theory to describe this rich physics and calculate the full spectral response of the ion. It follows from thermodynamic arguments that the ion-atom interaction leads to a mesoscopic dressing cloud of the polarons, and a simplified model demonstrates that the spectral weight of the molecules scale with increasing powers of the density. We finally calculate the quantum dynamics of the ion after a quench experiment.},

We enlarge the landscape of such (asymptotically flat, stationary, everywhere regular) objects by considering multiple fields (possibly) with different frequencies. This allows for new morphologies and a stabilization mechanism for different sorts of unstable BSs. First, any odd number of complex fields, yields a continuous family of BSs departing from the spherical, equal frequency, ℓ -BSs. As the simplest illustration, we construct the ℓ = 1 BSs family, that includes several single-frequency solutions, including even parity (such as spinning BSs and a toroidal, static BS) and odd parity (a dipole BS) limits. Second, these limiting solutions are dynamically unstable, but can be stabilized by a hybrid- ℓ construction: adding a sufficiently large fundamental ℓ = 0 BS of another field, with a different frequency. Evidence for this dynamical robustness is obtained by nonlinear numerical simulations of the corresponding Einstein-(complex, massive) Klein-Gordon system, both in formation and evolution scenarios, and a suggestive correlation between stability and energy distribution is observed. Similarities and differences with vector BSs are anticipated.},

The source is detected with a significance of 8.2 σ for E &gt; 25 TeV assuming a Gaussian template. The best-fit location is (right ascension, declination) = ( 95.47 ° ± 0.11 ° , 37.92 ° ± 0.09 ° ) , and the extension is 0.40 ° ± 0.07 ° . The energy spectrum can be described by a power-law spectrum with an index of − 2.92 ± 0.17 stat ± 0.02 sys . No clear extended multiwavelength counterpart of the LHAASO source has been found from the radio to sub-TeV bands. The LHAASO observations are consistent with the scenario that VHE electrons escaped from the pulsar, diffused in the interstellar medium, and scattered the interstellar radiation field. If interpreted as the pulsar halo scenario, the diffusion coefficient, inferred for electrons with median energies of ∼ 160 TeV , is consistent with those obtained from the extended halos around Geminga and Monogem and much smaller than that derived from cosmic ray secondaries. The LHAASO discovery of this source thus likely enriches the class of so-called pulsar halos and confirms that high-energy particles generally diffuse very slowly in the disturbed medium around pulsars.},

The measurement is based on observations carried out from January 2016 to May 2020. The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear species via a measurement of their electric charge with a dynamic range extending far beyond iron (up to atomic number Z = 40 ). The energy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter with a total equivalent thickness of 1.2 proton interaction lengths preceded by a thin (3 radiation lengths) imaging section providing tracking and energy sampling. The analysis of the data and the detailed assessment of systematic uncertainties are described and results are compared with the findings of previous experiments. The observed differential spectrum is consistent within the errors with previous experiments.

  abstract     = {The analysis of complex physical systems hinges on the ability to extract the relevant degrees of freedom from among the many others. Though much hope is placed in machine learning, it also brings challenges, chief of which is interpretability. It is often unclear what relation, if any, the architecture- and training-dependent learned “relevant” features bear to standard objects of physical theory. Here we report on theoretical results which may help to systematically address this issue: we establish equivalence between the field-theoretic relevance of the renormalization group, and an information-theoretic notion of relevance we define using the information bottleneck (IB) formalism of compression theory. We show analytically that for statistical physical systems described by a field theory the relevant degrees of freedom found using IB compression indeed correspond to operators with the lowest scaling dimensions. We confirm our field theoretic predictions numerically. We study dependence of the IB solutions on the physical symmetries of the data. Our findings provide a dictionary connecting two distinct theoretical toolboxes, and an example of constructively incorporating physical interpretability in applications of deep learning in physics.},

  abstract     = {Continuous-variable quantum information, encoded into infinite-dimensional quantum systems, is a promising platform for the realization of many quantum information protocols, including quantum computation, quantum metrology, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. To successfully demonstrate these protocols, an essential step is the certification of multimode continuous-variable quantum states and quantum devices. This problem is well studied under the assumption that multiple uses of the same device result in identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) operations. However, in realistic scenarios, identical and independent state preparation and calls to the quantum devices cannot be generally guaranteed. Important instances include adversarial scenarios and instances of time-dependent and correlated noise. In this Letter, we propose the first set of reliable protocols for verifying multimode continuous-variable entangled states and devices in these non-i.i.d scenarios. Although not fully universal, these protocols are applicable to Gaussian quantum states, non-Gaussian hypergraph states, as well as amplification, attenuation, and purification of noisy coherent states.},

However, the capability of models found in nature is largely unexplored—e.g., in one dimension only nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians have been considered so far, for which the quadratic speedup does not exist. Here, we prove that optimal spatial search, namely with O ( n ) run time and high fidelity, is possible in one-dimensional spin chains with long-range interactions that decay as 1 / r α with distance r . In particular, near unit fidelity is achieved for α ≈ 1 and, in the limit n → ∞ , we find a continuous transition from a region where optimal spatial search does exist ( α 1.5 ). Numerically, we show that spatial search is robust to dephasing noise and that, for reasonable chain lengths, α ≲ 1.2 should be sufficient to demonstrate optimal spatial search experimentally with near unit fidelity.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that entanglement can benefit quantum information processing tasks. Quantum illumination, when first proposed, was surprising as the entanglement’s benefit survived entanglement-breaking noise. Since then, many efforts have been devoted to study quantum sensing in noisy scenarios. The applicability of such schemes, however, is limited to a binary quantum hypothesis testing scenario. In terms of target detection, such schemes interrogate a single spatiotemporal resolution bin at a time, limiting the impact to radar detection. We resolve this binary-hypothesis limitation by proposing an entanglement-assisted quantum ranging protocol. By formulating a ranging task as a multiary hypothesis testing problem, we show that entanglement enables a 6-dB advantage in the error exponent against the optimal classical scheme. Moreover, the proposed ranging protocol can also be used to implement a pulse-position modulated entanglement-assisted communication protocol. Our ranging protocol reveals entanglement’s potential in general quantum hypothesis testing tasks and paves the way toward a quantum-ranging radar with a provable quantum advantage.},

We find that the non-Hermitian skin effect will pose a notable obstacle, rendering the straightforward extension of unsupervised learning approaches to topological phases for Hermitian systems ineffective in clustering non-Hermitian topological phases. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of two prototypical models, we show that this difficulty can be circumvented by choosing the “on-site” elements of the projective matrix as the input data.

If a s varies faster or slower than t , it is, respectively, proximate to the quench process and the adiabatic process, and both result in a slower energy growth rate. These results are obtained by analyzing the short time dynamics of the short-range behavior of the many-body wave function characterized by the contact, and are also confirmed by numerically solving an example of interacting bosons with time-dependent Bogoliubov theory. These results can also be verified experimentally in ultracold atomic gases.},

Here, we ask whether this diffusive threshold lowers for N &gt; 2 to allow “true” Turing instabilities. Inspired by May’s analysis of the stability of random ecological communities, we analyze the probability distribution of the diffusive threshold in reaction-diffusion systems defined by random matrices describing linearized dynamics near a homogeneous fixed point. In the numerically tractable cases N ⩽ 6 , we find that the diffusive threshold becomes more likely to be smaller and physical as N increases, and that most of these many-species instabilities cannot be described by reduced models with fewer diffusing species.},

We investigate the spectral properties of such an Ising superconductor in a magnetic field taking into account disorder. The interplay of the in-plane magnetic field and the Ising spin-orbit coupling leads to noncollinear effective fields. We find that the emerging singlet and triplet pairing correlations manifest themselves in the occurrence of “mirage” gaps: at (high) energies of the order of the spin-orbit coupling strength, a gaplike structure in the spectrum emerges that mirrors the main superconducting gap. We show that these mirage gaps are signatures of the equal-spin triplet finite-energy pairing correlations and due to their odd parity are sensitive to intervalley scattering.},

The efficiency of the interconversion between charge and spin current is estimated based on Berry curvature of Bloch wave function in the linear-response regime. Beyond the linear regime, nonlinear spin-charge conversion in the higher-order electric field terms has recently been demonstrated in noncentrosymmetric materials with nontrivial spin texture in the momentum space. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear charge-spin conversion in a nominally centrosymmetric oxide material SrIrO 3 by breaking inversion symmetry at the interface. A large second-order magnetoelectric coefficient is observed at room temperature because of the antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction at the interface of Dirac semimetallic bands, which is subject to the symmetry constraint of the substrates. Our study suggests that nonlinear spin-charge conversion can be induced in many materials with strong spin-orbit interaction at the interface by breaking the local inversion symmetry to give rise to spin splitting in otherwise spin degenerate systems.},

  abstract     = {Weyl semimetals host a variety of exotic effects that have no counterpart in conventional materials, such as the chiral anomaly and magnetic monopole in momentum space. These effects give rise to unusual transport properties, including a negative magnetoresistance and a planar Hall effect, etc. Here, we report a new type of Hall and magnetoresistance effect in a magnetic Weyl semimetal. Unlike antisymmetric (with respect to either magnetic field or magnetization) Hall and symmetric magnetoresistance in conventional materials, the discovered magnetoresistance and Hall effect are antisymmetric in both magnetic field and magnetization. We show that the Berry curvature, the tilt of the Weyl node, and the chiral anomaly synergically produce these phenomena. Our results reveal a unique property of Weyl semimetals with broken time reversal symmetry.},

With the NMR magnetic field parallel to the b axis, we observe significant quantum magnetic effects. These include an abrupt drop at 150 K in spin-lattice relaxation rate. This corresponds to a gap-opening transition in the Dirac carriers, likely indicating the onset of excitonic pairing. Below 50 K, we see a more negative shift for the Te z bridging site, indicating the repopulation of Dirac levels with spin polarized carriers at these temperatures. This is the previously reported 3D quantum Hall regime; however, we see no sign of a charge density wave as has been proposed.},

The computational efficiency of the model makes it possible to predict its phase diagram using molecular dynamics. Satisfactory overall agreement with experimental results is obtained. The fluid phases, molecular and ionic, and all the stable ice polymorphs, ordered and disordered, are predicted correctly, with the exception of ice III and XV that are stable in experiments, but metastable in the model. The evolution of the atomic dynamics upon heating, as ice VII transforms first into ice VII ′′ and then into an ionic fluid, reveals that molecular dissociation and breaking of the ice rules coexist with strong covalent fluctuations, explaining why only partial ionization was inferred in experiments.},

Compared with planar defects such as grain boundaries and surfaces, STJ lines are usually overlooked in a material’s strengthening although abundant atoms may reside at STJs in many nanomaterials. In this study, by in situ compression of coarse-grained and nanocrystalline nanoporous gold samples in an electrochemical environment, the effect of STJs on the strength of nanoporous gold was successfully decoupled from grain-boundary and surface effects . We found that the strength of nanoporous gold became sensitive to STJ modification when ligament size was decreased to below ∼ 100 nm , indicating that STJs started to influence ligament strength at sub-100 nm scale. This STJ effect was associated with the emission of dislocations from STJs during plastic deformation. Our findings strongly suggest that the structure and chemistry at STJs should be considered in understanding the mechanical response of sub-100 nm scale materials.},

Here, we report the physical mechanisms of water drops impacting on superhydrophobic surfaces with horizontal motions. We find that a viscous force is created due to the entrainment of a thin air layer between the liquid and solid interfaces, which competes with the capillary and inertia forces, leading to an asymmetric elongation of the drop and an unexpected contact time reduction. Our experimental and theoretical results uncover consolidated scaling relations: the maximum spreading diameter is controlled by both the Weber and capillary numbers D max / D 0 ∼ We 1 / 4 Ca 1 / 6 , while the dimensionless contact time depends on the capillary number τ / τ 0 ∼ Ca − 1 / 6 . These findings strengthen our fundamental understandings of interactions between drops and moving solids and open up new opportunities for controlling the preferred water repellency through largely unexplored active approaches.},

Our calculations show that solvent exchange is mediated by transient solubility gradients that dominate over the intrinsic concentration gradient of nitrogen in the incipient moments after exchange. Solubility gradients advect nitrogen toward the substrate during ethanol-water exchange but away from it in water-ethanol exchange, consistent with the directionality observed in experiments.},

We present a complete theoretical linear perturbation framework to evaluate first-order corrections of the full set of the scattering data within the integrable one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). The general scattering data portrait reveals nonlinear coherent structures—solitons—playing the key role in the wave field evolution. Applying the developed theory to a classic box-shaped wave field, we solve the derived equations analytically for a single Fourier mode acting as a perturbation to the initial condition, thus, leading to the sensitivity closed-form expressions for basic soliton characteristics, i.e., the amplitude, velocity, phase, and its position. With the appropriate statistical averaging, we model the soliton noise-induced effects resulting in compact relations for standard deviations of soliton parameters. Relying on a concept of a virtual soliton eigenvalue, we derive the probability of a soliton emergence or the opposite due to noise and illustrate these theoretical predictions with direct numerical simulations of the NLSE evolution. The presented framework can be generalized to other integrable systems and wave field patterns.},

We demonstrate that trapped Rydberg ions are a platform to engineer conical intersections and to simulate their ensuing dynamics on larger length scales and timescales of the order of nanometers and microseconds, respectively; all this in a highly controllable system. Here, the shape of the potential energy surfaces and the position of the conical intersection can be tuned thanks to the interplay between the high polarizability and the strong dipolar exchange interactions of Rydberg ions. We study how the presence of a conical intersection affects both the nuclear and electronic dynamics demonstrating, in particular, how it results in the inhibition of the nuclear motion. These effects can be monitored in real time via a direct spectroscopic measurement of the electronic populations in a state-of-the-art experimental setup.},

Recent advances in ultrafast electron microscopy enable the manipulation of free-electron wave functions using laser pulses. It would be of great importance if one could combine the spatial resolution of electron microscopes with the ability of laser pulses to probe coherent phenomena in quantum systems. To this end, we propose a novel concept that leverages free electrons that are coherently shaped by laser pulses to measure quantum coherence in materials. We develop the quantum theory of interactions between shaped electrons and arbitrary qubit states in materials, and show how the postinteraction electron energy spectrum enables measuring the qubit state (on the Bloch sphere) and the decoherence or relaxation times ( T 2 / T 1 ) . Finally, we describe how such electrons can detect and quantify superradiance from multiple qubits. Our scheme can be implemented in ultrafast transmission electron microscopes (UTEM), opening the way toward the full characterization of the state of quantum systems at atomic resolution.},

  abstract     = {In the short time since the first observation of supersolid states of ultracold dipolar atoms, substantial progress has been made in understanding the zero-temperature phase diagram and low-energy excitations of these systems. Less is known, however, about their finite-temperature properties, particularly relevant for supersolids formed by cooling through direct evaporation. Here, we explore this realm by characterizing the evaporative formation and subsequent decay of a dipolar supersolid by combining high-resolution in-trap imaging with time-of-flight observables. As our atomic system cools toward quantum degeneracy, it first undergoes a transition from thermal gas to a crystalline state with the appearance of periodic density modulation. This is followed by a transition to a supersolid state with the emergence of long-range phase coherence. Further, we explore the role of temperature in the development of the modulated state.},

Here, we make a step forward in this direction by proving the validity of the mean-field semiclassical equations for open multimode Dicke models, which, to the best of our knowledge, so far has not been rigorously established. We exploit this result to show that open quantum multimode Dicke models can behave as associative memories, displaying a nonequilibrium phase transition toward a pattern-recognition phase.},

Here, we design and fabricate nanophotonic topological harpoon-shaped beam splitters (HSBSs) based on 120-deg-bending interfaces and demonstrate the first on-chip valley-dependent quantum information process. Two-photon quantum interference, namely, Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with a high visibility of 0.956 ± 0.006 , is realized with our 50 / 50 HSBS, which is constructed by two topologically distinct domain walls. Cascading this kind of HSBS together, we also demonstrate a simple quantum photonic circuit and generation of a path-entangled state. Our work shows that the photonic valley state can be used in quantum information processing, and it is possible to realize more complex quantum circuits with valley-dependent photonic topological insulators, which provides a novel method for on-chip quantum information processing.},

We show that such random circuits provide tailor-made building blocks for simulating quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Specifically, we propose an algorithm consisting of a random circuit followed by a trotterized Hamiltonian time evolution to study hydrodynamics and to extract transport coefficients in the linear response regime. We numerically demonstrate the algorithm by simulating the buildup of spatiotemporal correlation functions in one- and two-dimensional quantum spin systems, where we particularly scrutinize the inevitable impact of errors present in any realistic implementation. Importantly, we find that the hydrodynamic scaling of the correlations is highly robust with respect to the size of the Trotter step, which opens the door to reach nontrivial time scales with a small number of gates. While errors within the random circuit are shown to be irrelevant, we furthermore unveil that meaningful results can be obtained for noisy time evolutions with error rates achievable on near-term hardware. Our work emphasizes the practical relevance of random circuits on NISQ devices beyond the abstract sampling task.},

In this case, the system is governed by the next-order Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the ground state energy, which describes the effect of quantum fluctuations. Experimentally such a LHY fluid is realized by controlling the atom numbers and interaction strengths in a K 39 spin mixture confined in a spherical trap potential. We measure the monopole oscillation frequency as a function of the LHY interaction strength as proposed recently by Jrgensen et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 , 173403 (2018) ] and find excellent agreement with simulations of the complete experiment including the excitation procedure and inelastic losses. This confirms that the system and its collective behavior are initially dominated by LHY interactions. Moreover, the monopole oscillation frequency is found to be stable against variations of the involved scattering lengths in a broad region around the ideal values, confirming the stabilizing effect of the LHY interaction. These results pave the way for using the nonlinearity provided by the LHY term in quantum simulation experiments and for investigations beyond the LHY regime.},

  abstract     = {A still widely debated question in the field of relativistic quantum information is whether entanglement and the degree of violation of Bell’s inequalities for massive relativistic particles are frame independent or not. At the core of this question is the effect that spin gets entangled with the momentum degree of freedom at relativistic velocities. Here, we show that Bell’s inequalities for a pair of particles can be maximally violated in a special-relativistic regime, even without any postselection of the momentum of the particles. To this end, we use the methodology of quantum reference frames, which allows us to transform the problem to the rest frame of a particle, whose state can be in a superposition of relativistic momenta from the viewpoint of the laboratory frame. We show that, when the relative motion of two particles is noncollinear, the optimal measurements for violation of Bell’s inequalities in the laboratory frame involve “coherent Wigner rotations.” Moreover, the degree of violation of Bell’s inequalities is independent of the choice of the quantum reference frame. Our results open up the possibility of extending entanglement-based quantum communication protocols to relativistic regimes.},

  abstract     = {Parity-time ( P T )-symmetric Hamiltonians have widespread significance in non-Hermitian physics. A P T -symmetric Hamiltonian can exhibit distinct phases with either real or complex eigenspectrum, while the transition points in between, the so-called exceptional points, give rise to a host of critical behaviors that holds great promise for applications. For spatially periodic non-Hermitian systems, P T symmetries are commonly characterized and observed in line with the Bloch band theory, with exceptional points dwelling in the Brillouin zone. Here, in nonunitary quantum walks of single photons, we uncover a novel family of exceptional points beyond this common wisdom. These “non-Bloch exceptional points” originate from the accumulation of bulk eigenstates near boundaries, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, and inhabit a generalized Brillouin zone. Our finding opens the avenue toward a generalized P T -symmetry framework, and reveals the intriguing interplay between P T symmetry and non-Hermitian skin effect.},

We then apply memory truncation techniques to recover an efficient description that approximates expectation values for multitime observables. Our proof-of-principle analysis paves the way for experiments concerning more general non-Markovian quantum processes and highlights where standard open systems techniques break down.},

These flow fields can be decomposed into interfacial hydrodynamic multipoles, including force monopole and dipole flows. These structures provide key insights essential to understanding the interface’s mechanical response. Importantly, the flow structure shows that the interface is incompressible for scant surfactant near the ideal gaseous state and contains information about interfacial properties and hydrodynamic coupling with the bulk fluid. The same dataset can be used to predict the response of the interface to applied, complex forces, enabling virtual experiments that produce higher order interfacial multipoles.},

Here, we experimentally investigate a model frictionless granular layer flowing down an inclined plane as a way to disentangle generic collective effects from those arising from frictional interactions. We find that thin frictionless granular layers are devoid of hysteresis of the avalanche angle, yet the layer stability increases as it gets thinner. Steady rheological laws obtained for different layer thicknesses can be collapsed into a unique master curve, supporting the idea that nonlocal effects are the consequence of the usual finite-size effects associated with the presence of a critical point. This collapse indicates that the so-called isostatic length l * , the scale on which pinning a boundary freezes all remaining floppy modes, governs the effect of boundaries on flow and rules out other propositions made in the past.},

Our findings are rationalized in terms of a phase diagram for the dynamical response of defects in terms of activity and frictional damping strength. Different regions of the underlying phase diagram correspond to distinct dynamical modes, namely immobile defects, steady rotation of defects, bouncing defects, bouncing-cruising defects, dancing defects, and multiple defects with irregular dynamics.

In this Letter, we implement a big metamaterial superscatterer, and experimentally demonstrate its superscattering effect at microwave frequencies by field-mapping technology. We confirm that superscattering is originated from the excitation of surface plasmons. Integrated with superscatterer, we experimentally display that an invisible gateway could stop electromagnetic waves in an air channel with a width much larger than the cutoff width of the corresponding rectangular waveguide.

However, the ultrafast response of low energy quasiparticle excitation in terahertz frequency remains nearly unexplored yet. Herein, we employ optical pump-terahertz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy to systematically study the photocarrier dynamics of PtTe 2 thin films with varying pump fluence, temperature, and film thickness. Upon photoexcitation the terahertz photoconductivity (PC) of PtTe 2 films shows abrupt increase initially, while the terahertz PC changes into negative value in a subpicosecond timescale, followed by a prolonged recovery process that lasted a few nanoseconds. The magnitude of both positive and negative terahertz PC response shows strongly pump fluence dependence. We assign the unusual negative terahertz PC to the formation of small polaron due to the strong electron-phonon ( e − ph ) coupling, which is further substantiated by temperature and film thickness dependent measurements. Moreover, our investigations give a subpicosecond timescale of simultaneous carrier cooling and polaron formation. The present study provides deep insights into the underlying dynamics evolution mechanisms of photocarrier in type-II Dirac semimetal upon photoexcitation, which is of crucial importance for designing PtTe 2 -based optoelectronic devices.},

Although phonoritons are predicted to emerge in an excitonic medium under intense electromagnetic wave irradiation, the stringent condition for their existence has eluded direct observation in solids. In particular, on-resonance, intense pumping schemes have been proposed, but excessive photoexcitation of carriers prevents optical detection. Here, we theoretically predict the appearance of phonoritonic features in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) embedded in an optical cavity. The coherent superposition nature of phonoriton states is evidenced by the hybridization of exciton-polariton branches with phonon replicas that is tunable by the cavity-matter coupling strength. This finding simultaneously provides an experimental pathway for observing the predicted phonoritons and opens a new avenue for tuning materials properties.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the amplitude (Higgs) mode associated with longitudinal fluctuations of the order parameter at the continuous spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transition. In quantum magnets, due to the fast decay of the amplitude mode into low-energy Goldstone excitations, direct observation of this mode represents a challenging task. By focusing on a quasi-one-dimensional geometry, we circumvent the difficulty and investigate the amplitude mode in a system of weakly coupled spin chains with the help of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic analytic continuation, and a chain-mean field approach combined with a mapping to the field-theoretic sine-Gordon model. The amplitude mode is observed to emerge in the longitudinal spin susceptibility in the presence of a weak symmetry-breaking staggered field. A conventional measure of the amplitude mode in higher dimensions, the singlet bond mode, is found to appear at a lower than the amplitude mode frequency. We identify these two excitations with the second (first) breather of the sine-Gordon theory, correspondingly. In contrast to higher-dimensional systems, the amplitude and bond order fluctuations are found to carry significant spectral weight in the quasi-1D limit.},

  abstract     = {Recently, higher-order topologies have been experimentally realized, featuring topological corner modes (TCMs) between adjacent topologically distinct domains. However, they have to comply with specific spatial symmetries of underlying lattices, hence their TCMs only emerge in very limited geometries, which significantly impedes generic applications. Here, we report a general scheme of inducing TCMs in arbitrary geometry based on Dirac vortices from aperiodic Kekulé modulations. The TCMs can now be constructed and experimentally observed in square and pentagonal domains incompatible with underlying triangular lattices. Such bound modes at arbitrary corners do not require their boundaries to run along particular lattice directions. Our scheme allows an arbitrary specification of numbers and positions of TCMs, which will be important for future on-chip topological circuits. Moreover, the general scheme developed here can be extended to other classical wave systems. Our findings reveal rich physics of aperiodic modulations, and advance applications of TCMs in realistic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {All elements that form diatomic molecules, such as H 2 , N 2 , O 2 , Cl 2 , Br 2 , and I 2 , are destined to become atomic solids under sufficiently high pressure. However, as revealed by many experimental and theoretical studies, these elements show very different propensity and transition paths due to the balance of reduced volume, lone pair electrons, and interatomic bonds. The study of F under pressure can illuminate this intricate behavior since F, owing to its unique position on the periodic table, can be compared with H, with N and O, and also with other halogens. Nevertheless, F remains the only element whose solid structure evolution under pressure has not been thoroughly studied. Using a large-scale crystal structure search method based on first principles calculations, we find that, before reaching an atomic phase, F solid transforms first into a structure consisting of F 2 molecules and F polymer chains and then into a structure consisting of F polymer chains and F atoms, a distinctive evolution with pressure that has not been seen in any other elements. Both intermediate structures are found to be metallic and become superconducting, a result that adds F to the elemental superconductors.},

Because the electronic wave function cannot be chosen as real in these molecules, a nonzero geometric vector potential (Berry connection) arises. As a result, an intrinsic nonzero vibrational angular momentum occurs even for nondegenerate modes and in the absence of external probes. The vibronic modes can then be seen as elementary quantum particles carrying a sizeable angular momentum. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the magnitude of this topological effect by performing nonadiabatic first principles calculations on platinum clusters and by showing that these molecules host sizeable intrinsic phonon angular momenta comparable to the orbital electronic ones in itinerant ferromagnets.},

We show that the metallization transition in hydrogen is subject to a very large isotope effect, occurring hundreds of degrees lower than the equivalent transition in deuterium. We examined this using path integral molecular dynamics simulations which identify a liquid-liquid transition involving atomization, metallization, and changes in viscosity, specific heat, and compressibility. The difference between H 2 and D 2 is a quantum mechanical effect that can be associated with the larger zero-point energy in H 2 weakening the covalent bond. Our results mean that experimental results on deuterium must be corrected before they are relevant to understanding hydrogen at planetary conditions.},

However, correlation between photonic flat bands and bilayer photonic moiré systems remains unexplored, impeding further development of moiré photonics. In this work, we formulate a coupled-mode theory for low-angle twisted bilayer honeycomb photonic crystals as a close analogy of TBG, discovering magic-angle photonic flat bands with a non-Anderson-type localization. Moreover, the interlayer separation constitutes a convenient degree of freedom in tuning photonic moiré bands without high pressure. A phase diagram is constructed to correlate the twist angle and separation dependencies to the photonic magic angles. Our findings reveal a salient correspondence between fermionic and bosonic moiré systems and pave the avenue toward novel applications through advanced photonic band or state engineering.},

Conditions that are sufficient to ensure causality, local existence, and uniqueness of solutions in these theories are also presented.

Our findings provide fundamental constraints on the magnitude of viscous corrections in fluid dynamics far from equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {We present a study of the IR behavior of a three-dimensional superrenormalizable quantum field theory consisting of a scalar field in the adjoint of S U ( N ) with a φ 4 interaction. A bare mass is required for the theory to be massless at the quantum level. In perturbation theory, the critical mass is ambiguous due to IR divergences, and we indeed find that at two loops in lattice perturbation theory the critical mass diverges logarithmically. It was conjectured long ago in [R. Jackiw et al. , Phys. Rev. D 23 , 2291 (1981) , T. Appelquist et al. , Phys. Rev. D 23 , 2305 (1981) ] that superrenormalizable theories are nonperturbatively IR finite, with the coupling constant playing the role of an IR regulator. Using a combination of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-regularized theory, frequentist and Bayesian data analysis, and considerations of a corresponding effective theory, we gather evidence that this is indeed the case.},

Using photon counting detectors, we demonstrate a signal improvement by a factor of 4.4 ± 0.2 and a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 2.10 ± 0.06 , compared to a single-pass weak-value experiment, and also compared to a conventional direct measurement of the tilt.

Many-body dynamics with local constraints has attracted much attention due to the recent discovery of nonergodic behavior in quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms. Lattice gauge theories provide natural examples of constrained systems since physical states must be gauge invariant. In our case, the Hamiltonian H = O kin + λ O pot , where O pot ( O kin ) is diagonal (off-diagonal) in the electric flux basis, contains exact midspectrum zero modes at λ = 0 whose number grows exponentially with system size. This massive degeneracy is lifted at any nonzero λ but some special linear combinations that simultaneously diagonalize O kin and O pot survive as quantum many-body scars, suggesting an “order-by-disorder” mechanism in the Hilbert space. We give evidence for such scars and show their dynamical consequences on two-leg ladders with up to 56 spins, which may be tested using available proposals of quantum simulators. Results on wider ladders point towards their presence in two dimensions as well.},

Applicable to all quantum computer architectures whose two-qubit gates rely on phase-space closure, we present here a new gate-optimizing principle according to which negligible amounts of gate fidelity are traded for substantial savings in power, which, in turn, can be traded for substantial increases in gate speed and/or qubit connectivity. As a concrete example, we illustrate the method by constructing optimal pulses for entangling gates on a pair of ions within a trapped-ion chain, one of the leading quantum computing architectures. Our method is direct, noniterative, and linear, and, in some parameter regimes, constructs gate-steering pulses requiring up to an order of magnitude less power than the standard method. Additionally, our method provides increased robustness to mode drift. We verify the new trade-off principle experimentally on our trapped-ion quantum computer.},

Beyond speed, the key advantage of SNZ is tuneup simplicity, owing to the regular structure of conditional phase and leakage as a function of two control parameters.

We construct measures for quantifying set coherence of sets of quantum states as well as quantum measurements.

This principle can be used to bound the nonlocality of quantum mechanics without resorting to its full formalism, with a notable example of reproducing the Tsirelson’s bound of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. Despite being promising, the latter result found little generalization to other Bell inequalities because of the limitations imposed by the process of concatenation, in which several nonsignaling resources are put together to produce tighter bounds. In this work, we show that concatenation can be successfully replaced by limits on the communication channel capacity. It allows us to rederive and, in some cases, significantly improve all the previously known results in a simpler manner and apply the information causality principle to previously unapproachable Bell scenarios.},

Inspired by these quantum correlations, we introduce network Bell inequalities for the bilocality scenario and show that they admit noise-tolerant quantum violations. In contrast to many previous studies of network Bell inequalities, neither our inequalities nor their quantum violations are based on standard Bell inequalities and standard quantum nonlocality.

This form of enzymatically driven surface motility is currently not well understood and has been loosely linked to burnt-bridge Brownian ratchet mechanisms. Starting from known properties of influenza’s spike proteins, we develop a physical model that quantitatively describes the observed motility. It predicts a collectively emerging dynamics of spike proteins and surface-bound ligands that combined with the virus’ geometry give rise to a self-organized rolling propulsion. We show that in contrast to a Brownian ratchet, the rotary spike drive is not fluctuation driven but operates optimally as a macroscopic engine in the deterministic regime. The mechanism also applies to relatives of influenza and to man-made analogs like DNA monowheels and should give guidelines for their optimization.},

  abstract     = {We study the bending of a booklike system, comprising a stack of elastic plates coupled through friction. The behavior of this layered system is rich and nontrivial, with a nonadditive enhancement of the apparent stiffness and a significant hysteretic response. A dimension reduction procedure is employed to develop a centerline-based theory describing the stack as a nonlinear planar rod with internal shear. We consider the coupling between the nonlinear geometry and the elasticity of the stacked plates, treating the interlayer friction perturbatively. This model yields predictions for the stack’s mechanical response in three-point bending that are in excellent agreement with our experiments. Remarkably, we find that the energy dissipated during deformation can be rationalized over 3 orders of magnitude, including the regimes of a thick stack with large deflection. This robust dissipative mechanism could be harnessed to design new classes of low-cost and efficient damping devices.},

Here, we argue that representing instead the logarithm of the density distribution via a Fourier sum is better. We show that truncating such a representation after only a few terms can be highly accurate for soft matter crystals. For quasicrystals, this sum does not truncate so easily, nonetheless, representing the density profile in this way is still of great use, enabling us to calculate the phase diagram for a three-dimensional quasicrystal-forming system using an accurate nonlocal density functional theory.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of the universal negative piezoelectricity in low-dimensional layered materials by carrying out first-principles calculations. Two-dimensional layered ferroelectric CuIn P 2 S 6 is analyzed in detail as a typical example, but the theory can be applied to any other low-dimensional layered piezoelectrics. Consistent with the theory proposed in [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 119 , 207601 (2017) , the anomalous negative piezoelectricity in CuIn P 2 S 6 also results from its negative clamped-ion term, which cannot be compensated by the positive internal-strain part. Here, we focus on a more general rule by proposing that having a negative clamped-ion term should be universal among piezoelectric materials, which is attributed to the “lag of Wannier center” effect. The internal-strain term, which is the change in polarization due to structural relaxation in response to strain, is mostly determined by the spatial structure and chemical bonding of the material. In a low-dimensional layered piezoelectric material such as CuIn P 2 S 6 , the internal-strain term is approximately zero. This is because the internal structure of the molecular layers, which are bonded by the weak van der Waals interaction, responds little to the strain. As a result, the magnitude of the dipole, which depends strongly on the dimension and structure of the molecular layer, also has a small response with respect to strain. An equation bridging the internal strain responses in low-dimensional and three-dimensional piezoelectrics is also derived to analytically express this point. This work aims to deepen our understanding about this anomalous piezoelectric effect, especially in low-dimensional layered materials, and provide strategies for discovering materials with novel electromechanical properties.},

We report a negative in-plane thermal expansion α / T below 2 K, which passes through a broad minimum near 0.75 K. Volume and a -axis magnetostriction for B ∥ a are markedly negative at low fields and change sign before a sharp metamagnetic anomaly at 6 T. These behaviors are unexpected for Ce-based intermediate valence systems, which should feature positive expansivity. Rather they point towards antiferromagnetic correlations at very low temperatures. This is supported by muon spin relaxation measurements down to 0.1 K, which provide microscopic evidence for a broad distribution of internal magnetic fields. Comparison with isostructural CeRhSn suggests that these antiferromagnetic correlations emerging at T ≪ T K result from geometrical frustration.},

Using QMC simulations, supplemented with mean-field and continuum field-theory arguments, we find that it hosts three distinct phases: a nodal d -wave phase, an antiferromagnet, and an intervening phase which hosts coexisting antiferromagnetism and nodeless d -wave superconductivity. The transition from the coexisting phase to the antiferromagnet is described by the 2 + 1 − D X Y universality class, while the one from the coexisting phase to the nodal d -wave phase is described by the Heisenberg-Gross-Neveu theory. The topology of our phase diagram resembles that of layered organic materials which host pressure tuned Mott transition from antiferromagnet to unconventional superconductor at half-filling.},

We report on measurements of electrical and thermal conductances of integer and fractional QH phases, realized in hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated graphite-gated bilayer graphene devices for both electron and hole doped sides with different valley and orbital symmetries. Remarkably, for complex edges at filling factors ν = 5 3 and 8 3 , closely related to the paradigmatic hole-conjugate ν = 2 3 phase, we find quantized thermal conductance whose values ( 3 κ 0 T and 4 κ 0 T , respectively where κ 0 T is the thermal conductance quantum) are markedly inconsistent with the values dictated by topology ( 1 κ 0 T and 2 κ 0 T , respectively). The measured thermal conductance values remain insensitive to different symmetries, suggesting its universal nature. Our findings are supported by a theoretical analysis, which indicates that, whereas electrical equilibration at the edge is established over a finite length scale, the thermal equilibration length diverges for strong electrostatic interaction. Our results elucidate the subtle nature of crossover from coherent, mesoscopic to topology-dominated transport.},

In carbon nanotubes (CNTs), it is well established that an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer can be realized. Other types of quantum interferences should also arise in CNTs, but have proven challenging to realize. In particular, CNTs have been identified as a system to realize the electronic analog of a Sagnac interferometer—the most sensitive optical interferometer. To realize this Sagnac effect, interference between nonidentical transmission channels in a single CNT must be observed. Here, we use suspended, ultraclean CNTs of known chiral index to study both Fabry-Perot and Sagnac electron interferences. We verify theoretical predictions for the behavior of Sagnac oscillations and the persistence of the Sagnac oscillations at high temperatures. As suggested by existing theoretical studies, our results show that these quantum interferences may be used for electronic structure characterization of carbon nanotubes and the study of many-body effects in these model one-dimensional systems.},

Here, we report an angle-resolved photoemission study on CeRh 6 Ge 4 in which we observe sharp momentum-dependent 4 f bands and clear bending of the conduction bands near the Fermi level, indicating considerable hybridization between conduction and 4 f electrons. The extracted hybridization strength is anisotropic in momentum space and is obviously stronger along the Ce chain direction.The hybridized 4 f bands persist up to high temperatures, and the evolution of their intensity shows clear band dependence.

  abstract     = {Non-Hermiticity gives rise to unique topological phases without Hermitian analogs. However, the effective field theory has yet to be established. Here, we develop a field-theoretical description of the intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases. Because of the dissipative and nonequilibrium nature of non-Hermiticity, our theory is formulated solely in terms of spatial degrees of freedom, which contrasts with the conventional theory defined in spacetime. Our theory provides a universal understanding of non-Hermitian topological phenomena such as the unidirectional transport in one dimension and the chiral magnetic skin effect in three dimensions. Furthermore, it systematically predicts new physics; we illustrate this by revealing transport phenomena and skin effects in two dimensions induced by a perpendicular spatial texture. From the field-theoretical perspective, the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the anomalous localization due to non-Hermiticity, is shown to be a signature of an anomaly.},

We compute the exact dielectric constant in canonical ensemble from NNQMD trajectories using fluctuations in macroscopic polarization computed from maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF). Two deep neural networks are constructed. The first, NNQMD, is trained on QMD configurations for liquid water under a variety of temperature and density conditions to learn potential energy surface and forces and then perform molecular dynamics simulations. The second network, NNMLWF, is trained to predict locations of MLWF of individual molecules using the atomic configurations from NNQMD. Training data for both the neural networks is produced using a highly accurate quantum-mechanical method, DFT-SCAN that yields an excellent description of liquid water. We produce 280 × 10 6 configurations of water at 7 temperatures using NNQMD and predict MLWF centers using NNMLWF to compute the polarization fluctuations. The length of trajectories needed for a converged value of the dielectric constant at 0 °C is found to be 20 ns ( 40 × 10 6 configurations with 0.5 fs time step). The computed dielectric constants for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 ° C are in good agreement with experiments.

These strong interactions suggest the possibility of larger excitonic complexes like trions and biexcitons, which are hard to study numerically due to the complexity of the layered HOIPs. Here, we propose and parametrize a model Hamiltonian for excitonic complexes in layered HOIPs and we study the correlated eigenfunctions of trions and biexcitons using a combination of diffusion Monte Carlo and very large variational calculations with explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions. Binding energies and spatial structures of these complexes are presented as a function of the layer thickness. The trion and biexciton of the thinnest layered HOIP have binding energies of 35 and 44 meV, respectively, whereas a single exfoliated layer is predicted to have trions and biexcitons with equal binding energies of 48 meV.

The computational complexity of simulating Fermions scales exponentially in the projection time β and system size. The sign problem is basis dependent and an improved basis, for fixed errors, leads to exponentially quicker simulations. We show how to use sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations to optimize over the choice of basis on large two-dimensional systems. We numerically illustrate these techniques decreasing the “badness” of the sign problem by optimizing over single-particle basis rotations on one- and two-dimensional Hubbard systems. We find a generic rotation which improves the average sign of the Hubbard model for a wide range of U and densities for L × 4 systems. In one example improvement, the average sign (and hence simulation cost at fixed accuracy) for the 16 × 4 Hubbard model at U / t = 4 and n = 0.75 increases by exp [ 8.64 ( 6 ) β ] . For typical projection times of β ⪆ 100 , this accelerates such simulation by many orders of magnitude.},

Odd-parity systems show a unique flamingolike pattern, whereas their even-parity counterparts exhibit regular hexagonal or rectangular superlattices. When the alternating stack consists of 7 layers or more, the flamingo pattern becomes favorable, regardless of parity. Notably, the out-of-plane corrugation of the system strongly depends on the shape of the superstructure resulting in significant parity dependence of its mechanical properties. The predicted phenomenon originates in an intricate competition between moiré patterns developing at the interface of consecutive layers. This mechanism is of general nature and is expected to occur in other alternating stacks of closely matched rigid layered materials as demonstrated for homogeneous alternating junctions of twisted graphene and h − BN . Our findings thus allow for the rational design of mechanomutable metamaterials based on van der Waals heterostructures.},

We analyze the impact of P T -symmetric gain and loss on localized edge and defect states in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. We realize all three symmetry phases of the system, including the A P T -symmetric regime that occurs at large gain and loss. We measure the admittance spectrum and eigenstates for arbitrary boundary conditions, which allows us to resolve not only topological edge states, but also a novel P T -symmetric Z 2 invariant of the bulk. We discover the distinct properties of topological edge states and defect states in the phase diagram. In the regime that is not P T symmetric, the topological defect state disappears and only reemerges when A P T symmetry is reached, while the topological edge states always prevail and only experience a shift in eigenvalue.

This instability grows due to the transverse magnetic pressure associated with the beam current filaments, which cannot be quickly neutralized due to the inertia of background ions. We show that it can amplify the magnetic field strength and spatial scale by orders of magnitude, leading to large-scale plasma cavities with strong magnetic field and to very efficient conversion of the beam kinetic energy into magnetic energy.

  abstract     = {In an atom interferometry experiment, the output phase shift depends on the wave vector of photons and the recoil momentum in optical transitions. This Letter puts forward a hypothesis that in light-atom interaction, the atom wave function could provide a transverse confinement to photons and thus could affect the mean recoil momentum. We propose a model to analyze the photon effective wave vector in a monochromatic optical field and calculate the relative shift of | k → eff | to k when an atom with a 3D Gaussian wave function absorbs one photon in a Gaussian beam. This shift could lead to a systematic effect related to the spatial distribution of atoms and the transverse beam profile in high-precision experiments based on atom interferometry.},

To the best of our knowledge, such an endeavor has not been undertaken before despite the growing relevance of fiber optics in the design of new quantum devices. We show that the stochastic generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation, derived from a quantum theory of optical fibers, leads to unphysical results such as a negative photon number and the appearance of a dominant anti-Stokes sideband when applied to this kind of waveguides. Starting from a recently introduced master-equation approach to propagation in fibers, we derive a novel stochastic photon-conserving nonlinear Schrödinger equation suitable for modeling arbitrary nonlinear profiles, thus greatly enhancing the study of fiber-based quantum devices.},

This allows us to set up the nonperturbative Polyakov bootstrap for the conformal field theories in Mellin space on a firm foundation, thereby fixing the contact term ambiguities in the crossing symmetric blocks. Our new approach employs certain “locality” constraints replacing the requirement of crossing symmetry in the usual fixed- t dispersion relation. Using these constraints, we show that the sum rules based on the two channel dispersion relations and the present dispersion relations are identical. Our framework allows us to connect with the conceptually rich picture of the Polyakov blocks being identified with Witten diagrams in anti-de Sitter space. We also give two sided bounds for Wilson coefficients for effective field theories in anti-de Sitter space.},

These results have deep consequences for autonomous heat engines operating at steady state, imposing an upper bound for their efficiency in terms of the power yield and its fluctuations. In the present Letter we analyze a different class of heat engines, namely, those which are operating in the periodic slow-driving regime. We show that an alternative TUR is satisfied, which is less restrictive than that of steady-state engines: it allows for engines that produce finite power, with small power fluctuations, to operate close to reversibility. The bound further incorporates the effect of quantum fluctuations, which reduces engine efficiency relative to the average power and reliability. We finally illustrate our findings in the experimentally relevant model of a single-ion heat engine.},

We numerically demonstrate that the scarring phenomenology in this model is similar to other known realizations such as Rydberg atom chains, including persistent dynamical revivals and ergodicity-breaking many-body eigenstates. At the same time, we show that the mechanism of scarring in the Fermi-Hubbard model is different from other examples in the literature: the scars originate from a subgraph, representing a free spin-1 paramagnet, which is weakly connected to the rest of the Hamiltonian’s adjacency graph. Our work demonstrates that correlated fermions in tilted optical lattices provide a platform for understanding the interplay of many-body scarring and other forms of ergodicity breaking, such as localization and Hilbert space fragmentation.},

However, in general, the present quantum information system can only carry out a single information protocol or deal with a single communication task, which limits its practical application in the future. Therefore, it is essential to develop a multifunctional platform compatible with multiple different quantum information protocols. In this Letter, by utilizing an all-optical platform consisting of a gain-tunable parametric amplifier, a beam splitter, and an entanglement source, we experimentally realize the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol, which links the all-optical quantum teleportation protocol and the optimal 1 → N coherent state cloning protocol. As a result, these three protocols, which have different physical essences and functionalities, are implemented in a single all-optical machine. In particular, we demonstrate that the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol can enhance the state transfer fidelity compared with all-optical quantum teleportation under the same strength of entanglement. Our all-optical quantum state transfer machine paves a way to implement the multifunctional quantum information system.},

In this Letter, we provide examples of orthonormal bases in two-qubit Hilbert space whose adaptive discrimination require three copies of the state. For this composite system, we analyze multicopy adaptive local distinguishability of orthogonal ensembles in full generality which, in turn, assigns varying nonlocal strength to different such ensembles. We also come up with ensembles whose discrimination under an adaptive separable scheme require less numbers of copies than adaptive local schemes. Our construction finds important application in multipartite secret sharing tasks and indicates toward an intriguing superadditivity phenomenon for locally accessible information.},

Using a superconducting five-qutrit processor, we find an average single-qutrit process infidelity of 3.8 × 10 − 3 . Through interleaved RB, we characterize a few relevant gates, and employ simultaneous RB to fully characterize crosstalk errors. Finally, we apply cycle benchmarking to a two-qutrit CSUM gate and obtain a two-qutrit process fidelity of 0.85. Our results present and demonstrate RB-based tools to characterize the performance of a qutrit processor, and a general approach to diagnose control errors in future qudit hardware.},

  abstract     = {A semi-device-independent framework for prepare-and-measure experiments is introduced in which an experimenter can tune the degree of distrust in the performance of the quantum devices. In this framework, a receiver operates an uncharacterized measurement device and a sender operates a preparation device that emits states with a bounded fidelity with respect to a set of target states. No assumption on Hilbert space dimension is required. The set of quantum correlations is investigated and bounded from both the interior and the exterior. Furthermore, the optimal performance of quantum state discrimination with bounded distrust is derived and applied to certification of detection efficiency. Quantum-over-classical advantages are demonstrated and the magnitude of distrust compatible with such advantages is explored. Finally, efficient schemes for semi-device-independent random number generation are developed.},

  abstract     = {One of the crucial steps in building a scalable quantum computer is to identify the noise sources which lead to errors in the process of quantum evolution. Different implementations come with multiple hardware-dependent sources of noise and decoherence making the problem of their detection manyfoldly more complex. We develop a randomized benchmarking algorithm which uses Weyl unitaries to efficiently identify and learn a mixture of error models which occur during the computation. We provide an efficiently computable estimate of the overhead required to compute expectation values on outputs of the noisy circuit relying only on the locality of the interactions and no further assumptions on the circuit structure. The overhead decreases with the noise rate and this enables us to compute analytic noise bounds that imply efficient classical simulability. We apply our methods to ansatz circuits that appear in the variational quantum eigensolver and establish an upper bound on classical simulation complexity as a function of noise, identifying regimes when they become classically efficiently simulatable.},

Second, we derive an effective time-dependent decay theory and corresponding generalized quantum regression relations for an open quantum system linearly coupled to an environment. This theory covers all timescales and subsumes the Markovian and linear-response results as limiting cases. Finally, we apply our theory to the phenomenon of quantum friction.},

  abstract     = {Active particles with their characteristic feature of self-propulsion are regarded as the simplest models for motility in living systems. The accumulation of active particles in low activity regions has led to the general belief that chemotaxis requires additional features and at least a minimal ability to process information and to control motion. We show that self-propelled particles display chemotaxis and move into regions of higher activity if the particles perform work on passive objects, or cargo, to which they are bound. The origin of this cooperative chemotaxis is the exploration of the activity gradient by the active particle when bound to a load, resulting in an average excess force on the load in the direction of higher activity. Using a new theoretical model, we capture the most relevant features of these active-passive dimers, and in particular we predict the crossover between antichemotactic and chemotactic behavior. Moreover, we show that merely connecting active particles to chains is sufficient to obtain the crossover from antichemotaxis to chemotaxis with increasing chain length. Such an active complex is capable of moving up a gradient of activity such as provided by a gradient of fuel and to accumulate where the fuel concentration is at its maximum. The observed transition is of significance to protoforms of life, enabling them to locate a source of nutrients even in the absence of any supporting sensomotoric apparatus.},

This optimal rectification contrasts highly with that of a simple ratchet model, where the inhibition of the backward current is inevitably accompanied by the suppression of the forward current. Our detailed analysis of single-molecule trajectories demonstrates a novel but simple rectification mechanism of F 1 with parallel landscapes and asymmetric transition rates.},

We consider a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of a self-assembled array of parallel dielectric hard rods of infinite length with circular or square cross section. We find that PBGs can exist over a large range of intermediate packing densities and the largest band gap does not always appear at the highest packing density studied. Remarkably, for rods with square cross section at intermediate packing densities, the transverse magnetic (TM) band gap of the self-assembled (i.e., thermal) system can be larger than that of identical rods arranged in a perfect square lattice. By considering hollow rods, we find the band gap of transverse electric modes can be substantially increased while that of TM modes show no obvious improvement over solid rods. Our study suggests that particle shape and internal structure can be used to engineer the PBG of a self-assembled system despite the positional and orientational randomness arising from thermal noise.},

The study involves a wide range of liquids (fragile, strong, attractive, repulsive, and active) and predicts some universal behaviors such as the softness being linearly proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the activation barrier of the dynamics with system dependent proportionality constants. We establish a master equation between the dynamics and the softness parameter and show that, indeed, the dynamics, when scaled by the temperature and system dependent parameters, show a data collapse when plotted against softness. The dynamics of fragile liquids show a strong softness dependence, whereas that of strong liquids show a much weaker softness dependence. We also connect the present study with the earlier studies of softness involving machine learning (ML), thus, providing a theoretical framework for understanding the ML results.},

  abstract     = {Graphene grain boundaries (GBs) have attracted interest for their ability to host nearly dispersionless electronic bands and magnetic instabilities. Here, we employ quantum transport and universal conductance fluctuation measurements to experimentally demonstrate a spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry across individual GBs of chemical vapor deposited graphene. While quantum transport across the GBs indicate spin-scattering-induced dephasing and hence formation of local magnetic moments, below T ≲ 4 K we observe complete lifting of time-reversal symmetry at high carrier densities ( n ≳ 5 × 10 12 cm − 2 ) and low temperature ( T ≲ 2 K ). An unprecedented thirtyfold reduction in the universal conductance fluctuation magnitude with increasing doping density further supports the possibility of an emergent frozen magnetic state at the GBs. Our experimental results suggest that realistic GBs of graphene can be a promising resource for new electronic phases and spin-based applications.},

Since no superpartners of elementary particles have been observed, SUSY, if present, must be broken at low-energy. This makes it important to understand how SUSY is realized and broken, and study their consequences. We show that an N = ( 1 , 0 ) SUSY, arguably the simplest type, can be realized at the edge of the Moore-Read quantum Hall state. Depending on the absence or presence of edge reconstruction, both SUSY-preserving and SUSY broken phases can be realized in the same system, allowing for their unified description. The significance of the gapless fermionic Goldstino mode in the SUSY broken phase is discussed.},

In the high-frequency limit, we obtain the Floquet Hamiltonian consisting of the static X Y and dynamically generated Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) terms. The dynamically generated magnetization current depends on the phases of complex coupling terms, with the X Y interaction as the real and DMI as the imaginary part. As these phases are cycled, the current reveals the ground-state degeneracies that distinguish the ordered and disordered phases.

One celebrated example is the second-order topological insulator in three dimensions that hosts chiral hinge modes protected by crystalline symmetries. Since amorphous solids are ubiquitous, it is important to ask whether such a second-order topological insulator can exist in an amorphous system without any spatial order. Here, we predict the existence of a second-order topological insulating phase in an amorphous system without any crystalline symmetry. Such a topological phase manifests in the winding number of the quadrupole moment, the quantized longitudinal conductance, and the hinge states. Furthermore, in stark contrast to the viewpoint that structural disorder should be detrimental to the higher-order topological phase, we remarkably find that structural disorder can induce a second-order topological insulator from a topologically trivial phase in a regular geometry. We finally demonstrate the existence of a second-order topological phase in amorphous systems with time-reversal symmetry.},

Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with ab initio density functional theory, the unique spin texture around the triple point caused by the crossing of one spin-degenerate and two spin-split bands along the ferroelectric crystal axis is derived. This consistently reveals spin winding numbers that are coupled with time-reversal symmetry and Lorentz invariance, which are found to be equal for both triple-point pairs in the Brillouin zone.

VDAT is a variational theory based on the sequential product density matrix (SPD) ansatz, characterized by an integer N , which monotonically approaches the exact solution with increasing N . To evaluate the SPD, we introduce a discrete action and a corresponding integer time Green’s function. We use VDAT to exactly evaluate the SPD in two canonical models of interacting electrons: the Anderson impurity model and the d = ∞ Hubbard model. For the latter, we evaluate N = 2 – 4 , where N = 2 recovers the Gutzwiller approximation (GA), and we show that N = 3 , which exactly evaluates the Gutzwiller-Baeriswyl wave function, provides a truly minimal yet precise description of Mott physics with a cost similar to that of the GA. VDAT is a flexible theory for studying quantum Hamiltonians, competing both with state-of-the-art methods and simple, efficient approaches all within a single framework.},

  abstract     = {The understanding of heavy ion collisions and its quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation requires a complicated interplay of rich physics in a wealth of experimental data. In this work we compare for identified particles the transverse momentum dependence of both the yields and the anisotropic flow coefficients for both PbPb and p Pb collisions. We do this in a global model fit including a free streaming prehydrodynamic phase with variable velocity v fs , thereby widening the scope of initial conditions. During the hydrodynamic phase we vary three second order transport coefficients. The free streaming velocity has a preference slightly below the speed of light. In this extended model the QGP bulk viscosity is small and even consistent with zero.},

The ratio of this combination to that in the constituent nucleons is found to be consistent with unity at the few-percent level from calculations with quark masses corresponding to m π ∼ 800 MeV . With a naive extrapolation to the physical quark masses, this constraint is consistent with, and more precise than, determinations from global nuclear parton distribution function fits through the n nnpdf framework. It is thus concretely demonstrated that lattice QCD calculations of light nuclei have imminent potential to enable more precise determinations of the u and d parton distributions in light nuclei and to reveal the QCD origins of the EMC effect.},

This mechanism, which we dub wash-in leptogenesis , does not require any C P violation in the neutrino sector and can be implemented even in the regime of strong wash-out. The key idea behind wash-in leptogenesis is to generalize standard freeze-out leptogenesis to a nonminimal cosmological background in which the chemical potentials of all particles not in chemical equilibrium at the temperature of leptogenesis are allowed to take arbitrary values. This sets the stage for building a plethora of new baryogenesis models where chemical potentials generated at high temperatures are reprocessed to generate a nonvanishing B − L asymmetry at low temperatures. As concrete examples, we discuss wash-in leptogenesis after axion inflation and in the context of grand unification.},

  abstract     = {Axionlike particles (ALPs) provide a promising direction in the search for new physics, while a wide range of models incorporate ALPs. We point out that future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, possess competitive sensitivity to ALP signals. The high-intensity proton beam impinging on a target can not only produce copious amounts of neutrinos, but also cascade photons that are created from charged particle showers stopping in the target. Therefore, ALPs interacting with photons can be produced (often energetically) with high intensity via the Primakoff effect and then leave their signatures at the near detector through the inverse Primakoff scattering or decays to a photon pair. Moreover, the high-capability near detectors allow for discrimination between ALP signals and potential backgrounds, improving the signal sensitivity further. We demonstrate that a DUNE-like detector can explore a wide range of parameter space in ALP-photon coupling g a γ vs ALP mass m a , including some regions unconstrained by existing bounds; the “cosmological triangle” will be fully explored and the sensitivity limits would reach up to m a ∼ 3 – 4 GeV and down to g a γ ∼ 10 − 8 GeV − 1 .},

Performing model selection on numerically simulated signals of head-on collisions using models for quasicircular binaries, we find that, for signal-to-noise ratios of 15 and 25, typical of Advanced LIGO observations, head-on mergers with respective total masses of M ∈ ( 125 , 300 ) M ⊙ and M ∈ ( 200 , 440 ) M ⊙ would be identified as precessing quasicircular intermediate-mass black-hole binaries located at a much larger distance. Ruling out the head-on scenario would require us to perform model selection using currently nonexistent waveform models for head-on collisions, together with the application of astrophysically motivated priors on the (rare) occurrence of those events. We show that in situations where standard parameter inference of compact binaries may report component masses inside (outside) the pair-instability supernova gap, the true object may be a head-on merger with masses outside (inside) this gap.

Obtaining the ultimate performance for discriminating quantum processes is of fundamental importance, but is challenging mainly due to the necessity of considering all discrimination strategies allowed by quantum mechanics, including entanglement-assisted strategies and adaptive strategies. In the case in which the processes to be discriminated have internal memories, the ultimate performance would generally be more difficult to analyze. In this Letter, we present a simple upper bound on the ultimate success probability for discriminating arbitrary quantum processes. In the special case of multishot channel discrimination, it can be shown that the ultimate success probability increases by at most a constant factor determined by the given channels if the number of channel evaluations increases by one. We also present a lower bound based on Bayesian updating, which has a low computational cost. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed bounds are reasonably tight. The proposed bounds do not explicitly depend on any quantum phenomena, and can be readily extended to a general operational probabilistic theory.},

Nonetheless, most quantum sensing protocols operate efficiently only when the unknown parameters vary within a very narrow region, i.e., local sensing. Here, we provide a systematic formulation for quantifying the precision of a probe for multiparameter global sensing when there is no prior information about the parameters. In many-body probes, in which extra tunable parameters exist, our protocol can tune the performance for harnessing the quantum criticality over arbitrarily large sensing intervals. For the single-parameter sensing, our protocol optimizes a control field such that an Ising probe is tuned to always operate around its criticality. This significantly enhances the performance of the probe even when the interval of interest is so large that the precision is bounded by the standard limit. For the multiparameter case, our protocol optimizes the control fields such that the probe operates at the most efficient point along its critical line. Finally, it is shown that even a simple magnetization measurement significantly benefits from our global sensing protocol.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional quantum entanglement can give rise to stronger forms of nonlocal correlations compared to qubit systems, offering significant advantages for quantum information processing. Certifying these stronger correlations, however, remains an important challenge, in particular in an experimental setting. Here we theoretically formalize and experimentally demonstrate a notion of genuine high-dimensional quantum steering. We show that high-dimensional entanglement, as quantified by the Schmidt number, can lead to a stronger form of steering, provably impossible to obtain via entanglement in lower dimensions. Exploiting the connection between steering and incompatibility of quantum measurements, we derive simple two-setting steering inequalities, the violation of which guarantees the presence of genuine high-dimensional steering, and hence certifies a lower bound on the Schmidt number in a one-sided device-independent setting. We report the experimental violation of these inequalities using macropixel photon-pair entanglement certifying genuine high-dimensional steering. In particular, using an entangled state in dimension d = 31 , our data certifies a minimum Schmidt number of n = 15 .},

This oscillation is a direct signature of the orbital changing collisions predicted to arise in this system in addition to the conventional on-site collisions. The observed oscillation frequency scales with the relative strength of these collisional interactions, which can be readily tuned via a distortion of the unit cell. The observations are compared to a quantum model of two single-particle modes and to a semiclassical multiband tight-binding simulation of 12 × 12 tubular sites of the lattice.

Our result connects circuit quantum electrodynamics to critical phenomena in two-dimensional boundary quantum field theories, important in the physics of strongly correlated systems.

The electric field can cause a blueshift in the photoluminescence peak of single excitons, from which the existence of a permanent dipole moment can be deduced. Meanwhile, the fine energy-level structures of single excitons and biexcitons in a single CsPbI 3 nanocrystal can be simultaneously eliminated, thus preparing a potent platform for the potential generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs.},

Here we argue that a nonzero shift current in centrosymmetric crystals can be activated by a photon-drag effect. Photon-drag shift current proceeds from a “shift current dipole” (a geometric quantity characterizing interband transitions) and manifests a purely transverse response in centrosymmetric crystals. This transverse nature proceeds directly from the shift-vector’s pseudovector nature under mirror operation and underscores its intrinsic geometric origin. Photon-drag shift current can be greatly enhanced by coupling to polaritons and provides a new and sensitive tool to interrogate the subtle interband coherences of materials with inversion symmetry previously thought to be inaccessible via photocurrent probes.},

Here, we consider a simplified model of a two-dimensional semiconductor embedded in a microcavity, where the interactions between electrons and holes are strongly screened, allowing us to develop a diagrammatic formalism for this system with an analytic expression for the exciton-polariton propagator. We apply this to the scattering of spin-polarized polaritons and electrons, and show that this is strongly enhanced compared with exciton-electron interactions. As we argue, this counterintuitive result is a consequence of the shift of the collision energy due to the strong light-matter coupling, and hence this is a generic feature that applies also for more realistic electron-hole and electron-electron interactions. We furthermore demonstrate that the lack of Galilean invariance inherent in the light-matter coupled system can lead to a narrow resonancelike feature for polariton-electron interactions close to the polariton inflection point. Our results are potentially important for realizing tunable light-mediated interactions between charged particles.},

For field aligned to the b axis, we find that the magnetic transition temperatures are suppressed and at low temperature there is a single modulated fan state, separating an easy a axis ferromagnetic state from a field polarized state. This fan state is well explained with the QOBD theory in the presence of anisotropy and field. Experimental evidence supporting the QOBD explanation is provided by the large increase in the T 2 coefficient of the resistivity and direct detection of enhanced magnetic fluctuations with inelastic neutron scattering, across the field range spanned by the fan state. This shows that the QOBD mechanism can explain field induced modulated states that persist to very low temperature.},

These vectors are assumed to realize Néel order in equilibrium, ↑ ↓ ⋯ ↑ ↓ , and their STT-driven dynamics is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. However, many experimentally employed materials (such as archetypal NiO) are strongly electron-correlated antiferromagnetic Mott insulators (AFMIs) whose localized spins form a ground state quite different from the unentangled Néel state | ↑ ↓ ⋯ ↑ ↓ ⟩ . The true ground state is entangled by quantum spin fluctuations, leading to the expectation value of all localized spins being zero , so that LLG dynamics of classical vectors of fixed length rotating due to STT cannot even be initiated. Instead, a fully quantum treatment of both conduction electrons and localized spins is necessary to capture the exchange of spin angular momentum between them, denoted as quantum STT . We use a recently developed time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach to quantum STT to predict how injection of a spin-polarized current pulse into a normal metal layer coupled to an AFMI overlayer via exchange interaction and possibly small interlayer hopping—mimicking, e.g., topological-insulator/NiO bilayer employed experimentally—will induce a nonzero expectation value of AFMI localized spins. This new nonequilibrium phase is a spatially inhomogeneous ferromagnet with a zigzag profile of localized spins. The total spin absorbed by AFMI increases with electron-electron repulsion in AFMIs, as well as when the two layers do not exchange any charge.},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of superconductivity in doped infinite-layer nickelates has stimulated intensive interest, especially for similarities and differences compared to that in cuprate superconductors. In contrast to cuprates, although earlier magnetization measurement reveals a Curie-Weiss-like behavior in undoped infinite-layer nickelates, there is no magnetic ordering observed by elastic neutron scattering down to liquid helium temperature. Until now, the nature of the magnetic ground state in undoped infinite-layer nickelates was still elusive. Here, we perform a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment through La 139 nuclei to study the intrinsic spin susceptibility of infinite-layer LaNiO 2 . First, the signature for magnetic ordering or freezing is absent in the La 139 NMR spectrum down to 0.24 K, which unambiguously confirms a paramagnetic ground state in LaNiO 2 . Second, a pseudogaplike behavior instead of Curie-Weiss-like behavior is observed in both the temperature-dependent Knight shift and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ( 1 / T 1 ), which is widely observed in both underdoped cuprates and iron-based superconductors. Furthermore, the scaling behavior between the Knight shift and 1 / T 1 T has also been discussed. Finally, the present results imply a considerable exchange interaction in infinite-layer nickelates, which sets a strong constraint for the proposed theoretical models.},

We use a density-functional-theory based scattering approach to determine values of l sf that result from electron-phonon scattering as a function of temperature for all 5 d transition metal elements. l sf does not decrease monotonically with the atomic number Z but is found to be inversely proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level. By using the same local current methodology to calculate the spin Hall angle Θ sH that characterizes the efficiency of the spin Hall effect, we show that the products ρ ( T ) l sf ( T ) and Θ sH ( T ) l sf ( T ) are constant.},

Here we demonstrate a way to unambiguously distinguish a paradigmatic correlated insulator, a Mott insulator, from a trivial band insulator based on their distinct chemical behavior for a surface adsorbate using 1 T − Ta S 2 , which has been debated between a spin-frustrated Mott insulator or a spin-singlet trivial insulator. We start from the observation of different sizes of spectral gaps on different surface terminations and show that potassium adatoms on these two surface layers behave in totally different ways. This can be straightforwardly understood from distinct properties of Mott and band insulators due to the fundamental difference of the half- and full-filled orbitals involved, respectively. This work not only solves an outstanding problem in this particularly interesting material but also provides a simple touchstone to identify the correlated ground state of electrons experimentally.},

The simultaneous presence in the valence of highly localized d - and f -type bands and itinerant s - and p -type states, as well as the half-filled f -type orbital shell with seven unpaired electrons on each Eu atom, have made the description of the electronic features of this system a challenge. The electronic band structure, density of states, and atomic oxidation states of EuO are analyzed in the 0–50 GPa pressure range. An insulator-to-metal transition at about 12 GPa of pressure was identified. The second isostructural transition at approximately 30–35 GPa, previously believed to be driven by an oxidation from Eu(II) to Eu(III), is shown instead to be associated with a change in the occupation of the Eu d orbitals, as can be determined from the analysis of the corresponding atomic orbital populations. The Eu d band is confined by the surrounding oxygens and split by the crystal field, which results in orbitals of e g symmetry (i.e., d x 2 − y 2 and d 2 z 2 − x 2 − y 2 , pointing along the Eu-O direction) being abruptly depopulated at the transition as a means to alleviate electron-electron repulsion in the highly compressed structures.},

Our results indicate that massive carriers in flat bands with highly localized electron and hole wave functions significantly reduce the screening and enhance the exchange interaction, leading to an unusually large triplet exciton binding energy ( ∼ 1.1 eV ) exceeding the G W band gap by ∼ 0.2 eV and a large singlet-triplet splitting of ∼ 0.4 eV .

  abstract     = {A fundamental dichotomous classification for all physical systems is according to whether they are spinless or spinful. This is especially crucial for the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, as the two classes have distinct symmetry algebra. As a prominent example, the spacetime inversion symmetry P T satisfies ( P T ) 2 = ± 1 for spinless/spinful systems, and each class features unique topological phases. Here, we reveal a possibility to switch the two fundamental classes via Z 2 projective representations. For P T symmetry, this occurs when P inverses the gauge transformation needed to recover the original Z 2 gauge connections under P . As a result, we can achieve topological phases originally unique for spinful systems in a spinless system, and vice versa. We explicitly demonstrate the claimed mechanism with several concrete models, such as Kramers degenerate bands and Kramers Majorana boundary modes in spinless systems, and real topological phases in spinful systems. Possible experimental realization of these models is discussed. Our work breaks a fundamental limitation on topological phases and opens an unprecedented possibility to realize intriguing topological phases in previously impossible systems.},

A thermally activated bond breaking model quantitatively explains the wear data in the low temperature, nonripple regime, but fails above the temperature threshold. This discrepancy is resolved with a geometric separation of the ripple mounds from the troughs, leading to full agreement with Arrhenius kinetics over the full temperature range.},

Using readily available intense laser pulses to scatter off the energetic electrons, on the one hand, allows us to significantly increase the total photon yield, but on the other hand, leads to a dramatic spectral broadening of the fundamental emission line as well as its harmonics due to the laser pulse shape induced ponderomotive effects. In this Letter we propose to avoid ponderomotive broadening in harmonics by using the polarization gating technique—a well-known method to construct a laser pulse with temporally varying polarization. We show that by restricting harmonic emission only to the region near the peak of the pulse, where the polarization is linear, it is possible to generate a bright narrow bandwidth comb in the gamma region.},

Based on a prototype model of nonlinear chains with nonreciprocal coupling to nearest neighbors, we study nonlinear wave dynamics. Nonreciprocal coupling induces a convective instability between unstable and stable equilibrium. Increasing the coupling level, the chain presents a propagative pattern, a traveling wave. This emergent phenomenon corresponds to the self-assembly of localized structures. The pattern wavelength is characterized as a function of the coupling. Analytically, the phase diagram is determined and agrees with numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Wavefront shaping (WFS) has emerged as a powerful tool to control the propagation of diverse wave phenomena (light, sound, microwaves, etc.) in disordered matter for applications including imaging, communication, energy transfer, micromanipulation, and scattering anomalies. Nonetheless, in practice the necessary coherent control of multiple input channels remains a vexing problem. Here, we overcome this difficulty by doping the disordered medium with programmable meta-atoms in order to adapt it to an imposed arbitrary incoming wavefront. Besides lifting the need for carefully shaped incident wavefronts, our approach also unlocks new opportunities such as sequentially achieving different functionalities with the same arbitrary wavefront. We demonstrate our concept experimentally for electromagnetic waves using programmable metasurfaces in a chaotic cavity, with applications to focusing with the generalized Wigner-Smith operator as well as coherent perfect absorption. We expect our fundamentally new perspective on coherent wave control to facilitate the transition of intricate WFS protocols into real applications for various wave phenomena.},

In order to achieve amplitude nonreciprocity, all such devices moreover require modulations that break spatial symmetries, which adds complexity in implementations. Here we introduce a modal circulator, which achieves amplitude nonreciprocity through a circulation motion among three modes. We show that such a circulator can be achieved in a dynamically modulated structure that preserves mirror symmetry, and as a result can be implemented using only a single standing-wave modulator, which significantly simplifies the implementation of dynamically modulated nonreciprocal devices. We also prove that in terms of the number of modes involved in the transport process, the modal circulator represents the minimum configuration in which complete amplitude nonreciprocity can be achieved while preserving spatial symmetry.},

Our method makes use of a binary sensor and suitably shaped pulses to perform weak, adaptive measurements on the position of the magnet. This allows us to precisely determine the position and momentum of the particle, transforming the initial high-entropy thermal state into a pure coherent state. The energy is then extracted by shifting the trap center. By delegating the task of energy extraction to a coherent displacement operation, we overcome the limitations associated with cooling schemes that rely on the dissipation of a two-level system coupled to the oscillator. We numerically benchmark our protocol in realistic experimental conditions, including heating rates and imperfect readout fidelities, showing that it is well suited for magnetogravitational traps operating at cryogenic temperatures.

More strikingly, an unprecedented vortex state, which breaks the continuous rotational symmetry to a discrete one spontaneously, is predicted to occur. The underlying physics are elucidated and verified by numerical simulations. The unique density distributions of the predicted vortex states enable a direct observation in experiment.},

Here, we show that turning a synthetic Hall ribbon into a synthetic Hall cylinder could naturally lead to localization. Unlike a Hall ribbon, a Hall cylinder hosts an intrinsic lattice, which arises due to the periodic boundary condition in the azimuthal direction, in addition to the external periodic potential imposed by extra lasers. When these two lattices are incommensurate, localization may occur on a synthetic Hall cylinder. Near the localization-delocalization transitions, physical observables strongly depend on the axial magnetic flux, providing us a sensitive means to probe either the transition or the axial flux using one another. In the irrational limit, physical observables are no longer affected by the axial flux, signifying a scheme to suppress decoherence induced by fluctuations of the axial flux.},

On the contrary, these data can be well described by an unitarized chiral amplitude containing a much lighter charmed scalar meson, the D 0 * ( 2100 ) . We also extract the low-energy S -wave D π phase of the decay B − → D + π − π − from the data in a model-independent way, and show that its difference from the D π scattering phase shift can be traced back to an intermediate ρ − exchange. Our work highlights that an analysis of data consistent with chiral symmetry, unitarity, and analyticity is mandatory in order to extract the properties of the ground-state scalar mesons in the singly heavy sector correctly, in analogy to the light scalar mesons f 0 ( 500 ) and K 0 * ( 700 ) .},

Assuming moderate values of new Yukawa couplings, not exceeding one, that can remain perturbative to very high energy scales, the measured value of muon g − 2 can be explained within one standard deviation even with 6.5 TeV leptons or 20 TeV Higgs bosons. Allowing new couplings near the perturbativity limit, these mass ranges extend to 45 TeV for leptons and 185 TeV for Higgs bosons.

An additional, subdominant contribution from high-luminosity AGN is needed to improve the description of the composition observables, leading to a substantial neutrino flux that peaks at exaelectronvolt (EeV) energies. We also find that different properties for the low- and high-luminosity AGN populations are required; a possibly similar baryonic loading can already be excluded from current IceCube Neutrino Observatory observations. We also show that the flux of neutrinos emitted from within the sources should outshine the cosmogenic neutrinos produced during the propagation of UHECRs. This result has profound implications for the ultra-high-energy ( ∼ EeV ) neutrino experiments, since additional search strategies can be used for source neutrinos compared to cosmogenic neutrinos, such as stacking searches, flare analyses, and multimessenger follow-ups.},

We argue that the presence of quantum chaos implies that at large times the time-evolution operator becomes effectively a random matrix in the many-body Hilbert space. To quantify this phenomenon, we compute analytically the squared magnitude of the trace of the evolution operator—the generalized spectral form factor—and compare it with the prediction of random matrix theory. We show that for the systems under consideration, the generalized spectral form factor can be expressed in terms of dynamical correlation functions of local observables in the infinite temperature state, linking chaotic and ergodic properties of the systems. This also provides a connection between the many-body Thouless time τ th —the time at which the generalized spectral form factor starts following the random matrix theory prediction—and the conservation laws of the system. Moreover, we explain different scalings of τ th with the system size observed for systems with and without the conservation laws.},

Our figure of merit is the number of runs of E required to achieve a desired prediction performance. We consider classical ML models that perform a measurement and record the classical outcome after each run of E , and quantum ML models that can access E coherently to acquire quantum data; the classical or quantum data are then used to predict the outcomes of future experiments. We prove that for any input distribution D ( x ) , a classical ML model can provide accurate predictions on average by accessing E a number of times comparable to the optimal quantum ML model. In contrast, for achieving an accurate prediction on all inputs, we prove that the exponential quantum advantage is possible. For example, to predict the expectations of all Pauli observables in an n -qubit system ρ , classical ML models require 2 Ω ( n ) copies of ρ , but we present a quantum ML model using only O ( n ) copies. Our results clarify where the quantum advantage is possible and highlight the potential for classical ML models to address challenging quantum problems in physics and chemistry.},

Second, we employ EC diamond norms to study a novel type of quantum speed limits, which apply to pairs of quantum dynamical semigroups. We expect these results to be relevant for benchmarking internal dynamics of quantum devices.

Experiments controlling quantum systems at the single quantum level may shed light on these puzzles.

We use entropic uncertainty relations for bipartite systems to derive measurable lower bounds on distillable entanglement. We showcase these bounds by applying them to physical models realizable in cold-atom experiments. The derived entanglement bounds rely on measurements in only two different bases and are generically applicable to any quantum simulation platform.},

We prove a no-go theorem for learning an unknown scrambling process with QML, showing that it is highly probable for any variational Ansatz to have a barren plateau landscape, i.e., cost gradients that vanish exponentially in the system size. This implies that the required resources scale exponentially even when strategies to avoid such scaling (e.g., from Ansatz -based barren plateaus or no-free-lunch theorems) are employed. Furthermore, we numerically and analytically extend our results to approximate scramblers. Hence, our work places generic limits on the learnability of unitaries when lacking prior information.},

Single-particle interference, for instance, is limited to the second order, that is, to pairs of single-particle paths. To date, all experimental efforts to search for higher-order interferences beyond those compatible with quantum mechanics have been based on such single-particle schemes. However, quantum physics is not bound to single-particle interference. We here experimentally study many-particle higher-order interference using a two-photon-five-slit setup. We observe nonzero two-particle interference up to fourth order, corresponding to the interference of two distinct two-particle paths. We further show that fifth-order interference is restricted to 10 − 3 in the intensity-correlation regime and to 10 − 2 in the photon-correlation regime, thus providing novel bounds on higher-order quantum interference.},

  abstract     = {Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), the phenomenon in which purely repulsive active particles undergo a liquid-gas phase separation, is among the simplest and most widely studied examples of a nonequilibrium phase transition. Here, we show that states of MIPS coexistence are in fact only metastable for three-dimensional active Brownian particles over a very broad range of conditions, decaying at long times through an ordering transition we call active crystallization. At an activity just above the MIPS critical point, the liquid-gas binodal is superseded by the crystal-fluid coexistence curve, with solid, liquid, and gas all coexisting at the triple point where the two curves intersect. Nucleating an active crystal from a disordered fluid, however, requires a rare fluctuation that exhibits the nearly close-packed density of the solid phase. The corresponding barrier to crystallization is surmountable on a feasible timescale only at high activity, and only at fluid densities near maximal packing. The glassiness expected for such dense liquids at equilibrium is strongly mitigated by active forces, so that the lifetime of liquid-gas coexistence declines steadily with increasing activity, manifesting in simulations as a facile spontaneous crystallization at extremely high activity.},

Here, we use numerical simulations and “proof of concept” experiments to demonstrate that boundaries can be engineered to control the bulk behavior in a colloidal artificial ice. We show that an antiferromagnetic frontier forces the system to rapidly reach the ground state (GS), as opposed to the commonly implemented open or periodic boundary conditions. We also show that strategically placing defects at the corners generates novel bistable states, or topological strings, which result from competing GS regions in the bulk. Our results could be generalized to other frustrated micro- and nanostructures where boundary conditions may be engineered with lithographic techniques.},

The center of mass mean square displacements of the tracers independent of their molecular weight is subdiffusive at short times until it has reached the size of the tube d ; then, a crossover to Fickian diffusion takes place. This observation cannot be understood within the tube model of reptation, but is rationalized as a result of important interchain couplings that lead to cooperative chain motion within the entanglement volume ∼ d 3 . Thus, the cooperative tracer chain motions are limited by the tube size d . If the center of mass displacement exceeds this size, uncorrelated Fickian diffusion takes over. Compared to the prediction of the Rouse model we observe a significantly reduced contribution of the tracer’s internal modes to the spectra corroborating the finding of cooperative rather than Rouse dynamics within d 3 .},

We show that higher-harmonic Josephson elements described by a cos ( 2 φ ) energy-phase relation provide an increased freedom to tailor the shape of the Josephson potential and design spectra featuring multiplets of flat bands and Dirac points in the charge Brillouin zone. Flat bands provide noise-insensitive energy levels, and consequently, engineering band pairs with flat spectral gaps can help improve the coherence of the system. We discuss a modified version of a flux qubit that achieves, in principle, no decoherence from charge noise and introduce a flux qutrit that shows a spin-1 Dirac spectrum and is simultaneously quite robust to both charge and flux noise.},

The progressive weakening of antiferromagnetic correlations upon doping paves the way for a variety of emergent many-electron phenomena including unconventional superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and collective charge-spin-orbital ordering. In this study, we explored the use of oxygen stoichiometry as an alternative pathway to modify the coupled magnetic and electronic ground state in the family of rare earth nickelates ( RENiO 3 − x ). Using a combination of x-ray spectroscopy and resonant soft x-ray magnetic scattering, we find that, while oxygen vacancies rapidly alter the electronic configuration within the Ni and O orbital manifolds, antiferromagnetic order is remarkably robust to substantial levels of carrier doping, only to suddenly collapse beyond 0.21 e − / Ni without an accompanying structural transition. Our work demonstrates that ordered magnetism in RENiO 3 − x is mostly insensitive to carrier doping up to significant levels unseen in other transition-metal oxides. The sudden collapse of ordered magnetism upon oxygen removal may provide a new mechanism for solid-state magnetoionic switching and new applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

The assignment of the antipolar nature is based on sudden changes in the crystal structure and a strong drop of the dielectric constant at T JT = 31 K , also indicating the first-order nature of the transition. In addition, we found that local symmetry lowering precedes long-range orbital ordering, implying the presence of a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in the cubic phase above T JT . Based on the variety of structural polymorphs reported in lacunar spinels, also including ferroelectric phases, we argue that GaNb 4 S 8 may be transformable to a ferroelectric state, which would further classify the observed antipolar phase as antiferroelectric.},

In this work, we demonstrate the strong field induced dynamic core polarization effect and propose a model for revealing its role in high harmonic generation (HHG) from solids. We show that the polarized core induces an additional polarization current beyond the SAE model based on the frozen cores. It gives a new mechanism for HHG and leads to new anisotropic structures, which are experimentally observed with MgO. Our experiments indicate that the influences of dynamic core polarization on HHG are obvious for both linearly and elliptically polarized laser fields. Our work establishes the bridge between the HHG and the dynamic changes of the effective many-electron interaction in solids, which paves the way to probe the ultrafast electron dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Starting from Shannon’s definition of dynamic entropy, we propose a theory to describe the rare-event-determined dynamic states in condensed matter and their transitions and apply it to high-pressure ice VII. A dynamic intensive quantity named dynamic field, rather than the conventional thermodynamic intensive quantities such as temperature and pressure, is taken as the controlling variable. The dynamic entropy versus dynamic field curve demonstrates two dynamic states in the stability region of ice VII and dynamic ice VII. Their microscopic differences were assigned to the dynamic patterns of proton transfer. This study puts a similar dynamical theory used in earlier studies of glass models on a simpler and more fundamental basis, which could be applied to describe the dynamic states of more realistic condensed matter systems.},

  abstract     = {The chiral anomaly is a fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon which is of great importance to both particle physics and condensed matter physics alike. In the context of QED, it manifests as the breaking of chiral symmetry in the presence of electromagnetic fields. It is also known that anomalous chiral symmetry breaking can occur through interactions alone, as is the case for interacting one-dimensional systems. In this Letter, we investigate the interplay between these two modes of anomalous chiral symmetry breaking in the context of interacting Weyl semimetals. Using Fujikawa’s path integral method, we show that the chiral charge continuity equation is modified by the presence of interactions which can be viewed as including the effect of the electric and magnetic fields generated by the interacting quantum matter. This can be understood further using dimensional reduction and a Luttinger liquid description of the lowest Landau level. These effects manifest themselves in the nonlinear response of the system. In particular, we find an interaction-dependent density response due to a change in the magnetic field as well as a contribution to the nonequilibrium and inhomogeneous anomalous Hall response while preserving its equilibrium value.},

  abstract     = {Dirac semimetals associated with bulk Dirac fermions are well known in topological electronic systems. In sharp contrast, three-dimensional (3D) Dirac phonons in crystalline solids are still unavailable. Here we perform symmetry arguments and first-principles calculations to systematically investigate 3D Dirac phonons in all space groups with inversion symmetry. The results show that there are two categories of 3D Dirac phonons depending on their protection mechanisms and positions in momentum space. The first category originates from the four-dimensional irreducible representations at the high symmetry points. The second category arises from the phonon branch inversion, and the symmetry guarantees Dirac points to be located along the high symmetry lines. Furthermore, we reveal that nonsymmorphic symmetries and the combination of inversion and time-reversal symmetries play essential roles in the emergence of 3D Dirac phonons. Our work not only offers a comprehensive understanding of 3D Dirac phonons but also provides significant guidance for exploring Dirac bosons in both phononic and photonic systems.},

  abstract     = {High density carbon (HDC) ablator is one of the promising candidates toward thermonuclear ignition in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), but it shows the largest ablation front instability growth as compared to other traditional ablator materials. In this Letter, we propose a novel HDC-CH capsule design, opening the way to mitigate the hydrodynamic instabilities by using CH as the outermost ablator layer, while keeping HDC as the main ablator for maintaining the advantage of short laser pulses. The CH layer is completely ablated during the shock transit phase. In the HDC-CH design, it is the first shock reflected from the HDC/CH interface that meets the ablation front first, which reduces the ablation front growth factor by about one order of magnitude at peak implosion velocity due to the Richtmyer-Meshkov and the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Our 2D simulation studies demonstrate convincingly that the ablation front growth factor of the HDC-CH capsule can be significantly reduced at both the end of shock transit phase and the time at peak implosion velocity, as compared to a HDC capsule. This novel HDC-CH capsule not only keeps the main advantage of the HDC ablator, but also has the advantage of low hydrodynamic instabilities, which can provide a larger margin toward ICF ignition. It can be applicable to both indirect-drive and direct-drive targets.},

As a proof of concept, the broadband angular spin Hall effect of light and optical vortices is experimentally demonstrated by using plasmonic metasurfaces consisting of space-variant nanoapertures with C2, C3, and C5 rotational symmetries.

As recently shown, this spin-spin effective interaction is both nonlocal and nontranslational invariant, and randomness in the atoms’ positions produces a spin glass phase. Here we consider the simplest feasible disorder-free setting, where atoms form a one-dimensional regular chain and we study the thermodynamics of the resulting effective Ising model. We present extensive results showing that the system has a low-temperature glassy phase. The model depends on the adimensional parameter α = ( a / w 0 ) 2 , a being a lattice spacing and w 0 an interaction length scale. Notably, for rational values of α = p / q , the number of metastable states at low temperature grows exponentially with q and the problem of finding the ground state rapidly becomes computationally intractable, suggesting that the system develops high-energy barriers and ergodicity breaking occurs.},

Because of a strong interplay between the electron-electron correlation and QED effects, the standard single-level perturbative QED approach may fail, even if it takes into account the second-order screened QED diagrams. In the present Letter, the corresponding obstacles are overcome by working out the QED perturbation theory for quasidegenerate states. The contributions of all the Feynman diagrams up to the second order are taken into account. The many-electron QED effects are rigorously evaluated in the framework of the extended Furry picture to all orders in the nuclear-strength parameter α Z . The higher-order electron-correlation effects are considered within the Breit approximation. The nuclear recoil effect is accounted for as well. The developed approach is applied to high-precision QED calculations of the ground and singly excited energy levels in Be-like xenon. The most accurate theoretical predictions for the binding and excitation energies are obtained. These results deviate from the most precise experimental value by 3 σ but perfectly agree with a more recent measurement.},

[ Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 142504 (2020) .] report only a single transition with a broad energy distribution of E α = ( 8.73 – 8.86 ) MeV and T 1 / 2 = 0.30 − 0.09 + 0.19 s . The data published in Pore et al. are very similar to those published for Md 245 m [ E α = 8.64 ( 2 ) , 8.68(2) MeV, T 1 / 2 = 0.35 − 0.16 + 0.23 s [V. Ninov, F. P. Heßberger, S. Hofmann, H.

Therefore, we compare the data presented for Md 244 in Pore et al. with those reported for Md 245 in Ninov et al. and also in Khuyagbaatar et al. We conclude that the data presented in Pore et al. shall be attributed to Md 245 with small contributions (one event each) from Fm 245 and probably Md 246 .},

We focus on exploring the minimal vector portal and the next-to-minimal models in which the productions and decays are decoupled. These next-to-minimal models have mostly been devised to explain experimental anomalies while avoiding existing constraints. We demonstrate that proton fixed-target experiments provide one of the most powerful probes for the MeV to few GeV mass range of these models, using inelastic dark matter (iDM) as an example. We consider an iDM model with a small mass splitting that yields the observed dark matter relic abundance, and a scenario with a sizable mass splitting that can also explain the muon g − 2 anomaly. We set strong limits based on the CERN-Hamburg-Amsterdam-Rome-Moscow Collaboration and NuCal experiments, which come close to excluding iDM as a full-abundance thermal dark matter candidate in the MeV to GeV mass range. We also make projections based on NA62, SeaQuest, and DarkQuest and update the constraints of the minimal dark photon parameter space. We find that NuCal sets the only existing constraint in ε ∼ 10 − 8 – 10 − 4 regime, reaching ∼ 800 MeV in dark photon mass due to the resonant enhancement of proton bremsstrahlung production. These studies also motivate LongQuest, a three-stage retooling of the SeaQuest experiment with short ( ≲ 5 m ), medium ( ∼ 5 m ), and long ( ≳ 35 m ) baseline tracking stations and detectors as a multipurpose machine to explore new physics.},

This Letter considers a crossing symmetric dispersion relation, reviving certain old ideas from the 1970s. Rather than the fixed t dispersion relation, this needs a dispersion relation in a different variable z , which is related to the Mandelstam invariants s , t , u via a parametric cubic relation making the crossing symmetry in the complex z plane a geometric rotation. The resulting dispersion is manifestly three-channel crossing symmetric. We give simple derivations of certain known positivity conditions for effective field theories, including the null constraints, which lead to two sided bounds and derive a general set of new nonperturbative inequalities. We show how these inequalities enable us to locate the first massive string state from a low energy expansion of the four dilaton amplitude in type II string theory. We also show how a generalized (numerical) Froissart bound, valid for all energies, is obtained from this approach.},

Starting with a nonrotating LQG black hole as a seed metric, we construct a rotating spacetime using the revised Newman-Janis algorithm. The rotating solution is nonsingular everywhere and it reduces to the Kerr black hole asymptotically. In different regions of the parameter space, the solution describes (1) a wormhole without event horizon (which, we show, is almost ruled out by observations), (2) a black hole with a spacelike transition surface inside the event horizon, or (3) a black hole with a timelike transition region inside the inner horizon. It is shown how fundamental parameters of LQG can be constrained by the observational implications of the shadow cast by this object. The causal structure of our solution depends crucially only on the spacelike transition surface of the nonrotating seed metric, while being agnostic about specific details of the latter, and therefore captures universal features of an effective rotating, nonsingular black hole in LQG.},

The GW190521 components’ masses of 85 − 14 + 21 M ⊙ and 66 − 18 + 17 M ⊙ challenge standard stellar evolution models, as they fall in the so-called mass gap. We demonstrate that the merger history of ultradwarf galaxies at high redshifts ( 1 ≲ z ≲ 2 ) matches well the LIGO-Virgo inferred merger rate for BHs within the mass range of the GW190521 components, resulting in a likely time delay of ≲ 4 Gyr considering the redshift of this event. We further demonstrate that the predicted timescales are consistent with expectations for central BH mergers, although with large uncertainties due to the lack of high-resolution simulations in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Our findings show that this BH production and merging channel is viable and extremely interesting as a new way to explore galaxies’ BH seeds and galaxy formation. We recommend this scenario be investigated in detail with simulations and observations.},

The dark photon dark matter can efficiently convert into photons in the outermost region of the solar atmosphere, the solar corona, where the plasma mass of photons is close to the dark photon rest mass. Because of the strong resonant conversion and benefiting from the short distance between the Sun and the Earth, the radio telescopes can lead the dark photon search sensitivity in the mass range of 4 × 10 − 8 – 4 × 10 − 6 eV , corresponding to the frequency 10–1000 MHz. As a promising example, the low-frequency array telescope can reach the kinetic mixing ε ∼ 10 − 13 ( 10 − 14 ) within 1 (100) h of solar observations. The future experiment square kilometer array phase 1 can reach ε ∼ 10 − 16 – 10 − 14 with 1 h of solar observations.},

We use these measurements to infer the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment, and the surface eccentricity of an isolated neutron star for the first time, using relations between these quantities that are insensitive to the unknown equation of state of supranuclear matter. We also use these results to forecast the moment of inertia of neutron star A in the double pulsar binary J0737-3039, a quantity anticipated to be directly measured in the coming decade with radio observations. Combining this information with the measurement of the tidal Love number with LIGO/Virgo observations, we propose and implement the first theory-agnostic and equation-of-state-insensitive test of general relativity. Specializing these constraints to a particular modified theory, we find that consistency with general relativity places the most stringent constraint on gravitational parity violation to date, surpassing all other previously reported bounds by 7 orders of magnitude and opens the path for a future test of general relativity with multimessenger neutron star observations.},

Autonomous models, which do not rely on any external time dependence, and models that make use of time-dependent control fields, often combined with dividing the control protocol into idealized strokes of a thermodynamic cycle. While the latter paradigm offers theoretical simplifications, its utility in practice has been questioned due to the involved approximations. Here, we bridge the two paradigms by constructing an autonomous model, which implements a thermodynamic cycle in a certain parameter regime. This effect is made possible by self-oscillations, realized in our model by the well-studied electron shuttling mechanism. Based on experimentally realistic values, we find that a thermodynamic cycle analysis for a single-electron working fluid is not justified, but a few-electron working fluid could suffice to justify it. Furthermore, additional open challenges remain to autonomously implement the more studied Carnot and Otto cycles.},

I theoretically propose how to measure QSLs in an ultracold quantum gas confined in a time-dependent harmonic trap. In this highly-dimensional system of continuous variables, quantum tomography is prohibited. Yet, QSLs can be probed whenever the dynamics is self-similar by measuring as a function of time the cloud size of the ultracold gas.

  abstract     = {Disorder and interactions can lead to the breakdown of statistical mechanics in certain quantum systems, a phenomenon known as many-body localization (MBL). Much of the phenomenology of MBL emerges from the existence of ℓ bits , a set of conserved quantities that are quasilocal and binary (i.e., possess only ± 1 eigenvalues). While MBL and ℓ bits are known to exist in one-dimensional systems, their existence in dimensions greater than one is a key open question. To tackle this question, we develop an algorithm that can find approximate binary ℓ bits in arbitrary dimensions by adaptively generating a basis of operators in which to represent the ℓ bit . We use the algorithm to study four models: the one-, two-, and three-dimensional disordered Heisenberg models and the two-dimensional disordered hard-core Bose-Hubbard model. For all four of the models studied, our algorithm finds high-quality ℓ bits at large disorder strength and rapid qualitative changes in the distributions of ℓ bits in particular ranges of disorder strengths, suggesting the existence of MBL transitions. These transitions in the one-dimensional Heisenberg model and two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model coincide well with past estimates of the critical disorder strengths in these models, which further validates the evidence of MBL phenomenology in the other two- and three-dimensional models we examine. In addition to finding MBL behavior in higher dimensions, our algorithm can be used to probe MBL in various geometries and dimensionality.},

We provide an intuitive interpretation of such latent symmetries by relating them to corresponding local symmetries in the powers of the underlying Hamiltonian matrix. As an application, we relate the degeneracies induced by the rotation symmetry of a real Hamiltonian to a non-Abelian latent symmetry group. It is demonstrated that the rotational symmetries can be broken in a controlled manner while maintaining the underlying more fundamental latent symmetry. This opens up the perspective of investigating accidental degeneracies in terms of latent symmetries.},

  abstract     = {We introduce sequential analysis in quantum information processing, by focusing on the fundamental task of quantum hypothesis testing. In particular, our goal is to discriminate between two arbitrary quantum states with a prescribed error threshold ε when copies of the states can be required on demand. We obtain ultimate lower bounds on the average number of copies needed to accomplish the task. We give a block-sampling strategy that allows us to achieve the lower bound for some classes of states. The bound is optimal in both the symmetric as well as the asymmetric setting in the sense that it requires the least mean number of copies out of all other procedures, including the ones that fix the number of copies ahead of time. For qubit states we derive explicit expressions for the minimum average number of copies and show that a sequential strategy based on fixed local measurements outperforms the best collective measurement on a predetermined number of copies. Whereas for general states the number of copies increases as log 1 / ε , for pure states sequential strategies require a finite average number of samples even in the case of perfect discrimination, i.e., ε = 0 .},

  abstract     = {In the last few years, the great utility of exceptional points in sensing linear perturbations has been recognized. However, physical systems are inherently anharmonic and macroscopic physics is most accurately described by nonlinear models. Considering the multitude of semiclassical and quantum effects ensuing from nonlinear interactions, the sensing of anharmonicities is a prerequisite to the primed control of these effects. Here, we propose an expedient sensing scheme relevant to dissipatively coupled anti parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric systems and customized for the fine-grained estimation of anharmonic perturbations. The sensitivity to anharmonicities is derived from the coherence between two modes induced by a common vacuum. Owing to this coherence, the linear response acquires a pole on the real axis. We demonstrate how this singularity can be exploited for the enhanced sensing of very weak anhamonicities at low pumping rates. Our results are applicable to a wide class of systems, and we specifically illustrate the remarkable sensing capabilities in the context of a weakly anharmonic yttrium iron garnet sphere interacting with a cavity via a tapered fiber waveguide. A small change in the anharmonicity leads to a substantial change in the induced spin current.},

For random scatterers, polar order varies with system size but we find strong non-self-averaging, with sample-to-sample fluctuations dominating asymptotically, which prevents us from elucidating the asymptotic status of order.},

We show that using the local descriptor as input features for deep learning-based nonlinear regression allows us to build a robust neural network that can predict the conductance of large systems beyond that of the current state-of-the-art first-principles calculation algorithms. Our protocol is applied to alkali metal nanowires, i.e., potassium, which have unique geometrical and electronic properties and hence nontrivial transport properties. We demonstrate that within our approach we can achieve qualitative agreement with experiment at a fraction of the computational effort as compared to the direct calculation of the transport properties using conventional first-principles methods.},

Here, we use resonant x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to study the temporal stability and domain memory of the charge and spin stripes in La 2 − x Sr x NiO 4 + δ . Although spin stripes are more spatially correlated, charge stripes maintain a better temporal stability against temperature change. More intriguingly, charge order shows robust domain memory with thermal cycling up to 250 K, far above the ordering temperature. These results demonstrate the pinning of charge stripes to the lattice and that charge condensation is the predominant factor in the formation of stripe orders in nickelates.},

In addition to the intensively studied shift current, the ballistic current, which originates from asymmetric carrier generation due to scattering processes, also constitutes an important contribution to the overall kinetic model of the BPVE. In this Letter, we use a perturbative approach to derive a formula for the ballistic current resulting from the intrinsic electron-phonon scattering in a form amenable to first-principles calculation. We then implement the theory and calculate the ballistic current of the prototypical BPVE material BaTiO 3 using quantum-mechanical density functional theory. The magnitude of the ballistic current is comparable to that of the shift current, and the total spectrum (shift plus ballistic) agrees well with the experimentally measured photocurrents. Furthermore, we show that the ballistic current is sensitive to structural change, which could benefit future photovoltaic materials design.},

By spatially shaping the wave fronts, the internal energy density—probed via the laterally scattered intensity—is enhanced at a tunable distance away from the front surface. The intensity is up to 100 × enhanced compared to random wave fronts, and extends as far as 8 × the Bragg length, which agrees with an extended mesoscopic model.

A major phenomenon within this family is the so-called Faraday chiral anisotropy, the long-predicted but yet unobserved effect which arises due to the correlated coaction of both natural and magnetically induced optical activities at concurring wavelengths in chiral systems. Here, we report on the detection of the elusive anisotropic Faraday chiral phenomenon and demonstrate its enantioselectivity. The existence of this fundamental effect reveals the accomplishment of envisioned nonreciprocal electromagnetic metamaterials referred to as Faraday chiral media, systems where novel electromagnetic phenomena such as negative refraction of light at tunable wavelengths or even negative reflection can be realized. From a more comprehensive perspective, our findings have profound implications for the general understanding of parity-violating photon-particle interactions in magnetized media.},

An optimal control path minimizing the energy cost of the reversal is identified and used to derive the time-dependent direction and amplitude of the optimal switching field. The minimum energy cost of the reversal scales inversely with the switching time for fast switching, follows exponential asymptotics for slow switching, and reaches the lower limit proportional to the energy barrier between the target states and to the damping parameter at infinitely long switching time. For a given switching time, the energy cost is never smaller than that for a free macrospin. This limitation can be bypassed by adding a hard anisotropy axis that activates the internal torque in the desired switching direction, thereby significantly reducing the energy cost. A comparison between the calculated optimal control path and minimum energy path reveals that optimal control does not translate to the minimization of the energy barrier but signifies effective use of the system’s internal dynamics to aid the desired magnetic transition.},

  abstract     = {Chirality in a helimagnetic structure is determined by the sense of magnetic moment rotation. We found that the chiral information did not disappear even after the phase transition to the high-temperature ferromagnetic phase in a helimagnet MnP. The 2nd harmonic resistivity ρ 2 f , which reflects the breaking down of mirror symmetry, was found to be almost unchanged after heating the sample above the ferromagnetic transition temperature and cooling it back to the helimagnetic state. The application of a magnetic field along the easy axis in the ferromagnetic state quenched the chirality-induced ρ 2 f . This indicates that the chirality memory effect originated from the ferromagnetic domain walls.},

Our scheme exploits ancillary quantum spins that communicate via time-dependent tunneling of energy into and out of the spin liquid’s chiral Majorana edge state. We show that the ancillary-spin dynamics reveals the edge-state velocity and, in suitable geometries, detects individual non-Abelian anyons and emergent fermions via a time-domain counterpart of quantum-Hall anyon interferometry.

We demonstrate that the quantum confined magnons exhibit nonlinear decay rates, which strongly depend on the mode number, in sharp contrast to what is assumed in the classical dynamics. Combining the experimental results with those of linear-response density-functional calculations we provide a quantitative explanation for this nonlinear damping effect. The results provide new insights into the decay mechanism of spin excitations in ultrathin films and multilayers and pave the way for tuning the dynamical properties of such structures.},

We rationalize that the three channels correspond to transitions to the neutral ground state, to the lowest energy triplet excited states and to the lowest energy singlet excited states. By single-electron tunneling spectroscopy we measured the energy differences between the transitions obtaining triplet and singlet excited state energies. The experimental values are compared with density functional theory calculations of the excited state energies. Our results show that molecules in excited states can be prepared and that energies of optical gaps can be quantified by controlled single-charge injections. Our work demonstrates the access to, and provides insight into, ubiquitous electron-attachment processes related to excited-state transitions important in electron transfer and molecular optoelectronics phenomena on surfaces.},

Here we reconsider this statement in terms of recent arguments of non-Hermitian skin effects—strong dependence of spectra on boundary conditions for the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians—in the traditional Green’s function formalism. We find the criterion for quantities to be sensitive or insensitive against the boundary condition in Hermitian correlated or disordered systems, which is characterized by the residue theorem. We also discuss the uncertainty of the quasiparticle energy under the skin effects in terms of non-normal pseudospectra, which can be tested via the sharp optical absorption from the bulk-surface coupling. Our result indicates that pseudo quantum number emerges as a consequence of large nonnormality.},

Here we propose a conceptual strategy to achieve CS efficiency close to unity and simultaneously avoid charge recombination (CR) during CT in a ferroelectric polar-discontinuity (PD) superlattice structure, as demonstrated in ( BaTiO 3 ) m / ( BiFeO 3 ) n , which is fundamentally different from the existing mechanisms. The competition of interfacial dipole and ferroelectric PD induces opposite band bending in BiFeO 3 and BaTiO 3 sublattices. Consequently, the photoexcited electrons ( e ) and holes ( h ) in individual sublattices move forward to the opposite interfaces forming electrically isolated e and h channels, leading to a CS efficiency close to unity. Importantly, the spatial isolation of conduction channels in ( BaTiO 3 ) m / ( BiFeO 3 ) n enable suppression of CR during CT, thus realizing a unique band diagram for spatially orthogonal CS and CT. Remarkably, ( BaTiO 3 ) m / ( BiFeO 3 ) n can maintain a high photocurrent and large band gap simultaneously. Our results provide a fascinating illumination for designing artificial heterostructures toward ideal CS and CT in optoelectronic applications.},

Relaxation of a huge misfit strain of about 30\% to 40\% between Bi adlayer and substrate is revealed to drive the ST-like island formation. A Frenkel-Kontrova model is developed to illustrate the enhanced strain relief in the ST islands offsetting the additional step energy cost.

  abstract     = {The 7 × 7 reconstruction of the Si(111) surface represents arguably the most fascinating surface reconstruction so far observed in nature. Yet, the atomistic mechanism underpinning its formation remains unclear after it was discovered sixty years ago. Experimentally, it is observed post priori so that analysis of its formation mechanism can only be carried out in analogy with archaeology. Theoretically, density-functional theory (DFT) correctly predicts the Si ( 111 ) − ( 7 × 7 ) ground state but is impractical to simulate its formation process; while empirical potentials failed to produce it as the ground state. Developing an artificial neural-network potential of DFT quality, we carried out accurate large-scale simulations to unravel the formation of the Si ( 111 ) − ( 7 × 7 ) surface. We reveal a possible step-mediated atom-pop rate-limiting process that triggers massive nonconserved atomic rearrangements, most remarkably, a critical process of collective vacancy diffusion that mediates a sequence of selective dimer, corner-hole, stacking-fault, and dimer-line pattern formation, to fulfill the 7 × 7 reconstruction. Our findings may not only solve the long-standing mystery of this famous surface reconstruction but they also illustrate the power of machine learning in studying complex structures.},

Upon decompression to ambient conditions, it transforms into a compound with atomic-thick BeN 4 layers interconnected via weak van der Waals bonds and consisting of polyacetylene-like nitrogen chains with conjugated π systems and Be atoms in square-planar coordination. Theoretical calculations for a single BeN 4 layer show that its electronic lattice is described by a slightly distorted honeycomb structure reminiscent of the graphene lattice and the presence of Dirac points in the electronic band structure at the Fermi level. The BeN 4 layer, i.e., beryllonitrene, represents a qualitatively new class of 2D materials that can be built of a metal atom and polymeric nitrogen chains and host anisotropic Dirac fermions.},

Imposing a well-controlled center of mass offset enables us to vary the rotational dynamics selectively by introducing an intrinsic rotational timescale to the problem. Results are highly sensitive even to small degrees of offset, rendering this a practically relevant parameter by itself. We further find that, for a certain ratio of the rotational to a vortex shedding timescale (capturing a Froude-type similarity), a resonance phenomenon sets in. Even though this is a rotational effect in origin, it also strongly affects translational oscillation frequency and amplitude, and most importantly, the drag coefficient. This observation equally applies to both heavy and light spheres, albeit with slightly different characteristics for which we offer an explanation. Our findings highlight the need to consider rotational parameters when trying to understand and classify path properties of rising and settling spheres.},

However, full 3D information based on echo location requires some form of scanning of the scene in order to provide the spatial location of the echo origin-points. Without this spatial information, imaging objects in three-dimensional (3D) is a very challenging task as the inverse retrieval problem is strongly ill-posed. Here, we show that the temporal information encoded in the return echoes that are reflected multiple times within a scene is sufficient to faithfully render an image in 3D. Numerical modeling and an information theoretic perspective prove the concept and provide insight into the role of the multipath information. We experimentally demonstrate the concept by using both radio frequency and acoustic waves for imaging individuals moving in a closed environment.},

We use this approach to predict nonlinear loss and (Duffing) frequency shift in ultracoherent phononic membrane resonators. A set of systematic measurements with silicon nitride membranes shows good agreement with the model for low-order soft-clamped modes. Our analysis also reveals quantitative connections between these nonlinearities and dissipation dilution.

Blueshift, redshift, and nonshift of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) have all been reported as the particle size decreases and enters the quantum size regime, but the underlying physical mechanism to induce these controversial size dependences is not clear. Herein, we propose an improved semiclassical model for modifying the dielectric function of metal nanospheres by combining the intrinsic quantized electron transitions and surface electron injection or extraction to investigate the plasmon shift and LSPR size dependence of the charged Au nanoparticles. We experimentally observe that the nonmonotonic blueshift of LSPRs with size for Au nanoparticles is turned into an approximately monotonic blueshift by increasing the electron donor concentration in the reduction solution, and it can also be transformed to an approximately monotonic redshift after surface passivation by ligand molecules. Moreover, we demonstrate controlled blueshift and redshift for the electron and hole plasmons in Cu 2 − x S @ Au core-shell nanoparticles by injecting electrons. The experimental observations and the theoretical calculations clarify the controversial size dependences of LSPR reported in the literature, reveal the critical role of surface electron injection or extraction in the transformation between the different size dependences of LSPRs, and are helpful for understanding the nature of surface plasmons in the quantum size regime.},

This occurs because of nonlinear interactions of modes with well equispaced frequencies. Though theory predicts that, in the absence of any device, mode locking would occur in random lasers, this has never been demonstrated so far. Through the analysis of multimode correlations we provide clear evidence for nonlinear mode coupling in random lasers. The behavior of multiresonance intensity correlations is tested against the nonlinear frequency matching condition equivalent to the one underlying phase locking in ordered ultrafast lasers. Nontrivially large correlations are clearly observed for spatially overlapping resonances that sensitively depend on the frequency matching condition to be satisfied, eventually demonstrating the occurrence of nonlinear mode-locked mode coupling. This is the first example, to our knowledge, of an experimental realization of self-starting mode locking in random lasers, allowing for many new developments in the design and use of nanostructured devices.},

  abstract     = {Measures of quantum properties are essential to understanding the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems as well as quantifying resources for quantum technologies. Here, two broad classes of bosonic phase-space functions, which are filtered versions of the Glauber-Sudarshan P function, are compared with regard to their ability to uncover nonclassical effects of light through their negativities. Gaussian filtering of the P function yields the family of s -parametrized quasiprobabilities, while more powerful regularized nonclassicality quasiprobabilities are obtained by non-Gaussian filtering. A method is proposed to directly sample such phase-space functions for the restricted case of phase-independent quantum states from balanced homodyne measurements. This overcomes difficulties of previous approaches that manually append uniformly distributed optical phases to the measured quadrature data. We experimentally demonstrate this technique for heralded single- and two-photon states using balanced homodyne detection with varying efficiency. The s -parametrized quasiprobabilities, which can be directly sampled, are non-negative for detection efficiencies below 0.5. By contrast, we show that significant negativities of non-Gaussian filtered quasiprobabilities uncover nonclassical effects for arbitrarily low efficiencies.},

  abstract     = {Long-range Rydberg interactions, in combination with electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), give rise to strongly interacting photons where the strength, sign, and form of the interactions are widely tunable and controllable. Such control can be applied to both coherent and dissipative interactions, which provides the potential for generating novel few-photon states. Recently it has been shown that Rydberg-EIT is a rare system in which three-body interactions can be as strong or stronger than two-body interactions. In this work, we study three-body scattering loss for Rydberg-EIT in a wide regime of single and two-photon detunings. Our numerical simulations of the full three-body wave function and analytical estimates based on Fermi’s golden rule strongly suggest that the observed features in the outgoing photonic correlations are caused by the resonant enhancement of the three-body losses.},

In this context, the neutron skin thickness of Pb 208 ( R skin 208 ) provides a stringent laboratory constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In turn, an improved value of R skin 208 has been reported recently by the PREX collaboration. Exploiting the strong correlation between R skin 208 and the slope of the symmetry energy L within a specific class of relativistic energy density functionals, we report a value of L = ( 106 ± 37 ) MeV —which systematically overestimates current limits based on both theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. The impact of such a stiff symmetry energy on some critical neutron-star observables is also examined.},

Assuming that the 0 ν β β process is mediated by a light-Majorana-neutrino exchange, a systematic analysis in chiral effective field theory shows that already at leading order a contact operator is required to ensure renormalizability. In this Letter, we develop a method to estimate the numerical value of its coefficient (in analogy to the Cottingham formula for electromagnetic contributions to hadron masses) and validate the result by reproducing the charge-independence-breaking contribution to the nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths. Our central result, while derived in dimensional regularization, is given in terms of the renormalized amplitude A ν ( | p | , | p ′ | ) , matching to which will allow one to determine the contact-term contribution in regularization schemes employed in nuclear-structure calculations. Our results thus greatly reduce a crucial uncertainty in the interpretation of searches for 0 ν β β decay.},

Two-step electroweak phase transition is found to occur in a narrow region of allowed parameter space with the second transition always being first order. The first transition into the phase of nonvanishing triplet vacuum expectation value is first order in a non-negligible portion of the two-step parameter space.

We compare the analytic results to small- N numerics, finding precise agreement. Furthermore, the random matrix theory results accurately match the behavior of chaotic many-body eigenstates, a manifestation of eigenstate thermalization. We apply this formalism to the AdS / CFT correspondence where the relative entropy measures the distinguishability between different black hole microstates. We find that black hole microstates are distinguishable even when the observer has arbitrarily small access to the quantum state, though the distinguishability is nonperturbatively small in Newton’s constant. Finally, we interpret these results in the context of the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (SETH), concluding that holographic systems obey SETH up to subsystems half the size of the total system.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational waves from binary black holes have the potential to yield information on both of the intrinsic parameters that characterize the compact objects: their masses and spins. While the component masses are usually resolvable, the component spins have proven difficult to measure. This limitation stems in great part from our choice to inquire about the spins of the most and least massive objects in each binary, a question that becomes ill defined when the masses are equal. In this Letter, we show that one can ask a different question of the data: what are the spins of the objects with the highest and lowest dimensionless spins in the binary? We show that this can significantly improve estimates of the individual spins, especially for binary systems with comparable masses. When applying this parametrization to the first 13 gravitational-wave events detected by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC), we find that the highest-spinning object is constrained to have nonzero spin for most sources and to have significant support at the Kerr limit for GW151226 and GW170729. A joint analysis of all the confident binary black hole detections by the LVC finds that, unlike with the traditional parametrization, the distribution of spin magnitude for the highest-spinning object has negligible support at zero spin. Regardless of the parametrization used, the configuration where all of the spins in the population are aligned with the orbital angular momentum is excluded from the 90\% credible interval for the first ten events and from the 99\% credible interval for all current confident detections.},

For strong monitoring, however, the dynamics favors a transition into a quantum Zeno-like area-law regime. Close to the critical point, we observe logarithmic finite size corrections, indicating a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism underlying the transition. This uncovers an unconventional entanglement transition in an elementary, physically realistic model for weak continuous measurements.

One particularly intriguing behavior is the mode switch phenomenon induced by dynamically encircling an exceptional point in the parameter space. While these mode switches have been explored in classical systems, the experimental investigation in the quantum regime remains elusive due to the difficulty of constructing time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in a real quantum system. Here we experimentally demonstrate dynamically encircling the exceptional point with a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are realized utilizing a dilation method. Both the asymmetric and symmetric mode switches have been observed. Our Letter reveals the topological structure of the exceptional point and paves the way to comprehensively explore the exotic properties of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in the quantum regime.},

Here, we extend the definition of quantum information masking to general mixed states, and show that the resource of maskable quantum states is far more abundant than the no-go theorem seemingly suggests. Geometrically, the simultaneously maskable states lays on hyperdisks in the state hypersphere, and strictly contains the broadcastable states. We devise a photonic quantum information masking machine using time-correlated photons to experimentally investigate the properties of qubit masking, and demonstrate the transfer of quantum information into bipartite correlations and its faithful retrieval. The versatile masking machine has decent extensibility, and may be applicable to quantum secret sharing and fault-tolerant quantum communication.

On one side of this phase transition (for weak postselection), an initially mixed density matrix remains mixed at all times, and an initially unentangled state develops volume-law entanglement; on the other side, an arbitrary initial state approaches a unique pure state with low entanglement. We identify this transition with an exceptional point in the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, at which P T symmetry is spontaneously broken.

  abstract     = {Establishing long-distance quantum entanglement, i.e., entanglement transmission, in quantum networks (QN) is a key and timely challenge for developing efficient quantum communication. Traditional comprehension based on classical percolation assumes a necessary condition for successful entanglement transmission between any two infinitely distant nodes: they must be connected by at least a path of perfectly entangled states (singlets). Here, we relax this condition by explicitly showing that one can focus not on optimally converting singlets but on establishing concurrence—a key measure of bipartite entanglement. We thereby introduce a new statistical theory, concurrence percolation theory (ConPT), remotely analogous to classical percolation but fundamentally different, built by generalizing bond percolation in terms of “sponge-crossing” paths instead of clusters. Inspired by resistance network analysis, we determine the path connectivity by series and parallel rules and approximate higher-order rules via star-mesh transforms. Interestingly, we find that the entanglement transmission threshold predicted by ConPT is lower than the known classical-percolation-based results and is readily achievable on any series-parallel networks such as the Bethe lattice. ConPT promotes our understanding of how well quantum communication can be further systematically improved versus classical statistical predictions under the limitation of QN locality—a “quantum advantage” that is more general and efficient than expected. ConPT also shows a percolationlike universal critical behavior derived by finite-size analysis on the Bethe lattice and regular two-dimensional lattices, offering new perspectives for a theory of criticality in entanglement statistics.},

We certify the presence of such quantum correlations via negativities in the regularized two-mode Glauber-Sudarshan function. Our data show compatibility with an incoherent mixture of orthonormal photon-number states, ruling out quantum coherence and other kinds of quantum resources. By construction, the quantumness of our state is robust against dephasing, thus requiring fewer experimental resources to ensure stability.

We find that this is not sufficient, and at least one plate must be made of nonreciprocal material. This setup operates as a heat engine by transforming heat radiation into mechanical force. Although the ratio of the lateral force to heat transfer in the near field regime diverges inversely with the plates separation, d , an Onsager symmetry, which we extend to nonreciprocal plates, limits the engine efficiency to the Carnot value η c . The optimal velocity of operation in the far field is of the order of c η c , where c is the speed of light. In the near field regime, this velocity can be reduced to the order of ω ¯ d η c , where ω ¯ is a typical material frequency.},

  abstract     = {We report on the possibility of detecting hinge spin polarization in magnetic topological insulators by resistance measurements. By implementing a three-dimensional model of magnetic topological insulators into a multiterminal device with ferromagnetic contacts near the top surface, local spin features of the chiral edge modes are unveiled. We find local spin polarization at the hinges that inverts the sign between the top and bottom surfaces. At the opposite edge, the topological state with inverted spin polarization propagates in the reverse direction. A large resistance switch between forward and backward propagating states is obtained, driven by the matching between the spin polarized hinges and the ferromagnetic contacts. This feature is general to the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and canted antiferromagnetic phases, and enables the design of spin-sensitive devices, with the possibility of reversing the hinge spin polarization of the currents.},

This feature results in peculiar nonhydrogenic excitonic states in which exciton-mediated optical nonlinearities are predicted to be enhanced compared to their hydrogenic counterparts. To demonstrate this enhancement, we perform optical transmission spectroscopy of a MoSe 2 monolayer placed in the strong coupling regime with the mode of an optical microcavity and analyze the results quantitatively with a nonlinear input-output theory. We find an enhancement of both the exciton-exciton interaction and of the excitonic fermionic saturation with respect to realistic values expected in the hydrogenic picture. Such results demonstrate that unconventional excitons in MoSe 2 are highly favorable for the implementation of large exciton-mediated optical nonlinearities, potentially working up to room temperature.},

Here, we show that it also induces highly two-dimensional superconducting correlations that have been argued to be the signatures of a new form of superconducting order, the so-called pair density wave (PDW) order. In addition, using resonant soft x-ray scattering, we find that the two-dimensional superconducting fluctuation is strongly associated with the CDW stripe. In particular, the PDW signature first appears when the correlation length of the CDW stripe grows over eight times the lattice unit ( ∼ 8 a ). These results provide critical conditions for the formation of the PDW order.},

We reveal that non-Hermiticity introduces a new scale and breaks down the one-parameter scaling, which is the central assumption of the conventional scaling theory of localization. Instead, we identify the origin of unconventional non-Hermitian delocalization as the two-parameter scaling. Furthermore, we establish the threefold universality of non-Hermitian localization based on reciprocity; reciprocity forbids delocalization without internal degrees of freedom, whereas symplectic reciprocity results in a new type of symmetry-protected delocalization.},

To check the validity of these findings, we propose to investigate the accumulation of extended in-plane defects in graphene. Such defects would contribute to thermodynamic properties of graphene and impose the upper limit on its melting temperature. We propose a type of extended defect of graphene, consisting of pentagonal and heptagonal rings with record low formation energy, whose accumulation leads to the loss of shear rigidity of graphene at temperatures above 6400 K, thus setting the upper limit on its melting temperature. We found that this model satisfactorily explains the increase of specific heat observed in the premelting region of graphite in slow (millisecond) pulse heating experiments. However, in fast (microsecond) pulse heating experiments such an increase of specific heat was not observed, which is a strong indication of overheating that takes place in these experiments.},

Governed by the fluid viscosity, traditional acoustic streaming arises from second-order nonlinear coupling between the fluid’s density and particle velocity, with the first-order acoustic wave time averaging to zero. We describe a form of acoustogeometric streaming that has a nonzero first-order contribution. Experimentally discovered in nanochannels of a height commensurate with the viscous penetration depth of the fluid in the channel, it arises from nonlinear interactions between the surrounding channel deformation and the leading order acoustic pressure field, generating flow pressures three orders of magnitude greater than any known acoustically mediated mechanism. It enables the propulsion of fluids against significant Laplace pressure, sufficient to produce 6 mm / s flow in a 130–150 nm tall nanoslit. We find quantitative agreement between theory and experiment across a variety of fluids and conditions, and identify the maximum flow rate with a channel height 1.59 times the viscous penetration depth.},

This effect is not limited to small mismatches and is observed for random oscillator heterogeneity on both homogeneous and heterogeneous network structures. The results are demonstrated experimentally using networks of Chua’s oscillators and are further supported by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. In particular, we propose a general mechanism based on heterogeneity-induced mode mixing that provides insights into the observed phenomenon.

Previous studies in lasers and other open systems have shown exotic roles played by non-Hermiticity on modifying passive resonances, defined in the absence of optical gain and loss. Here we report a new type of resonances in non-Hermitian photonic systems that does not originate from a passive resonance, identified by analyzing a unique quantization condition in the non-Hermitian extension of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. Termed active photonic resonances, these unique resonances are found in non-Hermitian systems with a spatially correlated complex dielectric function, which is related to supersymmetry quantum mechanics after a Wick rotation. Remarkably, such an active photonic resonance shifts continuously on the real frequency axis as optical gain increases, suggesting the possibility of a tunable on-chip laser that can span a wavelength range over 100 nm.},

Based on this dissipation engineering, we could engineer the optical mode linewidth by one order of magnitude. In addition, we can either enhance or suppress the optomechanical cooling and amplification of the target mechanical oscillations. Our scheme demonstrates the cascaded photon-phonon coupling to control the mechanical interactions, and also presents a novel approach for engineering coherent light-matter interaction in hybrid systems, which consist of different types of nonlinear interactions and multiple modes, and promote the performance of quantum devices.},

We implement quasiperiodic driving of a single qubit in the IBM Quantum Experience and thus experimentally realize a temporal version of the half-Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang Chern insulator. Using simple error mitigation, we achieve consistently high fidelities of around 97\%. From our data we can infer the presence of a topological transition, thus realizing an earlier proposal of topological frequency conversion by Martin, Refael, and Halperin. Motivated by these results, we theoretically study the many-qubit case, and show that one can implement a wide class of Floquet Hamiltonians, or time-dependent Hamiltonians in general.

This enhancement can be crucial in order to bring small coherence-based signatures above the detectable threshold.

This possibility is viable within the so-called two-families scenario in which neutron stars and strange quark stars coexist. Strange quark stars can reach the mass range indicated by GW190814, M ∼ ( 2.5 – 2.67 ) M ⊙ due to a large value of the adiabatic index, without the need for a velocity of sound close to the causal limit. Neutron stars (actually hyperonic stars in the two-families scenario) can instead fulfill the presently available astrophysical and nuclear physics constraints which require a softer equation of state. In this scheme it is possible to satisfy both the request of very large stellar masses and of small radii while using totally realistic and physically motivated equations of state. Moreover it is possible to get a radius for a 1.4 M ⊙ star of the order or less than 11 km, which is impossible if only one family of compact stars exists.},

Elastic scattering events were identified from the coincident detection of the scattered lepton and recoil proton in a large-acceptance toroidal spectrometer.

The v 2 coefficient of electrons from beauty hadron decays is measured for the first time in the transverse momentum ( p T ) range 1.3 – 6 GeV / c in the centrality class 30\%–50\%.

This correspondence reduces modular invariance of the 2D CFT partition function to a few simple algebraic relations obeyed by a multivariate polynomial characterizing the corresponding code. Using this correspondence, we construct many explicit examples of physically distinct isospectral theories, as well as many examples of nonholomorphic functions, which satisfy all the basic properties of a 2D CFT partition function, yet are not associated with any known CFT.},

  abstract     = {It is well known since the works of Utiyama and Kibble that the gravitational force can be obtained by gauging the Poincaré group, which puts gravity on the same footing as the standard model fields. The resulting theory—Einstein-Cartan gravity—inevitably contains four-fermion and scalar-fermion interactions that originate from torsion associated with spin degrees of freedom. We show that these interactions lead to a novel mechanism for producing singlet fermions in the early Universe. These fermions can play the role of dark matter particles. The mechanism is operative in a large range of dark matter particle masses: from a few keV up to ∼ 10 8 GeV . We discuss potential observational consequences of keV-scale dark matter produced this way, in particular for right-handed neutrinos. We conclude that a determination of the primordial dark matter momentum distribution might be able to shed light on the gravity-induced fermionic interactions.},

We find that DM with masses above about an MeV can be probed with exoplanets, with DM-proton and DM-electron scattering cross sections down to about 10 − 37 cm 2 , stronger than existing limits by up to six orders of magnitude. Supporting evidence of a DM origin can be identified through DM-induced exoplanet heating correlated with galactic position, and hence DM density.

  abstract     = {In quantum gases with contact repulsion, the distribution of momenta of the atoms typically decays as ∼ 1 / | p | 4 at large momentum p . Tan’s relation connects the amplitude of that 1 / | p | 4 tail to the adiabatic derivative of the energy with respect to the coupling constant or scattering length of the gas. Here it is shown that the relation breaks down in the one-dimensional Bose gas with contact repulsion, for a peculiar class of stationary states. These states exist thanks to the infinite number of conserved quantities in the system, and they are characterized by a rapidity distribution that itself decreases as 1 / | p | 4 . In the momentum distribution, that rapidity tail adds to the usual Tan contact term. Remarkably, atom losses, which are ubiquitous in experiments, do produce such peculiar states. The development of the tail of the rapidity distribution originates from the ghost singularity of the wave function immediately after each loss event. This phenomenon is discussed for arbitrary interaction strengths, and it is supported by exact calculations in the two asymptotic regimes of infinite and weak repulsion.},

Here we show that, for one-dimensional quantum cellular automata (QCA), there exists a lower bound on quantum chaos quantified by such entanglement entropy. This lower bound is equal to twice the index of the QCA, which is a topological invariant that measures the chirality of information flow, and holds for all the Rényi entropies, with its strongest Rényi- ∞ version being tight. The rigorous bound rules out the possibility of any sublinear entanglement growth behavior, showing in particular that many-body localization is forbidden for unitary evolutions displaying nonzero index. Since the Rényi entropy is measurable, our findings have direct experimental relevance. Our result is robust against exponential tails which naturally appear in quantum dynamics generated by local Hamiltonians.},

We study the rate at which DIQKD can be carried out for a given bipartite quantum state distributed between the sender and receiver or a quantum channel connecting them. We provide upper bounds on the achievable rate going beyond upper bounds possible for QKD. In particular, we construct states and channels where the QKD rate is significant while the DIQKD rate is negligible.

The Liouvillian gap can be obtained by a variational real-time evolution algorithm under this non-Hermitian operator. We apply our method to the dissipative Heisenberg model in both one and two dimensions. For the isotropic case, we find that the Liouvillian gap can be analytically obtained and in one dimension even the whole Liouvillian spectrum can be exactly solved using the Bethe ansatz method. By comparing our numerical results with their analytical counterparts, we show that the Liouvillian gap could be accessed by the RBM approach efficiently to a desirable accuracy, regardless of the dimensionality and entanglement properties.},

The nonlinear behavior of the modes participating in the network are the result of the nonresonant dynamics of weakly evanescent cortical waves that, as shown recently, adhere to an inverse frequency–wave number dispersion relation when propagating through an inhomogeneous anisotropic media characteristic of the brain cortex. This description provides a missing link between simplistic models of synchronization in networks of small amplitude phase coupled oscillators and in networks built with various empirically fitted models of pulse or amplitude coupled spiking neurons. Overall the phase-amplitude coupling mechanism presented in the Letter shows significantly more efficient synchronization compared to current standard approaches and demonstrates an emergence of collective synchronized spiking from subthreshold oscillations that neither phase nor amplitude coupling alone are capable of explaining.},

Droplet dynamics are strongly affected by stretch: glycerol droplets on silicone substrates with a 23\% stretch slide 67\% faster in the direction parallel to the applied stretch than in the perpendicular direction. Contrary to classical wetting theory, static droplets in equilibrium appear elongated, oriented parallel to the stretch direction. Both effects arise from droplet-induced deformations of the substrate near the contact line.},

This experimental model allows one to demonstrate that a “rapid” FnGD regime with a diffusivity close to that of free suspension can originate from earlier subdiffusion. We show that these two regimes are strictly tangled: as subdiffusion deepens upon increasing the optical force, deviations from Gaussianity in the FnGD regime become larger and more persistent in time. In addition, the distinctive exponential tails of FnGD are quickly built up in the subdiffusive regime. Our results shed new light on previous experimental observations and suggest that FnGD may generally be a memory effect of earlier subdiffusive processes.},

  abstract     = {We study the stochastic dynamics of an electrolyte driven by a uniform external electric field and show that it exhibits generic scale invariance despite the presence of Debye screening. The resulting long-range correlations give rise to a Casimir-like fluctuation-induced force between neutral boundaries that confine the ions; this force is controlled by the external electric field, and it can be both attractive and repulsive with similar boundary conditions, unlike other long-range fluctuation-induced forces. This work highlights the importance of nonequilibrium correlations in electrolytes and shows how they can be used to tune interactions between uncharged biological or synthetic structures at large separations.},

The selection rules at the AFM resonances are governed by the total angular momentum of the vortex beam: j = σ + l .

In the N = 0 Landau level, our data show exceptional agreement with numerical calculations over the whole Landau level without adjustable parameters as long as the screening of the Coulomb interaction by the filled Landau levels is accounted for.

Focusing on a clean noninteracting two-band system without band crossings, we derive the general expression for the Hall conductivity at small finite wave vector q to order q 2 , which governs the Hall response to the second gradient of the electric field. Using the Kubo formula, we show that the answer can be expressed through the Berry curvature, Fubini-Study quantum metric, and the rank-3 symmetric tensor which is related to the quantum geometric connection and physically corresponds to the gauge-invariant part of the third cumulant of the position operator. We further compare our results with the predictions made within the semiclassical approach. By deriving the semiclassical equations of motion, we reproduce the result obtained from the Kubo formula in some limits. We also find, however, that the conventional semiclassical description in terms of the definite position and momentum of the electron is not fully consistent because of singular terms originating from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We thus present a clear example of a case when the semiclassical approach inherently suffers from the uncertainty principle, implying that it should be applied to systems in nonuniform fields with extra care.},

However, its detection remains difficult in experiments. We systematically investigate the disorder-induced phase transition of the axion insulator state in a 3D TI with antiparallel magnetization alignment surfaces. It is found that there exists a 2D disorder-induced phase transition on the surfaces of the 3D TI which shares the same universality class with the quantum Hall plateau to plateau transition. Then, we provide a phenomenological theory which maps the random mass Dirac Hamiltonian of the axion insulator state into the Chalker-Coddington network model. Therefore, we propose probing the axion insulator state by investigating the universal signature of such a phase transition in the ferromagnetic-3D TI heterostructure and MnBi 2 Te 4 . Our findings not only show a global phase diagram of the axion insulator state, but also stimulate further experiments to probe it.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), a new horizon of topological phases of matter, host lower-dimensional corner or hinge states, providing important stepping stones to the realization of robust topological waveguides in higher dimensions. The nontrivial band topology that gives rise to the corner or hinge states is usually enabled by certain crystalline symmetries. As a result, higher-order topological boundary states are tied to specific corners or hinges, lacking the flexibility of switching and selecting. Here, we report the experimental realization of topologically switchable and valley-selective corner states in a two-dimensional sonic crystal. Such intriguing properties are enabled by exploiting the higher-order topology assisted with the valley degree of freedom. For this purpose, we realize a valley HOTI of second-order topology characterized by the nontrivial bulk polarization. Interestingly, the hosted corner states are found to be valley dependent and therefore enable flexible control and manipulation on the wave localization. Topological switch on or off and valley selection of the corner states are directly observed through spatial scanning of the sound field. We further design an arbitrary structure of complex patterns containing corners with various intersection angles, among which selected corners can be illuminated or darkened upon valley selection. The reported valley HOTI and the valley-selective corner states provide fundamental understanding on the interplay between higher-order topology and valley degree of freedom and pave the way for lower-dimensional valleytronics, which may find potential applications in integrated acoustics and photonics.},

Strikingly different behaviors of highly vibrationally excited NO scattered from Au(111) and LiF(001) were observed and attributed to disparate electronic structures between metals and insulators. Here, we reveal an alternative mechanical origin of this discrepancy by comparative molecular dynamics simulations with globally accurate adiabatic neural network potentials of both systems. We find that highly vibrating NO can reach for the high-dissociation barrier on Au(111), by which vibrational energy can largely transfer to translation or rotation and further dissipate into substrate phonons. This mechanical energy transfer channel is forbidden in the purely repulsive NO / LiF ( 001 ) system or for low-vibrating NO on Au(111), where molecular vibration is barely coupled to other degrees of freedom. Our results emphasize that the initial state and potential energy landscape concurrently influence the mechanical energy transfer dynamics of gas-surface scattering.},

In this work, a combined experimental and simulation approach uses an automated closed loop via an active learner, which is initialized by x-ray and neutron diffraction measurements, and sequentially improves a machine-learning model until the experimentally predetermined phase space is covered. A multiphase potential is generated for a canonical example of the archetypal refractory oxide, HfO 2 , by drawing a minimum number of training configurations from room temperature to the liquid state at ∼ 2900 ° C . The method significantly reduces model development time and human effort.},

  abstract     = {Electronic excitations near the surface of water ice lead to the desorption of adsorbed molecules, through a so far debated mechanism. A systematic study of photon-induced indirect desorption, revealed by the spectral dependence of the desorption (7–13 eV), is conducted for Ar, Kr, N 2 , and CO adsorbed on H 2 O or D 2 O amorphous ices. The mass and isotopic dependence and the increase of intrinsic desorption efficiency with photon energy all point to a mechanism of desorption induced by collisions between adsorbates and energetic H/D atoms, produced by photodissociation of water. This constitutes a direct and unambiguous experimental demonstration of the mechanism of indirect desorption of weakly adsorbed species on water ice, and sheds new light on the possibility of this mechanism in other systems. It also has implications for the description of photon-induced desorption in astrochemical models.},

These three-dimensional (3D) localized structures consist of either an isolated light bullet (LB), bound together, or could occur in clusters forming well-defined 3D patterns. They can be seen as stationary states in the reference frame moving with the group velocity of light within the cavity. The number of LBs and their distribution in 3D settings are determined by the initial conditions, while their maximum peak power remains constant for a fixed value of the system parameters. Their bifurcation diagram allows us to explain this phenomenon as a manifestation of homoclinic snaking for dissipative light bullets. However, when the strength of the injected beam is increased, LBs lose their stability and the cavity field exhibits giant, short-living 3D pulses. The statistical characterization of pulse amplitude reveals a long tail probability distribution, indicating the occurrence of extreme events, often called rogue waves.},

We propose a nonperturbative approach to analyze light-matter correlations at all interaction strengths. The key element of our approach is a unitary transformation that achieves asymptotic decoupling of light and matter degrees of freedom in the limit where light-matter interaction becomes the dominant energy scale. In the transformed frame, truncation of the matter or photon Hilbert space is increasingly well justified at larger coupling, enabling one to systematically derive low-energy effective models, such as tight-binding Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to concrete models relevant to electrons in crystal potential and electric dipoles interacting with a cavity mode. A generalization to the case of spatially varying electromagnetic modes is also discussed.},

Technical fluctuations are mitigated through a combination of nondestructive detection and active stabilization of the cooling sequence.

However, the extent of the analogy can be questioned since many thermodynamic quantities in the low temperature spin-imbalanced normal state can be described successfully using Fermi liquid theory. Here we present spin susceptibility measurements across the interaction strength-temperature phase diagram using a novel radio frequency technique with ultracold Li 6 gases. For all significant interaction strengths and at all temperatures we find the spin susceptibility is reduced compared to the equivalent value for a noninteracting Fermi gas. At unitarity, we can use the local density approximation to extract the integrated spin susceptibility for the uniform gas as a function of temperature, which at high temperatures is generally less than theoretically predicted. At low temperatures, our data lie within the range of theoretical predictions, although we can also describe the entire curve using a very simple one-parameter mean field model with monotonically increasing spin susceptibility.},

  abstract     = {Overcoming the detrimental effect of disorder at the nanoscale is very hard since disorder induces localization and an exponential suppression of transport efficiency. Here we unveil novel and robust quantum transport regimes achievable in nanosystems by exploiting long-range hopping. We demonstrate that in a 1D disordered nanostructure in the presence of long-range hopping, transport efficiency, after decreasing exponentially with disorder at first, is then enhanced by disorder [disorder-enhanced transport (DET) regime] until, counterintuitively, it reaches a disorder-independent transport (DIT) regime, persisting over several orders of disorder magnitude in realistic systems. To enlighten the relevance of our results, we demonstrate that an ensemble of emitters in a cavity can be described by an effective long-range Hamiltonian. The specific case of a disordered molecular wire placed in an optical cavity is discussed, showing that the DIT and DET regimes can be reached with state-of-the-art experimental setups.},

The stellar β -decay rate of Fe 59 is one of the major nuclear uncertainties impeding us from a precise prediction. The important Gamow-Teller strengths from the low-lying states in Fe 59 to the Co 59 ground state are measured for the first time using the exclusive measurement of the Co 59 ( t , He 3 + γ ) Fe 59 charge-exchange reaction. The new stellar decay rate of Fe 59 is a factor of 3.5 ± 1.1 larger than the currently adopted rate at T = 1.2 GK . Stellar evolution calculations show that the Fe 60 production yield of an 18 solar mass star is decreased significantly by 40\% when using the new rate. Our result eliminates one of the major nuclear uncertainties in the predicted yield of Fe 60 and alleviates the existing discrepancy of the Fe 60 / Al 26 ratio.},

Their systematic trends are discussed in terms of the N p N n scheme in order to study the influence of proton-neutron interaction on α decay in this region of nuclei. It is strikingly found that the reduced widths of U 214 , 216 are significantly enhanced by a factor of two as compared with the N p N n systematics for the 84 ≤ Z ≤ 90 and N &lt; 126 even-even nuclei. The abnormal enhancement is interpreted by the strong monopole interaction between the valence protons and neutrons occupying the π 1 f 7 / 2 and ν 1 f 5 / 2 spin-orbit partner orbits, which is supported by the large-scale shell model calculation.},

The measured asymmetries provide the first opportunity to extract the parton distribution function e ( x ) , which provides information about the interaction between gluons and quarks, in a collinear framework that offers cleaner access than previous measurements. The asymmetries also constitute the first ever signal sensitive to the helicity-dependent two-pion fragmentation function G 1 ⊥ . A clear sign change is observed around the ρ mass that appears in model calculations and is indicative of the dependence of the produced pions on the helicity of the fragmenting quark.},

  abstract     = {Neutrinoless double- β ( 0 ν β β ) decay of certain atomic isotopes, if observed, will have significant implications for physics of neutrinos and models of physics beyond the standard model. In the simplest scenario, if the mass of the light neutrino of the standard model has a Majorana component, it can mediate the decay. Systematic theoretical studies of the decay rate in this scenario, through effective field theories matched to ab initio nuclear many-body calculations, are needed to draw conclusions about the hierarchy of neutrino masses, and to plan the design of future experiments. However, a recently identified short-distance contribution at leading order in the effective field theory amplitude of the subprocess n n → p p ( e e ) remains unknown, and only lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) can directly and reliably determine the associated low-energy constant. While the numerical computations of the correlation function for this process are underway with lattice QCD, the connection to the physical amplitude, and hence this short-distance contribution, is missing. A complete framework that enables this complex matching is developed in this Letter. The complications arising from the Euclidean and finite-volume nature of the corresponding correlation function are fully resolved, and the value of the formalism is demonstrated through a simple example. The result of this work, therefore, fills the gap between first-principles studies of the n n → p p ( e e ) amplitude from lattice QCD and those from effective field theory, and can be readily employed in the ongoing lattice-QCD studies of this process.},

  abstract     = {Tremendous progress has been made experimentally in the hadron spectrum containing heavy quarks in the last two decades. It is surprising that many resonant structures are around thresholds of a pair of heavy hadrons. There should be a threshold cusp at any S -wave threshold. By constructing a nonrelativistic effective field theory with open channels, we discuss the generalities of threshold behavior, and offer an explanation of the abundance of near-threshold peaks in the heavy quarkonium regime. We show that the threshold cusp can show up as a peak only for channels with attractive interaction, and the width of the cusp is inversely proportional to the reduced mass relevant for the threshold. We argue that there should be threshold structures at any threshold of a pair of heavy-quark and heavy-antiquark hadrons, which have attractive interaction at threshold, in the invariant mass distribution of a heavy quarkonium and light hadrons that couple to that open-flavor hadron pair. The structure becomes more pronounced if there is a near-threshold pole. Predictions of the possible pairs are also given for the ground state heavy hadrons. Precisely measuring the threshold structures will play an important role in revealing the heavy-hadron interactions, and thus understanding the puzzling hidden-charm and hidden-bottom structures.},

Our study is done in the minimal left-right symmetric model assuming a type-II dominance scenario with charge conjugation as the left-right symmetry. We then show that the 0 ν β β decay rate may be dominated by the contribution proportional to this LR mixing, which at the hadronic level induces the leading-order contribution to the interaction between two pions and two charged leptons. The resulting long-range pion exchange contribution can significantly enhance the decay rate compared to previously considered short-range contributions. Finally, we find that even if future cosmological experiments rule out the inverted hierarchy for neutrino masses, there are still good prospects for a positive signal in the next generation of 0 ν β β decay experiments.},

  abstract     = {Clouds of ultralight bosons—such as axions—can form around a rapidly spinning black hole, if the black hole radius is comparable to the bosons’ wavelength. The cloud rapidly extracts angular momentum from the black hole, and reduces it to a characteristic value that depends on the boson’s mass as well as on the black hole mass and spin. Therefore, a measurement of a black hole mass and spin can be used to reveal or exclude the existence of such bosons. Using the black holes released by LIGO and Virgo in their GWTC-2, we perform a simultaneous measurement of the black hole spin distribution at formation and the mass of the scalar boson. We find that the data strongly disfavor the existence of scalar bosons in the mass range between 1.3 × 10 − 13 and 2.7 × 10 − 13 eV . Our mass constraint is valid for bosons with negligible self-interaction, that is, with a decay constant f a ≳ 1 0 14 GeV . The statistical evidence is mostly driven by the two binary black holes systems GW190412 and GW190517, which host rapidly spinning black holes. The region where bosons are excluded narrows down if these two systems merged shortly ( ∼ 10 5 yr ) after the black holes formed.},

Moreover, a wide range of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, including Bose-Einstein condensation or laserlike emission are identified. However, the small photon number and the presence of large relative fluctuations places major difficulties in identifying different phases and phase transitions. We overcome this limitation by employing unsupervised learning and fuzzy clustering algorithms to systematically construct the fuzzy phase diagram of our small photonic condensate. Our results thus demonstrate the rich and complex phase structure of even small collections of photons, making them an ideal platform to investigate equilibrium and nonequilibrium physics at the few particle level.},

Our derivation employs powerful bounds on the quantum Fisher information in generic quantum metrological protocols to characterize the QECC performance measured in terms of the worst-case entanglement fidelity. The theorem is applicable to a large class of decoherence models, including erasure and depolarizing noise. Our approach is unorthodox, as instead of following the established path of utilizing QECCs to mitigate noise in quantum metrological protocols, we apply methods of quantum metrology to explore the limitations of QECCs.},

  abstract     = {The class of possible thermodynamic conversions can be extended by introducing an auxiliary system called catalyst , which assists in state conversion while its own state remains unchanged. We reveal a complete characterization of catalytic state conversion in quantum and single-shot thermodynamics by allowing an infinitesimal correlation between the system and the catalyst. Specifically, we prove that a single thermodynamic potential, which provides the necessary and sufficient condition for the correlated-catalytic state conversion, is given by the standard nonequilibrium free energy defined with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This resolves the conjecture raised by Wilming, Gallego, and Eisert [ Entropy 19 , 241 (2017) ] and by Lostaglio and Müller [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 123 , 020403 (2019) ] in the positive. Moreover, we show that, with the aid of the work storage, any quantum state can be converted into another by paying the work cost equal to the nonequilibrium free energy difference. Our result would serve as a step towards establishing resource theories of catalytic state conversion in the fully quantum regime.},

We illustrate this using simulated third-order pump-probe spectroscopy data for exciton transport in a toy model of a coupled dimer with vibrational levels, revealing the dimension of the singly excited manifold of the dimer. Finally, we probe the complexity of excitonic transport in light harvesting 2 (LH2) and Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes using data from two recent nonlinear ultrafast optical spectroscopy experiments. For the latter we make model-independent inferences that are commensurate with model-specific ones, including the estimation of the fewest number of parameters needed to fit the experimental data and identifying the spatial extent, i.e., delocalization size, of quantum states participating in this complex quantum dynamics.},

This is in accordance with the spin and valley degeneracies in bilayer graphene and an additional threefold “minivalley degeneracy” caused by trigonal warping. For small electron numbers, implying a small dot size and a small displacement field, a two-dimensional s shell and then a p shell are successively filled with four and eight electrons, respectively. For electron numbers larger than 12, as the dot size and the displacement field increase, the single-particle ground state evolves into a threefold degenerate minivalley ground state. A transition between these regimes is observed in our measurements and can be described by band-structure calculations. Measurements in the magnetic field confirm Hund’s second rule for spin filling of the quantum dot levels, emphasizing the importance of exchange interaction effects.},

  abstract     = {The appearance of half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in α − RuCl 3 in the presence of in-plane magnetic fields has been taken as a strong evidence for the Kitaev spin liquid. Apart from the quantization, the observed sign structure of the thermal Hall conductivity is also consistent with predictions from the exact solution of the Kitaev honeycomb model. Namely, the thermal Hall conductivity changes sign when the field direction is reversed with respect to the heat current, which is perpendicular to one of the three nearest neighbor bonds on the honeycomb lattice. On the other hand, the thermal Hall conductivity is almost zero when the field is applied along the bond direction. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that such a peculiar sign structure of the thermal Hall conductivity is a generic property of the polarized state in the presence of in-plane magnetic fields. In this case, the thermal Hall effect arises from topological magnons with finite Chern numbers, and the sign structure follows from the symmetries of the momentum space Berry curvature. Using a realistic spin model with bond-dependent interactions, we show that the thermal Hall conductivity can have a magnitude comparable to that observed in the experiments. Hence, the sign structure alone cannot make a strong case for the Kitaev spin liquid. The quantization at very low temperatures, however, will be a decisive test as the magnon contribution vanishes in the zero temperature limit.},

This tunability allows us to unambiguously identify the quantum interferences due to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and to study their dependence with the beam-splitter transmission and the interferometer bias voltage.

The question is whether disorders can also cause the higher-order topological phase. This is not known so far, because interactions between disorders and the higher-order topological phases are completely different from those with the first-order topological system. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that the disorder-induced higher-order topological corner state and quantized fraction corner charge can appear in a modified Haldane model. In experiments, we construct the classical analog of such higher-order topological Anderson insulators using electric circuits and observe the disorder-induced corner state through the voltage measurement. Our work defies the conventional view that the disorder is detrimental to the higher-order topological phase, and offers a feasible platform to investigate the interaction between disorders and higher-order topological phases.},

  abstract     = {Atomic-scale charge transport properties are not only of significant fundamental interest but also highly relevant for numerous technical applications. However, experimental methods that are capable of detecting charge transport at the relevant single-digit nanometer length scale are scarce. Here we report on molecular nanoprobe experiments on Pd(110), where we use the charge carrier-driven switching of a single cis-2-butene molecule to detect ballistic transport properties over length scales of a few nanometers. Our data demonstrate a striking angular dependence with a dip in the charge transport along the [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ] -oriented atomic rows and a peak in the transverse [001] direction. The narrow angular width of both features and distance-dependent measurements suggest that the nanometer-scale ballistic transport properties of metallic surfaces are significantly influenced by the atomic structure.},

This gap has previously been extensively studied by electrical transport through thermal activation measurements. Here, we report the determination of the gap size at the CNP of graphene / h − BN superlattice through photocurrent spectroscopy study. We demonstrate two distinct measurement approaches to extract the gap size. A maximum of ∼ 14 meV gap is observed for devices with a twist angle of less than 1°. This value is significantly smaller than that obtained from thermal activation measurements, yet larger than the theoretically predicted single-particle gap. Our results suggest that lattice relaxation and moderate electron-electron interaction effects may enhance the CNP gap in graphene / h − BN superlattice.},

Understanding this phenomenon requires an accurate description of the coupling between the electron and some collective modes. We report here ab initio calculations based on G W perturbation theory and show that correlation-enhanced electron-phonon interaction in cuprates gives rise to the strong kinks, which not only explains quantitatively the observations but provides new understanding of experiments. Our results reveal it is the electron density of states being the predominant factor in determining the doping dependence of the kink size, manifesting the multiband nature of the cuprates, as opposed to the prevalent belief of it being a measure of the mode-coupling strength.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical behavior of atomically thin membranes is governed by bending rigidity and the Gaussian modulus. However, owing to methodological drawbacks, these two parameters have not been investigated sufficiently. We employed atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that the bending rigidity can be extracted from a quadratic relationship of adhesion energy with monolayer curvatures of rolled and unrolled graphene. The tip-induced topological defects revealed the Gaussian modulus; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on these parameters. Our study may hold great significance because existing investigations have been performed only on flat graphene. The configurational (strain) energy was evaluated via changes in the surface geometry, with subatomic resolution, by three-dimensional analyses of attractive interatomic forces. The mechanical parameters, evaluated at the hollow sites of the honeycomb lattice, were consistent with the isotropic elastic attributes. The remarkably large negative Gaussian modulus, observed when a single carbon atom was located at the center of the tip-induced bump, revealed attractive interactions between the topological defects and geometric potentials of the Gaussian curvature. Our approach will aid in developing two-dimensional materials and understanding cell biology.},

In these networks, known as coherent Ising machines, the model to be solved is encoded in the coupling between the oscillators, and a solution is offered by the steady state of the network. This approach relies on the assumption that mode competition steers the network to the ground-state solution of the Ising model. By considering a broad family of frustrated Ising models, we show that the most efficient mode does not correspond generically to the ground state of the Ising model. We infer that networks of parametric oscillators close to threshold are intrinsically not Ising solvers. Nevertheless, the network can find the correct solution if the oscillators are driven sufficiently above threshold, in a regime where nonlinearities play a predominant role. We find that for all probed instances of the model, the network converges to the ground state of the Ising model with a finite probability.},

Both the intrinsic excitation energies and the fragments’ intrinsic spins and parities are controlled by the interaction mechanism and conservations laws, which lead to their correlations and determines the character of their deexcitation mechanism. We outline here a framework for the theoretical extraction of the intrinsic spin distributions of the fragments and their correlations within the fully microscopic real-time density-functional theory formalism and illustrate it on the example of induced fission of U 236 and Pu 240 , using two nuclear energy density functionals. These fission fragment intrinsic spin distributions display new qualitative features previously not discussed in literature.

We successfully benchmarked the new method against the Green’s function approach and applied it to low-energy two-proton and two-neutron decays. In particular, we studied the interplay between initial-state nucleon-nucleon correlations and final-state interaction.

Axionlike dark matter can exert an oscillating torque on Pb 207 nuclear spins via the electric dipole moment coupling g d or via the gradient coupling g a N N . We calibrate the detector and characterize the excitation spectrum and relaxation parameters of the nuclear spin ensemble with pulsed magnetic resonance measurements in a 4.4 T magnetic field. We sweep the magnetic field near this value and search for axionlike dark matter with Compton frequency within a 1 MHz band centered at 39.65 MHz.

The anomaly is determined from the precision measurements of two angular frequencies. Intensity variation of high-energy positrons from muon decays directly encodes the difference frequency ω a between the spin-precession and cyclotron frequencies for polarized muons in a magnetic storage ring. The storage ring magnetic field is measured using nuclear magnetic resonance probes calibrated in terms of the equivalent proton spin precession frequency ω ˜ p ′ in a spherical water sample at 34.7 ° C .

Since we have not detected primordial gravitational waves yet, anisotropies of the SGWB provide a nontrivial opportunity to verify the rationality of inflation and detect the energy scale of inflation, especially for low-scale inflationary models.

  abstract     = {Detection mechanisms for low mass bosonic dark matter candidates, such as the axion or hidden photon, leverage potential interactions with electromagnetic fields, whereby the dark matter (of unknown mass) on rare occasion converts into a single photon. Current dark matter searches operating at microwave frequencies use a resonant cavity to coherently accumulate the field sourced by the dark matter and a near standard quantum limited (SQL) linear amplifier to read out the cavity signal. To further increase sensitivity to the dark matter signal, sub-SQL detection techniques are required. Here we report the development of a novel microwave photon counting technique and a new exclusion limit on hidden photon dark matter. We operate a superconducting qubit to make repeated quantum nondemolition measurements of cavity photons and apply a hidden Markov model analysis to reduce the noise to 15.7 dB below the quantum limit, with overall detector performance limited by a residual background of real photons. With the present device, we perform a hidden photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ε ≤ 1.68 × 10 − 15 in a band around 6.011 GHz ( 24.86 μ eV ) with an integration time of 8.33 s. This demonstrated noise reduction technique enables future dark matter searches to be sped up by a factor of 1,300. By coupling a qubit to an arbitrary quantum sensor, more general sub-SQL metrology is possible with the techniques presented in this Letter.},

Black holes with masses smaller than the Chandrasekhar limit ≈ 1.4 M ⊙ are essentially impossible to produce through stellar evolution. We propose a new channel for production of low mass black holes: stellar objects catastrophically accrete nonannihilating dark matter, and the small dark core subsequently collapses, eating up the host star and transmuting it into a black hole. The wide range of allowed dark matter masses allows a smaller effective Chandrasekhar limit and thus smaller mass black holes. We point out several avenues to test our proposal, focusing on the redshift dependence of the merger rate. We show that redshift dependence of the merger rate can be used as a probe of the transmuted origin of low mass black holes.},

  abstract     = {We propose a method to constrain the variation of the gravitational constant G with cosmic time using gravitational wave (GW) observations of merging binary neutron stars. The method essentially relies on the fact that the maximum and minimum allowed masses of neutron stars at a particular cosmic epoch have a simple dependence on the value of G at that epoch. GWs carry an imprint of the value of G at the time of the merger. Thus, if the value of G at merger is significantly different from its current value, the masses of the neutron stars inferred from the GW observations will be inconsistent with the theoretically allowed range. This enables us to place bounds on the variation of G between the merger epoch and the present epoch. Using the observation of the binary neutron star system GW170817, we constrain the fractional difference in G between the merger and the current epoch to be in the range − 1 ≲ Δ G / G ≲ 8 . Assuming a monotonic variation in G , this corresponds to a bound on the average rate of change of − 7 × 10 − 9 yr − 1 ≤ G ˙ / G ≤ 5 × 10 − 8 yr − 1 between these epochs. Future observations will put tight constraints on the deviation of G over vast cosmological epochs not probed by other observations.},

We also present a complementary analysis using orbital periods of 13 binary pulsar systems that eliminates the systematics associated with pulsar braking and results in a local acceleration of ( 1.7 ± 0.5 ) × 10 − 10 m / s 2 in good agreement with expectations.

Here we propose and validate an efficient variational scheme, based on the solution of inverse classical Ising problems, which in polynomial time can probe whether an arbitrary set of quantum data is compatible with a local theory; and, if not, it delivers the many-body Bell inequality most strongly violated by the quantum data. We use our approach to unveil new many-body Bell inequalities, violated by suitable measurements on paradigmatic quantum states (the low-energy states of Heisenberg antiferromagnets), paving the way to systematic Bell tests in the many-body realm.},

  abstract     = {While the interplay between liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and glass formation in biological systems is highly relevant for their structure formation and thus function, the exact underlying mechanisms are not well known. The kinetic arrest originates from the slowdown at the molecular level, but how this propagates to the dynamics of microscopic phase domains is not clear. Since with diffusion, viscoelasticity, and hydrodynamics, distinctly different mechanisms are at play, the dynamics needs to be monitored on the relevant time and length scales and compared to theories of phase separation. Using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, we determine the LLPS dynamics of a model protein solution upon low temperature quenches and find distinctly different dynamical regimes. We observe that the early stage LLPS is driven by the curvature of the free energy and speeds up upon increasing quench depth. In contrast, the late stage dynamics slows down with increasing quench depth, fingerprinting a nearby glass transition. The dynamics observed shows a ballistic type of motion, implying that viscoelasticity plays an important role during LLPS. We explore possible explanations based on the Cahn-Hilliard theory with nontrivial mobility parameters and find that these can only partially explain our findings.},

We implement a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics scheme that dynamically adjusts the charges of individual surface groups of objects while evolving their trajectories. Charge regulation effects are shown to qualitatively change self-assembled structures due to global charge redistribution, stabilizing asymmetric constructs. We delineate under which conditions the conventional constant-charge approximation may be employed and clarify the interplay between charge regulation and dielectric polarization.},

Here we exploit the divergence theorem to relate the forces responsible for this motion to the density and current induced by—but far away from—the body. In general, the force is composed of two contributions: due to the strength of the dipolar field component and due to particles leaving the boundary, generating a nonvanishing vorticity of the polarization. We derive and numerically corroborate results for periodic systems, which are fundamentally different from unbounded systems with forces that scale with the area of the system. We demonstrate that vorticity is localized close to the body and to points at which the local curvature changes, enabling the rational design of particle shapes with desired propulsion properties.},

In analogy with structural glasses (SGs), we expect that at low temperatures chain relaxation should occur by activated transitions between the compact metastable states. By evolving the states of the SCP, linearly coupled to a reference state, we show that, below a dynamical transition temperature ( T d ), the SCP is trapped in a metastable state leading to slow dynamics. At a lower temperature, T K ≠ 0 , the configurational entropy vanishes, resulting in a thermodynamic random first order ideal glass transition. The relaxation time obeys the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman law, diverging at T = T 0 ≈ T K . These findings, accord well with the random first order transition theory, establishing that SCP and SG exhibit similar universal characteristics.},

In this Letter, we demonstrate the two-color visibility spectroscopy of multiphoton photoemissions from a solid-state nanoemitter. We investigate the quantum pathway interference visibility over an almost octave-spanning wavelength range of the fundamental ( ω ) femtosecond laser pulses and their second harmonic ( 2 ω ). The photoemissions show a high visibility of 90\% ± 5\% , with a remarkably constant distribution. Furthermore, by varying the relative intensity ratio of the two colors, we find that we can vary the visibility between 0\% and close to 100\%. A simple but highly insightful theoretical model allows us to explain all observations, with excellent quantitative agreements. We expect this work to be universal to all kinds of photo-driven quantum interference, including quantum control in physics, chemistry, and quantum engineering.},

With an integrated design of SW waveguide and microscopic current line for the generation of strong, nanosecond-long, magnetic field pulses, a conversion efficiency up to 39\% of the carrier SW frequency is achieved, significantly larger compared to photonic systems. Given the strength of the magnetic field pulses and its strong impact on the SW dispersion relation, the effect of time refraction can be quantified on a length scale comparable to the SW wavelength.

We measure the plasma wave spectrum on samples with different electron density. It is established that, at large two-dimensional densities, there is a strong hybridization between the plasma and the Fabry-Perot light modes. In the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, the plasma resonance is shown to split into two modes, each corresponding to a particular sense of circular polarization. Experimental results are found to be in good agreement with the theory.},

We argue that such random models capture qualitatively the strong local correlations needed to describe the cuprates and related compounds, while avoiding lattice space group symmetry breaking orders. The previously known spin glass ordered phase in the insulator at doping p = 0 extends to a metallic spin glass phase up to a transition p = p c ≈ 1 / 3 . The dynamic spin susceptibility shows signatures of the spectrum of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models near p c . We also find signs of the phase transition in the entropy, entanglement entropy, and compressibility, all of which exhibit a maximum near p c . The electron energy distribution function in the metallic phase is consistent with a disordered extension of the Luttinger-volume Fermi surface for p &gt; p c , while this breaks down for p &lt; p c .},

We consider here two-dimensional electrons in a magnetic field, and, departing from the standard practice of restricting to the lowest LL, introduce a model short-range interaction that is infinitely strong compared to the cyclotron energy. We demonstrate that this model lends itself to an exact solution for the ground as well as excited states at arbitrary filling factors ν &lt; 1 / 2 p and produces a fractional quantum Hall effect at fractions of the form ν = n / ( 2 p n + 1 ) , where n and p are integers.

We unveiled the underlying microscopic origin by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies. Their eV-scale band structure matches well, representing the common characters of conduction electrons in R Os 4 Sb 12 systems ( R = rare earth ). However, f electrons interact differently with conduction electrons in COS and POS. Strong hybridization between conduction electrons and f electrons is observed in COS with band dependent hybridization gaps, and the development of a Kondo insulating state is directly revealed. Although the ground state of POS is a singlet, finite but incoherent hybridization exists, which can be explained by the Kondo scattering with the thermally excited triplet crystalline electric field state. Our results help us to understand the intriguing properties in COS and POS, and provide a clean demonstration of the microscopic differences in heavy fermion systems with 4 f 1 and 4 f 2 configurations.},

Remarkably, topologically nontrivial bulk and surface band structures are found to persist in highly modified samples with up to 30\% Sm substitution and with an antiferromagnetic ground state in the case of Eu doping.

We find that rock salt NaCl forms with a peculiar hexagonal morphology. We also see the emergence of a transitory graphitelike phase, which may act as an intermediate in a two-step pathway. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, we propose that these observations result from a delicate balance between the substrate-solute interaction and thermodynamics under confinement.

A strong guide field suppresses the production of nonthermal electrons by weakening the Fermi drive mechanism. For a weak guide field the total energy content of nonthermal electrons dominates that of the hot thermal electrons even though their number density remains small.

This solution has a pure Gaussian form in the paraxial limit but beyond it contains higher order Laguerre-Gaussian components attributable to the tighter focusing. One implication of the mixed mode nature of strongly diffracting beams is that the expectation values for spin and orbital angular momenta are fractional and are interrelated to each other by intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Our results for these properties align with earlier work on Bessel beams [Bliokh et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 , 174802 (2011) ] and show that fractional angular momenta can be expressed by means of a Berry phase. The most significant difference arises, though, due to the fact that Laguerre-Gaussian beams naturally contain Gouy phase, while Bessel beams do not. We show that Gouy phase is also related to Berry phase and that Gouy phase fronts that are flat in the paraxial limit become curved beyond it.},

When the driving laser beam is circularly polarized, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process facilitates a conversion of the spin angular momentum of the fundamental light into the intrinsic orbital angular momentum of the harmonics. By means of theoretical modeling and fully 3D particle-in-cell simulations, it is shown the harmonic beams of order n are optical vortices with topological charge | l | = n − 1 , and a power-law spectrum I n ∝ n − 3.5 is produced for sufficiently intense laser beams, where I n is the intensity of the n th harmonic.

We analyze the spectral dynamics of different molecules over a large range of optical powers in the nanoguide to show that these fluctuations are light-induced and local. A simple model is developed to explain our observations based on the optical activation of charges at an estimated mean density of 2.5 × 10 22 m − 3 in the GaP nanostructure. Our work showcases the potential of organic molecules as nanoscopic sensors of the electric charge as well as the use of GaP nanostructures for integrated quantum photonics.},

  abstract     = {Microresonators on a photonic chip could enhance nonlinear optics effects and thus are promising for realizing scalable high-efficiency frequency conversion devices. However, fulfilling phase matching conditions among multiple wavelengths remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a feasible scheme for degenerate sum-frequency conversion that only requires the two-mode phase matching condition. When the drive and the signal are both near resonance to the same telecom mode, an on-chip photon-number conversion efficiency up to 42\% is achieved, showing a broad tuning bandwidth over 250 GHz. Furthermore, cascaded Pockels and Kerr nonlinear optical effects are observed, enabling the parametric amplification of the optical signal to distinct wavelengths in a single device. The scheme demonstrated in this Letter provides an alternative approach to realizing high-efficiency frequency conversion and is promising for future studies on communications, atom clocks, sensing, and imaging.},

We use constrained density functional theory (DFT) to emulate the creation of a localized hole on the halogen and follow the subsequent dynamics via time-dependent DFT. We find low-frequency CM modes ( ∼ 1 eV ) that propagate across the molecule and study their dependence on length, bond order, and halogenation. We observe that the CM speed ( ∼ 4 Å / fs ) is largely independent of molecule length, but is lower for triple-bonded versus double-bonded molecules. Additionally, as the halogen mass increases, the hole travels in a more particlelike manner as it moves across the molecule. These heuristics will be useful in identifying molecules and optimal CM detection methods for future experiments, especially for halogenated hydrocarbons which are promising targets for ionization-triggered CM.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the LHCb Collaboration reported pronounced structures in the invariant mass spectrum of J / ψ pairs produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. In this Letter, we argue that the data can be very well described within two variants of a coupled-channel approach employing T matrices consistent with unitarity: (i) with just two channels, J / ψ J / ψ and ψ ( 2 S ) J / ψ , as long as energy-dependent interactions in these channels are allowed, or (ii) with three channels J / ψ J / ψ , ψ ( 2 S ) J / ψ , and ψ ( 3770 ) J / ψ with just constant contact interactions. Both formulations hint at the existence of a near-threshold state in the J / ψ J / ψ system with the quantum numbers J P C = 0 + + or 2 + + , which we refer to as X ( 6200 ) . We suggest experimental tests to check the existence of this state and discuss what additional channels need to be studied experimentally to allow for distinctive tests between the two mechanisms proposed. If the molecular nature of X ( 6200 ) , as hinted by the three-channel approach, is confirmed, many other double-quarkonium states should exist driven by the same binding mechanism. In particular, there should be an η c η c molecule with a similar binding energy.},

Love tensors characterize the tidal deformability of compact objects such as astrophysical (Kerr) black holes under an external static tidal field. We prove that all Love tensors vanish identically for a Kerr black hole in the nonspinning limit or for an axisymmetric tidal perturbation. In contrast to this result, we show that Love tensors are generically nonzero for a spinning black hole. Specifically, to linear order in the Kerr black hole spin and the weak perturbing tidal field, we compute in closed form the Love tensors that couple the mass-type and current-type quadrupole moments to the electric-type and magnetic-type quadrupolar tidal fields. For a dimensionless spin ∼ 0.1 , the nonvanishing quadrupolar Love tensors are ∼ 2 × 10 − 3 , thus showing that black holes are particularly “rigid” compact objects.},

Quantum photonic integrated circuits are well recognized as an attractive technology offering great promise for achieving large-scale quantum information processing, due to the potential for high fidelity, high efficiency, and compact footprints. Here, we demonstrate a supercompact integrated quantum CNOT gate on silicon by using the concept of symmetry breaking of a six-channel waveguide superlattice. The present path-encoded quantum CNOT gate is implemented with a footprint of 4.8 × 4.45 μ m 2 ( ∼ 3 λ × 3 λ ) as well as a high-process fidelity of ∼ 0.925 and a low excess loss of &lt; 0.2 dB . The footprint is shrunk significantly by ∼ 10 000 times compared to those previous results based on dielectric waveguides. This offers the possibility of realizing practical large-scale quantum information processes and paving the way to the applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Disorder-free localization has been recently introduced as a mechanism for ergodicity breaking in low-dimensional homogeneous lattice gauge theories caused by local constraints imposed by gauge invariance. We show that also genuinely interacting systems in two spatial dimensions can become nonergodic as a consequence of this mechanism. This result is all the more surprising since the conventional many-body localization is conjectured to be unstable in two dimensions; hence the gauge invariance represents an alternative robust localization mechanism surviving in higher dimensions in the presence of interactions. Specifically, we demonstrate nonergodic behavior in the quantum link model by obtaining a bound on the localization-delocalization transition through a classical correlated percolation problem implying a fragmentation of Hilbert space on the nonergodic side of the transition. We study the quantum dynamics in this system by introducing the method of “variational classical networks,” an efficient and perturbatively controlled representation of the wave function in terms of a network of classical spins akin to artificial neural networks. We identify a distinguishing dynamical signature by studying the propagation of line defects, yielding different light cone structures in the localized and ergodic phases, respectively. The methods we introduce in this work can be applied to any lattice gauge theory with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces irrespective of spatial dimensionality.},

Using an augmented epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model that accounts for the spatial variability of the background rates μ ( x , y ) , we present a direct quantitative test of criticality. We calibrate the model to the ANSS catalog of the entire globe, the region around California, and the Geonet catalog for the region around New Zealand using an extended expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm including the determination of μ ( x , y ) . We demonstrate that the criticality reported in previous studies is spurious and can be attributed to a systematic upward bias in the calibration of the branching ratio of the ETAS model, when not accounting correctly for spatial variability. We validate the version of the ETAS model that possesses a space varying background rate μ ( x , y ) by performing pseudoprospective forecasting tests. The noncriticality of seismicity has major implications for the prediction of large events.},

Then we show that a standard biochemical model of the chemotactic network is mathematically equivalent to this information-theoretically optimal dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that an experimentally observed nonlinear response relation can be reproduced from the optimal dynamics.

Analyzing these distributions for an increasing system density reveals that translational energy equipartition is reached at the onset of the gas-liquid granular transition corresponding to the emergence of local clusters. The dynamics of a few tracer particles thus appears as a simple and accurate tool to detect this transition. A model is proposed for describing accurately the formation of local heterogeneities.},

The corresponding spin conductivity is a factor of 3 larger than the record value from a survey of 20 000 nonmagnetic spin-Hall materials.

We show that particle-hole excitations in the electron gas mediate an attractive interaction between the polaritons, whereas the interaction between trions and polaritons mediated by the exchange of an electron can be either repulsive or attractive. These mediated interactions are intrinsic to the quasiparticles and are also present in the absence of light.

Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme based on a combined real- and momentum-space measurement to directly access these 1D topological invariants in lattices of semiconductor microcavities confining exciton polaritons. We extract these invariants in arrays emulating the physics of regular and critically compressed graphene where Dirac cones have merged.

Instead, we find the unusual situation, that the integrated optical spectral weight decreases with doping and increases with increasing temperature. We contrast this with the coherent component of the optical conductivity, which decreases with increasing temperature as a result of a coherence-incoherence crossover. Our studies reveal that the effective crystal field splitting is dynamical and increases strongly at low frequency. This leads to a picture of a Hund’s metallic state, where dynamical orbital fluctuations are visible at intermediate energies, while at low energies a Fermi surface with primarily d x 2 − y 2 character emerges. The infinite-layer nickelates are thus in an intermediate position between the iron based high temperature superconductors where multiorbital Hund’s physics dominates and a one-band system such as the cuprates. To capture this physics we propose a low-energy two-band model with atom centered e g states.},

The STM introduces a single Majorana into the system through hole-charge injection and the Majorana interacts with the MZM to form a stable composite object. We derive the exact analytical expression of single-hole Green’s function in the Mott insulating limit of Kitaev’s model, and show that the differential conductance has split peaks, as a consequence of resonant tunneling through the vison-hole composite. The peak splitting turns out comparable to the Majorana gap in CSL, well within the reach of experimental observation.},

Although discrete vortex states, and sometimes a zero energy mode, had been observed in several iron-based superconductors, their spatial properties are rarely explored. In this study, we used low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to measure the vortex state of (Li,Fe)OHFeSe with high spatial resolution. We found that the nonzero energy states display clear spatial oscillations with a period corresponding to bulk Fermi wavelength; while in contrast, the zero energy mode does not show such oscillation, which suggests its distinct electronic origin. Furthermore, the oscillations of positive and negative energy states near E F are found to be clearly out of phase. Based on a two-band model calculation, we show that our observation is more consistent with an s + + wave pairing in the bulk of (Li, Fe)OHFeSe, and superconducting topological states on the surface.},

The measurement of the photoassisted current of the detector gives direct access to the signal emitted by the carbon nanotube. We focus on the gate regions that exhibit Kondo features in the normal state and demonstrate that when the dc supercurrent is enhanced by the Kondo effect, the ac Josephson effect is strongly reduced. This result is compared to numerical renormalization group theory and is attributed to a transition between the singlet ground state and the doublet excited state which is enabled only when the junction is driven out-of-equilibrium by a voltage bias.},

Here, we address these issues by presenting a stochastic kinetics for nanoparticle catalytic systems. We propose a new experimental measure of the number of catalytic sites in terms of the mean and variance of the catalytic event count. By considering three types of nanocatalytic systems, we investigate how the mean, the variance, and the distribution of the catalytic turnover time depend on the catalytic reaction dynamics, the heterogeneity of catalytic activity, and communication among catalytic sites.

For wide slits the capillary condensation occurs at a pressure which is described accurately by a combination of the Kelvin equation and the Cassie law for an averaged contact angle. However, for narrow slits the condensation occurs in two steps involving an intermediate bridging phase, with the corresponding pressures described by two new Kelvin equations. These are characterised by different contact angles due to interfacial pinning, with one larger and one smaller than the Cassie angle. We determine the triple point and predict two types of dispersion force induced Derjaguin-like corrections due to mesoscopic volume reduction and the singular free-energy contribution from nanodroplets and bubbles. We test these predictions using a fully microscopic density functional model which confirms their validity even for molecularly narrow slits. Analogous mesoscopic corrections are also predicted for two-dimensional systems arising from thermally induced interfacial wandering.},

The results indicate that a quasisymmetric optimization is a robust path of error field correction across the resonant and nonresonant field spectrum in a tokamak, leveraging the prevailing concept of quasisymmetry for general 3D plasma confinement systems such as stellarators. The optimization becomes, in fact, a simple eigenvalue problem to the so-called torque response matrices if a perturbed equilibrium is calculated consistent with nonaxisymmetric neoclassical transport.},

It is generally believed that for these instabilities bulk effects like buoyancy are negligible compared to interfacial forces, especially on small scales. Consequently, the effect of a stable stratification on the Marangoni instability has hitherto been ignored. Here, however, we show that they can matter. We report, for an immiscible drop immersed in a stably stratified ethanol-water mixture, a new type of oscillatory solutal Marangoni instability that is triggered once the stratification has reached a critical value. We experimentally explore the parameter space spanned by the stratification strength and the drop size and theoretically explain the observed crossover from levitating to bouncing by balancing the advection and diffusion around the drop. Finally, the effect of the stable stratification on the Marangoni instability is surprisingly strongly amplified in confined geometries, leading to an earlier onset.},

In contrast, numerous recent proposals have illustrated that dissipation can also be tailored to stabilize many-body entangled quantum states. While the focus of these works has been primarily on engineering the nonequilibrium steady state, we investigate the buildup of entanglement in the quantum trajectories. Specifically, we analyze the competition between two different dissipation channels arising from two incompatible continuous monitoring protocols. The first protocol locks the phase of neighboring sites upon registering a quantum jump, thereby generating a long-range entanglement through the system, while the second destroys the coherence via a dephasing mechanism. By studying the unraveling of stochastic quantum trajectories associated with the continuous monitoring protocols, we present a transition for the scaling of the averaged trajectory entanglement entropies, from critical scaling to area-law behavior. Our work provides an alternative perspective on the measurement-induced phase transition: the measurement can be viewed as monitoring and registering quantum jumps, offering an intriguing extension of these phase transitions through the long-established realm of quantum optics.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic gauge fields have recently emerged, arising in the context of quantum simulations, topological matter, and the protected transportation of excitations against defects. For example, an ultracold atom experiences a light-induced effective magnetic field when tunneling in an optical lattice, and offering a platform to simulate the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators. Similarly, the magnetic field associated with photon transport between sites has been demonstrated in a coupled resonator array. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a synthetic gauge field in the virtual lattices of bosonic modes in a single optomechanical resonator. By employing degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise optical modes and a mechanical mode, a controllable synthetic gauge field is realized by tuning the phase of the driving lasers. The nonreciprocal conversion between the three modes is realized for different synthetic magnetic fluxes. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we also show the dynamics of the system under a fast-varying synthetic gauge field, and demonstrate synthetic electric field. Our demonstration not only provides a versatile and controllable platform for studying synthetic gauge fields in high dimensions but also enables an exploration of ultrafast gauge field tuning with a large dynamic range, which is restricted for a magnetic field.},

Helmrich et al. , Nature , 577 , 481–486 (2020)]. This creates unique possibilities to study this intriguing dynamical phenomenon under controlled experimental conditions. Here we theoretically and experimentally examine the self-organizing dynamics of a driven ultracold gas and identify an unanticipated feedback mechanism originating from the interaction of the system with a thermal reservoir. Transport of particles from the flanks of the cloud toward the center compensates avalanche-induced atom loss. This mechanism sustains an extended critical region in the trap center for timescales much longer than the initial self-organization dynamics. The characteristic flattop density profile provides an additional experimental signature for SOC while simultaneously enabling studies of SOC under almost homogeneous conditions. We present a hydrodynamic description for the reorganization of the atom density, which very accurately describes the experimentally observed features on intermediate and long timescales, and which is applicable to both collisional hydrodynamic and chaotic ballistic regimes.},

Unfortunately, the size and complex integration of optical isolators makes small-scale and densely integrated photonic networks infeasible. Here, we overcome this limitation by designing a single device that operates both as a coherent light source and as its own optical isolator. Our design relies on high-quality-factor dielectric metasurfaces that exhibit intrinsic chirality. By carefully manipulating the geometry of the constituent silicon metaatoms, we design three-dimensionally chiral modes that act as optical spin-dependent filters. Using spin-polarized Raman scattering together with our chiral metacavity, we demonstrate Raman lasing in the forward direction, while the lasing action is suppressed by over an order of magnitude for reflected light. Our high- Q chiral metasurface design presents a new approach toward compactly isolating integrated light sources by directly tailoring the emission properties of the light source itself.},

To extend this primarily atomic technique to large, organic compounds, we theoretically investigate optical cycling of alkaline earth phenoxides and their functionalized derivatives. We find that optical cycle leakage due to wave function mismatch is low in these species, and can be further suppressed by using chemical substitution to boost the electron-withdrawing strength of the aromatic molecular ligand through resonance and induction effects. This provides a straightforward way to use chemical functional groups to construct optical cycling moieties for laser cooling, state preparation, and quantum measurement.},

We propose to use azimuthally and radially polarized vector beams to probe CD spectra. By taking advantage of the strong longitudinal components of the vector beams, the transmitted light can be detected in the radial direction. The resulting CD signal is several orders of magnitude stronger than conventional CD signal with plane waves. Quantitative analysis and numerical simulations show that the enhancement factor is independent of molecular properties and can be increased by decreasing the path length of the sample cuvette and the interaction cross section between the light beam and molecular sample. The proposed novel CD spectroscopy is feasible with the current optical technology.},

When compared with the results from Pb + Pb collisions at s N N = 5.02 TeV , the longitudinal decorrelation signal in midcentral Xe + Xe collisions is found to be larger for v 2 , but smaller for v 3 . Current hydrodynamic models reproduce the ratios of the v n measured in Xe + Xe collisions to those in Pb + Pb collisions but fail to describe the magnitudes and trends of the ratios of longitudinal flow decorrelations between Xe + Xe and Pb + Pb .

  abstract     = {We study signatures of quantum chaos in ( 1 + 1 ) D quantum field theory (QFT) models. Our analysis is based on the method of Hamiltonian truncation, a numerical approach for the construction of low-energy spectra and eigenstates of QFTs that can be considered as perturbations of exactly solvable models. We focus on the double sine-Gordon, also studying the massive sine-Gordon and ϕ 4 model, all of which are nonintegrable and can be studied by this method with sufficiently high precision from small to intermediate perturbation strength. We analyze the statistics of level spacings and of eigenvector components, which are expected to follow random matrix theory predictions. While level spacing statistics are close to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) as expected, on the contrary, the eigenvector components follow a distribution markedly different from the expected Gaussian. Unlike in the typical quantum chaos scenario, the transition of level spacing statistics to chaotic behavior takes place already in the perturbative regime. Moreover, the distribution of eigenvector components does not appear to change or approach Gaussian behavior, even for relatively large perturbations. Our results suggest that these features are independent of the choice of model and basis.},

We make use of numerical lattice simulations to properly follow the nonlinear dynamics such as backreaction and rescattering which gives important contributions to the emission of gravitational waves. It turns out that the axion with the decay constant f ∼ 10 16 GeV and the mass m ∼ 10 − 14 eV which gives the correct dark matter abundance predicts the circularly polarized gravitational-wave signature detectable by SKA.

  abstract     = {Symmetries are well known to have had a profound role in our understanding of nature and are a critical design concept for the realization of advanced technologies. In fact, many symmetry-broken states associated with different phases of matter appear in a variety of quantum technology applications. Such symmetries are normally broken in spatial dimension, however, they can also be broken temporally leading to the concept of discrete time symmetries and their associated crystals. Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a novel state of matter emerging in periodically driven quantum systems. Typically, they have been investigated assuming individual control operations with uniform rotation errors across the entire system. In this work we explore a new paradigm arising from nonuniform rotation errors, where two dramatically different phases of matter coexist in well defined regions of space. We consider a quantum spin network possessing long-range interactions where different driving operations act on different regions of that network. What results from its inherent symmetries is a system where one region is a DTC, while the second is ferromagnetic. We envision our work to open a new avenue of research on chimeralike phases of matter where two different phases coexist in space.},

When the optimal measurements for different parameters are incompatible, they cannot be jointly performed. We find a correspondence relationship between the inaccuracy of a measurement for estimating the unknown parameter with the measurement error in the context of measurement uncertainty relations. Taking this correspondence relationship as a bridge, we incorporate Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle into quantum multiparameter estimation by giving a trade-off relation between the measurement inaccuracies for estimating different parameters. For pure quantum states, this trade-off relation is tight, so it can reveal the true quantum limits on individual estimation errors in such cases. We apply our approach to derive the trade-off between attainable errors of estimating the real and imaginary parts of a complex signal encoded in coherent states and obtain the joint measurements attaining the trade-off relation. We also show that our approach can be readily used to derive the trade-off between the errors of jointly estimating the phase shift and phase diffusion without explicitly parametrizing quantum measurements.},

Noisy cases contrast with noiseless cases where the quantum Fisher information has been shown to be nonzero for a small distance in various circumstances, revealing the superresolution. In addition, we show that false excitation on an arbitrary measurement, such as dark counts, also makes the classical Fisher information of the measurement approach to zero as the separation goes to zero. Finally, a practically relevant situation resolving two identical thermal sources is quantitatively investigated by using the quantum and classical Fisher information of finite spatial mode multiplexing, showing that the amount of noise poses a limit on the resolution in a noisy system.},

To reduce the complexity, coarse graining had been previously applied to experimental neural recordings, which showed over two decades of apparent scaling in free energy, activity variance, eigenvalue spectra, and correlation time, hinting that the mouse hippocampus operates in a critical regime. We model such data by simulating conditionally independent binary neurons coupled to a small number of long-timescale stochastic fields and then replicating the coarse-graining procedure and analysis. This reproduces the experimentally observed scalings, suggesting that they do not require fine-tuning of internal parameters, but will arise in any system, biological or not, where activity variables are coupled to latent dynamic stimuli. Parameter sweeps for our model suggest that emergence of scaling requires most of the cells in a population to couple to the latent stimuli, predicting that even the celebrated place cells must also respond to nonplace stimuli.},

Using a mathematical model, we show that superspreading drastically enhances mitigations which reduce the overall personal contact number and that social clustering increases this effect.},

Green’s functions and response functions are natural candidates for this but, while they are conceptually very useful, they are usually defined only for linear time-translationally invariant systems. The brain, instead, behaves nonlinearly and in a time-dependent way. Here, we use nonequilibrium Green’s functions to describe the time-dependent functional connectivity of a continuous-variable network of neurons. We show how the connectivity is related to the measurable response functions, and provide two illustrative examples via numerical calculations, inspired from Caenorhabditis elegans .},

Robust guidance mechanisms are needed for these bundles to migrate and reach their functional target. Directional information depends on external cues such as chemical or mechanical gradients. Unlike chemotaxis that has been extensively studied, the role and mechanism of durotaxis, the directed response to variations in substrate rigidity, remain unclear. We model bundle migration and guidance by rigidity gradients by using the theory of morphoelastic rods. We show that, at a rigidity interface, the motion of axon bundles follows a simple behavior analogous to optic ray theory and obeys Snell’s law for refraction and reflection. We use this powerful analogy to demonstrate that axons can be guided by the equivalent of optical lenses and fibers created by regions of different stiffnesses.},

To address this problem, we exploit the ability of glasses with large interfacial area to access low energy states. We submit aggregates of spheres of a polymeric glass former to aging well below their glass transition temperature, T g ; and characterize their thermodynamic state by calorimetry, and the vibrational density of state (VDOS) by inelastic neutron scattering (INS). We show that, when aged at appropriate temperatures, glassy spheres attain a thermodynamic state corresponding to an ideal glass in time scales of about one day. In this state, the boson peak, underlying the deviation from the Debye level of the VDOS, is essentially suppressed. Our results are discussed in the framework of the link between the macroscopic thermodynamic state of glasses and their vibrational properties.},

In the absorbing phase of models exhibiting an active-absorbing state transition, this suppression extends up to a hyperuniform length scale that diverges at the critical point. Here, we demonstrate the existence of additional many-body correlations beyond hyperuniformity. These correlations are hidden in the higher moments of the probability distribution of the local density and extend up to a longer length scale with a faster divergence than the hyperuniform length on approaching the critical point. Our results suggest that a hidden order beyond hyperuniformity may generically be present in complex disordered systems.},

Quantitative analyses of small-angle neutron scattering spectra, however, reveal no enhanced structural anisotropy in the PNCs, compared with the pristine polymers under the same deformation conditions. These results demonstrate that the mechanical reinforcement of PNCs is not due to molecular overstraining, but instead a redistribution of strain field in the polymer matrix, akin to the classical picture of hydrodynamic effect of nanoparticles.},

Different from those studies based on static domain-level couplings, here the magnetoelectric coupling relies on the collaborative spin dynamics around domain walls. Accompanying the reversal of spin chirality driven by polarization switching, a “rolling-downhill”-like motion of the domain wall is achieved in nanoscale, which tunes the magnetization locally. Our mechanism opens an alternative route to the pursuit of practical and fast converse magnetoelectric functions via spin dynamics.},

In the weak J regime, we identify a fully spin-polarized phase. The presence of finite V drives a spontaneous chiral current, which makes the system an orbital Chern insulator by contributing an orbital magnetization. Such an out-of-plane orbital magnetization allows the presence of a Chern insulating phase independent of the spin orientation in contrast to the spin-orbit coupling induced Chern insulator that disappears with in-plane ferromagnetism constrained by symmetry. Such a symmetry difference provides a criterion to distinguish the physical origin of topological responses in kagome systems. The orbital Chern insulator is robust against small coupling J . By further increasing J , we find that the ferromagnetic topological phase is suppressed, which first becomes partially polarized and then enters a nonmagnetic phase with spin and charge nematicity. The frustrated flat band allows the spin and Coulomb interaction to play an essential role in determining the quantum phases.},

While the switching event statistics show the expected power-law scaling, significant variations in the value of the scaling exponent τ are seen, possibly as a consequence of the different intrinsic disorder landscapes in the samples and of further alterations under high tip bias applied during domain writing. Importantly, higher exponent values (1.98–2.87) are observed when crackling statistics are acquired only for events occurring in the creep regime. The exponents are systematically lowered when all events across both creep and depinning regimes are considered—the first time such a distinction is made in studies of ferroelectric materials.

The measurement reveals that covalent bonds in diamond are broken and the electron distribution around each atom becomes almost isotropic within ∼ 5 fs after the intensity maximum of the x-ray pump pulse. The 15 fs time delay observed between the bond breaking and atomic disordering indicates nonisothermality of electron and lattice subsystems on this timescale.

Here, we propose a new scheme to construct merging BICs at almost an arbitrary point in reciprocal space. Our approach utilizes the topological features of BICs on photonic crystal slabs, and we merge a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC and an accidental BIC. The Q factors of the resulting merging BIC are enhanced for a broad wave vector range compared with both the original Friedrich-Wintgen BIC and the accidental BIC. Since Friedrich-Wintgen BICs and accidental BICs are quite common in the band structure, our proposal provides a general approach to realize off- Γ merging BICs with superhigh Q factors that can substantially enhance nonlinear and quantum effects and boost the performance of on-chip photonic devices.},

By taking into account the counterrotating terms, the excitation of the quantum emitter with simultaneous emission of a GP has a large probability. This happens for emitter speeds of about 10 − 4 times the speed of light. For accelerated emitters, the GPs exhibit thermal field photon distribution with a high temperature.

By using SU(2) density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we are able to access cluster sizes of up to 128 spins. Our most striking finding is a robust spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking, reflected in an energy density difference between the two sublattices of tetrahedra, familiar as a starting point of earlier perturbative treatments. We also determine the ground-state energy, E 0 / N sites = − 0.490 ( 6 ) J , by combining extrapolations of DMRG with those of a numerical linked cluster expansion. These findings suggest a scenario in which a finite-temperature spin liquid regime gives way to a symmetry-broken state at low temperatures.},

For the ν = 1 | − 1 | 1 geometry we find that magnons are weakly scattered by electric potential variation in the junction region, and that the scattering is chiral when the junction lacks a mirror symmetry. For the ν = 1 | 0 | 1 geometry, we find that kinematic constraints completely block magnon transmission if the incident angle exceeds a critical value. Our results explain the suppressed nonlocal–voltage signals observed in the ν = 1 | 0 | 1 case. We use our theory to propose that valley waves generated at ν = − 1 | 1 junctions and magnons can be used in combination to probe the spin or valley flavor structure of QHM states at integer and fractional filling factors.},

Superparamagnetic i-MTJs with small in-plane anisotropy and sizable perpendicular effective anisotropy show relaxation times down to 8 ns at negligible bias current, which is more than 5 orders of magnitude shorter than that of typical stochastic p-MTJs and about 100 times faster than the shortest time of i-MTJs reported so far.

  abstract     = {Artificial spin ices (ASI) have been widely investigated as magnetic metamaterials with exotic properties governed by their geometries. In parallel, interest in x-ray photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been rapidly growing. Here we show that a square ASI with a patterned topological defect, a double edge dislocation, imparts OAM to scattered x rays. Unlike single dislocations, a double dislocation does not introduce magnetic frustration, and the ASI equilibrates to its antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. The topological charge of the defect differs with respect to the structural and magnetic order; thus, x-ray diffraction from the ASI produces photons with even and odd OAM quantum numbers at the structural and AFM Bragg conditions, respectively. The magnetic transitions of the ASI allow the AFM OAM beams to be switched on and off by modest variations of temperature and applied magnetic field. These results demonstrate ASIs can serve as metasurfaces for reconfigurable x-ray optics that could enable selective probes of electronic and magnetic properties.},

A palladium thin film assists the synthesis by protecting the sputtered yttrium from oxidation and promoting subsequent hydrogenation.

In a conventional electron-phonon mediated picture for the superconductivity for these materials, the high critical temperatures predicted and observed can be ascribed to the low mass of the protons, but this also poses nontrivial questions associated with how the proton dynamics affect the superconductivity. Using clathrate superhydride Li 2 MgH 16 as an example, we show through ab initio path integral simulations that proton diffusion in this system is remarkably high, with a diffusion coefficient, for example, reaching 6 × 10 − 6 cm 2 / s at 300 K and 250 GPa. The diffusion is achieved primarily through proton transfer among interstitial voids within the otherwise rigid Li 2 Mg sublattice at these conditions. The findings indicate the coexistence of proton quantum diffusion together with hydrogen-induced superconductivity, with implications for other very-high-temperature superconducting hydrides.},

The Anderson-Higgs mechanism and the similarities between the Dirac and Bogoliubov–de Gennes equations are the most intriguing examples. In this last analogy, the massive Dirac particle is identified with a quasiparticle excitation and the fermion mass energy with the superconducting gap energy. Here we follow further this parallelism and show that it predicts an outstanding phenomenon: the superconducting Sauter-Schwinger effect. As in the quantum electrodynamics Schwinger effect, where an electron-positron couple is created from the vacuum by an intense electric field, we show that an electrostatic field can generate two coherent excitations from the superconducting ground-state condensate. Differently from the dissipative thermal excitation, these form a new macroscopically coherent and dissipationless state. We discuss how the superconducting state is weakened by the creation of this kind of excitations. In addition to shedding a different light and suggesting a method for the experimental verification of the Sauter-Schwinger effect, our results pave the way to the understanding and exploitation of the interaction between superconductors and electric fields.},

The final state always approaches its half component with a fixed parity in the ferromagnetic phase but remains almost unchanged in the paramagnetic phase. This indicates that the phase diagram at zero temperature is completely preserved at finite temperatures. Numerical simulations for Loschmidt echoes demonstrate such dynamical behaviors in finite-size systems.

Phonons are found to be the main heat carriers, and the high κ hinges on a particular combination of factors: weak electron-phonon scattering, low isotopic mass disorder, and a large frequency gap between acoustic and optical phonon modes that, together with acoustic bunching, impedes three-phonon processes. On the other hand, four-phonon scattering is found to be significant.

Inspired by the unique anatomy of bird lungs and the phenomenon of directed airflow throughout the respiration cycle, we hypothesize, test, and validate that multiloop networks exhibit persistent circulation or DC flows when subject to oscillatory or AC forcing at high Reynolds numbers. Experiments reveal that disproportionately stronger circulation is generated for higher frequencies and amplitudes of the imposed oscillations, and this nonlinear response is corroborated by numerical simulations. Visualizations show that flow separation and vortex shedding at network junctions serve the valving function of directing current with appropriate timing in the oscillation cycle. These findings suggest strategies for controlling inertial flows through network topology and junction connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic dimension provides a new platform for realizing topological photonic devices. Here, we propose a method to realize a rainbow concentrator of topological photonic states based on the synthetic dimension concept. The synthetic dimension is constructed using a translational degree of freedom of the nanostructures inside the unit cell of a two-dimensional photonic crystal. The translational deformation induces a nontrivial topology in the synthetic dimension, which gives rise to robust interface states at different frequencies. The topological rainbow can trap states with different frequencies, controlled by tuning the spatial modulation of interface state group velocities. The operation frequency as well as the bandwidth of the topological rainbow can be easily tuned by controlling the band gap of the photonic crystal. The topological principle can be applied to photonic crystals of any symmetry and arbitrary material composition, as long as a complete band gap exists. This Letter provides a new and general scheme for the realization of a topological rainbow concentrator and will be useful for the development of topological photonic devices.},

Here we demonstrate stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in optomechanics, where the optical mode is not populated during the coherent state transfer between the mechanical modes avoiding this decay channel. We show a state transfer of a coherent mechanical excitation between vibrational modes of a membrane in a high-finesse optical cavity with a transfer efficiency of 86\%. Combined with exceptionally high mechanical quality factors, STIRAP between mechanical modes can enable generation, storage, and manipulation of long-lived mechanical quantum states, which is important for quantum information science and for the investigation of macroscopic quantum superpositions.},

To describe the many-body spin dynamics of the molecules, we derive a long-range interacting X X Z model valid in the regime where motional degrees of freedom are frozen. Because of the spatially extended nature of the harmonic oscillator modes, the interactions in the spin model are very long ranged, and the system behaves close to the collective limit, resulting in robust dynamics and generation of entanglement in the form of spin squeezing even at finite temperature and in the presence of dephasing and chemical reactions. We discuss how the internal state structure can be exploited to realize time reversal and enhanced metrological sensing protocols.},

  abstract     = {Collimated sprays of hadrons, called jets, are an emergent phenomenon of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at collider experiments, whose detailed internal structure encodes valuable information about the interactions of high energy quarks and gluons and their confinement into color-neutral hadrons. The flow of energy within jets is characterized by correlation functions of energy flow operators, with the three-point correlator being the first correlator with nontrivial shape dependence, playing a special role in unraveling the dynamics of QCD. In this Letter, we initiate a study of the three-point energy correlator to all orders in the strong coupling constant, in the limit where two of the detectors are squeezed together. We show that, by rotating the two squeezed detectors with respect to the third by an angle ϕ , a cos ( 2 ϕ ) dependence arising from the quantum interference between intermediate virtual gluons with + / − helicity is imprinted on the detector. This can be regarded as a double slit experiment performed with jet substructure, and it provides a direct probe of the ultimately quantum nature of the substructure of jets and of transverse spin physics in QCD. To facilitate our all-orders analysis, we adopt the operator product expansion (OPE) for light-ray operators in conformal field theory and develop it in QCD. Our application of the light-ray OPE in real world QCD establishes it as a powerful theoretical tool with broad applications for the study of jet substructure.},

  abstract     = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely applied but rather time-consuming tool in machine learning techniques. In 2014, Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost proposed a quantum PCA (qPCA) algorithm [Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost, Nat. Phys. 10 , 631 (2014) ] that still lacks experimental demonstration due to the experimental challenges in preparing multiple quantum state copies and implementing quantum phase estimations. Here, we propose a new qPCA algorithm using the hybrid classical-quantum control, where parameterized quantum circuits are optimized with simple measurement observables, which significantly reduces the experimental complexity. As one important PCA application, we implement a human face recognition process using the images from the Yale Face Dataset. By training our quantum processor, the eigenface information in the training dataset is encoded into the parameterized quantum circuit, and the quantum processor learns to recognize new face images from the test dataset with high fidelities. Our work paves a new avenue toward the study of qPCA applications in theory and experiment.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computation promises intrinsically parallel information processing capacity by harnessing the superposition and entanglement of quantum states. However, it is still challenging to realize universal quantum computation due that the reliability and scalability are limited by unavoidable noises on qubits. Nontrivial topological properties like quantum Hall phases are found capable of offering protection, but require stringent conditions of topological band gaps and broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a symmetry-induced error filtering scheme, showing a more general role of geometry in protection mechanism and applications. We encode qubits in a superposition of two spatial modes on a photonic Lieb lattice. The geometric symmetry endows the system with topological properties featuring a flat band touching, leading to distinctive transmission behaviors of π -phase qubits and 0-phase qubits. The geometry exhibits a significant effect on filtering phase errors, which also enables it to monitor phase deviations in real time. The symmetry-induced error filtering can be a key element for encoding and protecting quantum states, suggesting an emerging field of symmetry-protected universal quantum computation and noisy intermediate-scale quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {The diverse range of resources which underlie the utility of quantum states in practical tasks motivates the development of universally applicable methods to measure and compare resources of different types. However, many of such approaches were hitherto limited to the finite-dimensional setting or were not connected with operational tasks. We overcome this by introducing a general method of quantifying resources for continuous-variable quantum systems based on the robustness measure, applicable to a plethora of physically relevant resources such as optical nonclassicality, entanglement, genuine non-Gaussianity, and coherence. We demonstrate in particular that the measure has a direct operational interpretation as the advantage enabled by a given state in a class of channel discrimination tasks. We show that the robustness constitutes a well-behaved, bona fide resource quantifier in any convex resource theory, contrary to a related negativity-based measure known as the standard robustness. Furthermore, we show the robustness to be directly observable—it can be computed as the expectation value of a single witness operator—and establish general methods for evaluating the measure. Explicitly applying our results to the relevant resources, we demonstrate the exact computability of the robustness for several classes of states.},

The recent realization of optical quasicrystal lattices paves the way to the study of correlated Bose fluids in such structures, but the regime of strong interactions remains largely unexplored, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we determine the quantum phase diagram of two-dimensional correlated bosons in an eightfold quasicrystal potential. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we demonstrate a superfluid-to-Bose glass transition and determine the critical line. Moreover, we show that strong interactions stabilize Mott insulator phases, some of which have spontaneously broken eightfold symmetry. Our results are directly relevant to current generation experiments and, in particular, drive prospects to the observation of the still elusive Bose glass phase in two dimensions and exotic Mott phases.},

Their movement is directed along the steepest local light intensity gradient; we call this emergent symmetry breaking motion “field drive.” We show there emerge dynamic and spatial transitions similar to gas, crystalline, liquid, glass, and jammed states as a function of robot density, resource consumption rates, and resource recovery rates. Paradoxically the nongas states emerge from smooth, flat resource landscapes, not rough ones, and each state can directly move to a glassy state if the resource recovery rate is slow enough, at any robot density.},

That is, the effects of phonon fields on interacting Dirac electrons is an open issue, in particular when investigating long-range ordering. Thus, here we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations to examine the Hubbard-Holstein model (HHM) in the half-filled honeycomb lattice. By performing careful finite-size scaling analysis, we identify semimetal-to-insulator quantum critical points, and determine the behavior of the antiferromagnetic and charge-density wave phase transitions. We have, therefore, established the ground state phase diagram of the HHM for intermediate interaction strength, determining its behavior for different phonon frequencies. Our findings provide quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the model at intermediate coupling strengths, and may shed light on the emergence of many-body properties in honeycomblike systems.},

The latter enables the thermal magnon-mediated essentially unity spin-current transmission at room temperature due to considerably enhanced effective spin-mixing conductance of the interface. As a result, we obtain dampinglike spin-orbit torque efficiency per unit current density of up to 0.8 as detected by the standard technology ferromagnet FeCoB and others, which reaches the expected upper-limit spin Hall ratio of Pt. We establish that Pt / NiO and Pt − Hf / NiO are two energy-efficient, integration-friendly, and high-endurance spin-current generators that provide &gt; 100 times greater energy efficiency than sputter-deposited topological insulators BiSb and BiSe. Our finding will benefit spin-orbitronic research and advance spin-torque technologies.},

By a self-contained method of analysis, for the underdoped ( x = 0.36 ) sample, which harbors a magnetically ordered tetragonal phase, we find it hosts a short nematic correlation length ξ ∼ 10 Å and a large nematic susceptibility χ nem .

After a critical strength of disorder, all the states of the system become localized, thereby ceasing the particle motion in the system. However, in our analysis, we show that in a one-dimensional dimerized lattice with staggered quasiperiodic disorder, after the localization transition, some of the localized eigenstates become extended for a range of intermediate disorder strengths. Eventually, the system undergoes a second localization transition at a higher disorder strength, leading to all states being localized. We also show that the two localization transitions are associated with the mobility regions hosting the single-particle mobility edges. We establish this reentrant localization transition by analyzing the eigenspectra, participation ratios, and the density of states of the system.},

Comparison with theoretical calculations allows us to establish the dominant mechanisms of inelastic scattering for different temperatures. The longest measured relaxation time is around 1 μ s at the lowest temperature of 135 mK, which is determined by the inelastic scattering due to the spontaneous two-ripplon emission process. Furthermore, the image-charge response shortly after applying microwave radiation reveals interesting population dynamics due to the multisubband structure of the system.},

  abstract     = {In the immediate vicinity of the critical temperature ( T c ) of a phase transition, there are fluctuations of the order parameter that reside beyond the mean-field approximation. Such critical fluctuations usually occur in a very narrow temperature window in contrast to Gaussian fluctuations. Here, we report on a study of specific heat in graphite subject to a high magnetic field when all carriers are confined in the lowest Landau levels. The observation of a BCS-like specific heat jump in both temperature and field sweeps establishes that the phase transition discovered decades ago in graphite is of the second order. The jump is preceded by a steady field-induced enhancement of the electronic specific heat. A modest (20\%) reduction in the amplitude of the magnetic field (from 33 to 27 T) leads to a threefold decrease of T c and a drastic widening of the specific heat anomaly, which acquires a tail spreading to two times T c . We argue that the steady departure from the mean-field BCS behavior is the consequence of an exceptionally large Ginzburg number in this dilute metal, which grows steadily as the field lowers. Our fit of the critical fluctuations indicates that they belong to the 3 D X Y universality class as in the case of the He 4 superfluid transition.},

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we found that the electron-phonon coupling is strong at the interface as characterized by a clear observation of replica shake-off bands. Such strong electron-phonon coupling interplays with disorder scattering, leading to an Anderson localization of polarons which could explain the MIT. The domelike emergent gapped phase could then be attributed to a polaron extended state or phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our results demonstrate the capability of alkali-metal deposition as an effective method to enhance the many-body interactions in 2D semiconductors.

Starting from a simple model with a single pair of Weyl nodes, we demonstrated the increase of K and the AHE by decreasing the bandwidth. It is further expanded to a realistic pyrochlore lattice model with characteristic double-degenerated FBs, where we discovered a giant AHE while maximizing the K with nearly vanishing band dispersion of FBs. We identify that such a model system can be realized and modulated through strain engineering in both pyrochlore and spinel compounds based on first-principles calculations, validating our theoretical model and providing a feasible platform for experimental exploration.},

Here, we show that long-range order of atomic Au double chains adsorbed on a Si(553) surface is not only stabilized by interaction with the substrate, but spontaneous self-healing of structural defects is actually enforced by the adsorption of atomic species such as Au or H. This is true even for random adsorbate distribution. Combining atomistic models within density functional theory with low energy electron diffraction and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this apparently counterintuitive behavior is mainly caused by adsorption-induced band filling of modified surface bands, i.e., by the strong electronic correlation throughout the whole terrace. Although adsorption preferably occurs at the step edge, it enhances the dimerization and the stiffness of the Au dimers. Thus, the intertwinement of quasi-1D properties with delocalized 2D effects enforces the atomic wire order.},

Reduction of oxygen valence from 2, common for oxides, down to 1.5 can be explained by a formation of a localized hole at oxygen sites.},

The behavior of the entropy reveals a non-Fermi-liquid state at sufficiently high interactions near half filling: A maximum in the entropy at nonzero doping develops as the coupling strength is increased, along with an inflection point, evidencing a metal to non-Fermi-liquid crossover. The specific heat exhibits additional distinctive features of a non-Fermi-liquid state.

This is achieved by enhanced self-amplified spontaneous emission with a 2 μ m laser and a dechirper device. Optical compression was achieved by modulating the energy of an electron beam with the laser and then compressing with a chicane, resulting in high current spikes on the beam which we observe to lase. A dechirper was then used to selectively control the lasing region of the electron beam. Field autocorrelation measurements indicate a train of pulses, and we find that the number of pulses within the train can be controlled (from 1 to 5 pulses) by varying the dechirper position and undulator taper. These results are a step toward attosecond spectroscopy with x-ray FELs as well as future FEL schemes relying on optical compression of an electron beam.},

Starting from an arbitrary set point, the plasma accelerator autonomously tunes the beam energy spread to the subpercent level at 254 MeV and 4.7 pC / MeV spectral density.

  abstract     = {Conventionally neutral atmospheric boundary layers (CNBLs), which are characterized with zero surface potential temperature flux and capped by an inversion of potential temperature, are frequently encountered in nature. Therefore, predicting the wind speed profiles of CNBLs is relevant for weather forecasting, climate modeling, and wind energy applications. However, previous attempts to predict the velocity profiles in CNBLs have had limited success due to the complicated interplay between buoyancy, shear, and Coriolis effects. Here, we utilize ideas from the classical Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in combination with a local scaling hypothesis to derive an analytic expression for the stability correction function ψ = − c ψ ( z / L ) 1 / 2 , where c ψ = 4.2 is an empirical constant, z is the height above ground, and L is the local Obukhov length based on potential temperature flux at that height, for CNBLs. An analytic expression for this flux is also derived using dimensional analysis and a perturbation method approach. We find that the derived profile agrees excellently with the velocity profile in the entire boundary layer obtained from high-fidelity large eddy simulations of typical CNBLs.},

Considering a disk pendulum swept by a flow in a wind tunnel, bistability between two aerodynamic branches is observed, with spontaneous transitions from one branch to the other. The waiting times before spontaneous transition are distributed following a double exponential as a function of the control parameter, spanning 4 orders of magnitude in time, for both transitions. Inspired by a model originally applied to the transition to turbulence, we show that, for the disk pendulum, both transitions are controlled by rare events of the aerodynamic forces acting on the disk which we propose to link in particular to the vortex shedding-induced fluctuations. Beyond the aerodynamic aspects, this work has interesting fundamental outcomes regarding the broad field of rare events in out-of-equilibrium systems.},

We attribute this enhancement to a mechanism similar to optical pumping through the well-coupled superradiant states.

The high interest in such reactions has initiated many experimental and theoretical studies for various molecules. Here, we report measurements as well as ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on the fragmentation of dicationic methanol monomers and clusters ionized by low-energy (90 eV) electrons. Experimentally, for dicationic monomers, a fragmentation channel for the formation of H 3 + in coincidence with a COH + cation is observed. The simulations show that an intermediate neutral H 2 is formed in the first step, and its roaming around the dication ends in the formation of H 3 + . The entire reaction takes about 100–500 fs. The calculated kinetic energy release for the H 3 + + COH + ion pair is in excellent agreement with the experimental result. In contrast, for the dicationic clusters, due to the possibility of distributing the two charges onto different molecules, several fast dissociation channels occur and suppress the roaming of H 2 and formation of H 3 + . The present Letter suggests that the quenching of H 3 + formation by the chemical environment is a general phenomenon in dicationic clusters of organic molecules.},

Our approach is based upon shifting entropy between different regions of a system by spatially modulating the magnitude of the effective Hamiltonian. We conduct two case studies, on a topological spin chain and the spinful fermionic Hubbard model, focusing on the key question: can a “conformal cooling quench” remove sufficient entropy within experimentally accessible timescales? Finite-temperature, time-dependent matrix product state calculations reveal that even moderately sized bath regions can remove enough energy and entropy density to expose coherent low-temperature physics. The protocol is particularly natural in systems with long-range interactions, such as lattice-trapped polar molecules and Rydberg-excited atoms, where the magnitude of the Hamiltonian scales directly with the interparticle spacing. To this end, we propose simple, near-term implementations of conformal cooling quenches in systems of atoms or molecules, where signatures of low-temperature phases may be observed.},

We employ a momentum-space tight-binding calculation that includes all range real-space tunnelings and show that all twist angles θ ≲ 6 ° can become magic and support gapped flat bands. Because of the greatly enhanced density of states near the flat bands, the system can be driven to superfluidity by weak attractive interaction. Strikingly, the superfluid phase corresponds to a Larkin-Ovchinnikov state with finite momentum pairing that results from the interplay between flat bands and interspin interactions in the unique single-layer spin-twisted lattice.

  abstract     = {We explore the relaxation dynamics of elementary spin clusters in a kinetically constrained spin system. Inspired by experiments with Rydberg lattice gases, we focus on the situation in which an excited spin leads to a “facilitated” excitation of a neighboring spin. We show that even weak interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors can have a dramatic impact on the relaxation behavior: they generate a linear potential, which under certain conditions leads to the onset of Bloch oscillations of spin clusters. These hinder the expansion of a cluster and, more generally, the relaxation of many-body states toward equilibrium. This shows that nonergodic behavior in kinetically constrained systems may occur as a consequence of the interplay between reduced connectivity of many-body states and weak interparticle interactions. We furthermore show that the emergent Bloch oscillations identified here can be detected in experiment through measurements of the Rydberg atom density and discuss how spin-orbit coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom of spin clusters can be used to control their relaxation behavior.},

In the two-flavor theory, unitarization via the inverse-amplitude method (IAM) can be justified from dispersion relations, which is therefore expected to provide reliable predictions for the pion mass dependence of results from lattice QCD calculations. In this work, we provide compact analytic expression for the two-loop partial-wave amplitudes for J = 0 , 1, 2 required for the IAM at subleading order. To analyze the pion mass dependence of recent lattice QCD results for the P wave, we develop a fit strategy that for the first time allows us to perform stable two-loop IAM fits and assess the chiral convergence of the IAM approach. While the comparison of subsequent orders suggests a breakdown scale not much below the ρ mass, a detailed understanding of the systematic uncertainties of lattice QCD data is critical to obtain acceptable fits, especially at larger pion masses.},

FQFT involves a new kind of gauge field, a foliated gauge field, which behaves similar to a collection of independent gauge fields on this stack of layers. Gauge invariant operators (and their analogous particle mobilities) are constrained to the intersection of one or more layers from different foliations. The level coefficients are quantized and exhibit a duality that spatially transforms the coefficients. This duality occurs because the FQFT is a foliated fracton order. That is, the duality can decouple 2 + 1 D gauge theories from the FQFT through a process we dub exfoliation.},

Since translation invariance is obscured in the conformal basis, features of amplitudes that heavily rely on it appear to be lost. Among these are the remarkable relations between gauge theory and gravity amplitudes known as the double copy. Nevertheless, properties of amplitudes reflecting fundamental aspects of the perturbative regime of quantum field theory are expected to survive a change of basis. Here we show that there exists a well-defined procedure for a celestial double copy . This requires a generalization of the usual squaring of numerators which entails first promoting them to generalized differential operators acting on external wave functions and then squaring them. We demonstrate this procedure for three- and four-point celestial amplitudes and give an argument for its validity to all multiplicities.},

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) may detect up to ten such gas-rich black-hole binaries months to years before their detection by Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory or Virgo-like interferometers, localizing them in the sky within ≈ 1 ° 2 . LISA will also measure directly deviations from purely vacuum and stationary waveforms arising from gas accretion, dynamical friction, and orbital motion around the AGN’s massive black hole (acceleration, strong lensing, and Doppler modulation). LISA will therefore be crucial to enable us to point electromagnetic telescopes ahead of time toward this novel class of gas-rich sources, to gain direct insight on their physics, and to disentangle environmental effects from corrections to general relativity that may also appear in the waveforms at low frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Recent observations by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) have tentatively detected a handful of cosmic-ray antihelium events. Such events have long been considered as smoking-gun evidence for new physics, because astrophysical antihelium production is expected to be negligible. However, the dark-matter-induced antihelium flux is also expected to fall below current sensitivities, particularly in light of existing antiproton constraints. Here, we demonstrate that a previously neglected standard model process—the production of antihelium through the displaced-vertex decay of Λ ¯ b -baryons—can significantly boost the dark matter induced antihelium flux. This process can entirely dominate the production of high-energy antihelium nuclei, increasing the rate of detectable AMS-02 events by 2 orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Strongly disordered systems in the many-body localized (MBL) phase can exhibit ground state order in highly excited eigenstates. The interplay between localization, symmetry, and topology has led to the characterization of a broad landscape of MBL phases ranging from spin glasses and time crystals to symmetry protected topological phases. Understanding the nature of phase transitions between these different forms of eigenstate order remains an essential open question. Here, we conjecture that no direct transition between distinct MBL orders can occur in one dimension; rather, an ergodic phase always intervenes. Motivated by recent advances in Rydberg-atom-based quantum simulation, we propose an experimental protocol where the intervening ergodic phase can be diagnosed via the dynamics of local observables.},

The recurrence time of these wave packets (their “round-trip” time) locks in at rational ratios s T / r of the driving period T , where s , r are coprime integers. Wave packets of different s / r can coexist under the same drive, yet travel at different speeds. They retain their spatial compactness either infinitely ( s / r = 1 ) or over a long time ( s / r ≠ 1 ). Discrete time translation symmetry is manifestly broken for s ≠ 1 , reminiscent of integer and fractional Floquet time crystals. We further demonstrate how to reverse engineer a drive protocol to reproduce a target Floquet micromotion, such as the free propagation of a wave packet, as if coming from a strictly linear energy spectrum. The variety of control schemes open up a new avenue for Floquet engineering in quantum information sciences.},

To date, state-of-the-art finite-key security analyses require block lengths in the order of 10 4 bits to obtain positive secret keys. This requirement, however, can be very difficult to achieve in practice, especially in the case of entanglement-based satellite QKD, where the overall channel loss can go up to 70 dB or more. Here, we provide an improved finite-key security analysis which reduces the block length requirement by 14\% to 17\% for standard channel and protocol settings. In practical terms, this reduction could save entanglement-based satellite QKD weeks of measurement time and resources, thereby bringing space-based QKD technology closer to reality. As an application, we use the improved analysis to show that the recently reported Micius QKD satellite is capable of generating positive secret keys with a 10 − 5 security level.},

Weak measurements are minimally invasive methods for obtaining partial state information without projection. Recently, weak measurements were shown to obey an uncertainty relation cast in terms of entropies. We experimentally test this entropic uncertainty relation with strong and weak measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. A weak measurement, we find, can reconcile two strong measurements’ incompatibility, via backaction on the state. Mathematically, a weak value—a preselected and postselected expectation value—lowers the uncertainty bound. Hence we provide experimental support for the physical interpretation of the weak value as a determinant of a weak measurement’s ability to reconcile incompatible operations.},

The third condition is often overlooked, since it may give the impression that it follows trivially from the second. We show that this condition cannot be removed, as it leads to two distinct values for the trace of an element of the POVM. This observation has led us to define a broader class of measurements which we call semi-SIC POVMs. In dimension two, we show that semi-SIC POVMs exist, and we construct the entire family. In higher dimensions, we characterize key properties and applications of semi-SIC POVMs, and note that the proof of their existence remains open.},

Interestingly, these exponents still approximately hold to a dynamical scaling relation. Here we show that the theory of quasicriticality, an organizing principle for brain dynamics, can account for this paradoxical situation. As external stimuli drive the cortex, quasicriticality predicts a departure from criticality along a Widom line with exponents that decrease in absolute value, while still holding approximately to a dynamical scaling relation. We use simulations and experimental data to confirm these predictions and describe new ones that could be tested soon.},

  abstract     = {Relaxation of linear magnetization dynamics is well described by the viscous Gilbert damping processes. However, for strong excitations, nonlinear damping processes such as the decay via magnon-magnon interactions emerge and trigger additional relaxation channels. Here, we use space- and time-resolved microfocused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and micromagnetic simulations to investigate the nonlinear relaxation of strongly driven propagating spin waves in yttrium iron garnet nanoconduits. We show that the nonlinear magnon relaxation in this highly quantized system possesses intermodal features, i.e., magnons scatter to higher-order quantized modes through a cascade of scattering events. We further show how to control such intermodal dissipation processes by quantization of the magnon band in single-mode devices, where this phenomenon approaches its fundamental limit. Our study extends the knowledge about nonlinear propagating spin waves in nanostructures which is essential for the construction of advanced spin-wave elements as well as the realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in scaled systems.},

In a layer of α − RuCl 3 on graphene, the dominant Kitaev exchange is further enhanced by strain. Recently, quantum oscillation (QO) measurements of such α − RuCl 3 and graphene heterostructures showed an anomalous temperature dependence beyond the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) description. Here, we develop a theory of anomalous QO in an effective Kitaev-Kondo lattice model in which the itinerant electrons of the graphene layer interact with the correlated magnetic layer via spin interactions. At low temperatures, a heavy Fermi liquid emerges such that the neutral Majorana fermion excitations of the Kitaev QSL acquire charge by hybridizing with the graphene Dirac band. Using ab initio calculations to determine the parameters of our low-energy model, we provide a microscopic theory of anomalous QOs with a non-LK temperature dependence consistent with our measurements. We show how remnants of fractionalized spin excitations can give rise to characteristic signatures in QO experiments.},

Rev. Lett. 119 , 146401 (2017) ]. Through detailed studies of the quantum correction to the conductance in the BLG, we establish that the band-structure evolution arises from an interplay between proximity-induced strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and the layer polarizability in BLG. The low-energy carriers in the BLG experience an effective valley Zeeman SOI that is completely gate tunable to the extent that it can be switched on or off by applying a transverse displacement field or can be controllably transferred between the valence and the conduction band. We demonstrate that this results in the evolution from weak localization to weak antilocalization at a constant electronic density as the net displacement field is tuned from a positive to a negative value with a concomitant SOI-induced splitting of the low-energy bands of the BLG near the K ( K ′ ) valley, which is a unique signature of the theoretically predicted spin-orbit valve effect. Our analysis shows that quantum correction to the Drude conductance in Dirac materials with strong induced SOI can only be explained satisfactorily by a theory that accounts for the SOI-induced spin splitting of the BLG low-energy bands. Our results demonstrate the potential for achieving highly tunable devices based on the valley Zeeman effect in dual-gated two-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {The topology of the Fermi surface controls the electronic response of a metal, including charge density wave (CDW) formation. A topology conducive for Fermi surface nesting (FSN) allows the electronic susceptibility χ 0 to diverge and induce a CDW at wave vector q CDW . Kohn extended the implications of FSN to show that the imaginary part of the lattice dynamical susceptibility χ L ′′ also responds anomalously for all phonon branches at q CDW —a phenomenon referred to as the Kohn anomaly. However, materials exhibiting multiple Kohn anomalies remain rare. Using first-principles simulations of χ 0 and χ L ′′ , and previous scattering measurements [Crummett et al. , Phys. Rev. B 19 , 6028 234 (1979)], we show that α -uranium harbors multiple Kohn anomalies enabled by the combined effect of FSN and “hidden” nesting, i.e., nesting of electronic states above and below the Fermi surface. FSN and hidden nesting lead to a ridgelike feature in the real part of χ 0 , allowing interatomic forces to modulate strongly and multiple Kohn anomalies to emerge. These results emphasize the importance of hidden nesting in controlling χ 0 and χ L ′′ to exploit electronic and lattice states and enable engineering of advanced materials, including topological Weyl semimetals and superconductors.},

We show experimentally that the temporal modulation of the stiffness drives the transfer of edge states from one boundary of the waveguide to the other. The considered implementation, that consists of an elastic waveguide coupled with tunable electrical impedances, allows the pumping to occur in a controllable manner. The framework presented herein opens new avenues for the manipulation and transport of information through elastic waves, with potential technological applications for digital delay lines and digitally controlled waveguides.

The device achieves postselection or sorting of OAM states after electron-material interactions, thereby allowing the study of new material properties such as the magnetic states of atoms. The required electron-optical configuration is achieved by using microelectromechanical systems technology and focused ion beam milling to control the electron phase electrostatically with a lateral resolution of 50 nm.

This pulse inherits the radial polarization of the incident beam field and has a ring intensity distribution. This RTR is emitted when the beam density is comparable to the plasma density and the spot size much larger than the plasma skin depth. Physically, it arises from the return current or backward relativistic motion of electrons starting just inside the plasma that Doppler up shifts the emitted photons. The number of RTR pulses is determined by the number of groups of plasma electrons that originate at different depths within the first plasma wake period and emit coherently before phase mixing.},

Despite the valuable insights gained from analyzing specific systems, an understanding of the general physical mechanism underlying the emergence of chimeras is still lacking. Here, we show that many stable chimeras arise because coherence in part of the system is sustained by incoherence in the rest of the system. This mechanism may be regarded as a deterministic analog of noise-induced synchronization and is shown to underlie the emergence of strong chimeras. These are chimera states whose coherent domain is formed by identically synchronized oscillators. Recognizing this mechanism offers a new meaning to the interpretation that chimeras are a natural link between coherence and incoherence.},

Recently, spatiotemporal mode locking (STML) was proposed in lasers with small modal (i.e., transverse-mode) dispersion, which has been considered to be critical for achieving STML in those cavities because the small dispersion can be easily balanced. Here, we demonstrate that STML can also be achieved in multimode lasers with much larger modal dispersion, where we find that the intracavity saturable absorber plays an important role for counteracting the large modal dispersion. Furthermore, we observe a new STML phenomenon of passive nonlinear autoselection of single-mode mode locking, resulting from the interaction between spatiotemporal saturable absorption and spatial gain competition. Our work significantly broadens the design possibilities for useful STML lasers thus making them much more accessible for applications, and extends the explorable parameter space of the novel dissipative spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics that can be achieved in these lasers.},

Despite previous attempts to extract these coupling constants from different systems, our knowledge of their values is still deficient. In this Letter, we present a precision determination of these fundamental observables with fully controlled uncertainties from neutron-proton and proton-proton scattering data using chiral effective field theory. To achieve this goal, we use a novel methodology based on the Bayesian approach and perform, for the first time, a full-fledged partial-wave analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering up to the pion production threshold in the framework of chiral effective field theory, including a complete treatment of isospin-breaking effects and our own determination of mutually consistent data. The resulting values of the pion-nucleon coupling constants are accurate at the percent level and show no significant charge dependence.

For both states, the fraction that is produced promptly at the collision vertex is found to decrease as charged particle multiplicity increases. The ratio of χ c 1 ( 3872 ) to ψ ( 2 S ) cross sections for promptly produced particles is also found to decrease with multiplicity, while no significant dependence on multiplicity is observed for the equivalent ratio of particles produced away from the collision vertex in b -hadron decays.

As a result, only Hubble patches with unnaturally small values of the Higgs mass do not immediately crunch. The main experimental prediction of this mechanism is a dilaton in the 0.1–10 GeV range that mixes with the Higgs and can be detected at future colliders and experiments searching for weakly coupled particles.},

By embedding C 2 inside the A 3 cluster algebra, we identify these adjacencies with the extended Steinmann relations for six-particle massless scattering. The cluster algebra connection we find restricts the functions space for vector boson or Higgs plus jet amplitudes and for form factors recently considered in N = 4 super Yang-Mills. We explain general procedures for studying relationships between alphabets of generalized polylogarithmic functions and cluster algebras and use them to provide various identifications of one-loop alphabets with cluster algebras. In particular, we show how one can obtain one-loop alphabets for five-particle scattering from a recently discussed dual conformal eight-particle alphabet related to the G ( 4 , 8 ) cluster algebra.},

  abstract     = {The conformal extension of the BMS 3 algebra is constructed. Apart from an infinite number of “superdilatations,” in order to incorporate superspecial conformal transformations, the commutator of the latter with supertranslations strictly requires the presence of nonlinear terms in the remaining generators. The algebra appears to be very rigid, in the sense that its central extensions as well as the coefficients of the nonlinear terms become determined by the central charge of the Virasoro subalgebra. The wedge algebra corresponds to the conformal group in three spacetime dimensions SO(3,2), so that the full algebra can also be interpreted as an infinite-dimensional nonlinear extension of the AdS 4 algebra with nontrivial central charges. Moreover, since the Lorentz subalgebra [ s l ( 2 , R ) ] is nonprincipally embedded within the conformal (wedge) algebra, according to the conformal weight of the generators, the conformal extension of BMS 3 can be further regarded as a W ( 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 ) algebra. An explicit canonical realization of the conformal extension of BMS 3 is then shown to emerge from the asymptotic structure of conformal gravity in three dimensions, endowed with a new set of boundary conditions. The supersymmetric extension is also briefly addressed.},

However, to pass local gravitational tests, a “screening mechanism” is needed to suppress, on small scales, the fifth force driving the cosmological acceleration. We consider the simplest of these theories, i.e., a scalar-tensor theory with first-order derivative self-interactions, and study isolated (static and spherically symmetric) nonrelativistic and relativistic stars. We produce screened solutions and use them as initial data for nonlinear numerical evolutions in spherical symmetry. We find that these solutions are stable under large initial perturbations, as long as they do not cause gravitational collapse. When gravitational collapse is triggered, the characteristic speeds of the scalar evolution equation diverge, even before apparent black-hole or sound horizons form. This casts doubts on whether the dynamical evolution of screened stars may be predicted in these effective field theories.},

  abstract     = {In recent experiments, the light-matter interaction has reached the ultrastrong coupling limit, which can give rise to dynamical generalizations of spatial symmetries in periodically driven systems. Here, we present a unified framework of dynamical-symmetry-protected selection rules based on Floquet response theory. Within this framework, we study rotational, parity, particle-hole, chiral, and time-reversal symmetries and the resulting selection rules in spectroscopy, including symmetry-protected dark states (spDS), symmetry-protected dark bands, and symmetry-induced transparency. Specifically, dynamical rotational and parity symmetries establish spDS and symmetry-protected dark band conditions. A particle-hole symmetry introduces spDSs for symmetry-related Floquet states and also a symmetry-induced transparency at quasienergy crossings. Chiral symmetry and time-reversal symmetry alone do not imply spDS conditions but can be combined to define a particle-hole symmetry. These symmetry conditions arise from destructive interference due to the synchronization of symmetric quantum systems with the periodic driving. Our predictions reveal new physical phenomena when a quantum system reaches the strong light-matter coupling regime, which is important for superconducting qubits, atoms and molecules in optical or plasmonic field cavities, and optomechanical systems.},

  abstract     = {We present a unified exact tensor network approach to compute the ground state energy, identify the optimal configuration, and count the number of solutions for spin glasses. The method is based on tensor networks with the tropical algebra defined on the semiring of ( R ∪ { − ∞ } , ⊕ , ⊙ ) . Contracting the tropical tensor network gives the ground state energy; differentiating through the tensor network contraction gives the ground state configuration; mixing the tropical algebra and the ordinary algebra counts the ground state degeneracy. The approach brings together the concepts from graphical models, tensor networks, differentiable programming, and quantum circuit simulation, and easily utilizes the computational power of graphical processing units (GPUs). For applications, we compute the exact ground state energy of Ising spin glasses on square lattice up to 1024 spins, on cubic lattice up to 216 spins, and on three regular random graphs up to 220 spins, on a single GPU; we obtain exact ground state energy of ± J Ising spin glass on the chimera graph of D-Wave quantum annealer of 512 qubits in less than 100 s and investigate the exact value of the residual entropy of ± J spin glasses on the chimera graph; finally, we investigate ground-state energy and entropy of three-state Potts glasses on square lattices up to size 18 × 18 . Our approach provides baselines and benchmarks for exact algorithms for spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, and for evaluating heuristic algorithms and mean-field theories.},

Here, we show advantageous strategies for these nonlocal games for generic ground states of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological orders (SPTOs), when a discrete invariant of a SPTO known as a twist phase is nontrivial and − 1 . Our construction demonstrates that sufficiently large string order parameters of such SPTOs are indicative of globally constrained correlations useful for the unconditional computational separation.},

In this work, we present a universally optimal protocol for verifying entangled states by employing the so-called quantum nondemolition measurements, such that the verification efficiency is equivalent to that of the optimal global strategy. Instead of being probabilistic as the standard verification strategies, our protocol is constructed sequentially, which is thus more favorable for experimental realizations. In addition, the target states are preserved in the protocol after each measurement, so can be reused in any subsequent tasks. We demonstrate the power of our protocol for the optimal verification of Bell states, arbitrary two-qubit pure states, and stabilizer states. We also prove that our protocol is able to perform tasks including fidelity estimation and state preparation.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting qubits are a leading platform for scalable quantum computing and quantum error correction. One feature of this platform is the ability to perform projective measurements orders of magnitude more quickly than qubit decoherence times. Such measurements are enabled by the use of quantum-limited parametric amplifiers in conjunction with ferrite circulators—magnetic devices which provide isolation from noise and decoherence due to amplifier backaction. Because these nonreciprocal elements have limited performance and are not easily integrated on chip, it has been a long-standing goal to replace them with a scalable alternative. Here, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by using a superconducting switch to control the coupling between a qubit and amplifier. Doing so, we measure a transmon qubit using a single, chip-scale device to provide both parametric amplification and isolation from the bulk of amplifier backaction. This measurement is also fast, high fidelity, and has 70\% efficiency, comparable to the best that has been reported in any superconducting qubit measurement. As such, this work constitutes a high-quality platform for the scalable measurement of superconducting qubits.},

Here we perform a quantum simulation of topological quantum computing, by teleporting a qubit encoded in the Majorana zero modes of a Kitaev chain. The quantum simulation is performed by mapping the Kitaev chain to its equivalent spin version and realizing the ground states in a superconducting quantum processor. The teleportation transfers the quantum state encoded in the spin-mapped version of the Majorana zero mode states between two Kitaev chains. The teleportation circuit is realized using only braiding operations and can be achieved despite being restricted to Clifford gates for the Ising anyons. The Majorana encoding is a quantum error detecting code for phase-flip errors, which is used to improve the average fidelity of the teleportation for six distinct states from 70.76 ± 0.35\% to 84.60 ± 0.11\% , well beyond the classical bound in either case.},

Based on level statistics and finite-size scaling analysis, the critical exponent for the length scale is estimated as ν = 0.99 ± 0.05 for class AI † , and ν = 1.09 ± 0.05 for class A, both of which are clearly distinct from the critical exponents for 3D orthogonal and 3D unitary classes, respectively.

Since the inception of quantum theory, it has been debated whether complex numbers are essential or whether an alternative consistent formulation is possible using real numbers only. Here, we attack this long-standing problem theoretically and experimentally, using the powerful tools of quantum resource theories. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, quantum states are easier to create and manipulate if they only have real elements. This gives an operational meaning to the resource theory of imaginarity. We identify and answer several important questions, which include the state-conversion problem for all qubit states and all pure states of any dimension and the approximate imaginarity distillation for all quantum states. As an application, we show that imaginarity plays a crucial role in state discrimination, that is, there exist real quantum states that can be perfectly distinguished via local operations and classical communication but that cannot be distinguished with any nonzero probability if one of the parties has no access to imaginarity. We confirm this phenomenon experimentally with linear optics, discriminating different two-photon quantum states by local projective measurements. Our results prove that complex numbers are an indispensable part of quantum mechanics.},

To this purpose, we formulate a model based on the coupling of spontaneous molecular aggregation with vesicle nucleation. Its implications are studied by means of a phenomenological theory describing the diffusion of molecules toward multiple sorting centers that grow due to molecule absorption and are extracted when they reach a sufficiently large size. The predictions of the theory are compared with numerical simulations of a lattice-gas realization of the model and with experimental observations. The efficiency of the distillation process is found to be optimal for intermediate aggregation rates, where the density of sorted molecules is minimal and the process obeys simple scaling laws. Quantitative measures of endocytic sorting performed in primary endothelial cells are compatible with the hypothesis that these optimal conditions are realized in living cells.},

Here we suggest that minimal complexes —mechanically frustrated and positionally disordered local structures—embody the minimal physical ingredients needed to generate glasslike excitations. We investigate the individual effects of mechanical frustration and positional disorder on the vibrational spectrum of isolated minimal complexes, and demonstrate that ensembles of marginally stable minimal complexes yield D ( ω ) ∼ ω 4 . Furthermore, glasslike excitations emerge by embedding a single minimal complex within a perfect lattice. Consequently, minimal complexes offer a conceptual framework to understand glasslike excitations from first principles, as well as a practical computational method for introducing them into solids.},

We construct a fully 3D model to relate flagellar beating directly to the free-swimming trajectories. For realistic geometries, the model reproduces both the sense and magnitude of the axial rotation of live cells. We show that helical swimming requires further symmetry breaking between the two flagella. These functional differences underlie all tactic responses, particularly phototaxis. We propose a control strategy by which cells steer toward or away from light by modulating the sign of biflagellar dominance.},

  abstract     = {The dynamical description of the radiative decay of an electronically excited state in realistic many-particle systems is an unresolved challenge. In the present investigation electromagnetic radiation of the charge density is approximated as the power dissipated by a classical dipole, to cast the emission in closed form as a unitary single-electron theory. This results in a formalism of unprecedented efficiency, critical for ab initio modeling, which exhibits at the same time remarkable properties: it quantitatively predicts decay rates, natural broadening, and absorption intensities. Exquisitely accurate excitation lifetimes are obtained from time-dependent DFT simulations for C 2 + , B + , and Be, of 0.565, 0.831, and 1.97 ns, respectively, in accord with experimental values of 0.57 ± 0.02 , 0.86 ± 0.07 , and 1.77–2.5 ns. Hence, the present development expands the frontiers of quantum dynamics, bringing within reach first-principles simulations of a wealth of photophysical phenomena, from fluorescence to time-resolved spectroscopies.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of superconductivity in a d 9 − δ nickelate has inspired disparate theoretical perspectives regarding the essential physics of this class of materials. A key issue is the magnitude of the magnetic superexchange, which relates to whether cuprate-like high-temperature nickelate superconductivity could be realized. We address this question using Ni L -edge and O K -edge spectroscopy of the reduced d 9 − 1 / 3 trilayer nickelates R 4 Ni 3 O 8 (where R = La , Pr) and associated theoretical modeling. A magnon energy scale of ∼ 80 meV resulting from a nearest-neighbor magnetic exchange of J = 69 ( 4 ) meV is observed, proving that d 9 − δ nickelates can host a large superexchange. This value, along with that of the Ni-O hybridization estimated from our O K -edge data, implies that trilayer nickelates represent an intermediate case between the infinite-layer nickelates and the cuprates. Layered nickelates thus provide a route to testing the relevance of superexchange to nickelate superconductivity.},

In this Letter, however, we demonstrate a pronounced breakdown of this universality, due to the interplay of local and remote phenomena in transport. Our experiments are performed in a graphene-based interaction-detection geometry, in which an artificial magnetic texture is induced in the graphene layer by covering a portion of it with a micromagnet. When probing conduction at some distance from this region, the strong influence of remote factors is manifested through the appearance of giant conductance fluctuations, with amplitude much larger than e 2 / h . This violation of one of the fundamental tenets of mesoscopic physics dramatically demonstrates how local considerations can be overwhelmed by remote signatures in phase-coherent conductors.},

Here, we present an extension of the doubling theorem to non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians. We focus on two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without any symmetry constraints, which can host two different types of topological point nodes, namely, (i) Fermi points and (ii) exceptional points. We show that these two types of protected point nodes obey doubling theorems, which require that the point nodes come in pairs. To prove the doubling theorem for exceptional points, we introduce a generalized winding number invariant, which we call the “discriminant number.” Importantly, this invariant is applicable to any two-dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with exceptional points of arbitrary order and, moreover, can also be used to characterize nondefective degeneracy points. Furthermore, we show that a surface of a three-dimensional system can violate the non-Hermitian doubling theorems, which implies unusual bulk physics.},

A simple dislocation-based continuum model is developed, which reproduced the third power law and revealed very good agreement with recent experiments of multiple types of metals quantitatively. New insights into this unusual macroscopic phenomenon are presented through quantifying the connection between the macroscopic mechanical response and the collective dynamics of dislocation assembles. It is found that the Swegle-Grady law results from the particular stress dependence of the plasticity behaviors, and that the difference between the third power scaling and the classical fourth power scaling results from different shock dissipative actions.},

Since rare events of rapid collapse can be important and even catastrophic, we present here a theory of this distribution, with a stress on its tail of fast rates. We show that the tail of the PDF is a power law with a universal exponent that is theoretically determined. Extensive numerics validate the offered theory.

However, it is difficult to operate seeded FELs at a high repetition rate due to the limitations of present state-of-the-art laser systems. Here, we report a novel self-modulation method for enhancing laser-induced energy modulation, thereby significantly reducing the requirement of an external laser system. Driven by this scheme, we experimentally realize high harmonic generation in a seeded FEL using an unprecedentedly small external laser-induced energy modulation. An electron beam with a laser-induced energy modulation as small as 1.8 times the slice energy spread is used for lasing at the seventh harmonic of a 266-nm seed laser in a single-stage high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) setup and the 30th harmonic of the seed laser in a two-stage HGHG setup.

  abstract     = {The geometric Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase not only is of physical interest but also has wide applications ranging from condensed-matter physics to photonics. Space-varying PB phases based on inhomogeneously anisotropic media have previously been used effectively for spin photon manipulation. Here we demonstrate a novel wave-vector-varying PB phase that arises naturally in the transmission and reflection processes in homogeneous media for paraxial beams with small incident angles. The eigenpolarization states of the transmission and reflection processes are determined by the local wave vectors of the incident beam. The small incident angle breaks the rotational symmetry and induces a PB phase that varies linearly with the transverse wave vector, resulting in the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE). This new PSHE can address the contradiction between spin separation and energy efficiency in the conventional PSHE associated with the Rytov-Vladimirskii-Berry phase, allowing spin photons to be separated completely with a spin separation up to 2.2 times beam waist and a highest energy efficiency of 86\%. The spin separation dynamics is visualized by wave coupling equations in a uniaxial crystal, where the centroid positions of the spin photons can be doubled due to the conservation of the angular momentum. Our findings can greatly deepen the understanding in the geometric phase and spin-orbit coupling, paving the way for practical applications of the PSHE.},

  abstract     = {We study the correlated transport of photons through a chain of three-level emitters that are coupled chirally to a photonic mode of a waveguide. It is found that this system can transfer a weak classical input into a strongly correlated state of light in a unitary manner. Our analysis reveals two-photon scattering eigenstates, that are akin to Fano resonances or shape resonances in particle collisions and facilitate the emergence of antibunched light with long-range correlations upon crossing a critical length of the chain. By operating close to conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency of the three-level medium, a high degree of antibunching and photon transmission can be maintained in the presence of moderate losses. These features suggest a promising mechanism for single-photon generation and may open the door to exploring correlated quantum many-body states of light with repulsively interacting photons.},

  abstract     = {Exceptional points (EPs) of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time-reversal ( P T ) symmetry have the potential to drastically enhance the capabilities of metrology and sensing through their power-law growing sensitivity to external perturbation. With the ability of generating and tuning dissipation in a single trapped ion system, we observe rich dynamics and detailed quantum phase transitions from the P T -symmetric phase to the symmetry-breaking phase. In this single qubit full quantum system, we develop a method to precisely determine the location of EP without any fitting parameter, and extract the eigenvalues in a unified way through all parameter regions. We can also obtain the full density matrix by quantum state tomography. Finally, we suggest from theoretical analysis that the periodically driving P T -symmetric non-Hermitian system can be used to measure the magnitude, frequency, and phase of time-dependent perturbation with EP enhancement.},

  abstract     = {Mode locking in lasers is a collective effect, where due to a weak coupling a large number of frequency modes lock their phases to oscillate in unison, forming an ultrashort pulse in time. We demonstrate an analogous collective effect in coupled parametric oscillators, which we term “pairwise mode locking,” where many pairs of modes with twin frequencies (symmetric around the center carrier) oscillate simultaneously with a locked phase sum, while the phases of individual modes remain undefined. Thus, despite being broadband and multimode, the emission is not pulsed and lacks first-order coherence, while possessing a very high degree of second-order coherence. Our configuration comprises two coupled parametric oscillators within identical multimode cavities, where the coupling between the oscillators is modulated in time at the repetition rate of the cavity modes, with some analogy to active mode locking in lasers. We demonstrate pairwise mode locking in a radio-frequency experiment, covering over an octave of bandwidth with approximately 20 resonant mode-locked pairs, filling most of the available bandwidth between dc and the pump frequency. We accompany our experiment with an analytic model that accounts for the properties of the coupled parametric oscillators near threshold.},

This is in stark contrast to many-atom photoassociation dynamics, which are governed by decay with a single rate coefficient. We also investigate photoassociation in a three-atom system, thereby probing the transition from two-atom dynamics to many-atom dynamics. Our experiments reveal additional reaction dynamics that are only accessible through the control of single atoms and suggest photoassociation could measure pair correlations in few-atom systems.

Our finding of such a small 1 s 1 / 2 component and the halo features reported in prior experiments can be explained by the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum, revealing a definite but not dominant neutron halo in B 17 . The present work gives the smallest s - or p -orbital component among known nuclei exhibiting halo features and implies that the dominant occupation of s or p orbitals is not a prerequisite for the occurrence of a neutron halo.},

Such a state would be expected to decay strongly to final states with charged pions due to the dominant decay ρ → π + π − , whereas decay to two neutral pions would likely be suppressed.

Using these relations we present lattice QCD results for ∂ n ρ ( λ , m l ) / ∂ m l n ( n = 1 , 2, 3) for m l corresponding to pion masses m π = 160 – 55 MeV and at a temperature of about 1.6 times the chiral phase transition temperature. Calculations were carried out using ( 2 + 1 ) flavors of highly improved staggered quarks with the physical value of strange quark mass, three lattice spacings a = 0.12 , 0.08, 0.06 fm, and lattices having aspect ratios 4–9. We find that ρ ( λ → 0 , m l ) develops a peaked structure. This peaked structure arises due to non-Poisson correlations within the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum, becomes sharper as a → 0 , and its amplitude is proportional to m l 2 . We demonstrate that this ρ ( λ → 0 , m l ) is responsible for the manifestations of axial anomaly in two-point correlation functions of light scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. After continuum and chiral extrapolations we find that axial anomaly remains manifested in two-point correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons in the chiral limit.},

  abstract     = {First experimental results from a room-temperature tabletop phase-sensitive axion haloscope experiment are presented. The technique exploits the axion-photon coupling between two photonic resonator oscillators excited in a single cavity, allowing low-mass axions to be upconverted to microwave frequencies, acting as a source of frequency modulation on the microwave carriers. This new pathway to axion detection has certain advantages over the traditional haloscope method, particularly in targeting axions below 1 μ eV (240 MHz) in energy. At the heart of the dual-mode oscillator, a tunable cylindrical microwave cavity supports a pair of orthogonally polarized modes ( TM 0 , 2 , 0 and TE 0 , 1 , 1 ), which, in general, enables simultaneous sensitivity to axions with masses corresponding to the sum and difference of the microwave frequencies. However, in the reported experiment, the configuration was such that the sum frequency sensitivity was suppressed, while the difference frequency sensitivity was enhanced. The results place axion exclusion limits between 7.44–19.38 neV, excluding a minimal coupling strength above 5 × 10 − 7 1 / GeV , after a measurement period of two and a half hours. We show that a state-of-the-art frequency-stabilized cryogenic implementation of this technique, ambitious but realizable, may achieve the best limits in a vast range of axion space.},

The process determining the relic abundance is χ ζ † → ζ ζ , where χ is the dark matter candidate. For m ζ &lt; m χ &lt; 3 m ζ , χ is cosmologically long-lived and scatters against the exponentially more abundant ζ . Therefore, such a process allows for exponentially heavier dark matter for the same interaction strength as a particle undergoing ordinary 2 → 2 freeze-out, or equivalently, exponentially weaker interactions for the same mass. We demonstrate this mechanism in a leptophilic dark matter model, which allows for dark matter masses up to 10 9 GeV .},

Here we reveal the basic properties of pseudo-entropy in quantum field theories by numerically calculating this quantity for a set of two-dimensional free-scalar field theories and the Ising spin chain. We extend the Gaussian method for pseudo-entropy in free-scalar theories with two parameters: mass m and dynamical exponent z . This computation finds two novel properties of pseudo-entropy which we conjecture to be universal in field theories, in addition to an area law behavior. One is a saturation behavior and the other one is nonpositivity of the difference between pseudo-entropy and averaged entanglement entropy. Moreover, our numerical results for the Ising chain imply that pseudo-entropy can play a role as a new quantum order parameter which detects whether two states are in the same quantum phase or not.},

The fluorine spectrum deviates from a single power law above 200 GV. The heavier secondary-to-primary F/Si flux ratio rigidity dependence is distinctly different from the lighter B/O (or B/C) rigidity dependence. In particular, above 10 GV, the F / Si B / O ratio can be described by a power law R δ with δ = 0.052 ± 0.007 .

With barely visible pre-merger emission, however, GW190521 merits further investigation of the pre-merger dynamics and even of the very nature of the colliding objects. We show that GW190521 is consistent with numerically simulated signals from head-on collisions of two (equal mass and spin) horizonless vector boson stars (aka Proca stars), forming a final black hole with M f = 23 1 − 17 + 13 M ⊙ , located at a distance of d L = 57 1 − 181 + 348 Mpc . This provides the first demonstration of close degeneracy between these two theoretical models, for a real gravitational-wave event. The favored mass for the ultralight vector boson constituent of the Proca stars is μ V = 8.7 2 − 0.82 + 0.73 × 10 − 13 eV . Confirmation of the Proca star interpretation, which we find statistically slightly preferred, would provide the first evidence for a long sought dark matter particle.},

The level statistics in the MBC phase are well characterized by the so-called critical statistics, and the wave functions exhibit deep multifractal behavior only in the critical region. We further study the half-chain entanglement entropy and thermalization properties and show that the former, in the MBC phase, manifest a volume law scaling, while the many-body states violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The results are confirmed by the state-of-the-art numerical calculations with system size up to L = 22 . This work unveils a novel many-body phase which is extended but nonthermal.},

We find that the distribution of computation error is approximately Gaussian, which in turn justifies the quadratic error loss. It is shown that these loss functions can be efficiently evaluated in a scalable way by sampling from Clifford-dominated circuits. We demonstrate the results by numerically simulating 10-qubit noisy quantum circuits with various error models as well as executing 4-qubit circuits with up to ten layers of 2-qubit gates on a superconducting quantum processor.

Despite the increase of protein numbers in growing cells, the protein concentrations are often found to be confined within small ranges throughout the cell cycle. Generally, the noise in protein concentration can be decomposed into an intrinsic and an extrinsic component, where the former vanishes for high expression levels. Considering the time trajectory of protein concentration as a random walker in the concentration space, an effective restoring force (with a corresponding “spring constant”) must exist to prevent the divergence of concentration due to random fluctuations. In this work, we prove that the magnitude of the effective spring constant is directly related to the fraction of intrinsic noise in the total protein concentration noise. We show that one can infer the magnitude of intrinsic, extrinsic, and measurement noises of gene expression solely based on time-resolved data of protein concentration, without any a priori knowledge of the underlying gene expression dynamics. We apply this method to experimental data of single-cell bacterial gene expression. The results allow us to estimate the average copy numbers and the translation burst parameters of the studied proteins.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact of phonon excitations on the photoexcited carrier dynamics in a lead-halide perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , which hosts unique low-energy phonons that can be directly excited by terahertz pulses. Our time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that strong terahertz excitation prolongs the cooling time of hot carriers, providing direct evidence for the hot-phonon bottleneck effect. In contrast to the previous studies where phonons are treated as a passive heat bath, our results demonstrate that phonon excitation can significantly perturb the carrier relaxation dynamics in halide perovskites through the coupling between transverse- and longitudinal-optical phonons.},

  abstract     = {In solid state physics, giant magnetoresistance is the large change in electrical resistance due to an external magnetic field. Here we show that giant magnetoresistance is possible in a spin chain composed of weakly interacting layers of strongly coupled spins. This is found for all system sizes even down to a minimal system of four spins. The mechanism driving the effect is a mismatch in the energy spectrum resulting in spin excitations being reflected at the boundaries between layers. This mismatch, and thus the current, can be controlled by external magnetic fields resulting in giant magnetoresistance. A simple rule for determining the behavior of the spin transport under the influence of a magnetic field is presented based on the energy levels of the strongly coupled spins.},

We consider an open system of the Kitaev honeycomb model generically coupled to an external environment. In extended parameter regimes, the Dirac points of the emergent Majorana fermions from the original model are split into exceptional points with Fermi arcs connecting them. In glaring contrast to the original gapless phase of the honeycomb model that requires time-reversal symmetry, this new phase is stable against all perturbations. The system also displays a large sensitivity to boundary conditions resulting from the non-Hermitian skin effect with telltale experimental consequences. Our results point to the emergence of new classes of spin liquids in open systems that might be generically realized due to unavoidable couplings with the environment.},

However, conventional reconstruction methods, which recover forces from single-frequency motion of the cantilever at its resonance, exhibit non-negligible error and reconstruction instability in the highly nonlinear force regime when the tip oscillates with its amplitude comparable to the decay length of the interaction. Here, we develop a theoretical platform of DFM based on multiharmonic signal analysis for exact and robust reconstruction of conservative and dissipative forces, valid for all oscillation amplitudes and entire tip-sample distances in both amplitude- and frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy. We achieve accuracy improvement by an order of magnitude for oscillation amplitudes comparable to or larger than the decay length, and by 2 orders of magnitude for smaller amplitudes at the force minimum, even in cases where conventional methods show poor accuracy ( ≳ 5\% ). Moreover, we obtain greater robustness with respect to the oscillation amplitude error, resulting in a fivefold increase in reconstruction precision. Our results demonstrate a fast and versatile reconstruction scheme for nanomechanical force characterization, with higher harmonics measured with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, which provides unprecedented accuracy and stability beyond conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions are a central paradigm of modern condensed matter physics, describing low-energy excitations in graphene, in certain classes of superconductors, and on surfaces of 3D topological insulators. At zero energy E = 0 , Dirac fermions with mass m are band insulators, with the Chern number jumping by unity at m = 0 . This observation lead Ludwig et al. [ Phys. Rev. B 50 , 7526 (1994) ] to conjecture that the transition in 2D disordered Dirac fermions (DDF) and the integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) are controlled by the same fixed point and possess the same universal critical properties. Given the far-reaching implications for the emerging field of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, modern condensed matter physics, and our general understanding of disordered critical points, it is surprising that this conjecture has never been tested numerically. Here, we report the results of extensive numerics on the phase diagram and criticality of 2D DDF in the unitary class. We find a critical line at m = 0 , with an energy-dependent localization length exponent. At large energies, our results for the DDF are consistent with state-of-the-art numerical results ν IQH = 2.56 – 2.62 from models of the IQHT. At E = 0 , however, we obtain ν 0 = 2.30 – 2.36 incompatible with ν IQH . This result challenges conjectured relations between different models of the IQHT, and several interpretations are discussed.},

On the other hand, oscillations of the long-wavelength limit of the quadrupole mode, i.e., the spin-2 graviton, as well as the combination of two spin-1 states, can be activated by a sudden change of band mass anisotropy. We construct an effective field theory to describe the quench dynamics of these collective modes. In particular, we derive the dynamics for both the spin-2 and the spin-1 states and demonstrate their excellent agreement with numerics.},

We analyze charge transport in a QP within a model of electrons coupled to a soft transverse optical (TO) mode via a two-phonon mechanism. For T above the soft-mode frequency but below some characteristic scale ( E 0 ), the resistivity scales with the occupation number of phonons squared, i.e., as T 2 . The T 2 scattering rate does not depend on the carrier number density and is not affected by a crossover between degenerate and nondegenerate regimes, in agreement with the experiment. Temperatures higher than E 0 correspond to a nonquasiparticle regime, which we analyze by mapping the Dyson equation onto a problem of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

Our results show that the mechanochemical response can be decomposed into the contribution from the interface itself (deformation of interfacial bonds) and a contribution from the underlying solid. The relative contributions depend on the stiffness of these regions and the contact geometry, which affects the stress distribution within the bulk region. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is commonly assumed, the contribution to the activation volume from the elastic deformation of the surrounding bulk is significant and, in some case, may be dominant. We also show that the activation volume and the mechanochemical response of interfaces should be finite due to the effects on the stiffness and stress distribution within the near-surface bulk region. Our results indicate that the large range of activation volumes measured in the previous experiments even for the same material system might originate from the different degrees of contributions probed from the bulk vs interface.},

  abstract     = {Shock reverberation compression experiments on dense gaseous deuterium-helium mixtures are carried out to provide thermodynamic parameters relevant to the conditions in planetary interiors. The multishock pressures are determined up to 120 GPa and reshock temperatures to 7400 K. Furthermore, the unique compression path from shock-adiabatic to quasi-isentropic compressions enables a direct estimation of the high-pressure sound velocities in the unexplored range of 50–120 GPa. The equation of state and sound velocity provide particular dual perspectives to validate the theoretical models. Our experimental data are found to agree with several equation of state models widely used in astrophysics within the probed pressure range. The current data improve the experimental constraints on sound velocities in the Jovian insulating-to-metallic transition layer.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical treatments of frictional granular matter often assume that it is legitimate to invoke classical elastic theory to describe its coarse-grained mechanical properties. Here, we show, based on experiments and numerical simulations, that this is generically not the case since stress autocorrelation functions decay more slowly than what is expected from elasticity theory. It was theoretically shown that standard elastic decay demands pressure and torque density fluctuations to be normal, with possibly one of them being hyperuniform. However, generic compressed frictional assemblies exhibit abnormal pressure fluctuations, failing to conform with the central limit theorem. The physics of this failure is linked to correlations built in the material during compression from a dilute configuration prior to jamming. By changing the protocol of compression, one can observe different pressure fluctuations, and stress autocorrelations decay at large scales.},

In a codirectional coupling device, two waveguides are connected by a partially etched section that facilitates tunable coupling of the adjacent channels. This evanescent coupling of the two macroscopic wave functions in each waveguide reveals itself in real space oscillations of the condensate. This Josephson-like oscillation has only been observed in coupled polariton traps so far. Here, we report on a similar coupling behavior in a controllable, propagative waveguide-based design. By controlling the gap width, channel length, or propagation energy, the exit port of the polariton flow can be chosen. This codirectional polariton device is a passive and scalable coupler element that can serve in compact, next generation logic architectures.},

The speed of sound extracted from the dipole oscillation frequency is smaller than the Bogoliubov sound, which can be partly explained by the influence of the incoherent reservoir.

This is because magnetic transport actually relies on β ∥ − β ⊥ and α ⊥ − α ∥ , rather than α ⊥ and β ⊥ themselves. We provide fit functions that rectify this problem and thus resolve the discrepancies with kinetic simulations in the literature. When implemented in the g orgon code, they reduce the predicted density asymmetry amplitude at laser ablation fronts. Recognizing the importance of α ⊥ − α ∥ and β ∥ − β ⊥ , we recast the set of coefficients. This makes explicit the symmetry of the magnetic and thermal transport, as well as the symmetry of the coefficients themselves.},

Our results show that turbulence becomes an ineffective mixer when Sc is large. First, the mean scalar dissipation rate ⟨ χ ⟩ = 2 D ⟨ | ∇ θ | 2 ⟩ , when suitably nondimensionalized, decreases as 1 / log Sc . Second, 1D cuts through the scalar field indicate increasing density of sharp fronts on larger scales, oscillating with large excursions leading to reduced mixing, and additionally suggesting weakening of scalar variance flux across the scales. The scaling exponents of the scalar structure functions in the inertial-convective range appear to saturate with respect to the moment order and the saturation exponent approaches unity as Sc increases, qualitatively consistent with 1D cuts of the scalar.},

We identify soliton-lattice mode resonances resulting in input-independent energy transfer into desired metabeam vibration modes as long as transition waves are triggered within the metastructure. We observe both low-to-high and high-to-low incommensurate frequency interactions in the metabeams, thus enabling energy exchange between bands 2 orders of magnitude apart. This behavior generalizes fluxon-cavity mode resonance in superconducting electronics, providing a general method to extreme frequency conversion in mechanics. Importantly, the introduced architecture allows for expanding the metamaterials design paradigm by fundamentally breaking the dependence of macroscopic dynamics on the unit cell properties. The resulting input-independent nature implies potential applications in broadband frequency regulation and energy transduction.},

It was exposed during run 2 of the LHC program to 6.46 fb − 1 of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHCb interaction point. Evidence for dyons (particles with electric and magnetic charge) captured in the trapping detector was sought by passing the aluminum volumes comprising the detector through a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The presence of a trapped dyon would be signaled by a persistent current induced in the SQUID magnetometer. On the basis of a Drell-Yan production model, we exclude dyons with a magnetic charge ranging up to five Dirac charges ( 5 g D ) and an electric charge up to 200 times the fundamental electric charge for mass limits in the range 870–3120 GeV and also monopoles with magnetic charge up to and including 5 g D with mass limits in the range 870–2040 GeV.},

As the stochastic GWs experience the whole history of cosmic expansion, they encode potential observational evidence of such variation. We report that, one feature of a varying GWs speed is that the energy spectrum of GWs will present resonantly enhanced peaks if the GWs speed oscillates in time at high-energy scales. Such oscillatory behavior arises in a wide class of modified gravity theories. The amplitude of these peaks can be at reach by current and forthcoming GWs instruments, hence making the underlying theories falsifiable. This mechanism reveals that probing the variation of GWs speed can be a promising way to search for new physics beyond general relativity.},

Specifically we compare a cryogenic sapphire oscillator (CSO), hydrogen maser (HM) atomic oscillator, and a bulk acoustic wave quartz oscillator (OCXO). This work includes the first calculation of the dependence of acoustic oscillators on variations of the fundamental constants, and demonstration that they can be a sensitive tool for scalar DM experiments. Results are presented based on 16 days of data in comparisons between the HM and OCXO, and 2 days of comparison between the OCXO and CSO. No evidence of oscillating fundamental constants consistent with a coupling to scalar dark matter is found, and instead limits on the strength of these couplings as a function of the dark matter mass are determined. We constrain the dimensionless coupling constant d e de and combination | d m e − d g | |dme−dg| across the mass band 4.4 × 10 − 19 ≲ m φ ≲ 6.8 × 10 − 14 eV c − 2 4.4×10−19≲mφ≲6.8×10−14  eV c−2 , with most sensitive limits d e ≳ 1.59 × 10 − 1 de≳1.59×10−1 , | d m e − d g | ≳ 6.97 × 10 − 1 |dme−dg|≳6.97×10−1 . Notably, these limits do not rely on maximum reach analysis (MRA), instead employing the more general coefficient separation technique. This experiment paves the way for future, highly sensitive experiments based on state-of-the-art acoustic oscillators, and we show that these limits can be competitive with the best current MRA-based exclusion limits.},

We argue that a unique signature of such “transmuted” solar-mass BHs is that their mass distribution would follow that of the NSs. This would be distinct from the mass function of black holes in the solar-mass range predicted either by conventional stellar evolution or early Universe PBH production. We propose that analysis of the solar-mass BH population mass distribution in a narrow mass window of ∼ 1 – 2.5 M ⊙ can provide a simple yet powerful test of the origin of these BHs. Recent LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave (GW) observations of the binary merger events GW190425 and GW190814 are consistent with a BH mass in the range ∼ 1.5 – 2.6 M ⊙ . Though these results have fueled speculation on dark matter-transmuted solar-mass BHs, we demonstrate that it is unlikely that the origin of these particular events stems from NS implosions. Data from upcoming GW observations will be able to distinguish between solar-mass BHs and NSs with high confidence. This capability will facilitate and enhance the efficacy of our proposed test.},

  abstract     = {The Heisenberg scaling, which scales as N − 1 in terms of the number of particles or T − 1 in terms of the evolution time, serves as a fundamental limit in quantum metrology. Better scalings, dubbed as “super-Heisenberg scaling,” however, can also arise when the generator of the parameter involves many-body interactions or when it is time dependent. All these different scalings can actually be seen as manifestations of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. While there is only one best scaling in the single-parameter quantum metrology, different scalings can coexist for the estimation of multiple parameters, which can be characterized by multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations. We demonstrate the coexistence of two different scalings via the simultaneous estimation of the magnitude and frequency of a field where the best precisions, characterized by two Heisenberg uncertainty relations, scale as T − 1 and T − 2 , respectively (in terms of the standard deviation). We show that the simultaneous saturation of two Heisenberg uncertainty relations can be achieved by the optimal protocol, which prepares the optimal probe state, implements the optimal control, and performs the optimal measurement. The optimal protocol is experimentally implemented on an optical platform that demonstrates the saturation of the two Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously, with up to five controls. As the first demonstration of simultaneously achieving two different Heisenberg scalings, our study deepens the understanding on the connection between the precision limit and the uncertainty relations, which has wide implications in practical applications of multiparameter quantum estimation.},

Singular value decomposition based compression together with a two-sided circuit evolution algorithm are used to further compress the resulting tensor network. To further accelerate the simulation, we also propose a heuristic algorithm to compute the optimal tensor contraction path. We demonstrate that our algorithm is up to 2 orders of magnitudes faster than the Schrödinger-Feynman algorithm for verifying random quantum circuits on the 53-qubit Sycamore processor, with circuit depths below 12.

  abstract     = {We develop a coherent beam splitter for single electrons driven through two tunnel-coupled quantum wires by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The output current through each wire oscillates with gate voltages to tune the tunnel coupling and potential difference between the wires. This oscillation is assigned to coherent electron tunneling motion that can be used to encode a flying qubit and is well reproduced by numerical calculations of time evolution of the SAW-driven single electrons. The oscillation visibility is currently limited to about 3\%, but robust against decoherence, indicating that the SAW electron can serve as a novel platform for a solid-state flying qubit.},

  abstract     = {We have recently shown how a polarized beam in Talbot-Lau interferometric imaging can be used to analyze strong magnetic fields through the spin dependent differential phase effect at field gradients. While in that case an adiabatic spin coupling with the sample field is required, here we investigate a nonadiabatic coupling causing a spatial splitting of the neutron spin states with respect to the external magnetic field. This subsequently leads to no phase contrast signal but a loss of interferometer visibility referred to as dark-field contrast. We demonstrate how the implementation of spin analysis to the Talbot-Lau interferometer setup enables one to recover the differential phase induced to a single spin state. Thus, we show that the dark-field contrast is a measure of the quantum mechanical spin split analogous to the Stern-Gerlach experiment without, however, spatial beam separation. In addition, the spin analyzed dark-field contrast imaging introduced here bears the potential to probe polarization dependent small-angle scattering and thus magnetic microstructures.},

The key parameter for determining the Zeeman splitting, namely, the separate contribution of the electron and hole g factor, is inaccessible in most measurements. Here we present an original method that gives access to the respective contribution of the conduction and valence band to the measured Zeeman splitting. It exploits the optical selection rules of exciton complexes, in particular the ones involving intervalley phonons, avoiding strong renormalization effects that compromise single particle g -factor determination in transport experiments. These studies yield a direct determination of single band g factors. We measure g c 1 = 0.86 ± 0.1 , g c 2 = 3.84 ± 0.1 for the bottom (top) conduction bands and g v = 6.1 ± 0.1 for the valence band of monolayer WSe 2 . These measurements are helpful for quantitative interpretation of optical and transport measurements performed in magnetic fields. In addition, the measured g factors are valuable input parameters for optimizing band structure calculations of these 2D materials.},

Owing to the existence of hidden antiunitary symmetry, which we call the effective time-reversal symmetry (eTRS), the Fermi surfaces of ordinary antiferromagnetic metals are generally spin degenerate, and spin-singlet pairing is favored. However, by introducing a local inversion symmetry breaking perturbation that also breaks the eTRS, we can lift the degeneracy to obtain spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. In the weak-coupling limit, the spin-polarized Fermi surfaces constrain the electrons to form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with odd parity. Interestingly, all the odd-parity superconducting ground states we obtained host nontrivial band topologies manifested as chiral topological superconductors, second-order topological superconductors, and nodal superconductors. We propose that double perovskite oxides with collinear antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic ordering, such as SrLaVMoO 6 , are promising candidate systems where our theoretical ideas can be applied to.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional (2D) twisted bilayer materials with van der Waals coupling have ignited great research interests, paving a new way to explore the emergent quantum phenomena by twist degree of freedom. Generally, with the decreasing of twist angle, the enhanced interlayer coupling will gradually flatten the low-energy bands and isolate them by two high-energy gaps at zero and full filling, respectively. Although the correlation and topological physics in the low-energy flat bands have been intensively studied, little information is available for these two emerging gaps. In this Letter, we predict a 2D second-order topological insulator (SOTI) for twisted bilayer graphene and twisted bilayer boron nitride in both zero and full filling gaps. Employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian based on first-principles calculations, three unique fingerprints of 2D SOTI are identified, that is, nonzero bulk topological index, gapped topological edge state, and in-gap topological corner state. Most remarkably, the 2D SOTI exists in a wide range of commensurate twist angles, which is robust to microscopic structure disorder and twist center, greatly facilitating the possible experimental measurement. Our results not only extend the higher-order band topology to massless and massive twisted moiré superlattice, but also demonstrate the importance of high-energy bands for fully understanding the nontrivial electronics.},

  abstract     = {We present a study on the phase stability of dense carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) at extreme pressure-temperature conditions, up to 6200 K within the pressure range 37 ± 9 to 106 ± 17 GPa . The investigations of high-pressure high-temperature in situ x-ray diffraction patterns recorded from laser-heated CO 2 , as densified in diamond-anvil cells, consistently reproduced the exclusive formation of polymeric tetragonal CO 2 -V at any condition achieved in repetitive laser-heating cycles. Using well-considered experimental arrangements, which prevent reactions with metal components of the pressure cells, annealing through laser heating was extended individually up to approximately 40 min per cycle in order to keep track of upcoming instabilities and changes with time. The results clearly exclude any decomposition of CO 2 -V into the elements as previously suggested. Alterations of the Bragg peak distribution on Debye-Scherrer rings indicate grain coarsening at temperatures &gt; 4000 K , giving a glimpse of the possible extension of the stability of the polymeric solid phase.},

We develop a method to evaluate exactly the spectral function for a gas of one-dimensional bosons with infinitely strong repulsions valid for any type of external confinement. Focusing on the case of a lattice confinement, we find that the spectral function displays three main singularity lines. One of them is due uniquely to lattice effects, while the two others correspond to the Lieb-I and Lieb-II modes occurring in a uniform fluid. Differently from the dynamical structure factor, in the spectral function the Lieb-II mode shows a divergence, thus providing a route to probe such mode in experiments with ultracold atoms.},

  abstract     = {Sources of high-energy photons have important applications in almost all areas of research. However, the photon flux and intensity of existing sources is strongly limited for photon energies above a few hundred keV. Here we show that a high-current ultrarelativistic electron beam interacting with multiple submicrometer-thick conducting foils can undergo strong self-focusing accompanied by efficient emission of gamma-ray synchrotron photons. Physically, self-focusing and high-energy photon emission originate from the beam interaction with the near-field transition radiation accompanying the beam-foil collision. This near field radiation is of amplitude comparable with the beam self-field, and can be strong enough that a single emitted photon can carry away a significant fraction of the emitting electron energy. After beam collision with multiple foils, femtosecond collimated electron and photon beams with number density exceeding that of a solid are obtained. The relative simplicity, unique properties, and high efficiency of this gamma-ray source open up new opportunities for both applied and fundamental research including laserless investigations of strong-field QED processes with a single electron beam.},

In this Letter the dynamics of metastable oil-water emulsions in highly turbulent ( 10 11 ≤ Ta ≤ 3 × 10 13 ) Taylor-Couette flow, far from equilibrium, is investigated. By varying the oil-in-water void fraction, catastrophic phase inversion between oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions can be triggered, changing the morphology, including droplet sizes, and rheological properties of the mixture, dramatically. The manifestation of these different states is exemplified by combining global torque measurements and local in situ laser induced fluorescence microscopy imaging. Despite the turbulent state of the flow and the dynamic equilibrium of the oil-water mixture, the global torque response of the system is found to be as if the fluid were Newtonian, and the effective viscosity of the mixture was found to be several times bigger or smaller than either of its constituents.},

These patterns are inherently synchronized multifrequency combs. Under proper conditions, the axially localized nature of the patterns leads to a fundamental drift instability that induces transitions among patterns with a different number of rows. Self-replications, thus, result in the stepwise addition or removal of individual combs along the cylinder’s axis. Transitions occur in a fully reversible and, consequently, deterministic way. The phenomenon puts forward a novel paradigm for Kerr frequency comb formation and reveals important insights into the physics of multidimensional nonlinear patterns.},

Also, we demonstrate a low-noise microwave signal with phase noise of − 49 dBc / Hz at 10 Hz, − 130 dBc / Hz at 10 kHz, and − 149 dBc / Hz at 1 MHz offsets for a 10.43 GHz carrier with only a free-running input pump.

The accelerated atom becomes excited by emitting an Unruh-Minkowski photon which has negative frequency in the atom’s frame, and decays by emitting a positive-frequency photon. This leads to interesting effects. For example, the photon emitted by accelerated ground-state atom cannot be absorbed by another ground-state atom accelerating in the same direction, but it can be absorbed by an excited atom or a ground-state atom accelerated in the opposite direction. We also show that similar effects take place for Cherenkov radiation.

The picture accommodates waveguide-QED phenomena where atoms behave as perfect mirrors, connecting in particular dressed bound states (BSs) in the continuum with geometrically confined photonic modes. When applied to photonic lattices, the framework establishes a one-to-one correspondence between topologically robust dressed states and topologically robust photonic BSs seeded by a vacancy. This is used to predict new classes of dressed BSs in the photonic Creutz-ladder and Haldane models. In the latter case, states with nonzero local photon flux occur in which an atom is dressed by a photon orbiting around it.},

Outside this regime, the nonlinearity of the spectrum leads to irreversibility, characterized by a universal behavior.

  abstract     = {Simulating quantum field theories is a flagship application of quantum computing. However, calculating experimentally relevant high energy scattering amplitudes entirely on a quantum computer is prohibitively difficult. It is well known that such high energy scattering processes can be factored into pieces that can be computed using well established perturbative techniques, and pieces which currently have to be simulated using classical Markov chain algorithms. These classical Markov chain simulation approaches work well to capture many of the salient features, but cannot capture all quantum effects. To exploit quantum resources in the most efficient way, we introduce a new paradigm for quantum algorithms in field theories. This approach uses quantum computers only for those parts of the problem which are not computable using existing techniques. In particular, we develop a polynomial time quantum final state shower that accurately models the effects of intermediate spin states similar to those present in high energy electroweak showers with a global evolution variable. The algorithm is explicitly demonstrated for a simplified quantum field theory on a quantum computer.},

We show that transverse relaxation determines the epoch of this irreversible depolarization.

The cavity meanwhile provides access to quantum-limited displacement measurements. For a centimeter-scale membrane precooled to 10 mK, we argue that sensitivity to vector B − L dark matter can exceed that of the Eöt-Wash experiment in integration times of minutes, over a fractional bandwidth of ∼ 0.1\% near 10 kHz (corresponding to a particle mass of 10 − 10 eV / c 2 ).

With this dataset, the form of the prior distribution still has an impact on the posterior mass-radius curves and equation of state (EOS), but this impact is smaller than recently obtained when considering QLMXBs alone.

These results demonstrate the validity of multiparameter universality for confined anisotropic systems and the nonuniversality of the critical Casimir amplitude. We find an unexpected complex form of self-similarity of the anisotropy effects near the instability where weak anisotropy breaks down. This can be traced back to the property of modular invariance of isotropic conformal field theory for d = 2 . More generally, for d &gt; 2 we predict the existence of self-similar structures of the finite-size scaling functions of O ( n ) -symmetric systems with planar anisotropies and periodic boundary conditions both in the critical region for n ≥ 1 as well as in the Goldstone-dominated low-temperature region for n ≥ 2 .},

In spite of this, approximate cloning with imperfect fidelity is possible, which opens up the field of quantum cloning. In general, quantum cloning can be divided into discrete variable and continuous variable (CV) categories. In the CV regime, all-optical implementation of the optimal N → M quantum cloning has been proposed in two original parallel works, which involves a parametric amplifier and a set of beam splitters and thus avoids the optic-electro and electro-optic conversions in the current CV quantum cloning technologies. However, such original proposal of all-optical CV optimal N → M quantum cloning scheme has never been experimentally implemented. Here, we show that optimal N → M quantum cloning of coherent states can be realized by utilizing a parametric amplifier based on four-wave mixing process in a hot atomic vapor and a set of beam splitters. In particular, we realize 1 → M , 2 → M , and 4 → M quantum cloning. We find that the fidelity of N → M quantum cloning increases with the decrease of clone number M and the increase of original replica number N . The best cloning fidelity achieved in our experiment is about 93.3\% ± 1.0\% in the 4 → 5 case.

We show that quantum communication and entanglement-assisted communication without a phase reference are possible, when a short-time memory effect is present. The degradation in the communication rate of classical or quantum information transmission decreases inversely with the correlation time. Exact solutions of the quantum capacity and entanglement-assisted classical and quantum capacity for pure dephasing channels are derived, where non-Gaussian multipartite-entangled states show strict advantages over usual Gaussian sources. For thermal-loss dephasing channels, lower bounds of the capacities are derived. The lower bounds also extend to scenarios with fading effects in the channel. In addition, for entanglement-assisted communication, the lower bounds can be achieved by a simple phase-encoding scheme on two-mode squeezed vacuum sources, when the noise is large.},

A major hurdle toward experimentally realizing this physics is the need to apply postselection on random measurement outcomes in order to repeatedly prepare a given output state, resulting in an exponential overhead. We propose a method to sidestep this issue in a wide class of nonunitary circuits by taking advantage of spacetime duality . This method maps the purification dynamics of a mixed state under nonunitary evolution onto a particular correlation function in an associated unitary circuit. This translates to an operational protocol which could be straightforwardly implemented on a digital quantum simulator. We discuss the signatures of different entanglement phases, and demonstrate examples via numerical simulations. With minor modifications, the proposed protocol allows measurement of the purity of arbitrary subsystems, which could shed light on the properties of the quantum error correcting code formed by the mixed phase in this class of hybrid dynamics.},

We develop a universal theoretical model that explains this fundamentally nonlinear damping as a process whereby two quanta of the gapped lowest excitation mode couple to a higher-energy mode, which subsequently decays into a continuum. We find quantitative agreement between our experiments and the predictions of this model.

  abstract     = {An energy gap develops near quantum critical point of quantum phase transition in a finite many-body (MB) system, facilitating the ground state transformation by adiabatic parameter change. In real application scenarios, however, the efficacy for such a protocol is compromised by the need to balance finite system lifetime with adiabaticity, as exemplified in a recent experiment that prepares three-mode balanced Dicke state near deterministically [Y.-Q. Zou et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 115 , 6381 (2018) ]. Instead of tracking the instantaneous ground state as unanimously required for most adiabatic crossing, this work reports a faster sweeping policy taking advantage of excited level dynamics. It is obtained based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) from a multistep training scheme we develop. In the absence of loss, a fidelity ≥ 99\% between prepared and the target Dicke state is achieved over a small fraction of the adiabatically required time. When loss is included, training is carried out according to an operational benchmark, the interferometric sensitivity of the prepared state instead of fidelity, leading to better sensitivity in about half of the previously reported time. Implemented in a Bose-Einstein condensate of ∼ 10 4 Rb 87 atoms, the balanced three-mode Dicke state exhibiting an improved number squeezing of 13.02 ± 0.20 dB is observed within 766 ms, highlighting the potential of DRL for quantum dynamics control and quantum state preparation in interacting MB systems.},

We present an analytical model that shows how strong stochastic forcing drives the long tail of the distribution, gives rise to rare events of reaching a threshold stretch, and constitutes a framework within which nucleation rates of flow-induced crystallization may be understood in systems of associating polymers under flow.

  abstract     = {Zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) can manifest a number of notable physical phenomena and thus provide critical characteristics to the underlying electronic systems. Here, we report observations of pronounced ZBCPs in hybrid junctions composed of an oxide heterostructure LaAlO 3 / SrTiO 3 and an elemental superconductor Nb, where the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at the LaAlO 3 / SrTiO 3 interface is known to accommodate gate-tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Remarkably, the ZBCPs exhibit a domelike dependence on the gate voltage, which correlates strongly with the nonmonotonic gate dependence of the Rashba SOC in the 2DES. The origin of the observed ZBCPs can be attributed to the reflectionless tunneling effect of electrons that undergo phase-coherent multiple Andreev reflection, and their gate dependence can be explained by the enhanced quantum coherence time of electrons in the 2DES with increased momentum separation due to SOC. We further demonstrate theoretically that, in the presence of a substantial proximity effect, the Rashba SOC can directly enhance the overall Andreev conductance in the 2DES-barrier-superconductor junctions. These findings not only highlight nontrivial interplay between electron spin and superconductivity revealed by ZBCPs, but also set forward the study of superconducting hybrid structures by means of controllable SOC, which has significant implications in various research fronts from superconducting spintronics to topological superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs), which consist of two metal electrodes separated by a thin ferroelectric barrier, have recently aroused significant interest for technological applications as nanoscale resistive switching devices. So far, most existing FTJs have been based on perovskite-oxide barrier layers. The recent discovery of the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals ferroelectric materials opens a new route to realize tunnel junctions with new functionalities and nm-scale dimensions. Because of the weak coupling between the atomic layers in these materials, the relative dipole alignment between them can be controlled by applied voltage. This allows transitions between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orderings, resulting in significant changes of the electronic structure. Here, we propose to realize 2D antiferroelectric tunnel junctions (AFTJs), which exploit this new functionality, based on bilayer In 2 X 3 ( X = S , Se, Te) barriers and different 2D electrodes. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the In 2 X 3 bilayers exhibit stable ferroelectric and antiferroelectric states separated by sizable energy barriers, thus supporting a nonvolatile switching between these states. Using quantum-mechanical modeling of the electronic transport, we explore in-plane and out-of-plane tunneling across the In 2 S 3 van der Waals bilayers, and predict giant tunneling electroresistance effects and multiple nonvolatile resistance states driven by ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order transitions. Our proposal opens a new route to realize nanoscale memory devices with ultrahigh storage density using 2D AFTJs.},

The STC is realized by strong homogeneous microwave pumping of a micron-sized permalloy (Py) stripe and is directly imaged by scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM). For a fundamental understanding of the formation of the STC, micromagnetic simulations are carefully adapted to model the experimental findings. Beyond the mere generation of a STC, we observe the formation of a magnonic band structure due to back folding of modes at the STC’s Brillouin zone boundaries. We show interactions of magnons with the STC that appear as lattice scattering, which results in the generation of ultrashort spin waves (SW) down to 100-nm wavelengths that cannot be described by classical dispersion relations for linear SW excitation. We expect that room-temperature STCs will be useful to investigate nonlinear wave physics, as they can be easily generated and manipulated to control their spatial and temporal band structures.},

  abstract     = {It has been recently shown that monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the 2H structural phase exhibit relatively large orbital Hall conductivity plateaus within their energy band gaps, where their spin Hall conductivities vanish [Canonico et al. , Phys. Rev. B 101 , 161409 (2020) ; Bhowal and Satpathy, Phys. Rev. B 102 , 035409 (2020) ]. However, since the valley Hall effect (VHE) in these systems also generates a transverse flow of orbital angular momentum, it becomes experimentally challenging to distinguish between the two effects in these materials. The VHE requires inversion symmetry breaking to occur, which takes place in the TMD monolayers but not in the bilayers. We show that a bilayer of 2 H − MoS 2 is an orbital Hall insulator that exhibits a sizeable orbital Hall effect in the absence of both spin and valley Hall effects. This phase can be characterized by an orbital Chern number that assumes the value C L = 2 for the 2 H − MoS 2 bilayer and C L = 1 for the monolayer, confirming the topological nature of these orbital-Hall insulator systems. Our results are based on density functional theory and low-energy effective model calculations and strongly suggest that bilayers of TMDs are highly suitable platforms for direct observation of the orbital Hall insulating phase in two-dimensional materials. Implications of our findings for attempts to observe the VHE in TMD bilayers are also discussed.},

The sharpness of our identification even pinpoints an alternative criterion to determine the Kondo temperature of strongly correlated systems on the two-particle level, which only requires calculations at the lowest Matsubara frequency. We showcase its strength by applying it to the single impurity and the periodic Anderson model as well as to the Hubbard model. Our results represent a significant progress for the general understanding of quantum field theory at the two-particle level and allow for tracing the limits of the physics captured by perturbative approaches for correlated systems.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of finite temperature quantum systems provide imaginary frequency Green’s functions that correspond one to one to experimentally measurable real-frequency spectral functions. However, due to the bad conditioning of the continuation transform from imaginary to real frequencies, established methods tend to either wash out spectral features at high frequencies or produce spectral functions with unphysical negative parts. Here, we show that explicitly respecting the analytic “Nevanlinna” structure of the Green’s function leads to intrinsically positive and normalized spectral functions, and we present a continued fraction expansion that yields all possible functions consistent with the analytic structure. Application to synthetic trial data shows that sharp, smooth, and multipeak data is resolved accurately. Application to the band structure of silicon demonstrates that high energy features are resolved precisely. Continuations in a realistic correlated setup reveal additional features that were previously unresolved. By substantially increasing the resolution of real frequency calculations our work overcomes one of the main limitations of finite-temperature quantum simulations.},

We consider two configurations of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) that have very similar band structures, but show different valley Chern numbers of the flat bands. These differences between the A B − A B and A B − B A configurations of TDBG clearly manifest as different Landau level sequences in the Hofstadter butterfly spectra calculated using the tight-binding model. The Landau level sequences are explained from the point of view of the distribution of orbital magnetization in momentum space that is governed by the rotational C 2 and time-reversal T symmetries. Our results can be readily extended to other twisted graphene multilayers and h − BN /graphene heterostructures thus establishing the Hofstadter butterfly spectra as a powerful tool for detecting the nontrivial valley band topology.},

As the superfluid critical temperature is crossed from below, we observe the evolution from a highly nonlinear to an Ohmic conduction characteristic, associated with the critical breakdown of the Josephson dc current induced by pair condensate depletion. Moreover, we reveal a large and dominant anomalous contribution to resistive currents, which reaches its maximum at the lowest attained temperature, fostered by the tunnel coupling between the condensate and phononic Bogoliubov-Anderson excitations. Increasing the temperature, while the zeroing of supercurrents marks the transition to the normal phase, the conductance drops considerably but remains much larger than that of a normal, uncorrelated Fermi gas tunneling through the same junction. We attribute such enhanced transport to incoherent tunneling of sound modes, which remain weakly damped in the collisional hydrodynamic fluid of unpaired fermions at unitarity.},

In this Letter, we show how such a spin-polarized relativistic beam can be produced by ionization injection of electrons of certain atoms with a circularly polarized laser field into a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator, providing a much desired one-step solution to this challenge. Using time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) simulations, we show the propensity rule of spin-dependent ionization of xenon atoms can be reversed in the strong-field multiphoton regime compared with the non-adiabatic tunneling regime, leading to high total spin polarization. Furthermore, three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are incorporated with TDSE simulations, providing start-to-end simulations of spin-dependent strong-field ionization of xenon atoms and subsequent trapping, acceleration, and preservation of electron spin polarization in lithium plasma. We show the generation of a high-current (0.8 kA), ultralow-normalized-emittance ( ∼ 37 nm ), and high-energy (2.7 GeV) electron beam within just 11 cm distance, with up to ∼ 31\% net spin polarization. Higher current, energy, and net spin-polarization beams are possible by optimizing this concept, thus solving a long-standing problem facing the development of plasma accelerators.},

Here, we show that this magnetic nondipole effect is not the only nondipole effect in strong-field ionization. We find that an electric nondipole effect arises that is due to the position dependence of the electric field and which can be understood in analogy to the Doppler effect. This electric nondipole effect manifests as an increase of the radius of the donut-shaped photoelectron momentum distribution for forward-directed momenta and as a decrease of this radius for backwards-directed electrons. We present experimental data showing this fingerprint of the electric nondipole effect and compare our findings with a classical model and quantum calculations.},

While NO ν A prefers values close to δ CP ∼ 0.8 π , T2K identifies values of δ CP ∼ 1.4 π . Such two estimates are in disagreement at more than 90\% C.L. for 2 degrees of freedom. We show that such a tension can be resolved if one hypothesizes the existence of complex neutral-current nonstandard interactions (NSIs) of the flavor changing type involving the e − μ or the e − τ sectors with couplings | ϵ e μ | ∼ | ϵ e τ | ∼ 0.2 . Remarkably, in the presence of such NSIs, both experiments point towards the same common value of the standard C P phase δ CP ∼ 3 π / 2 . Our analysis also highlights an intriguing preference for maximal C P violation in the nonstandard sector with the NSI C P phases having best fit close to ϕ e μ ∼ ϕ e τ ∼ 3 π / 2 , hence pointing towards imaginary NSI couplings.},

Numerous such bounds have been proposed, either for classes of theories or (by using general arguments) universally for all theories. Few are exact and inviolable. I present a new set of methods and sufficient conditions for deriving exact, rigorous, and sharp bounds on all coefficients of hydrodynamic dispersion relations, including diffusivity and the speed of sound. These general techniques combine analytic properties of hydrodynamics and the theory of univalent (complex holomorphic and injective) functions. Particular attention is devoted to bounds relating transport to quantum chaos, which can be established through pole-skipping in theories with holographic duals. Examples of such bounds are shown along with holographic theories that can demonstrate the validity of the conditions involved. I also discuss potential applications of univalence methods to bounds without relation to chaos, such as for example the conformal bound on the speed of sound.},

  abstract     = {The LIGO/Virgo Collaboration has by now observed or constrained the gravitational merger rates of different classes of compact objects. We consider the possibility that the bulk of these mergers are primordial black hole (PBH) mergers of PBHs formed during the QCD epoch making up the entirety of the dark matter. Having shown in a companion paper that mergers due to the initial binary population formed in the early Universe are likely negligible, we compute current merger rates in PBH clusters in which the typical PBH resides. We consider two scenarios: (i) the PBH mass function dictated by the QCD equation of state and (ii) the PBH mass function dictated by the existence of a peak in the inflationary perturbation spectrum. In the first scenario, which is essentially parameter-free, we reproduce very well the merger rates for heavy BHs, the merger rate of mass-asymmetric BHs such as GW190814, a recently discovered merger of a 23 M ⊙ black hole with a 2.6 M ⊙ object, and can naturally explain why LIGO/Virgo has not yet observed mergers of two light PBHs from the dominant ∼ 1 M ⊙ PBH population. In the second scenario, which has some parameter freedom, we match well the observed rate of heavy PBHs but can currently not explain the rate for mass-asymmetric events. In either case, it is tantalizing that in both scenarios PBH merger rates made with a minimum of assumptions match most LIGO/Virgo observed rates very well.},

In ultralight oscillating dark matter (DM) models, such an experiment is sensitive to coupling of DM to the standard model fields, through oscillations of the cavity and fiber lengths and of the fiber refractive index. Additionally, the sensitivity is significantly enhanced around the mechanical resonances of the cavity. We present experimental results of such an experiment and report no evidence of DM for masses in the [ 4.1 × 10 − 11 , 8.3 × 10 − 10 ] eV region. In addition, we improve constraints on the involved coupling constants by one order of magnitude in a standard galactic DM model, at the mass corresponding to the resonant frequency of our cavity. Furthermore, in the model of relaxion DM, we improve on existing constraints over the whole DM mass range by about one order of magnitude, and up to 6 orders of magnitude at resonance.},

Of these, the extreme-mass-ratio inspirals of compact objects into massive black holes are the only sources that combine the challenges of strong-field complexity with that of long-lived signals. Such signals are found and characterized by comparing them against a large number of accurate waveform templates during data analysis, but the rapid generation of templates is hindered by computing the ∼ 10 3 – 10 5 harmonic modes in a fully relativistic waveform. We use order-reduction and deep-learning techniques to derive a global fit for the ≈ 4000 modes in the special case of an eccentric Schwarzschild orbit, and implement the fit in a complete waveform framework with hardware acceleration. Our high-fidelity waveforms can be generated in under 1 s, and achieve a mismatch of ≲ 5 × 10 − 4 against reference waveforms that take ≳ 10 4 times longer. This marks the first time that analysis-length waveforms with full harmonic content can be produced on timescales useful for direct implementation in LISA analysis algorithms.},

Similarly, many gain-dissipative systems that can be manipulated by optical means can bring about the ground state of the k -local Hamiltonians and solve higher-order binary optimization problems. We show how to facilitate the search for the global solution by invoking complex couplings in the system and demonstrate the efficiency of the method on the sets of complex problems.

Paradigmatic examples include several fractional quantum Hall phases, which are expected to be realized in different atomic and photonic quantum platforms in the near future. Experimental measurement and numerical computation of this invariant are conventionally based on the linear-response techniques that require having access to a family of states, as a function of an external parameter, which is not suitable for many quantum simulators. Here, we propose an ancilla-free experimental scheme for the measurement of this invariant, without requiring any knowledge of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we use the statistical correlations of randomized measurements to infer the MBCN of a wave function. Remarkably, our results apply to disklike geometries that are more amenable to current quantum simulator architectures.},

We introduce an update strategy that enables plaquette terms and Gauss-law constraints to be applied as sequences of two-body operators. This allows the use of the most up-to-date iPEPS algorithms. From the calculation of spatial Wilson loops we are able to prove the existence of a confined phase. We show that with relatively low computational cost it is possible to reproduce crucial features of gauge theories. We expect that the strategy allows the extension of iPEPS studies to more general LGTs.},

Here, we introduce a topological earth mover’s (TEM) distance between disordered structures that compares local graph neighborhoods of the microscopic cell-centroid networks. Leveraging structural information contained in the neighborhood motif distributions, the TEM metric allows an interpretable reconstruction of equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase spaces and embedded pathways from static system snapshots alone. Applied to cell-resolution imaging data, the framework recovers time ordering without prior knowledge about the underlying dynamics, revealing that fly wing development solves a topological optimal transport problem. Extending our topological analysis to bacterial swarms, we find a universal neighborhood size distribution consistent with a Tracy-Widom law.},

The replica theory for glasses and jamming is a mean-field theory which attempts to do so by working in the limit of infinite dimensions, such that correlations between neighbors are negligible. As such, results from this mean-field theory are not guaranteed to be observed in finite dimensions. However, many results in mean field for jamming have been shown to be exact or nearly exact in low dimensions. This suggests that the infinite dimensional limit is not necessary to obtain these results. In this Letter, we perform precision measurements of jamming scaling relationships between pressure, excess packing fraction, and number of excess contacts from dimensions 2–10 in order to extract the prefactors to these scalings. While these prefactors should be highly sensitive to finite dimensional corrections, we find the mean-field predictions for these prefactors to be exact in low dimensions. Thus the mean-field approximation is not necessary for deriving these prefactors. We present an exact, first-principles derivation for one, leaving the other as an open question. Our results suggest that mean-field theories of critical phenomena may compute more for d ≥ d u than has been previously appreciated.},

In the regime of reentrant superconductivity associated with the destructive Little-Parks effect, numerous coherent transitions are observed in the first reentrant lobe, where the shell carries 2 π winding of superconducting phase, and are absent in the zeroth lobe. As junction density was increased by gate voltage, qubit coherence was suppressed then lost in the first lobe. These observations and numerical simulations highlight the role of winding-induced Andreev states in the junction.},

  abstract     = {Strain-mediated interaction between phonons and telecom photons is demonstrated using excited states of erbium ions embedded in a mechanical resonator. Owing to the extremely long-lived nature of rare-earth ions, the dissipation rate of the optical resonance falls below that of the mechanical one. Thus, a “reversed dissipation regime” is achieved in the optical frequency region. We experimentally demonstrate an optomechanical coupling rate g 0 = 2 π × 21.7 Hz , and numerically reveal that the interaction causes stimulated excitation of erbium ions. Numerical analyses further indicate the possibility of g 0 exceeding the dissipation rates of erbium and mechanical systems, thereby leading to single-photon strong coupling. This strain-mediated interaction, moreover, involves the spin degree of freedom, and has a potential to be extended to highly coherent opto-electro-mechanical hybrid systems in the reversed dissipation regime.},

The promise of dichromatic excitation is to spectrally isolate the excitation laser from the quantum emission, enabling background-free photon extraction from the emitter. While excitation is not possible without spectral overlap between the exciting pulse and the quantum emitter transition for ideal two-level systems due to cancellation of the accumulated pulse area, we find that any additional interactions that interfere with cancellation of the accumulated pulse area may lead to a finite stationary population inversion. Our spectroscopic results of a solid-state two-level system show that, while coupling to lattice vibrations helps to improve the inversion efficiency up to 50\% under symmetric driving, coherent population control and a larger amount of inversion are possible using asymmetric dichromatic excitation, which we achieve by adjusting the ratio of the intensities between the red- and blue-detuned pulses. Our measured results, supported by simulations using a real-time path-integral method, offer a new perspective toward realizing efficient, background-free photon generation and extraction.},

Here, we demonstrate that a nonradiative plasmon mode drives the transfer from two-photon-excited excitons to trap states. In plasmonic cavities, trap emission dominates while the band-edge recombination is completely suppressed. The induced pathways for excitonic recombination not only shed light on the fundamental interactions of excitonic spins, but also open new avenues in manipulating QD emission, for optoelectronics and nanophotonics applications.},

  abstract     = {In van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures formed by stacking two monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, multiple exciton resonances with highly tunable properties are formed and subject to both vertical and lateral confinement. We investigate how a unique control knob, the twist angle between the two monolayers, can be used to control the exciton dynamics. We observe that the interlayer exciton lifetimes in MoSe 2 / WSe 2 twisted bilayers (TBLs) change by one order of magnitude when the twist angle is varied from 1° to 3.5°. Using a low-energy continuum model, we theoretically separate two leading mechanisms that influence interlayer exciton radiative lifetimes. The shift to indirect transitions in the momentum space with an increasing twist angle and the energy modulation from the moiré potential both have a significant impact on interlayer exciton lifetimes. We further predict distinct temperature dependence of interlayer exciton lifetimes in TBLs with different twist angles, which is partially validated by experiments. While many recent studies have highlighted how the twist angle in a vdW TBL can be used to engineer the ground states and quantum phases due to many-body interaction, our studies explore its role in controlling the dynamics of optically excited states, thus, expanding the conceptual applications of “twistronics”.},

Fitting the experimentally observed STM differential conductance for Co on Cu(111) including both the Kondo feature near the Fermi energy and the resonance below the surface band, we conclude that the STM senses mainly the Co s orbital and that the Kondo antiresonance is due to interference between states with electrons in the s orbital and a localized d orbital mediated by the conduction states.},

We derive a model that provides a predictive means to capture mode coarsening in the form of a nondissipative, purely geometric force relaxation mechanism, and validate the model by means of molecular dynamics (MD) based structural dynamics simulations for rods of wood and pasta considering different thermodynamic ensembles. The scalability of theory and simulation for engineering applications opens new venues toward safe design of engineering structures subject to impact-induced risks of buckling, ranging from skyscrapers, to aerospace structures, to the crashworthiness of vehicles, for example.},

The measured temperatures are in agreement with isentropic lines reconstructed via QMC for the experimental parameters of interest, with a conserved entropy per particle of S / N = 0.8 ( 1 ) k B . In addition, the Fisher information associated with this thermometry method shows that the latter is most accurate in the critical regime close to the Mott transition, as confirmed in the experiment.

In this Letter, we present a new scheme for generation of isolated CEP tunable intense subcycle pulses with central frequencies that range from the midinfrared to the ultraviolet. It utilizes an intense laser pulse that drives a wake in a plasma, copropagating with a long-wavelength seed pulse. The moving electron density spike of the wake amplifies the seed and forms a subcycle pulse. Controlling the CEP of the seed pulse or the delay between driver and seed leads to CEP tunability, while frequency tunability can be achieved by adjusting the laser and plasma parameters. Our 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations predict laser-to-subcycle-pulse conversion efficiencies up to 1\%, resulting in relativistically intense subcycle pulses.},

The liquid layer thickness is measured by a novel method using inductive sensing, while the friction is measured simultaneously. The measured values of the layer thickness and friction on the disk are well described by the hydrodynamic description of liquid flowing through a contact area. This allows us to propose a modified version of the Hersey number that compares viscous to normal forces and allows us to rescale data for different geometries and systems. The modification overcomes the shortcomings of the commonly used Hersey number, adds the effects of the geometry of the configuration on the friction, and successfully predicts the lubrication layer thickness.},

Self-switching occurs in balanced regimes of operation and is well captured by a simple coupled dynamical system featuring only the self- and cross-phase Kerr nonlinearities. Switching phenomena are due to temporal instabilities of symmetry-broken states combined with attractor merging, which restores the broken symmetry on average. Self-switching of counterpropagating light is robust for realizing controllable, all-optical generation of waveforms, signal encoding, and chaotic cryptography.},

The chiral bound states arise due to interference in the nonlocal coupling of a giant atom to multiple points of the waveguide. The chirality can be tuned by changing either the atom-waveguide coupling or the external bias of the PCW. Furthermore, the chiral bound states can induce directional dipole-dipole interactions between multiple giant atoms coupling to the same waveguide. Our proposal is ready to be implemented in experiments with superconducting circuits, where it can be used as a tunable toolbox to realize topological phase transitions and quantum simulations.},

Therefore, it is both fundamentally interesting and practically relevant to investigate the nonclassical features of optical quantum measurements. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a procedure for direct certification of quantum non-Gaussianity and Wigner function negativity, two crucial nonclassicality levels, of photonic quantum detectors. Remarkably, we characterize the highly nonclassical properties of the detector by probing it with only two classical thermal states and a vacuum state. We experimentally demonstrate the quantum non-Gaussianity of a single-photon avalanche diode even under the presence of background noise, and we also certify the negativity of the Wigner function of this detector. Our results open the way for direct benchmarking of photonic quantum detectors with a few measurements on classical states.},

This reaction also affects the temperature range for thermal equilibrium between the ground and isomeric levels. We present a novel technique, which exploits the isospin symmetry of the nuclear force, to address the long-standing challenge of determining proton-capture rates on excited nuclear levels. Such a technique has in-built tests that strongly support its veracity and, for the first time, we have experimentally constrained the strengths of resonances that dominate the astrophysical Al 26 m ( p , γ ) Si 27 reaction. These constraints demonstrate that the rate is at least a factor ∼ 8 lower than previously expected, indicating an increase in the stellar production of Mg 26 and a possible need to reinvestigate sensitivity studies involving the thermal equilibration of Al 26 .},

In particular, they finally enable a complete and precise characterization of the trends in ground state binding energies along the N = 32 isotone, confirming that the empirical neutron shell gap energies peak at the doubly magic Ca 52 . Moreover, our data, combined with other recent measurements, do not support the existence of a closed neutron shell in Sc 55 at N = 34 . The results were compared to predictions from both ab initio and phenomenological nuclear theories, which all had success describing N = 32 neutron shell gap energies but were highly disparate in the description of the N = 34 isotone.},

We show how the treatment of the proton parton density functions’ (PDFs’) uncertainty as a source of systematic error leads to the automatic inclusion in the fit of the bin-bin correlation of the kinematic distributions with respect to PDF variations. In the case of the determination of M W from the charged lepton transverse momentum distribution, we observe that the inclusion of this correlation factor yields a strong reduction of the PDF uncertainty, given a sufficiently good control over all the other error sources. This improvement depends on a systematic accounting of the features of the QCD-based PDF model, and it is achieved by relying only on the information available in current PDF sets. While a realistic quantitative estimate requires taking into account the details of the experimental systematics, we argue that, in perspective, the proton PDF uncertainty will not be a bottleneck for precision measurements.},

In contrast with previous results, we find that black hole rotation, ubiquitous in astrophysics, improves our ability to probe quantum effects. Our analysis shows that gravitational wave echoes and suppressed tidal heating are signs of new physics from which the fundamental quantum of black hole area can be measured, and which are within reach of future detectors.

On the contrary, we show using a rotating draining vortex flow that a fluid system of finite size responds to the presence of waves on timescales much longer than the wave dynamics, which leads to a significant global change in the total mass of our system. This backreaction is encapsulated by a dynamical metric, raising the possibility of studying backreaction in analogue black hole spacetimes.},

This is equivalent at high frequencies to increasing the laser power circulating in the interferometer by a factor of 4. Achieving this milestone, a key goal for the upgrades of the advanced detectors required a better understanding of the noise sources and losses and implementation of robust control schemes to mitigate their contributions. In particular, we address the optical losses from beam propagation, phase noise from the squeezing ellipse, and backscattered light from the squeezed light source. The expertise gained from this work carried out at GEO 600 provides insight toward the implementation of 10 dB of squeezing envisioned for third-generation gravitational wave detectors.},

In the early Universe, the long-range forces mediated by the scalar fields can lead to formation of halos of heavy particles even during the radiation-dominated era. The same interactions result in the emission of scalar radiation from the motion and close encounters of particles in such halos. Radiative cooling due the scalar radiation allows the halos to collapse to black holes. We illustrate this scenario on a simple model with fermions interacting via the Yukawa forces. The abundance and the mass function of PBHs are suitable to account for all dark matter, or for some gravitational wave events detected by LIGO. The model relates the mass of the dark-sector particles to the masses and abundance of dark matter PBHs in a way that can explain why the dark matter and the ordinary matter have similar mass densities. The model also predicts a small contribution to the number of effective light degrees of freedom, which can help reconcile different measurements of the Hubble constant.},

We obtain exact analytic expressions for the inverse participation ratio and show that right eigenvectors of directed random graphs with a small average degree are localized. Remarkably, if the fourth moment of the degree distribution is finite, then the critical mean degree of the localization transition is independent of the degree fluctuations, which is different from localization in undirected graphs that is governed by degree fluctuations. We also show that in the high connectivity limit the distribution of the right eigenvector components is solely determined by the degree distribution. For delocalized eigenvectors, we recover in this limit the universal results from standard random matrix theory that are independent of the degree distribution, while for localized eigenvectors the eigenvector distribution depends on the degree distribution.},

These one-dimensional tight-binding models can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known Aubry-André model, with an energy-dependent self-duality condition that constitutes an analytical mobility edge relation. By adiabatically preparing low and high energy eigenstates of this model system and performing microscopic measurements of their participation ratio, we track the evolution of the mobility edge as the energy-dependent density of states is modified by the model’s tuning parameter. Our results show strong deviations from single-particle predictions, consistent with attractive interactions causing both enhanced localization of the lowest energy state due to self-trapping and inhibited localization of high energy states due to screening. This study paves the way for quantitative studies of interaction effects on self-duality induced mobility edges.},

  abstract     = {The analogy between an equilibrium partition function and the return probability in many-body unitary dynamics has led to the concept of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). DQPTs are defined by nonanalyticities in the return amplitude and are present in many models. In some cases, DQPTs can be related to equilibrium concepts, such as order parameters, yet their universal description is an open question. In this Letter, we provide first steps toward a classification of DQPTs by using a matrix product state description of unitary dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This allows us to distinguish the two limiting cases of “precession” and “entanglement” DQPTs, which are illustrated using an analytical description in the quantum Ising model. While precession DQPTs are characterized by a large entanglement gap and are semiclassical in their nature, entanglement DQPTs occur near avoided crossings in the entanglement spectrum and can be distinguished by a complex pattern of nonlocal correlations. We demonstrate the existence of precession and entanglement DQPTs beyond Ising models, discuss observables that can distinguish them, and relate their interplay to complex DQPT phenomenology.},

For n ≥ 1 , we find a prethermal regime, the lifetime of which grows algebraically with the driving rate, with exponent 2 n + 1 . A simple theory based on Fermi’s golden rule accounts for this behavior. The quasiperiodic Thue-Morse sequence corresponds to the n → ∞ limit and, accordingly, exhibits an exponentially long-lived prethermal regime. Despite the absence of periodicity in the drive, and in spite of its eventual heat death, the prethermal regime can host versatile nonequilibrium phases, which we illustrate with a random multipolar discrete time crystal.},

As an application of this result, we also show that all pure genuine multipartite entangled states are genuine multipartite nonlocal in the sense that measurements can be found on finitely many copies of any genuine multipartite entangled state to yield a genuine multipartite nonlocal behavior.

Natural structures are often highly optimized through evolution and natural selection, leading to the biologically and practically relevant problem of understanding and applying the principles of their design. Inspired by the hierarchically organized scaffolding networks found in plant leaves, here we model networks of bending beams that capture the discrete and nonuniform nature of natural materials. Using the principle of maximal rigidity under natural resource constraints, we show that optimal discrete beam networks reproduce the structural features of real leaf venation. Thus, in addition to its ability to efficiently transport water and nutrients, the venation network also optimizes leaf rigidity using the same hierarchical reticulated network topology. We study the phase space of optimal mechanical networks, providing concrete guidelines for the construction of elastic structures. We implement these natural design rules by fabricating efficient, biologically inspired metamaterials.},

Motivated by the striking similarity to the behavior of equilibrium fluids with short-ranged pairwise attractions, we show that a direct mapping to pair potentials in the dilute limit implies interactions that are insufficiently attractive to engender phase separation. Instead, this is driven by the emergence of multibody effects associated with particle caging that occurs at sufficiently high number density. We quantify these effects via information-theoretical measures of n -body effective interactions extracted from the configurational structure.},

  abstract     = {Using high-level ab initio quantum theory we suggest an optically induced subpicosecond spin-transfer scenario over 4.428 nm, a distance which is directly comparable to the actual CMOS scale. The spin-density transfer takes place between two Ni atoms and over a 40-atom-long zigzag carbon chain. The suitable combination of the local symmetries of the participating carbon atoms and the global symmetry of the whole molecule gives rise to what we term the dynamical Goodenough-Kanamori rules, allowing the long-range coupling of the two Ni atoms. We also present local spin-flip scenarios, and compare spin flip and spin transfer with respect to their sensitivity against an external static magnetic gradient. Finally, we use two identical laser pulses, rather than a single one, which allows us to accurately control local (intrasite) vs global (intersite) processes, and we thus solve the problem of embedding individually addressable molecular nanologic elements in an integrated nanospintronic circuit. Our results underline the great potential of carbon chain systems as building and supporting blocks for designing future all-optical magnetic processing units.},

However, for genuine spatially indirect excitons, the dipolar nature is usually accompanied by a notable quenching of the exciton oscillator strength.

The emitted spin waves contain a range of k vectors and by detuning the applied magnetic field slightly off the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), we observe X -shaped caustic spin wave patterns at 70° propagation angles as predicted by theory. When the harmonic of the light source approaches the FMR, the caustic pattern gives way to uniaxial spin wave propagation perpendicular to the in-plane component of the applied field. This field-controlled propagation pattern and directionality of optically emitted short-wavelength spin waves provide additional degrees of freedom when designing magnonic devices.},

Our simulations demonstrate efficient excitation of dynamical states that would be forbidden by the semiclassical symmetries, such as generation of multiple magnetic excitation quanta by a single electron. Furthermore, quantum interference of spin wave functions enables generation of magnetization dynamics with amplitudes exceeding the transferred magnetic moment. The efficiency of excitation is almost independent of the electron spin polarization, and is governed mainly by the transfer of energy. Nonclassical spin transfer may thus enable efficient electronic control of antiferromagnets not limited by the classical constraints.},

Here we report a study of Sr 2 CuTe 1 − x W x O 6 using neutron diffraction and μ SR techniques, showing that the Néel order vanishes already at x = 0.025 ± 0.005 . We explain this extreme order suppression using a two-dimensional Heisenberg spin model, demonstrating that a W-type impurity induces a deformation of the order parameter that decays with distance as 1 / r 2 at temperature T = 0 . The associated logarithmic singularity leads to loss of order for any x &gt; 0 . Order for small x &gt; 0 and T &gt; 0 is induced by weak interplane couplings.

We confirm the strong in-plane anisotropy of the 2D charge correlations and observe their symmetric response to pressure: pressure along a enhances correlations along b , and vice versa. Our results imply that the underlying order parameter is uniaxial. In contrast, 3D long-range charge order is only observed along b in response to compression along a . Spectroscopic RXS measurements show that the 3D charge order resides exclusively in the CuO 2 planes and may thus be generic to the cuprates.

The proximity-induced gap, the critical current and the average value of the transparency τ ¯ are extracted without need for phase bias, demonstrating, e.g., a near-unity value of τ ¯ = 0.94 . Our method allows us to probe the devices deeply in the nondissipative regime, where ordinary transport measurements are featureless. In perpendicular magnetic field the junctions show a nearly perfect Fraunhofer pattern of the critical current, which is insensitive to the value of τ ¯ . In contrast, the signature of supercurrent interference in the inductance turns out to be extremely sensitive to τ ¯ .},

An important nonperturbative finding is a remarkable fine-tuning effect of the precise lattice commensuration, where slight variations in the relative lattice periods may lead to a suppression of the correlated insulating phase, in qualitative agreement with the observed fragility of the correlated insulating phase in twisted bilayer graphene.

We show that a similar effect appears in the absence of external electric fields, in the case of scattering of an exciton flow by charged impurities in the presence of the external magnetic field. As a result, the exciton flow changes the direction of its propagation that may be described in terms of the Hall conductivity for excitons. We develop a theory of this effect, which we refer to as the anomalous exciton Hall effect, to distinguish it from the exciton Hall effect that arises due to the valley selective exciton transport in transition metal dichalcogenides. According to our estimations, the effect is relatively weak for optically active or bright excitons in conventional GaAs quantum wells, but it becomes significant for optically inactive or dark excitons, because of the difference of the lifetimes. This makes the proposed effect a convenient tool for spatial separation of dark and bright excitons.},

This mixed-coordination silica fills in the density, electronic band gap, and coordination number gaps between the previously known sixfold pyrite-type and ninefold Fe 2 P -type phases, and may appear in the core or mantle of super-Earth exoplanets, or even the solar giant planets such as the Neptune. In addition, we also found that some silicon superoxides, Cmcm SiO 3 and Ccce SiO 6 , are stable in this pressure range and may appear in an oxygen-rich environment. Our finding enriches the high-pressure phase diagram of silicon oxides and improves understanding of the interior structure of giant planets in our solar system.},

  abstract     = {As in between liquid and crystal phases lies a nematic liquid crystal, which breaks rotation with preservation of translation symmetry, there is a nematic superfluid phase bridging a superfluid and a supersolid. The nematic order also emerges in interacting electrons and has been found to largely intertwine with multiorbital correlation in high-temperature superconductivity, where Ising nematicity arises from a four-fold rotation symmetry C 4 broken down to C 2 . Here, we report an observation of a three-state ( Z 3 ) quantum nematic order, dubbed “Potts-nematicity”, in a system of cold atoms loaded in an excited band of a hexagonal optical lattice described by an s p 2 -orbital hybridized model. This Potts-nematic quantum state spontaneously breaks a three-fold rotation symmetry of the lattice, qualitatively distinct from the Ising nematicity. Our field theory analysis shows that the Potts-nematic order is stabilized by intricate renormalization effects enabled by strong interorbital mixing present in the hexagonal lattice. This discovery paves a way to investigate quantum vestigial orders in multiorbital atomic superfluids.},

An analytical model reveals a strong dependency of the yield on the foam geometry and plasma sheath. For foam pore sizes near or larger than the sheath thickness, the plasma infuses the foam and transitions the plasma-surface interactions from superficial to volumetric phenomena. By defining a plasma infusion parameter, the sputtering behavior of foams is shown to be separated into the plasma-facing and plasma-infused regimes. While plasma infusion leads to a larger effective sputtering area, geometric recapture of ejected particles facilitates an overall reduction in yield. For a given level of plasma infusion, the reductions in normalized yield are more pronounced at lower ion energies since angular sputtering effects enable more effective geometric recapture of sputterants.},

The characterization and understanding of mixing dynamics in these opaque environments is an outstanding challenge. We address this issue by developing a novel technique based upon high-resolution imaging of the scalar signature produced by push-pull flows through porous media samples. Owing to the rapid decorrelation of particle trajectories in chaotic flows, the scalar image measured outside the porous material is representative of in situ mixing dynamics. We present a theoretical framework for estimation of the Lyapunov exponent based on extension of Lagrangian stretching theories to correlated aggregation. This method provides a full characterization of chaotic mixing dynamics in a large class of porous materials.},

We show that, for any swimmer, the minimum dissipation at a given velocity can be expressed in terms of the resistance tensors of two passive bodies of the same shape with a no-slip and perfect-slip boundary. To achieve the absolute minimum dissipation, the optimal swimmer needs a surface velocity profile that corresponds to the flow around the perfect-slip body, and a propulsive force density that corresponds to the no-slip body. Using this theorem, we propose an alternative definition of the energetic efficiency of microswimmers that, unlike the commonly used Lighthill efficiency, can never exceed unity.

  abstract     = {To quantify the fate of respiratory droplets under different ambient relative humidities, direct numerical simulations of a typical respiratory event are performed. We found that, because small droplets (with initial diameter of 10 μ m ) are swept by turbulent eddies in the expelled humid puff, their lifetime gets extended by a factor of more than 30 times as compared to what is suggested by the classical picture by Wells, for 50\% relative humidity. With increasing ambient relative humidity the extension of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to around 150 times for 90\% relative humidity, implying more than 2 m advection range of the respiratory droplets within 1 sec. Employing Lagrangian statistics, we demonstrate that the turbulent humid respiratory puff engulfs the small droplets, leading to many orders of magnitude increase in their lifetimes, implying that they can be transported much further during the respiratory events than the large ones. Our findings provide the starting points for larger parameter studies and may be instructive for developing strategies on optimizing ventilation and indoor humidity control. Such strategies are key in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the present autumn and upcoming winter.},

However, the physical mechanisms governing the phase conversion are only partly explained. Here, we show that an acoustic resonance can arise from the large speed of sound mismatch between a perfluorocarbon microdroplet and its surroundings. The fundamental resonance mode obeys a unique relationship k R ∼ 0.65 between droplet size and driving frequency that leads to a threefold pressure amplification inside the droplet. Classical nucleation theory shows that this pressure amplification increases the nucleation rate by several orders of magnitude. These findings are confirmed by high-speed imaging performed at a timescale of 10 ns. The optical recordings demonstrate that droplets exposed to intense acoustic waves generated by interdigital transducers nucleate only if they match the theoretical resonance size.},

The characteristic kink in the charge radii at the N = 126 neutron shell closure has been revealed, providing the first information on its behavior below the Z = 82 proton shell closure. A theoretical analysis has been performed within relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov and nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approaches, considering both the new mercury results and existing lead data. Contrary to previous interpretations, it is demonstrated that both the kink at N = 126 and the odd-even staggering (OES) in its vicinity can be described predominately at the mean-field level and that pairing does not need to play a crucial role in their origin. A new OES mechanism is suggested, related to the staggering in the occupation of the different neutron orbitals in odd- and even- A nuclei, facilitated by particle-vibration coupling for odd- A nuclei.},

  abstract     = {Eigenvector continuation is a computational method that finds the extremal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian matrix with one or more control parameters. It does this by projection onto a subspace of eigenvectors corresponding to selected training values of the control parameters. The method has proven to be very efficient and accurate for interpolating and extrapolating eigenvectors. However, almost nothing is known about how the method converges, and its rapid convergence properties have remained mysterious. In this Letter, we present the first study of the convergence of eigenvector continuation. In order to perform the mathematical analysis, we introduce a new variant of eigenvector continuation that we call vector continuation. We first prove that eigenvector continuation and vector continuation have identical convergence properties and then analyze the convergence of vector continuation. Our analysis shows that, in general, eigenvector continuation converges more rapidly than perturbation theory. The faster convergence is achieved by eliminating a phenomenon that we call differential folding, the interference between nonorthogonal vectors appearing at different orders in perturbation theory. From our analysis we can predict how eigenvector continuation converges both inside and outside the radius of convergence of perturbation theory. While eigenvector continuation is a nonperturbative method, we show that its rate of convergence can be deduced from power series expansions of the eigenvectors. Our results also yield new insights into the nature of divergences in perturbation theory.},

  abstract     = {We propose an operator product expansion for planar form factors of local operators in N = 4 SYM theory. This expansion is based on the dual conformal symmetry of these objects or, equivalently, the conformal symmetry of their dual description in terms of periodic Wilson loops. A form factor is decomposed into a sequence of known pentagon transitions and a new universal object that we call the “form factor transition.” This transition is subject to a set of nontrivial bootstrap constraints, which are sufficient to fully determine it. We evaluate the form factor transition for maximally helicity-violating form factors of the chiral half of the stress tensor supermultiplet at leading order in perturbation theory and use it to produce operator product expansion predictions at any loop order. We match the one-loop and two-loop predictions with data available in the literature.},

Our derivation is based on Wald’s gedanken experiment to destroy an extremal black hole. We find that the WCCC no longer holds for all possible generalizations. Thus, the WCCC can serve as a new constraint to the high-order effective field theories. However, our constraint is independent of photon’s self-interactions so that precision measurement of quantum electrodynamics cannot constrain the WCCC. For higher-dimension operators induced by the one-loop correction for the minimally coupled spinor and scalar to gravity, our constraint is satisfied.},

In this study, we disprove fast scrambling in generic long-range interacting systems with α &gt; D ( D : spatial dimension), where the total energy is extensive in terms of system size and the thermodynamic limit is well defined.

Thermalization is enabled by resonant processes that involve correlated hops of the impurity and localized particles. This effect indicates that Anderson localized insulators behave as “supercooled” systems, with mobile impurities acting as ergodic seeds. We provide analytical estimates, supported by numerical exact diagonalization, showing how the critical disorder strength for such mechanism depends on the particle density of the localized system. In the U → ∞ limit, doublons are stable excitations, and they can thermalize mesoscopic systems by a similar mechanism. The emergence of an additional conservation law leads to an eventual localization of doublons. Our predictions apply to fermionic and bosonic systems and are readily accessible in ongoing experiments simulating synthetic quantum lattices with tunable disorder.},

While recent analytic advances have sharpened our intuition for many-body chaos in certain large N theories, it has proven challenging to develop precise numerical tools capable of exploring this phenomenon in generic Hamiltonians. To this end, we utilize massively parallel, matrix-free Krylov subspace methods to calculate dynamical correlators in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model for up to N = 60 Majorana fermions. We begin by showing that numerical results for two-point correlation functions agree at high temperatures with dynamical mean field solutions, while at low temperatures finite-size corrections are quantitatively reproduced by the exactly solvable dynamics of near extremal black holes. Motivated by these results, we develop a novel finite-size rescaling procedure for analyzing the growth of out-of-time-order correlators. Our procedure accurately determines the Lyapunov exponent, λ , across a wide range in temperatures, including in the regime where λ approaches the universal bound, λ = 2 π / β .},

Quite remarkably, we show that this “bipartite OTOC” is equal to the operator entanglement of the evolution, and we determine its interplay with entangling power. Furthermore, we compute long-time averages of the OTOC and reveal their connection with eigenstate entanglement. For Hamiltonian systems, we uncover a hierarchy of constraints over the structure of the spectrum and elucidate how this affects the equilibration value of the OTOC.

Moreover, we report a desynchronization transition and the emergence of complex partial synchronization patterns induced by an increasing overall coupling strength.

By modifying individual edges in these networks, either by adjusting edge conductances or creating and destroying edges, organisms robustly control the propagation of inputs to perform specific tasks. However, a fundamental disconnect exists between the structure and function: networks with different local architectures can perform the same functions. Here, we answer the question of how changes at the level of individual edges collectively create functionality at the scale of an entire network. Using persistent homology, we analyze networks tuned to perform complex tasks. We find that the responses of such networks encode a hidden topological structure composed of sectors of nearly uniform pressure. Although these sectors are not apparent in the underlying network structure, they correlate strongly with the tuned function. The connectivity of these sectors, rather than that of individual nodes, provides a quantitative relationship between structure and function in flow networks.},

This evaporation-induced expansion can be attributed to the pressure imbalance near the liquid-vapor interface, which originates from the interplay between the complex thermodynamics of binary mixtures both in the vapor and liquid phases, as well as their dynamical asymmetries. In addition, careful modulation of the pressure quench in the vapor phase can result in spinodal bubble formation inside liquid phase. The results indicate that the thermodynamics-kinetics interplay could foster our fundamental understanding of the evaporation process and promote its practical applications.},

In contrast to similar superselective binding previously observed at surfaces, we have identified that a key effect in a three-dimensional environment is that the presence of inert crowding agents can significantly enhance or even introduce superselectivity. In essence, molecular crowding initially suppresses binding via an entropic penalty, but the clients can then more easily form many bonds simultaneously. We demonstrate the robustness of the superselective behavior with respect to client valency, linker length, and binding interactions in Monte Carlo simulations of an archetypal lattice polymer model.},

According to the mean-field picture, if local motion within the glass were becoming highly correlated due to the emergence of a Gardner phase then χ 3 ( 3 ) , which is analogous to the dynamical spin-glass susceptibility, should increase and diverge at the Gardner transition temperature T G . We find instead that upon cooling | χ 3 ( 3 ) | decreases by several orders of magnitude and becomes roughly constant in the regime 100 − 10 K . We rationalize our findings by assuming that the low temperature physics is described by localized excitations weakly interacting via a spin-glass dipolar pairwise interaction in a random magnetic field. Our quantitative estimations show that the spin-glass interaction is twenty to fifty times smaller than the local random field contribution, thus rationalizing the absence of the spin-glass Gardner phase. This hints at the fact that a Gardner phase may be suppressed in standard molecular glasses, but it also suggests ways to favor its existence in other amorphous solids and by changing the preparation protocol.},

Their operation frequency, typically in or below the GHz range, however, limits the speed of neuromorphic computing. Ultrafast THz electric field excitation has been employed to induce nonequilibrium states of matter, called hidden phases in oxides. One may wonder if there are systems for which THz pulses can generate neuronic and synaptic behavior, via the creation of hidden phases. Using atomistic simulations, we discover that relaxor ferroelectrics can emulate all the key neuronic and memristive synaptic features. Their occurrence originates from the activation of many hidden phases of polarization order, resulting from the response of nanoregions to THz pulses. Such phases further possess different dielectric constants, which is also promising for memcapacitor devices.},

The superfluid “mobility”, in the form of the superfluid weight D s , does not draw from the curvature of the band but has a purely band-geometric origin. In a mean-field description, a nonzero Chern number or fragile topology sets a lower bound for D s , which, via the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism, might explain the relatively high superconducting transition temperature measured in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). For fragile topology, relevant for the bilayer system, the fate of this bound for finite temperature and beyond the mean-field approximation remained, however, unclear. Here, we numerically use exact Monte Carlo simulations to study an attractive Hubbard model in flat bands with topological properties akin to those of MATBG. We find a superconducting phase transition with a critical temperature that scales linearly with the interaction strength. Then, we investigate the robustness of the superconducting state to the addition of trivial bands that may or may not trivialize the fragile topology. Our results substantiate the validity of the topological bound beyond the mean-field regime and further stress the importance of fragile topology for flat-band superconductivity.},

In the hole branch, however, because the hole mean free path is smaller than the nanowire perimeter, the quantum confinement effect is inoperative and the topological property maintained. The superconductivity is enhanced by gate tuning from electron to hole conduction, manifested by a larger critical supercurrent and a larger critical magnetic field, which is attributed to the topological transition from gapped surface subbands to a gapless surface band.

  abstract     = {Traditionally, one- and two-point correlation functions are used to characterize many-body systems. In strongly correlated quantum materials, such as the doped 2D Fermi-Hubbard system, these may no longer be sufficient, because higher-order correlations are crucial to understanding the character of the many-body system and can be numerically dominant. Experimentally, such higher-order correlations have recently become accessible in ultracold atom systems. Here, we reveal strong non-Gaussian correlations in doped quantum antiferromagnets and show that higher-order correlations dominate over lower-order terms. We study a single mobile hole in the t − J model using the density matrix renormalization group and reveal genuine fifth-order correlations which are directly related to the mobility of the dopant. We contrast our results to predictions using models based on doped quantum spin liquids which feature significantly reduced higher-order correlations. Our predictions can be tested at the lowest currently accessible temperatures in quantum simulators of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. Finally, we propose to experimentally study the same fifth-order spin-charge correlations as a function of doping. This will help to reveal the microscopic nature of charge carriers in the most debated regime of the Hubbard model, relevant for understanding high- T c superconductivity.},

For short-range interactions, avalanches correspond to compact reorganizations of the interface well described by the depinning theory. For long-range elasticity, an avalanche is a collection of spatially disconnected clusters. In this Letter we determine the scaling properties of the clusters and relate them to the roughness exponent of the interface. The key observation of our analysis is the identification of a Bienaymé-Galton-Watson process describing the statistics of the number of clusters. Our work has concrete importance for experimental applications where the cluster statistics is a key probe of avalanche dynamics.},

It is demonstrated here that fracture toughness of a material can be asymmetric, i.e., the resistance of a medium to a crack propagating from right to left can be significantly different from that to a crack propagating from left to right. Such asymmetry is unknown in natural materials, but we show that it can be built into artificial materials through the proper control of microstructure. This paves the way for control of crack paths and direction, where fracture—when unavoidable—can be guided through predesigned paths to minimize loss of critical components.},

The theory predicts compression-induced rejuvenation and the resulting strain hardening that have been recently observed in metallic glasses. Structural relaxation under pressure is mainly governed by local cage dynamics. The external pressure restricts the dynamical constraints and slows down the atomic mobility. In addition, the compression induces a rejuvenated metastable state (local minimum) at a higher energy in the free-energy landscape. Thus, compressed metallic glasses can rejuvenate and the corresponding relaxation is reversible. This behavior leads to strain hardening in mechanical deformation experiments. Theoretical predictions agree well with experiments.},

While nondipolar self-bound (without external confinement) mixtures are necessarily miscible with an approximately fixed ratio between the two densities, the density ratio for the dipolar case is free. Therefore, self-bound dipolar mixtures present qualitatively novel and much richer physics, characterized by three possible ground-state phases: miscible, symmetric immiscible, and asymmetric immiscible, which may in principle occur at any population imbalance. Self-bound immiscible droplets are possible due to mutual nonlocal intercomponent attraction, which results in the formation of a droplet molecule. Moreover, our analysis of the impurity regime shows that quantum fluctuations in the majority component crucially modify the miscibility of impurities. Our work opens intriguing perspectives for the exploration of spinor physics in ultradilute liquids, which should resemble to some extent that of He 4 – He 3 droplets and impurity-doped helium droplets.},

Their dynamics, evolution, and interior structure are insufficiently understood and models rely imperatively on data for equation of state and transport properties. Despite its great significance, the experimentally accessed region of the ammonia phase diagram today is still very limited in pressure and temperature. Here we push the probed regime to unprecedented conditions, up to ∼ 350 GPa and ∼ 40 000 K . Along the Hugoniot, the temperature measured as a function of pressure shows a subtle change in slope at ∼ 7000 K and ∼ 90 GPa , in agreement with ab initio simulations we have performed. This feature coincides with the gradual transition from a molecular liquid to a plasma state. Additionally, we performed reflectivity measurements, providing the first experimental evidence of electronic conduction in high-pressure ammonia. Shock reflectance continuously rises with pressure above 50 GPa and reaches saturation values above 120 GPa. Corresponding electrical conductivity values are up to 1 order of magnitude higher than in water in the 100 GPa regime, with possible significant contributions of the predicted ammonia-rich layers to the generation of magnetic dynamos in ice giant interiors.},

These shell-thickness nonuniformities have significantly impacted some recent experiments leading to ρ R asymmetries on the order of ∼ 25\% of the average ρ R and hot spot velocities of ∼ 100 km / s .

We address this challenge by introducing the concept of laser-ion lensing and acceleration. Using a simple analogy with a gradient-index lens, we demonstrate that simultaneous focusing and acceleration of ions is accomplished by illuminating a shaped solid-density target by an intense laser pulse at ∼ 10 22 W / cm 2 intensity, and using the radiation pressure of the laser to deform or focus the target into a cubic micron spot. We show that the laser-ion lensing and acceleration process can be approximated using a simple deformable mirror model and then validate it using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of a two-species plasma target composed of electrons and ions. Extensive scans of the laser and target parameters identify the stable propagation regime where the Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability is suppressed. Stable focusing is found at different laser powers (from a few to multiple petawatts). Focused ion beams with the focused density of order 10 23 cm − 3 , energies in access of 750 MeV, and energy density up to 2 × 10 13 J / cm 3 at the focal point are predicted for future multipetawatt laser systems.},

Here we report spectrally resolved laser dimensional metrology via a free-running soliton frequency microcomb, with nanometric-scale precision. Spectral interferometry provides information on the optical time-of-flight signature, and the large free-spectral range and high coherence of the microcomb enable tooth-resolved and high-visibility interferograms that can be directly read out with optical spectrum instrumentation. We employ a hybrid timing signal from comb-line homodyne, microcomb, and background amplified spontaneous emission spectrally resolved interferometry—all from the same spectral interferogram. Our combined soliton and homodyne architecture demonstrates a 3-nm repeatability over a 23-mm nonambiguity range achieved via homodyne interferometry and over 1000-s stability in the long-term precision metrology at the white noise limits.},

  abstract     = {Multimode optical fibers are essential in bridging the gap between nonlinear optics in bulk media and single-mode fibers. The understanding of the transition between the two fields remains complex due to intermodal nonlinear processes and spatiotemporal couplings, e.g., some striking phenomena observed in bulk media with ultrashort pulses have not yet been unveiled in such waveguides. Here we generalize the concept of conical waves described in bulk media towards structured media, such as multimode optical fibers, in which only a discrete and finite number of modes can propagate. Such propagation-invariant optical wave packets can be linearly generated, in the limit of superposed monochromatic fields, by shaping their spatiotemporal spectrum, whatever the dispersion regime and waveguide geometry. Moreover, they can also spontaneously emerge when a rather intense short pulse propagates nonlinearly in a multimode waveguide, their finite energy is also associated with temporal dispersion. The modal distribution of optical fibers then provides a discretization of conical emission (e.g., discretized X waves). Future experiments in multimode fibers could reveal different forms of dispersion-engineered conical emission and supercontinuum light bullets.},

  abstract     = {We propose the mechanism of edge state-led mode coupling under topological protection; i.e., localized surface plasmons almost do not have any influence on the edge state, while the edge state greatly changes the local field distribution of surface plasmons. Based on this mechanism, in the well-designed topological photonic structure containing a resonant plasmon nanoantenna, an obvious absorption reduction in the spontaneous emission spectra appears due to the near-field deformation around the antenna induced by the edge state. Because a plasmon antenna with ultrasmall mode volume provides large Purcell enhancement and simultaneously the photonic crystal guides almost all scattering light into its edge state, the rate of nonscattering single photons reaches more than 10 4 γ 0 . This topological state-led mode coupling mechanism and induced absorption reduction, which are based on topological protection, will have a profound effect on the study of composite topological photonic structures and related micro- and nanoscale cavity quantum electrodynamics. Also, nonscattering large Purcell enhancement will provide practical use for on-chip quantum light sources, such as single-photon sources and nanolasers.},

Here, we present the first experimental implementation of the recently introduced phase-space inequalities for nonclassicality certification, which conceptually unite phase-space representations with correlation conditions. We demonstrate the practicality and sensitivity of this approach by studying nonclassicality of a family of noisy and lossy quantum states of light. To this end, we experimentally generate single-photon-added thermal states with various thermal mean photon numbers and detect them at different loss levels. Based on the reconstructed Wigner and Husimi Q functions, the inequality conditions detect nonclassicality despite the fact that the involved distributions are nonnegative, which includes cases of high losses (93\%) and cases where other established methods do not reveal nonclassicality. We show the advantages of the implemented approach and discuss possible extensions that assure a wide applicability for quantum science and technologies.},

The double-EIT ground-state cooling is observed for Yb 171 + ions with a clock state, for which EIT cooling has not been realized like many other ions with a simple Λ scheme. A cooling rate of n ¯ ˙ = 34 ( ± 1.8 ) ms − 1 and a cooling limit of n ¯ = 0.06 ( ± 0.059 ) are observed for a single ion. The measured cooling rate and limit are consistent with theoretical predictions. We apply double-EIT cooling to the transverse modes of two-dimensional (2D) crystals with up to 12 ions. In our 2D crystals, the micromotion and the transverse mode directions are perpendicular, which makes them decoupled. Therefore, the cooling on transverse modes is not disturbed by micromotion, which is confirmed in our experiment. For the center of mass mode of a 12-ion crystal, we observe a cooling rate and a cooling limit that are consistent with those of a single ion, including heating rates proportional to the number of ions. This method can be extended to other hyperfine qubits, and near ground-state cooling of stationary 2D crystals with large numbers of ions may advance the field of quantum information sciences.},

The time-dependent quantum Rabi model is simulated by applying parametric amplification to the Jaynes-Cummings model. Using experimentally feasible parametric drive, this STA protocol can generate large-size Schrödinger cat states, through a process that is ∼ 10 times faster compared to adiabatic protocols. Such fast evolution increases the robustness of our protocol against dissipation. Our method enables one to freely design the parametric drive, so that the target state can be generated in the lab frame. A largely detuned light-matter coupling makes the protocol robust against imperfections of the operation times in experiments.},

We benchmark our time-multiplexing framework that includes a high-performance source of multiphoton states and a large multiplexing network, together with unique detectors with high photon-number resolution, readily available for distributing quantum light and measuring complex quantum correlations. Using an adaptive approach that employs flexible time bins, rather than static ones, we successfully verify high-order nonclassical correlations of many photons distributed over many modes. By exploiting the symmetry of our system and using powerful analysis tools, we can analyze correlations that would be inaccessible by classical means otherwise. In particular, we produce on the order of ten photons and distribute them over 64 modes. Nonclassicality is verified with correlation functions up to the 128th order and statistical significances of up to 20 standard deviations.},

The threshold for the formation of the liquid coincides with the appearance of a bound state in the dimer-dimer problem and possesses a universality in terms of the two-body parameters of the dimer-dimer interaction, namely, scattering length and effective range.

  abstract     = {Proton decay is a smoking gun signature of grand unified theories (GUTs). Searches by Super-Kamiokande have resulted in stringent limits on the GUT symmetry-breaking scale. The large-scale multipurpose neutrino experiments DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO will either discover proton decay or further push the symmetry-breaking scale above 1 0 16 GeV . Another possible observational consequence of GUTs is the formation of a cosmic string network produced during the breaking of the GUT to the standard model gauge group. The evolution of such a string network in the expanding Universe produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves which will be tested by a number of gravitational wave detectors over a wide frequency range. We demonstrate the nontrivial complementarity between the observation of proton decay and gravitational waves produced from cosmic strings in determining SO(10) GUT-breaking chains. We show that such observations could exclude SO(10) breaking via flipped SU ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) or standard SU(5), while breaking via a Pati-Salam intermediate symmetry, or standard SU ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) , may be favored if a large separation of energy scales associated with proton decay and cosmic strings is indicated. We note that recent results by the NANOGrav experiment have been interpreted as evidence for cosmic strings at a scale of ∼ 10 14 GeV . This would strongly point toward the existence of GUTs, with SO(10) being the prime candidate. We show that the combination with already available constraints from proton decay allows us to identify preferred symmetry-breaking routes to the standard model.},

We demonstrate that the decay rate of the axial charge is first order in the fine-structure constant Γ flip ∝ α m e 2 / T and thus orders of magnitude greater than the naive estimate which has been in use for decades. This counterintuitive result arises through infrared divergences regularized at high temperature by environmental effects. The decay of axial charge plays an important role in the problems of leptogenesis and cosmic magnetogenesis.},

With the inclusion of a Maxwell term, we show that the low-energy properties of our model can be obtained reliably via a semiclassical approach. Those properties are the same as that of the Chern-Simons field theory, S = ∫ d 3 x ( K I J / 4 π ) A I d A J . We require the lattice variables on each link to be compact (i.e., take values on circles), which enforces the quantization of the K matrix as a symmetric integer matrix with even diagonals. Our lattice model also has exact 1-symmetries, which gives rise to the 1-form symmetry in the Chern-Simons field theory. In particular, some of those 1-symmetries are anomalous (i.e., non-on-site) in the expected way. The anomaly can be probed via the breaking of those lattice 1-symmetries by the boundaries.},

We focus on the matter-dependent contributions and compute the first truly nonplanar terms. They appear at four loops and are proportional to a quartic Casimir operator in color space. Specializing our general gauge theory result to U(1), we obtain the full QED four-loop angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. While more complicated functions appear at intermediate steps, the analytic answer depends only on multiple polylogarithms with singularities at fourth roots of unity. It can be written in terms of four rational structures and contains functions of up to maximal transcendental weight seven. Despite this complexity, we find that numerically the answer is tantalizingly close to the appropriately rescaled one-loop formula, over most of the kinematic range. We take several limits of our analytic result, which serves as a check and allows us to obtain new, power-suppressed terms. In the antiparallel lines limit, which corresponds to production of two massive particles at threshold, we find that the subleading power correction vanishes. Finally, we compute the quartic Casimir contribution for scalars in the loop. Taking into account a supersymmetric decomposition, we derive the first nonplanar corrections to the quark antiquark potential in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory.},

Because the predicted tangential shear signal at a given separation depends on the physical modeling on all scales internal to that separation, systematic uncertainties in the modeling of nonlinear small scales are propagated outward to larger scales. Even in the absence of other limiting factors, this systematic effect alone can necessitate conservative small-scale cuts, resulting in significant losses of information in the tangential shear data vector. We construct a simple linear transformation of the standard galaxy-galaxy observable that removes this nonlocality, which ensures that the cosmological signal contained within the transformed observable is exclusively drawn from well-understood physical scales. This new observable, through its robustness against nonlocality, also enables a significant extension in the range of usable scales in galaxy-galaxy lensing compared to the standard approach in current cosmological analyses.},

We show in particular the de Sitter precession of the inner stellar-mass binary’s orbital angular momentum (AM) around the AM of the outer orbit will be detectable if the precession period is comparable to the duration of observation, typically a few years. Once detected, the precession can be combined with the Doppler shift arising from the outer orbital motion to determine the mass of the SMBH and the outer orbital separation individually and each with percent-level accuracy.

In particular, we evaluate the rate of energy dissipation of this many-body system of interacting noisy subharmonic oscillators in contact with a heat bath. The mean-field model displays the phenomenon of subharmonic synchronization, which corresponds to collective subharmonic oscillations of the individual units. The 2D model does not display synchronization but it does show a time-crystalline phase, which is characterized by a power-law behavior of the number of coherent subharmonic oscillations with system size. This result demonstrates that the emergence of coherent oscillations is possible even in the absence of synchronization.},

It is shown that slow ramping could induce a dynamical transition between two Z 2 symmetry breaking time crystal phases in time domain, which can be considered as a temporal analog of the soliton excitation spatially sandwiched by two degenerate charge density wave states in polyacetylene. By tuning the ramping rate, we observe a critical value at which point the transition duration diverges, resembling the critical slowing down phenomenon in nonequilibrium statistic physics. We also discuss the effect of stochastic sequences of such phase ramping processes and its implication to the stability of the discrete time crystal phase against noisy perturbations.},

Here, we connect these two fields and design a linear-optical simulator such that the evolution of the optical quantum gates simulates the spin-foam amplitudes of LQG. It has been shown that computing transition amplitudes in simple quantum field theories falls into the bounded-error quantum polynomial time class, which strongly suggests that computing transition amplitudes of LQG are classically intractable. Therefore, these amplitudes are efficiently computable with universal quantum computers, which are, alas, possibly decades away. We propose here an alternative special-purpose linear-optical quantum computer that can be implemented using current technologies. This machine is capable of efficiently computing these quantities. This work opens a new way to relate quantum gravity to quantum information and will expand our understanding of the theory.},

Here, we report on the direct observation of the Pauli principle in a continuous system of up to six particles in the ground state of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. To this end, we sample the full many-body wave function by applying a single atom resolved imaging scheme in momentum space. We find so-called Pauli crystals as a manifestation of higher order correlations. In contrast to true crystalline phases, these unique high-order density correlations emerge even without any interactions present.

We find that even in such a simple landscape the structure and kinetics of the ensemble of transition paths changes drastically in the presence of activity. Indeed, active Brownian particles reach the target more frequently than passive Brownian particles, following longer and counterintuitive search patterns.},

However, tensor monopoles are less studied, and their observation has not been reported. Here we experimentally construct a tunable spin-1 Hamiltonian to generate a tensor monopole and then measure its unique features with superconducting quantum circuits. The energy structure of a 4D Weyl-like Hamiltonian with threefold degenerate points acting as tensor monopoles is imaged. Through quantum-metric measurements, we report the first experiment that measures the Dixmier-Douady invariant, the topological charge of the tensor monopole. Moreover, we observe topological phase transitions characterized by the topological Dixmier-Douady invariant, rather than the Chern numbers as used for conventional monopoles in odd-dimensional spaces.},

This situation, described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian, has so far only been studied with quantum Monte Carlo in one dimension. Here we present results for the 2D SSH model, show that a bond ordered wave (BOW) insulator is present in the ground state at half filling, and argue that a critical value of the electron-phonon coupling is required for its onset, in contradistinction with the 1D case where BOW exists for any nonzero coupling.

Using a theory that takes into account nonperturbative correlations between the excitons as well as strong light-matter coupling, we demonstrate the high tunability of an effective interaction between quasiparticles formed by minority component polaritons interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a majority component polaritons. In particular, the interaction, which is mediated by sound modes in the BEC can be made strong enough to support a bound state of two quasiparticles. Since these quasiparticles consist partly of photons, this in turn corresponds to a dimer state of photons propagating through the BEC. This gives rise to a new light transmission line where the dimer wave function is directly mapped onto correlations between the photons. Our findings open new routes for highly nonlinear optical materials and novel hybrid light-matter quantum systems.},

Here, we report on the dynamic resonances of these novel magnetic states. After promoting the nucleation of the LTS by means of field cycling, we apply broadband microwave spectroscopy in two experimental geometries that provide either predominantly in-plane or out-of-plane excitation. By comparing the results to linear spin-wave theory, we clearly identify resonant modes associated with the tilted conical state, the gyrational and breathing modes associated with the LTS, as well as the hybridization of the breathing mode with a dark octupole gyration mode mediated by the magnetocrystalline anisotropies. Most intriguingly, our findings suggest that under decreasing fields the hexagonal skyrmion lattice becomes unstable with respect to an oblique deformation, reflected in the formation of elongated skyrmions.},

However, at higher energy transfers, these semiclassical and harmonic dynamics are replaced by an energy and momentum broadened continuum of excitations. Applying kinematic constraints required for energy and momentum conservation, sum rules of neutron scattering, and comparison against exact diagonalization calculations, we show that the dynamics at high-energy transfers resemble low- S one-dimensional quantum fluctuations. β − CaCr 2 O 4 represents an example of a magnet at the border between classical Néel and quantum phases, displaying dual characteristics.},

Coupled YSR states constitute basic elements to engineer artificial superconducting states, but their substrate-mediated interactions are generally weak. In this Letter, we report that intramolecular (Hund’s-like) exchange interactions produce coupled YSR states across a molecular platform. We measured YSR spectra along a magnetic iron-porphyrin on Pb(111) and found evidence of two distinct interaction channels, which invert their particle-hole asymmetry across the molecule. Numerical calculations show that the identical YSR asymmetry pattern of the two channels is caused by two spin-hosting orbitals with opposite potential scattering and coupled strongly. Both channels can be similarly excited by tunneling electrons into each orbital, depicting a new scenario for entangled superconducting bound states using molecular platforms.},

Recently, detection of bulk topology through quench dynamics has attracted growing interests. Here, we propose that topological characters of a quantum quadrupole insulator can be read out by quench dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a quantity, a quadrupole moment weighted by the eigenvalues of the chiral operator, which takes zero for the trivial phase and finite for the quadrupolar topological phase. By utilizing an efficient numerical method to track the unitary time evolution, we elucidate that the quantity we propose indeed serves as an indicator of topological character for both noninteracting and interacting cases. The robustness against disorders is also demonstrated.},

We find zero-energy solutions at a discrete set of values of the dimensionless Planck’s constant, which we obtain analytically.

Comparison of our angle-dependent dHvA spectra with those of the non- 4 f compound LaRhIn 5 and with band-structure calculations evidences that the Ce 4 f electrons in CeRhIn 5 remain localized over the whole field range. This rules out any significant Fermi-surface reconstruction, either at the suggested nematic phase transition at B * ≈ 30 T or at the putative quantum critical point at B c ≃ 50 T .

We present a number of supporting arguments for the invariants via topological field theory interpretation, adiabatic pumping argument, and direct mapping to free-fermion band indices. Therefore, the invariants explicitly encircle several different pillars of theoretical descriptions of topological phases. Furthermore, our many-body invariants are written in forms which can be directly employed in various numerics including the exact diagonalization and the density-matrix renormalization group simulations. We finally confirm our invariants by numerical computations including an infinite density-matrix renormalization group on quasi-one-dimensional systems.},

This implies that the topological transition in ZrTe 5 can be realized with many different settings of external stimuli capable of penetrating through the phonon-space Dirac surface without breaking the crystallographic symmetry. Furthermore, we predict that domains with effective mass of opposite signs can be created by laser pumping and will host Weyl modes of opposite chirality propagating along the domain boundaries.

Perhaps the most noted relationship between the two is the phenomenon of de Gennes narrowing, in which relaxation times in liquids are proportional to the scattering structure factor. Here, a similar relationship is discovered during the self-organized ion-beam nanopatterning of silicon using coherent x-ray scattering. However, in contrast to the exponential relaxation of fluctuations in classic de Gennes narrowing, the dynamic surface exhibits a wide range of behaviors as a function of the length scale, with a compressed exponential relaxation at lengths corresponding to the dominant structural motif—self-organized nanoscale ripples. These behaviors are reproduced in simulations of a nonlinear model describing the surface evolution. We suggest that the compressed exponential behavior observed here is due to the morphological persistence of the self-organized surface ripple patterns which form and evolve during ion-beam nanopatterning.},

We discovered a 2 orders of magnitude difference in the thermal Hall conductivity between SrTi 16 O 3 and O 18 -enriched SrTi 18 O 3 samples. In most temperature ranges, the magnitude of thermal Hall conductivity ( κ x y ) in SrTi 18 O 3 is proportional to the magnitude of the longitudinal thermal conductivity ( κ x x ), which suggests a phonon-mediated thermal Hall effect. However, they deviate in the temperature of their maxima, and the thermal Hall angle ratio ( | κ x y / κ x x | ) shows anomalously decreasing behavior below the ferroelectric Curie temperature T c ∼ 25 K . This observation suggests a new underlying mechanism, as the conventional scenario cannot explain such differences within the slight change in phonon spectrum. Notably, the difference in magnitude of thermal Hall conductivity and rapidly decreasing thermal Hall angle ratio in SrTi 18 O 3 is correlated with the strength of quantum critical fluctuations in this displacive ferroelectric. This relation points to a link between the quantum critical physics of strontium titanate and its thermal Hall effect, a possible clue to explain this example of an exotic phenomenon in nonmagnetic insulating systems.},

In this work we present a computational investigation of the homogeneous ice nucleation at negative pressures. By means of the seeding technique we estimate the size of the ice critical nucleus N c for the TIP4P/Ice water model. This is done along the isotherms 230, 240, and 250 K, from positive to negative pressures until reaching the liquid-gas kinetic stability limit (where cavitation cannot be avoided). We find that N c is nonmonotonic upon depressurization, reaching a minimum at negative pressures in the doubly metastable region of water. According to classical nucleation theory we establish the nucleation rate J and the surface tension γ , revealing a retracing behavior of both when the liquid-gas kinetic stability limit is approached. We also predict a reentrant behavior of the homogeneous nucleation line. The reentrance of these properties is related to the reentrance of the coexistence line at negative pressure, revealing new anomalies of water. The results of this work suggest the possibility of having metastable samples of liquid water for long times at negative pressure provided that heterogeneous nucleation is suppressed.},

The disordering occurs within 100 fs of irradiation, a timescale that agrees well with first principles simulations, and is faster than that predicted by purely inertial behavior, suggesting that both the phase change and disordered state reached are dominated by Coulomb forces. This method is capable of observing liquid scattering without masking signal from the ambient solid, allowing the liquid structure to be measured throughout and beyond the phase change.},

The ammonia-rich ammonia hemihydrate (AHH) plays a pivotal role as it precipitates from water-rich mixtures under pressure.

Utilizing Raman spectroscopy measurements up to 123 GPa and first-principles calculations, we report the spontaneous ionization of AHH under compression. Spectroscopic measurements reveal that molecular AHH begins to transform into an ionic state at 26 GPa and then above ∼ 69 GPa transforms into the fully ionic P 3 ¯ m 1 phase, AHH-III, characterized as ammonium oxide ( NH 4 + ) 2 O 2 − .},

Here we explore a susceptibility-mismatch phase transformation in a paraelectric ceramic, yttria-doped zirconia. Using in situ x-ray diffraction at 550 ° C we show that the monoclinic-to-tetragonal transformation can be driven directly by an electric field, providing experimental evidence of a paraelectric-to-paraelectric phase transformation. Considering the ∼ 1\% mechanical strain of this transformation, the resulting electromechanical coupling may have potential for solid-state electrical actuators.},

Despite their central role in determining how glasses yield and break, the search for a simple and generally applicable definition of the precursors of those plastic rearrangements—the so-called shear transformation zones (STZs)—is still ongoing. Here we present a simple definition of STZs—based solely on the harmonic approximation of a glass’s energy. We explain why and demonstrate directly that our proposed definition of plasticity carriers in amorphous solids is more broadly applicable compared to anharmonic definitions put forward previously. Finally, we offer an open-source library that analyzes low-lying STZs in computer glasses and in laboratory materials such as dense colloidal suspensions for which the harmonic approximation is accessible. Our results constitute a physically motivated methodological advancement towards characterizing mechanical disorder in glasses, and understanding how they yield.},

It is known, however, that the geometry and topology of space can have significant effects on quantum statistics for particles moving on it. Here, we have undertaken the first step toward realizing the emerging fractional statistics for particles restricted to move on the sphere instead of on the plane. We show that such a model arises naturally in the context of quantum impurity problems. In particular, we demonstrate a setup in which the lowest-energy spectrum of two linear bosonic or fermionic molecules immersed in a quantum many-particle environment can coincide with the anyonic spectrum on the sphere. This paves the way toward the experimental realization of anyons on the sphere using molecular impurities. Furthermore, since a change in the alignment of the molecules corresponds to the exchange of the particles on the sphere, such a realization reveals a novel type of exclusion principle for molecular impurities, which could also be of use as a powerful technique to measure the statistics parameter. Finally, our approach opens up a simple numerical route to investigate the spectra of many anyons on the sphere. Accordingly, we present the spectrum of two anyons on the sphere in the presence of a Dirac monopole field.},

A hadron resonance gas model with pion interactions, based on first-principle lattice QCD simulations at nonzero isospin density, is used to evaluate cosmic trajectories at various values of electron, muon, and tau lepton asymmetries that satisfy the available constraints on the total lepton asymmetry. The cosmic trajectory can pass through the pion condensed phase if the combined electron and muon asymmetry is sufficiently large: | l e + l μ | ≳ 0.1 , with little sensitivity to the difference l e − l μ between the individual flavor asymmetries. Future constraints on the values of the individual lepton flavor asymmetries will thus be able to either confirm or rule out the condensation of pions during the cosmic QCD epoch. We demonstrate that the pion condensed phase leaves an imprint both on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves and on the mass distribution of primordial black holes at the QCD scale, e.g., the black hole binary of recent LIGO event GW190521 can be formed in that phase.},

Despite significant efforts, consensus on their internal structures is still lacking. As a prime example, it remains a pressing open question to decipher the X(3872) state between two popular exotic configurations: a loose hadronic molecule or a compact tetraquark. We demonstrate a novel approach to help address this problem by studying the X(3872) production in heavy ion collisions, where a hot fireball with ample light as well as charm (anti-)quarks is available for producing the exotics. Adopting a multiphase transport model (AMPT) for describing such collisions and implementing appropriate production mechanism of either molecule or tetraquark picture, we compute and compare a series of observables for X(3872) in Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We find the fireball volume plays a crucial role, leading to a 2-order-of-magnitude difference in the X(3872) yield and a markedly different centrality dependence between hadronic molecules and compact tetraquarks, thus offering a unique opportunity for distinguishing the two scenarios. We also make the first prediction of X(3872) elliptic flow coefficient to be tested by future experimental measurements.},

Using HERA data fit to HERA’s parton distribution functions (PDFs), we obtain the model-independent bound ε ≲ 0.02 on the kinetic mixing between hypercharge and the dark photon for dark photon masses ≲ 10 GeV . This slightly improves on the bound obtained from electroweak precision observables. For higher masses, the limit weakens monotonically; ε ≲ 1 for a dark photon mass of 5 TeV. Utilizing PDF sum rules, we demonstrate that the effects of the dark photon cannot be (trivially) absorbed into refit PDFs and, in fact, lead to non–Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (Bjorken x B -independent) scaling violations that could provide a smoking gun in data. The proposed e ± p collider operating at s = 1.3 TeV (Large Hadron Electron Collider) is anticipated to accumulate 10 3 times the luminosity of HERA, providing substantial improvements in probing the effects of a dark photon: sensitivity to ε well below that probed by electroweak precision data is possible throughout virtually the entire dark photon mass range, as well as being able to probe to much higher dark photon masses, up to 100 TeV.},

  abstract     = {Cosmological neutrinos have their greatest influence in voids: These are the regions with the highest neutrino to dark matter density ratios. The marked power spectrum can be used to emphasize low-density regions over high-density regions and, therefore, is potentially much more sensitive than the power spectrum to the effects of neutrino masses. Using 22 000 N -body simulations from the Quijote suite, we quantify the information content in the marked power spectrum of the matter field and show that it outperforms the standard power spectrum by setting constraints improved by a factor larger than 2 on all cosmological parameters. The combination of marked and standard power spectra allows us to place a 4.3 σ constraint on the minimum sum of the neutrino masses with a volume equal to 1 ( Gpc h − 1 ) 3 and without cosmic microwave background priors. Combinations of different marked power spectra yield a 6 σ constraint within the same conditions.},

The scalarized black holes can violate the Kerr rotation bound. We identify “critical” families of scalarized black hole solutions such that the expansion of the metric functions and of the scalar field at the horizon no longer allows for real coefficients.

This instability appears only once the dimensionless spin j is sufficiently large, that is, j ≳ 0.5 . A tachyonic instability is the hallmark of spontaneous scalarization. Focusing, for illustrative purposes, on a class of theories that do exhibit this instability, we show that stationary, rotating black hole solutions do indeed have scalar hair once the spin-induced instability threshold is exceeded, while black holes that lie below the threshold are described by the Kerr solution.

  abstract     = {In the inflation-based cosmology the dark matter (DM) density component starts moving with respect to the universal expansion at z eq ∼ 3200 while baryons remain frozen until z rec ∼ 1100 . It has been suggested that in this case postlinear corrections to the evolution of small fluctuations would result, for the standard Λ -dominated cold DM (CDM) model, in delayed formation of early objects as supersonic advection flows develop after recombination, so baryons are not immediately captured by the DM gravity on small scales. We develop the hydrodynamical description of such two-component advection and show that, in the supersonic regime, the advection within irrotational fluids is governed by the gradient of the difference of the kinetic energies of the two (DM and baryonic here) components. We then apply this formalism to the case where DM is made up of LIGO-type black holes (BHs) and show that there the advection process on scales relevant for early structure collapse will differ significantly from the earlier discussed (CDM) case because of the additional granulation component to the density field produced during inflation. The advection here will lead efficiently to the common motion of the DM and baryon components on scales relevant for collapse and formation of first luminous sources. This leads to early collapse, making it easier to explain the existence of supermassive BHs observed in quasars at high z &gt; 7 . The resultant net advection rate reaches minimum around ≲ 10 9 M ⊙ and subsequently rises to a secondary maximum near the typical mass of ∼ 10 12 M ⊙ , which may be an important consideration for formation of galaxies at z ≲ ( a few ) .},

By measuring the environmental state after the system-environment interaction, we bound the counting observables in the environment by the survival activity, which reduces to the dynamical activity in classical Markov processes. Remarkably, the relation derived herein holds for general open quantum systems with any counting observable and any initial state. Therefore, our relation is satisfied for classical Markov processes with arbitrary time-dependent transition rates and initial states. We apply our relation to continuous measurement and the quantum walk to find that the quantum nature of the system can enhance the precision. Moreover, we can make the lower bound arbitrarily small by employing appropriate continuous measurement.},

Using information geometry, we prove that irreversible entropy production is bounded from below by a modified Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states, thus strengthening the Clausius inequality in the reversible-Markov case. The modified metric can be regarded as a discrete-state generalization of the Wasserstein metric, which has been used to bound dissipation in continuous-state Langevin systems. Notably, the derived bounds can be interpreted as the quantum and classical speed limits, implying that the associated entropy production constrains the minimum time of transforming a system state. We illustrate the results on several systems and show that a tighter bound than the Carnot bound for the efficiency of quantum heat engines can be obtained.},

  abstract     = {High-quality long-distance entanglement is essential for both quantum communication and scalable quantum networks. Entanglement purification is to distill high-quality entanglement from low-quality entanglement in a noisy environment and it plays a key role in quantum repeaters. The previous significant entanglement purification experiments require two pairs of low-quality entangled states and were demonstrated in tabletop. Here we propose and report a high-efficiency and long-distance entanglement purification using only one pair of hyperentangled state. We also demonstrate its practical application in entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD). One pair of polarization spatial-mode hyperentanglement was distributed over 11 km multicore fiber (noisy channel). After purification, the fidelity of polarization entanglement arises from 0.771 to 0.887 and the effective key rate in entanglement-based QKD increases from 0 to 0.332. The values of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality of polarization entanglement arises from 1.829 to 2.128. Moreover, by using one pair of hyperentanglement and deterministic controlled-NOT gates, the total purification efficiency can be estimated as 6.6 × 10 3 times than the experiment using two pairs of entangled states with spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources. Our results offer the potential to be implemented as part of a full quantum repeater and large-scale quantum network.},

We show the transition between two phases characterized by distinct knots occur through exceptional points and come in two types. We further develop an algorithm to construct the corresponding tight-binding NH Hamiltonian for any desired knot, and propose a scheme to probe the knot structure via quantum quench.
