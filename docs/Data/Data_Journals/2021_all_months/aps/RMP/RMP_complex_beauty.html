  abstract = {The theory of entanglement provides a fundamentally new language for describing interactions and correlations in many-body systems. Its vocabulary consists of qubits and entangled pairs, and the syntax is provided by tensor networks. How matrix product states and projected entangled pair states describe many-body wave functions in terms of local tensors is reviewed. These tensors express how the entanglement is routed, act as a novel type of nonlocal order parameter, and the manner in which their symmetries are reflections of the global entanglement patterns in the full system is described. The manner in which tensor networks enable the construction of real-space renormalization group flows and fixed points is discussed, and the entanglement structure of states exhibiting topological quantum order is examined. Finally, a summary of the mathematical results of matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, highlighting the fundamental theorem of matrix product vectors and its applications, is provided.},

  abstract = {Water vapor is a greenhouse gas that dominates Earth’s terrestrial radiation absorption. As the planetary temperature warms, forced by increasing CO 2 and other greenhouse gases, water vapor content of the atmosphere increases, thereby producing the strongest positive feedback in the climate system. At the same time, the rate at which atmospheric temperature drops with height (the “lapse rate”) is expected to decrease with warming. This represents a smaller, but significant, negative feedback since it enables the planet to radiate more effectively to space. The two feedbacks are closely coupled to each other, and the combined result represents the foundational net positive feedback in the climate system, mandating substantial global warming in response to increased greenhouse gases. This review summarizes the published work that has provided an ever deepening understanding of these critical feedbacks. The historical context, beginning with the 19th century awakening to the importance of water vapor in the climate, is outlined before the review’s focus shifts to the theoretical, observational, and modeling work in recent decades that has transformed our understanding of the feedbacks’ role in climate change. It is shown that the evidence is now overwhelming that combined water vapor and lapse rate processes indeed provide the strongest positive feedback in the climate system. However, important challenges remain. This review provides physicists with a deeper understanding of these feedbacks and stimulates engagement with the climate research community. Together the scientific community can facilitate further rigor, understanding, and confidence in these most fundamental Earth system processes.},

  abstract = {The distinctive electronic properties of quasicrystals stem from their long-range structural order, with invariance under rotations and under discrete scale change, but without translational invariance. d -dimensional quasicrystals can be described in terms of lattices of higher dimension ( D &gt; d ), and many of their properties can be simply derived from analyses that take into account the extra “hidden” dimensions. In particular, as recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown, quasicrystals can have topological properties inherited from the parent crystals. These properties are discussed here for the simplest of quasicrystals, the one-dimensional (1D) Fibonacci chain. The Fibonacci noninteracting tight-binding Hamiltonians are characterized by the multifractality of the spectrum and states, which is manifested in many of its physical properties, most notably in transport. Perturbations due to disorder and reentrance phenomena are described, along with the crossover to strong Anderson localization. Perturbations due to boundary conditions also give information on the spatial and topological electronic properties, as is shown for the superconducting proximity effect. Related models including phonon and mixed Fibonacci models are discussed, as are generalizations to other quasiperiodic chains and higher-dimensional extensions. Interacting quasiperiodic systems and the case for many body localization are discussed. Some experimental realizations of the 1D quasicrystal and their potential applications are described.},

Particular emphasis is placed on photoinduced phenomena that do not result from ultrafast heating effects but rather emerge from microscopic processes that are inherently nonthermal in nature. Many of these processes can be described as transient modifications to the free energy landscape resulting from the redistribution of quasiparticle populations, the dynamical modification of coupling strengths, and the resonant driving of the crystal lattice. Other pathways result from the coherent dressing of a material’s quantum states by the light field. A selection of recently discovered effects leveraging these mechanisms, as well as the technological advances that led to their discovery, is discussed. A road map for how the field can harness these nonthermal pathways to create new functionalities is presented.},

A summary of the theoretical basis for describing heat transport in one-dimensional channels is first provided. The main experimental investigations of quantized heat conductance due to phonons, photons, electrons, and anyons in such channels are then presented. These experiments are important for understanding the fundamental processes that underlie the concept of a heat conductance quantum for a single channel. An illustration of how one can control the quantum heat transport by means of electric and magnetic fields, and how such tunable heat currents can be useful in devices, is first given. This lays the basis for realizing various thermal device components such as quantum heat valves, rectifiers, heat engines, refrigerators, and calorimeters. Also of interest are fluctuations of quantum heat currents, both for fundamental reasons and for optimizing the most sensitive thermal detectors; at the end of the Colloquium the status of research on this topic is given.},

  abstract = {Entropy production is a key quantity in any finite-time thermodynamic process. It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, embodying a tool to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to nonequilibrium processes. It is also often used in attempts to provide the quantitative characterization of logical and thermodynamic irreversibility, stemming from processes in physics, chemistry, and biology. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy production valid for general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet been formulated. Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, open quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial progress in such endeavors. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new generation of experiments able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes and the impact of entropy production on them. This review aims to provide a compendium on the current framework for the description, assessment, and manipulation of entropy production. Formal aspects of its formulation and the implications stemming from the potential quantum nature of a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments, are both presented.},

As no such signal has yet been detected, neutrino detectors are turned to in order to constrain the “most invisible channel.” The experimental techniques that are used to detect neutrinos are reviewed, and the expected contributions to the neutrino flux at current and upcoming neutrino experiments is revisited. Updated constraints are placed on the dark matter self-annihilation cross section to neutrinos ⟨ σ v ⟩ using the most recent data, and the sensitivity of upcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande, Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), and IceCube Gen2 is forecasted. Where possible, limits and projections are scaled to a single set of dark matter halo parameters for consistent comparison. Galactic and extragalactic signals of s -, p -, and d -wave annihilation processes directly into neutrino pairs are considered, yielding constraints that range from ⟨ σ v ⟩ ∼ 2.5 × 10 − 26 cm 3 s − 1 at 30 MeV / c 2 to 10 − 17 cm 3 s − 1 at 10 11 Ge V / c 2 .

Polarized atoms are often held in a container, most commonly a glass cell. Their interactions with the walls of the container during their collisions with the walls are often the main cause of spin relaxation, which determines the ultimate attainable polarization, and frequency shift, which affects the long-term frequency stability in atomic clocks. A critical review of studies of wall interactions of spin-polarized atoms done in the past six decades is presented, including the hydrogen atom, alkali metal atoms, and diamagnetic atoms with S 0 1 ground states such as mercury, cadmium, and noble gas atoms. The review summarizes the progress that has been made in understanding the nature of wall interactions and the physical mechanisms of spin relaxation and frequency shift due to wall collisions. It also points out those issues, particularly in connection with the widely used antirelaxation coatings, that are not yet understood.},

  abstract = {Since the parton model was introduced by Feynman more than 50 years ago, much has been learned about the partonic structure of the proton through a large body of high-energy experimental data and dedicated global fits. However, limited progress has been made in calculating partonic observables such as the parton distribution function (PDFs) from the fundamental theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Recently some advocated for a formalism, large-momentum effective theory (LaMET), through which one can extract parton physics from the properties of the proton traveling at a moderate boost factor such as γ ∼ 2 – 5 . The key observation behind this approach is that Lorentz symmetry allows the standard formalism of partons in terms of light-front operators to be replaced by an equivalent one with large-momentum states and time-independent operators of a universality class. With LaMET, the PDFs, generalized PDFs or generalized parton distributions, transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs, and light-front wave functions can all be extracted in principle from lattice simulations of QCD (or other nonperturbative methods) through standard effective field theory matching and running. Future lattice QCD calculations with exascale computational facilities could help one to understand the experimental data related to the hadronic structure, including those from the upcoming electron-ion colliders dedicated to exploring the partonic landscape of the proton. Here the progress made in the past few years in the development of the LaMET formalism and its applications is reviewed, with an emphasis on a demonstration of its effectiveness from initial lattice QCD simulations.},

  abstract = {The current status of baryogenesis is reviewed, with an emphasis on electroweak baryogenesis and leptogenesis. The first detailed studies were carried out for SU ( 5 ) grand unified theory (GUT) models where C P -violating decays of leptoquarks generate a baryon asymmetry. These GUT models were excluded by the discovery of unsuppressed, ( B + L )-violating sphaleron processes at high temperatures. Yet a new possibility emerged: electroweak baryogenesis. Here sphaleron processes generate a baryon asymmetry during a strongly first-order phase transition. This mechanism has been studied in detail in many extensions of the standard model. However, constraints from the LHC and from low-energy precision experiments exclude most of the known models, leaving composite Higgs models of electroweak symmetry breaking as an interesting possibility. Sphaleron processes are also the basis of leptogenesis, where C P -violating decays of heavy right-handed neutrinos generate a lepton asymmetry that is partially converted to a baryon asymmetry. This mechanism is closely related to that of GUT baryogenesis, and simple estimates based on GUT models can explain the order of magnitude of the observed baryon-to-photon ratio. In the one-flavor approximation an upper bound on the light-neutrino masses has been derived that is consistent with the cosmological upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses. For quasidegenerate right-handed neutrinos the leptogenesis temperature can be lowered from the GUT scale down to the weak scale, and C P -violating oscillations of GeV sterile neutinos can also lead to successful leptogenesis. Significant progress has been made in developing a full field-theoretical description of thermal leptogenesis, which demonstrated that interactions with gauge bosons of the thermal plasma play a crucial role. Finally, recent ideas on how the seesaw mechanism and B − L breaking at the GUT scale can be probed by gravitational waves are discussed.},

The former include a decrease in the uncertainty of the dimensionless fine-structure constant and a nearly two orders of magnitude improvement of particle masses expressed in units of kg due to the transition to the revised International System of Units (SI) with an exact value for the Planck constant. Further, because the elementary charge, Boltzmann constant, and Avogadro constant also have exact values in the revised SI, many other constants are either exact or have significantly reduced uncertainties. Inconsistencies remain for the gravitational constant and the muon magnetic-moment anomaly.

  abstract = {Many-body physics aims to understand emergent properties of systems made of many interacting objects. This review examines recent progress on the topic of radiative heat transfer in many-body systems consisting of thermal emitters interacting in the near-field regime. Near-field radiative heat transfer is a rapidly emerging field of research in which the cooperative behavior of emitters gives rise to peculiar effects that can be exploited to control heat flow at the nanoscale. Using an extension of the standard Polder and van Hove stochastic formalism to deal with thermally generated fields in N -body systems, along with their mutual interactions through multiple scattering, a generalized Landauer-like theory is derived to describe heat exchange mediated by thermal photons in arbitrary reciprocal and nonreciprocal multiterminal systems. In this review, this formalism is used to address both transport and dynamics in these systems from a unified perspective. The discussion covers (i) the description of nonadditivity of heat flux and its related effects, including fundamental limits as well as the role of nanostructuring and material choice; (ii) the study of equilibrium states and multistable states; (iii) the relaxation dynamics (thermalization) toward local and global equilibria; (iv) the analysis of heat transport regimes in ordered and disordered systems composed of a large number of objects, density, and range of interactions; and (v) the description of thermomagnetic effects in magneto-optical systems and heat transport mechanisms in non-Hermitian many-body systems. The review concludes with a listing of outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in synthetic and biological systems, broadly defined as the spontaneous organization of multiple subunits (macromolecules, particles, etc.) into ordered multiunit structures. The vast majority of equilibrium assembly processes give rise to two states: one consisting of dispersed disassociated subunits and the other consisting of a bulk-condensed state of unlimited size. This review focuses on the more specialized class of self-limiting assembly , which describes equilibrium assembly processes resulting in finite-size structures. These systems pose a generic and basic question, how do thermodynamic processes involving noncovalent interactions between identical subunits “measure” and select the size of assembled structures? This review begins with an introduction to the basic statistical mechanical framework for assembly thermodynamics that is used to highlight the key physical ingredients ensuring that equilibrium assembly will terminate at finite dimensions. Then examples of self-limiting assembly systems are introduced, and they are classified within this framework based on two broad categories: self-closing assemblies and open-boundary assemblies . These include well-known cases in biology and synthetic soft matter (micellization of amphiphiles and shell and tubule formation of tapered subunits) as well as less widely known classes of assemblies, such as short-range attractive or long-range repulsive systems and geometrically frustrated assemblies. For each of these self-limiting mechanisms, the physical mechanisms that select equilibrium assembly size, as well as the potential limitations of finite-size selection, are described. Finally, alternative mechanisms for finite-size assemblies are discussed, and contrasts are drawn with the size control that these can achieve relative to self-limitation in equilibrium, single-species assemblies.},

  abstract = {Events with vector bosons produced in association with jets have been extensively studied at hadron colliders and provide high-accuracy tests of the standard model. A good understanding of these processes is of paramount importance for precision Higgs physics, as well as for searches for new physics. In particular, associated production of γ , W , or Z bosons with light-flavor and heavy-flavor jets is a powerful tool for testing perturbative QCD calculations, Monte Carlo event generators, and can also constrain the parametrizations used to describe the parton content of the proton. Furthermore, events with a W or Z boson produced with two well-separated jets can be used to distinguish between electroweak and strong production mechanisms, and to set limits on contributions of physics beyond the standard model. This review summarizes the historical theoretical developments and the state-of-the-art in the modeling of vector-boson-plus-jet physics while focusing on experimental results by the LHC collaborations in run 1 and run 2 and including comparisons with recent measurements at the Tevatron.},

Simultaneously, the capability to synthesize new materials and apply nonthermal tuning parameters in situ has unlocked new dimensions in the study of all quantum materials.

  abstract = {Quantum-mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson-junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980s. In recent decades, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to gate-based digital quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED provides a framework for the study of hybrid quantum systems, such as quantum dots, magnons, Rydberg atoms, surface acoustic waves, and mechanical systems interacting with microwave photons. Here the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focusing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system are reviewed. Also discussed is coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics are discussed. Circuit QED realizes a broad set of concepts that open up new possibilities for the study of quantum physics at the macro scale with superconducting circuits and applications to quantum information science in the widest sense.},

  abstract = {Despite major advances in climate science over the last 30 years, persistent uncertainties in projections of future climate change remain. Climate projections are produced with increasingly complex models that attempt to represent key processes in the Earth system, including atmospheric and oceanic circulations, convection, clouds, snow, sea ice, vegetation, and interactions with the carbon cycle. Uncertainties in the representation of these processes feed through into a range of projections from the many state-of-the-art climate models now being developed and used worldwide. For example, despite major improvements in climate models, the range of equilibrium global warming due to doubling carbon dioxide still spans a range of more than 3. Here a promising way to make use of the ensemble of climate models to reduce the uncertainties in the sensitivities of the real climate system is reviewed. The emergent constraint approach uses the model ensemble to identify a relationship between an uncertain aspect of the future climate and an observable variation or trend in the contemporary climate. This review summarizes previous published work on emergent constraints and discusses the promise and potential dangers of the approach. Most importantly, it argues that emergent constraints should be based on well-founded physical principles such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This review will stimulate physicists to contribute to the rapidly developing field of emergent constraints on climate projections, bringing to it much needed rigor and physical insights.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade impressive progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of transport properties of clean, one-dimensional quantum lattice systems. Many physically relevant models in one dimension are Bethe-ansatz integrable, including the anisotropic spin- 1 / 2 Heisenberg (also called the spin- 1 / 2 XXZ chain) and the Fermi-Hubbard model. Nevertheless, practical computations of correlation functions and transport coefficients pose hard problems from both the conceptual and technical points of view. Only because of recent progress in the theory of integrable systems, on the one hand, and the development of numerical methods, on the other hand, has it become possible to compute their finite-temperature and nonequilibrium transport properties quantitatively. Owing to the discovery of a novel class of quasilocal conserved quantities, there is now a qualitative understanding of the origin of ballistic finite-temperature transport, and even diffusive or superdiffusive subleading corrections, in integrable lattice models. The current understanding of transport in one-dimensional lattice models, in particular, in the paradigmatic example of the spin- 1 / 2 XXZ and Fermi-Hubbard models, is reviewed, as well as state-of-the-art theoretical methods, including both analytical and computational approaches. Among other novel techniques, matrix-product-state-based simulation methods, dynamical typicality, and, in particular, generalized hydrodynamics are covered. The close and fruitful connection between theoretical models and recent experiments is discussed, with examples given from the realms of both quantum magnets and ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices.},

The most famous examples are Dirac and Weyl semimetals, in which the corresponding low-energy fermionic excitations, i.e., the Dirac and Weyl fermions, are direct analogs of elementary particles in quantum field theory. The last decade has witnessed an explosion of research activities in the field of TSMs thanks to precise theoretical predictions, well-controlled material synthesis, and advanced characterization techniques including angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, magnetotransport measurements, optical spectroscopy, etc. Here recent progress in three-dimensional TSMs is reviewed with an emphasis on their characteristic bulk electronic structures, including dimensionality (such as zero-dimensional nodal points, one-dimensional nodal lines, and two-dimensional nodal surfaces), degeneracy (twofold, threefold, fourfold, sixfold, or eightfold) of the band crossing, the slope (type I and type II) and order (linear, quadratic, or cubic) of the band dispersion near the crossing, the characteristic topological invariants (such as monopole charges), and the crystallographic symmetries that stabilize the band crossings. The distinct signatures of the various topological semimetal phases, such as the nontrivial surface states (including Fermi arcs of Dirac and Weyl semimetals) and the unique transport and optical responses (such as chiral anomaly-induced negative magnetoresistance in Dirac and Weyl semimetals), are also reviewed.},

In particular, how the paramount and genuinely NH concept of exceptional degeneracies, at which both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leads to phenomena drastically distinct from the familiar Hermitian realm is discussed. An immediate consequence is the ubiquitous occurrence of nodal NH topological phases with concomitant open Fermi-Seifert surfaces, where conventional band-touching points are replaced by the aforementioned exceptional degeneracies. Furthermore, new notions of gapped phases including topological phases in single-band systems are detailed, and the manner in which a given physical context may affect the symmetry-based topological classification is clarified. A unique property of NH systems with relevance beyond the field of topological phases consists of the anomalous relation between bulk and boundary physics, stemming from the striking sensitivity of NH matrices to boundary conditions. Unifying several complementary insights recently reported in this context, a picture of intriguing phenomena such as the NH bulk-boundary correspondence and the NH skin effect is put together. Finally, applications of NH topology in both classical systems including optical setups with gain and loss, electric circuits, and mechanical systems and genuine quantum systems such as electronic transport settings at material junctions and dissipative cold-atom setups are reviewed.},

The original axion was soon ruled out by laboratory experiments and astrophysical considerations, but a new version was invented that is much more weakly coupled and that evades the laboratory and astrophysical constraints. It was named the “invisible” axion. However, the axion cannot be arbitrarily weakly coupled because it is overproduced in the early Universe by vacuum realignment in the limit of vanishing coupling. The axions produced by vacuum realignment are a form of cold dark matter today. The axion provides a solution then not only to the strong C P problem but also to the dark matter problem. Various methods have been proposed to search for dark matter axions and for axions emitted by the Sun. Their implementation and improvement has led to significant constraints on the notion of an invisible axion. Even purely laboratory methods may place significant constraints on invisible axions or axionlike particles. This review discusses the various methods that have been proposed and provides theoretical derivations of their signals.},

  abstract = {The Novel Probes Project, an initiative to advance the field of astrophysical tests of the dark sector by creating a forum that connects observers and theorists, is introduced. This review focuses on tests of gravity and is intended to be of use primarily to observers, as well as theorists with an interest in the development of experimental tests. It is twinned with a separate upcoming review on dark matter self-interactions. The review focuses on astrophysical tests of gravity in the weak-field regime, ranging from stars to quasilinear cosmological scales. This regime is complementary to both strong-field tests of gravity and background and linear probes in cosmology. In particular, the nonlinear screening mechanisms that are an integral part of viable modified-gravity models lead to characteristic signatures, specifically on astrophysical scales. The potential of these probes is not limited by cosmic variance but comes with the challenge of building robust theoretical models of the nonlinear dynamics of stars, galaxies, and large-scale structure. The groundwork is laid for a thorough exploration of the weak-field, nonlinear regime, with an eye to using the current and next generation of observations for tests of gravity. The scene is set by showing how gravitational theories beyond general relativity are expected to behave, focusing primarily on screening mechanisms. Analytic and numerical techniques for exploring the relevant astrophysical regime are described, as are the pertinent observational signals. With these in hand a range of astrophysical tests of gravity are presented, and prospects for future measurements and theoretical developments are discussed.},

  abstract = {The production of about half of the heavy elements found in nature is assigned to a specific astrophysical nucleosynthesis process: the rapid neutron-capture process ( r process). Although this idea was postulated more than six decades ago, the full understanding faces two types of uncertainties or open questions: (a) The nucleosynthesis path in the nuclear chart runs close to the neutron-drip line, where presently only limited experimental information is available, and one has to rely strongly on theoretical predictions for nuclear properties. (b) While for many years the occurrence of the r process has been associated with supernovae, where the innermost ejecta close to the central neutron star were supposed to be neutron rich, more recent studies have cast substantial doubts on this environment. Possibly only a weak r process, with no or negligible production of the third r -process peak, can be accounted for, while much more neutron-rich conditions, including an r -process path with fission cycling, are likely responsible for the majority of the heavy r -process elements. Such conditions could result during the ejection of initially highly neutron-rich matter, as found in neutron stars, or during the fast ejection of matter that has previously experienced strong electron captures at high densities. Possible scenarios are the mergers of neutron stars, neutron-star–black hole mergers, but also include rare classes of supernovae as well as hypernovae or collapsars with polar jet ejecta, and possibly also accretion disk outflows related to the collapse of fast rotating massive stars. The composition of the ejecta from each event determines the temporal evolution of the r -process abundances during the “chemical” evolution of the Galaxy. Stellar r -process abundance observations have provided insight into and constraints on the frequency of and conditions in the responsible stellar production sites. One of them, neutron-star mergers, was just identified thanks to the observation of the r -process kilonova electromagnetic transient following the gravitational wave event GW170817. These observations, which are becoming increasingly precise due to improved experimental atomic data and high-resolution observations, have been particularly important in defining the heavy element abundance patterns of the old halo stars, and thus in determining the extent and nature of the earliest nucleosynthesis in the Galaxy. Combining new results and important breakthroughs in the related nuclear, atomic, and astronomical fields of science, this review attempts to answer the question “How were the elements from iron to uranium made?”},

  abstract = {Yearslong time series of high-precision brightness measurements have been assembled for thousands of stars with telescopes operating in space. Such data have allowed astronomers to measure the physics of stellar interiors via nonradial oscillations, opening a new avenue to study the stars in the Universe. Asteroseismology, the interpretation of the characteristics of oscillation modes in terms of the physical properties of the stellar interior, brought entirely new insights in how stars rotate and how they build up their chemistry throughout their evolution. Data-driven space asteroseismology has delivered a drastic increase in the reliability of computer models mimicking the evolution of stars born with a variety of masses and metallicities. Such models are critical ingredients for modern physics as a whole because they are used throughout various contemporary and multidisciplinary research fields in space science, including the search for life outside the Solar System, archaeological studies of the Milky Way, and the study of single and binary supernova progenitors, among which are future gravitational wave sources. The specific role and potential of asteroseismology for those modern research fields are illustrated. The review concludes with current limitations of asteroseismology and highlights how they can be overcome with ongoing and future large infrastructures for survey astronomy combined with new theoretical research in the era of high-performance computing. This review presents results obtained through major community efforts over the past decade. These breakthroughs were achieved in a collaborative and inclusive spirit that is characteristic of the asteroseismology community. The review’s aim is to make this research field accessible to graduate students and readers coming from other fields of physics, with incentives to enjoy and join future applications in this domain of astrophysics.},

  abstract = {The state-of-the-art knowledge of ferroelectric and ferroelastic group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers is surveyed. These semiconductors feature remarkable structural and mechanical properties, such as a switchable in-plane spontaneous polarization, soft elastic constants, structural degeneracies, and thermally driven two-dimensional structural transformations. Additionally, these 2D materials display selective valley excitations, valley Hall effects, and persistent spin helix behavior. After a description of their Raman spectra, a discussion of optical properties arising from their lack of centrosymmetry (such as an unusually strong second-harmonic intensity, large bulk photovoltaic effects, photostriction, and tunable exciton binding energies) is provided as well. The physical properties observed in these materials originate from (correlate with) their intrinsic and switchable electric polarization, and the physical behavior hereby reviewed could be of use in nonvolatile memory, valleytronic, spintronic, and optoelectronic devices: these 2D multiferroics enrich and diversify the 2D material toolbox.},
