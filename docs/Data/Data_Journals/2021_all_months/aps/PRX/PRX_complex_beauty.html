  abstract     = {Recent developments in higherorder topological phases have revealed the relationship between nontrivial multipole moments in the bulk and the emergence of fractionally quantized charges at the boundary. Here, we put forth a proposal of the three-dimensional octupole insulator with fractionally quantized corner charges ± e / 8 : sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt. The fractional quantization of the corner charge is unaffected by the quantum fluctuation of the electric charge per ion, as we demonstrate explicitly with ab initio calculations. We further show that the electrostatic signature of the fractional charge is well preserved even when the ideal crystal is sprinkled with defects, and provide a systematic analysis on how the corner charge contribution could be isolated from the electric-field corrections originating from realistic surface relaxation. Our results suggest that the observation of corner charges from quantized multipole moments in solids might be imminent.},

We perform a self-consistent Hartree-Fock study that incorporates these effects alongside realistic interaction and substrate potentials and explore a comprehensive set of competing orders including those that break translational symmetry at arbitrary wave vectors. We find that at all nonzero integer fillings very small strains, comparable to those measured in scanning tunneling experiments, stabilize a fundamentally new type of time-reversal-symmetric and spatially nonuniform order. This order, which we dub the “incommensurate Kekulé spiral” (IKS) order, spontaneously breaks both the emergent valley-charge conservation and moiré translation symmetries but preserves a modified translation symmetry T ^ ′ —which simultaneously shifts the spatial coordinates and rotates the U ( 1 ) angle which characterizes the spontaneous intervalley coherence. We discuss the phenomenological and microscopic properties of this order. We argue that our findings are consistent with all experimental observations reported so far, suggesting a unified explanation of the global phase diagram in terms of the IKS order.},

  abstract     = {Efficient quantum state measurement is important for maximizing the extracted information from a quantum system. For multiqubit quantum processors, in particular, the development of a scalable architecture for rapid and high-fidelity readout remains a critical unresolved problem. Here we propose reservoir computing as a resource-efficient solution to quantum measurement of superconducting multiqubit systems. We consider a small network of Josephson parametric oscillators, which can be implemented with minimal device overhead and in the same platform as the measured quantum system. We theoretically analyze the operation of such a device as a reservoir computer to classify stochastic time-dependent signals subject to quantum statistical features. We apply this reservoir computer to the task of multinomial classification of measurement trajectories from joint multiqubit readout. For a 2-qubit dispersive measurement under realistic conditions we demonstrate a classification fidelity reliably exceeding that of an optimal linear filter using only 2–5 reservoir nodes, while simultaneously requiring far less calibration data—as little as a few shots per state. We understand this remarkable performance through an analysis of the network dynamics and develop an intuitive picture of reservoir processing generally. Finally, we demonstrate how to operate this device to perform 2-qubit state tomography and continuous parity monitoring with equal effectiveness and ease of calibration. This reservoir processor avoids computationally intensive training common to other machine learning frameworks and can be implemented as an integrated cryogenic superconducting device for low-latency processing of quantum signals on the computational edge.},

We show that increasing the number of measured observables will always produce a tighter bound. This tighter bound becomes particularly useful if one of the observables is a conserved quantity, whose expectation is invariant under a given perturbation of the system. For the case of the TUR, we show that this applies to any function of the state of the system. The resulting correlation TUR takes into account the correlations between a current and a noncurrent observable, thereby tightening the TUR. We demonstrate our finding on a model of the F 1 -ATPase molecular motor, a Markov jump model consisting of two rings and transport through a two-dimensional channel. We find that the correlation TUR is significantly tighter than the TUR and can be close to an equality even far from equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Detection of the energy conversion pathways between photons, charge carriers, and the lattice is of fundamental importance to understand fundamental physics and to advance materials and devices. Yet, such insight remains incomplete due to experimental challenges in disentangling the various signatures on overlapping timescales. Here, we show that attosecond core-level x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XANES) meets this challenge by providing an unambiguous and simultaneous view on the temporal evolution of the photon-carrier-phonon system. We provide surprising new results by applying the method to graphite, a seemingly well-studied system whose investigation is complicated by a variety of mechanisms occurring across a wide range of temporal scales. The simultaneous real-time measurement of electrons and holes reveals disparate scattering mechanisms for infrared excitation close to the Fermi energy. We find that ultrafast dephasing of the coherent carrier dynamics is governed by impact excitation (IE) for electrons, while holes exhibit a switchover from impact excitation to Auger heating (AH) already during the 11-fs duration of the infrared light field. We attribute this switchover to the limited scattering phase space in the n -doped material. We further elucidate the excitation mechanisms of strongly coupled optical phonons (SCOPs). The coherent excitation of both SCOPs is nondisplacive and is explained by the strong electron-phonon scattering, i.e., via a seemingly incoherent process. We identify the A 1 ′ phonon as the dominating channel for dissipation of electronic coherence. Moreover, unobserved in graphite, we find high-frequency oscillations up to 90 THz, which arise from the modulation of the electronic density of states by the atomic displacements along the E 2 g and A 1 ′ modes. These measurements establish the utility of core-level XANES with attosecond temporal resolution to achieve an unambiguous and simultaneous view on the temporal evolution of the photon-carrier-phonon system with surprising new results even for a seemingly well-studied system like graphite. While the graphite measurement was conducted around the K edge of carbon, adapting the methodology to other materials only requires spectra coverage of the respective elemental edge of the material’s constituent. This flexibility makes our methodology widely applicable to detect and distinguish the various dynamic contributions to the flow of energy inside materials on their native timescales.},

  abstract     = {We introduce topological invariants for gapless systems and study the associated boundary phenomena. More generally, the symmetry properties of the low-energy conformal field theory (CFT) provide discrete invariants establishing the notion of symmetry-enriched quantum criticality. The charges of nonlocal scaling operators, or more generally, of symmetry defects, are topological and imply the presence of localized edge modes. We primarily focus on the 1 + 1 d case where the edge has a topological degeneracy, whose finite-size splitting can be exponential or algebraic in system size depending on the involvement of additional gapped sectors. An example of the exponential case is given by tuning the spin-1 Heisenberg chain to a symmetry-breaking Ising phase. An example of the algebraic case arises between the gapped Ising and cluster phases: This symmetry-enriched Ising CFT has an edge mode with finite-size splitting scaling as 1 / L 14 . In addition to such new cases, our formalism unifies various examples previously studied in the literature. Similar to gapped symmetry-protected topological phases, a given CFT can split into several distinct symmetry-enriched CFTs. This raises the question of classification, to which we give a partial answer—including a complete characterization of symmetry-enriched 1 + 1 d Ising CFTs. Nontrivial topological invariants can also be constructed in higher dimensions, which we illustrate for a symmetry-enriched 2 + 1 d CFT without gapped sectors.},

Realizing this high-level function requires a system capable of several low-level primitives, including single-qubit and two-qubit operations, midcircuit measurements of subsets of qubits, real-time processing of measurement outcomes, and the ability to condition subsequent gate operations on those measurements. In this work, we use a 10-qubit quantum charge-coupled device trapped-ion quantum computer to encode a single logical qubit using the [ [ 7 , 1 , 3 ] ] color code, first proposed by Steane [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 , 793 (1996) ]. The logical qubit is initialized into the eigenstates of three mutually unbiased bases using an encoding circuit, and we measure an average logical state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error of 1.7 ( 2 ) × 10 − 3 , compared to the average physical SPAM error 2.4 ( 4 ) × 10 − 3 of our qubits. We then perform multiple syndrome measurements on the encoded qubit, using a real-time decoder to determine any necessary corrections that are done either as software updates to the Pauli frame or as physically applied gates. Moreover, these procedures are done repeatedly while maintaining coherence, demonstrating a dynamically protected logical qubit memory. Additionally, we demonstrate non-Clifford qubit operations by encoding a T ¯ | + ⟩ L magic state with an error rate below the threshold required for magic state distillation. Finally, we present system-level simulations that allow us to identify key hardware upgrades that may enable the system to reach the pseudothreshold.},

It is of great interest to understand how topological states behave in the presence of interparticle interactions and nonlinearity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate backscatter-immune unidirectional solitonlike nonlinear states on the edge of photonic topological insulators consisting of laser-written waveguides. As a result of the optical Kerr nonlinearity of the ambient glass, the solitonlike wave packet forms a long-lived quasilocalized coherent structure that slowly radiates power into the bulk and along the edge. The realization of solitonlike edge states paves the way to an understanding of nonlinear and interacting topological systems.},

  abstract     = {Light-matter interaction based on strong laser fields enables probing the structure and dynamics of atomic and molecular systems with unprecedented resolutions, through high-order harmonic spectroscopy, laser-induced electron diffraction, and holography. All strong-field processes rely on a primary ionization mechanism where electrons tunnel through the target potential barrier lowered by the laser field. Tunnel ionization is, thus, of paramount importance in strong-field physics and attoscience. However, the tunneling dynamics and properties of the outgoing electronic wave packets often remain hidden beneath the influence of the subsequent scattering of the released electron onto the ionic potential. Here, we present a joint experimental-theoretical endeavor to characterize the influence of sub-barrier dynamics on the amplitude and phase of the wave packets emerging from the tunnel. We use chiral molecules, whose photoionization by circularly polarized light produces forward-backward asymmetric electron distributions with respect to the light propagation direction. These asymmetric patterns provide a background-free signature of the chiral potential in the ionization process. We first implement the attoclock technique, using bicircular two-color fields. We find that, in the tunnel-ionization process, molecular chirality induces a strong forward-backward asymmetry in the electron yield, while the subsequent scattering of the freed electron onto the chiral potential leads to an asymmetric angular streaking of the electron momentum distribution. In order to access the phase of the tunneling wave packets, we introduce subcycle gated chiral interferometry. We employ an orthogonally polarized two-color laser field whose optical chirality is manipulated on a sub-laser-cycle timescale. Numerical simulations are used to interpret the electron interference patterns inherent to this interaction scheme. They show that the combined action of the chiral potential and rotating laser field not only imprints asymmetric ionization amplitudes during the tunneling process, but also induces a forward-backward asymmetric phase profile onto the outgoing electron wave packets. Chiral light-matter interaction thus induces subtle angular-dependent shaping of both the amplitude and the phase of tunneling wave packets.},

While the optical pump (photon energy of 3.1 eV) induces a strongly nonthermal electron distribution, terahertz excitation (4.1 meV) results in a quasithermal perturbation of the electron population. The pump-induced spin and electron dynamics are interrogated by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE). A deconvolution procedure allows us to push the time resolution down to 130 fs, even though the driving terahertz pulse is about 500 fs long. Remarkably, the MOKE signals exhibit an almost identical time evolution for both optical and terahertz pump pulses, despite the 3 orders of magnitude different number of excited electrons. We are able to quantitatively explain our results using a nonthermal model based on quasielastic spin-flip scattering. It shows that, in the small-perturbation limit, the rate of demagnetization of a metallic ferromagnet is proportional to the excess energy of the electrons, independent of the precise shape of their distribution. Our results reveal that, for simple metallic ferromagnets, the dynamics of ultrafast demagnetization and of the closely related terahertz spin transport do not depend on the pump photon energy.},

Here, we utilize ultracold atoms to simulate the dynamics of 1D Heisenberg spin chains and observe fast, local spin decay controlled by the anisotropy. However, even for isotropic interactions, we observe dephasing due to a new effect: an effective magnetic field created by superexchange. If spatially uniform, it leads only to uniform spin precession and is, therefore, typically ignored. However, we show through experimental studies and extensive numerical simulations how this superexchange-generated field is relevant and leads to additional dephasing mechanisms over the exchange anisotropy: There is dephasing due to (i) inhomogeneity of the effective field from variations of lattice depth between chains; (ii) a twofold reduction of the field at the edges of finite chains; and (iii) fluctuations of the effective field due to the presence of mobile holes in the system. The latter is a new coupling mechanism between holes and magnons. All these dephasing mechanisms have not been observed before with ultracold atoms and illustrate basic properties of the underlying Hubbard model.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the nearsightedness principle, the low-energy electronic structure of solids can be represented by localized states such as the Wannier functions. Wannier functions are actively being applied to a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter systems. However, the Wannier-function-based representation is limited to a small number of bands and thus cannot describe the change of wave functions due to various kinds of perturbations, which require sums over an infinite number of bands. Here, we introduce the concept of the Wannier function perturbation, which provides a localized representation of wave function perturbations. Wannier function perturbation theory allows efficient calculation of numerous quantities involving wave function perturbation, among which we provide three applications. First, we calculate the temperature-dependent indirect optical absorption spectra of silicon near the absorption edge nonadiabatically, i.e., differentiating phonon-absorption and phonon-emission processes, and without arbitrary temperature-dependent shifts in energy. Second, we establish a theory to calculate the shift spin conductivity without any band-truncation error. Unlike the shift charge conductivity, an exact calculation of the shift spin conductivity is not possible within the conventional Wannier function methods because it cannot be obtained from geometric quantities for low-energy bands. We apply the theory to monolayer WTe 2 . Third, we calculate the spin Hall conductivity of the same material again without any band-truncation error. Wannier function perturbation theory is a versatile method that can be readily applied to calculate a wide range of quantities related to various kinds of perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Interactions between electrons and lattice vibrations are responsible for a wide range of material properties and applications. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the development of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) as a tool for measuring electron-phonon ( e -ph) interactions. Here, we demonstrate the ability of RIXS to probe the interaction between phonons and specific electronic states both near to, and away from, the Fermi level. We perform carbon K -edge RIXS measurements on graphite, tuning the incident x-ray energy to separately probe the interactions of the π * and σ * electronic states. Our high-resolution data reveal detailed structure in the multiphonon RIXS features that directly encodes the momentum dependence of the e -ph interaction strength. We develop a Green’s-function method to model this structure, which naturally accounts for the phonon and interaction-strength dispersions, as well as the mixing of phonon momenta in the intermediate state. This model shows that the differences between the spectra can be fully explained by contrasting trends of the e -ph interaction through the Brillouin zone, being concentrated at the Γ and K points for the π * states while being significant at all momenta for the σ * states. Our results advance the interpretation of phonon excitations in RIXS and extend its applicability as a probe of e -ph interactions to a new range of out-of-equilibrium situations.},

We show that the elasticity theory of quasicrystals, which accounts for both “phonon” and “phason” modes, admits nontrivial quantized topological terms with far richer structure than their crystalline counterparts. We show that these terms correspond to distinct phases of matter and also uncover intrinsically quasicrystalline phases, which have no crystalline analogs. For quasicrystals with internal U(1) symmetry, we discuss a number of interpretations and physical implications of the topological terms, including constraints on the mobility of dislocations in d = 2 quasicrystals and a quasicrystalline generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Oshikawa-Hastings theorem. We then extend these ideas much further and address the complete classification of quasicrystalline topological phases, including systems with point-group symmetry as well as noninvertible phases. We hence obtain the “quasicrystalline equivalence principle,” which generalizes the classification of crystalline topological phases to the quasicrystalline setting.},

  abstract     = {Continued timing observations of the double pulsar PSR J0737–3039A/B, which consists of two active radio pulsars (A and B) that orbit each other with a period of 2.45 h in a mildly eccentric ( e = 0.088 ) binary system, have led to large improvements in the measurement of relativistic effects in this system. With a 16-yr data span, the results enable precision tests of theories of gravity for strongly self-gravitating bodies and also reveal new relativistic effects that have been expected but are now observed for the first time. These include effects of light propagation in strong gravitational fields which are currently not testable by any other method. In particular, we observe the effects of retardation and aberrational light bending that allow determination of the spin direction of the pulsar. In total, we detect seven post-Keplerian parameters in this system, more than for any other known binary pulsar. For some of these effects, the measurement precision is now so high that for the first time we have to take higher-order contributions into account. These include the contribution of the A pulsar’s effective mass loss (due to spin-down) to the observed orbital period decay, a relativistic deformation of the orbit, and the effects of the equation of state of superdense matter on the observed post-Keplerian parameters via relativistic spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the implications of our findings, including those for the moment of inertia of neutron stars, and present the currently most precise test of general relativity’s quadrupolar description of gravitational waves, validating the prediction of general relativity at a level of 1.3 × 10 − 4 with 95\% confidence. We demonstrate the utility of the double pulsar for tests of alternative theories of gravity by focusing on two specific examples and also discuss some implications of the observations for studies of the interstellar medium and models for the formation of the double pulsar system. Finally, we provide context to other types of related experiments and prospects for the future.},

  abstract     = {The majority of ions and other charged particles of spectroscopic interest lack the fast, cycling transitions that are necessary for direct laser cooling. In most cases, they can still be cooled sympathetically through their Coulomb interaction with a second, coolable ion species confined in the same potential. If the charge-to-mass ratios of the two ion types are too mismatched, the cooling of certain motional degrees of freedom becomes difficult. This limits both the achievable fidelity of quantum gates and the spectroscopic accuracy. Here, we introduce a novel algorithmic cooling protocol for transferring phonons from poorly to efficiently cooled modes. We demonstrate it experimentally by simultaneously bringing two motional modes of a Be + − Ar 13 + mixed Coulomb crystal close to their zero-point energies, despite the weak coupling between the ions. We reach the lowest temperature reported for a highly charged ion, with a residual temperature of only T ≲ 200 μ K in each of the two modes, corresponding to a residual mean motional phonon number of ⟨ n ⟩ ≲ 0.4 . Combined with the lowest observed electric-field noise in a radio-frequency ion trap, these values enable an optical clock based on a highly charged ion with fractional systematic uncertainty below the 10 − 18 level. Our scheme is also applicable to (anti)protons, molecular ions, macroscopic charged particles, and other highly charged ion species, enabling reliable preparation of their motional quantum ground states in traps.},

When the electronic structure near the Fermi level is characterized by fermions with angular momentum j = 3 / 2 due to strong spin-orbit interactions, novel pairing states such as even-parity quintet ( J = 2 ) and odd-parity septet ( J = 3 ) states are allowed. Prime candidates for such exotic states are half-Heusler superconductors, which exhibit unconventional superconducting properties, but their pairing nature remains unsettled. Here, we show that the superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric half-Heusler LuPdBi can be consistently described by the admixture of isotropic even-parity singlet and anisotropic odd-parity septet pairing, whose ratio can be tuned by electron irradiation. From magnetotransport and penetration depth measurements, we find that carrier concentrations and impurity scattering both increase with irradiation, resulting in a nonmonotonic change of the superconducting gap structure. Our findings shed new light on our fundamental understanding of unconventional superconducting states in topological materials.},

Involving prolonged dwells interrupted by instantaneous transitions between nodes, such Markov networks stand as a coarse-graining paradigm for chemical reactions, gene expression, molecular machines, spreading of diseases, protein dynamics, diffusion in energy landscapes, epigenetics, and many others. However, as soon as transitions cease to be negligibly short, as often observed in experiments, the dynamics develops a memory. That is, state changes depend not only on the present state but also on the past. Here, we establish the first thermodynamically consistent—dissipation-preserving—mapping of continuous dynamics onto a network, which reveals ingrained dynamical symmetries and an unforeseen kinetic hysteresis. These symmetries impose three independent sources of fluctuations in state-to-state kinetics that determine the “flavor of memory.” The hysteresis between the forward- or backward-in-time coarse graining of continuous trajectories implies a new paradigm for the thermodynamics of active molecular processes in the presence of memory, that is, beyond the assumption of local detailed balance. Our results provide a new understanding of fluctuations in the operation of molecular machines as well as catch bonds involved in cellular adhesion.},

How such characteristics are related to the underlying microscopic processes of the driven and dissipative system is a fundamental question. Here, we address this point in a quantum gas that is strongly coupled to a lossy optical cavity mode using two independent Raman drives, which act on the spin and motional degrees of freedom of the atoms. This setting allows us to control the competition between coherent dynamics and dissipation by adjusting the imbalance between the drives. For strong enough coupling, the transition to a superradiant phase occurs, as is the case for a closed system. Yet, by imbalancing the drives, we can enter a dissipation-stabilized normal phase and a region of multistability. Measuring the properties of excitations on top of the out-of-equilibrium phases reveals the microscopic elementary processes in the open system. Our findings provide prospects for studying squeezing in non-Hermitian systems, quantum jumps in superradiance, and dynamical spin-orbit coupling in a dissipative setting.},

These circuits are built from basic quantum operations available for the particular sensor platform, such as one-axis twisting, or finite range interactions. Optimization is defined relative to a cost function, which in the present study is the Bayesian mean squared error of the estimated phase for a given prior distribution; i.e., we optimize for a finite dynamic range of the interferometer. In analogous variational optimizations of optical atomic clocks, we use the Allan deviation for a given Ramsey interrogation time as the relevant cost function for the long-term instability. Remarkably, even low-depth quantum circuits yield excellent results that closely approach the fundamental quantum limits for optimal Ramsey interferometry and atomic clocks. The quantum metrological schemes identified here are readily applicable to atomic clocks based on optical lattices, tweezer arrays, or trapped ions. While in the present work variationally optimized circuits are found with classical simulations, optimization can also be performed “on” the (physical) quantum sensor, also in regimes not accessible to classical computations and in the presence of imperfections.},

In particular, the reservoir can be tailored to have a memory of past interactions with emitters, in contrast to memoryless Markovian dynamics of typical open systems. In this article, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a superconducting qubit strongly coupled to a superconducting waveguide engineered to have both a sharp spectral variation in its transmission properties and a slowing of light by a factor of 650. Tuning the qubit into the spectral vicinity of the passband of this slow-light waveguide reservoir, we observe a 400-fold change in the emission rate of the qubit, along with oscillatory energy relaxation of the qubit resulting from the beating of bound and radiative dressed qubit-photon states. Furthermore, upon addition of a reflective boundary to one end of the waveguide, we observe revivals in the qubit population on a timescale 30 times longer than the inverse of the qubit’s emission rate, corresponding to the round-trip travel time of an emitted photon. By in situ tuning of the qubit-waveguide interaction strength, we also probe a crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian qubit emission dynamics in the presence of feedback from waveguide reflections. With this superconducting circuit platform, future studies of multiqubit interactions via highly structured reservoirs and the generation of multiphoton highly entangled states are possible.},

Seemingly unrelated recent advances in the quantum interactions of electrons and light have raised interest in the underlying classical-quantum correspondence principle at the foundations of electron acceleration. Here, we present the observation of the underlying quantum nature of DLAs: observing quantized peaks in the electron-energy spectra. Our findings demonstrate quasi-phase-matching between an electron wave function and a light wave, which also demonstrates the role of the quantum wave function in the inverse Smith-Purcell effect. We harness the capabilities of an ultrafast transmission electron microscope (UTEM) to maintain a long electron-light interaction length extending over hundreds of periods of the laser pulse, mediated by a silicon-photonic nanograting DLA. The UTEM is shown as a new platform for characterization of future DLA concepts. The results raise fundamental questions regarding the role of quantum mechanics in DLA design, and more generally about the prospects of manipulating particles’ quantum wave functions in accelerator physics.},

We use coherent population trapping and optically driven electronic spin resonance to confirm coherent access to the qubit at 1.7 K and obtain spin Rabi oscillations at a rate of Ω / 2 π = 19.0 ( 1 ) MHz . All-optical Ramsey interferometry reveals a spin dephasing time of T 2 * = 1.3 ( 3 ) μ s , and four-pulse dynamical decoupling already extends the spin-coherence time to T 2 = 0.30 ( 8 ) ms .

  abstract     = {We develop an efficient approach for computing two-particle response functions and interaction vertices for multiorbital strongly correlated systems based on the rotationally invariant slave-boson framework. The method is applied to the degenerate three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model for investigating the origin of the s -wave orbital antisymmetric spin-triplet superconductivity in Hund’s metal regime, previously found in the dynamical mean-field theory studies. By computing the pairing interaction considering the particle-particle and the particle-hole scattering channels, we identify the mechanism leading to the pairing instability around Hund’s metal crossover arises from the particle-particle channel, which contains the local electron pair fluctuation between different particle-number sectors of the atomic Hilbert space. On the other hand, the particle-hole spin fluctuations induce the s -wave pairing instability before entering Hund’s regime. Our approach paves the way for investigating the pairing mechanism in realistic correlated materials.},

  abstract     = {The successful implementation of algorithms on quantum processors relies on the accurate control of quantum bits (qubits) to perform logic gate operations. In this era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, systematic miscalibrations, drift, and crosstalk in the control of qubits can lead to a coherent form of error that has no classical analog. Coherent errors severely limit the performance of quantum algorithms in an unpredictable manner, and mitigating their impact is necessary for realizing reliable quantum computations. Moreover, the average error rates measured by randomized benchmarking and related protocols are not sensitive to the full impact of coherent errors and therefore do not reliably predict the global performance of quantum algorithms, leaving us unprepared to validate the accuracy of future large-scale quantum computations. Randomized compiling is a protocol designed to overcome these performance limitations by converting coherent errors into stochastic noise, dramatically reducing unpredictable errors in quantum algorithms and enabling accurate predictions of algorithmic performance from error rates measured via cycle benchmarking. In this work, we demonstrate significant performance gains under randomized compiling for the four-qubit quantum Fourier transform algorithm and for random circuits of variable depth on a superconducting quantum processor. Additionally, we accurately predict algorithm performance using experimentally measured error rates. Our results demonstrate that randomized compiling can be utilized to leverage and predict the capabilities of modern-day noisy quantum processors, paving the way forward for scalable quantum computing.},

  abstract     = {Cell neighbor exchanges are integral to tissue rearrangements in biology, including development and repair. Often, these processes occur via topological T1 transitions analogous to those observed in foams, grains, and colloids. However, in contrast to those in nonliving materials, the T1 transitions in biological tissues are rate limited and cannot occur instantaneously due to the finite time required to remodel complex structures at cell-cell junctions. Here, we study how this rate-limiting process affects the mechanics and collective behavior of cells in a tissue by introducing this important biological constraint in a theoretical vertex-based model as an intrinsic single-cell property. We report that, in the absence of this time constraint, the tissue undergoes a glass transition with lowering of cell motility characterized by a sharp increase in the intermittency of cell-cell rearrangements. Remarkably, this glass transition disappears, as T1 transitions are temporally limited. As a unique consequence of limited rearrangements, we also find that the tissue develops spatially correlated populations of fast and slow cells, in which the fast cells organize into streamlike patterns and maintain optimally stable cell-cell contacts. The predictions of this work are compared with existing in vivo experiments in Drosophila pupal development.},

Quantum error correction is expected to eventually enable fault-tolerant quantum computation at large scales, but until then, it will be necessary to use alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of errors. We propose a near-term friendly strategy to mitigate errors by entangling and measuring M copies of a noisy state ρ . This enables us to estimate expectation values with respect to a state with dramatically reduced error ρ M / Tr ( ρ M ) without explicitly preparing it, hence the name “virtual distillation.” As M increases, this state approaches the closest pure state to ρ exponentially quickly. We analyze the effectiveness of virtual distillation and find that it is governed in many regimes by the behavior of this pure state (corresponding to the dominant eigenvector of ρ ). We numerically demonstrate that virtual distillation is capable of suppressing errors by multiple orders of magnitude and explain how this effect is enhanced as the system size grows. Finally, we show that this technique can improve the convergence of randomized quantum algorithms, even in the absence of device noise.},

We validate this approach by bulk and surface-enhanced Raman scattering and infrared absorption measurements. We develop a virtual screening methodology performed on databases of millions of commercially available compounds. Quantum-chemistry calculations for about 3000 compounds are complemented by machine-learning methods to predict applicability of 93 000 organic molecules for detection. Training is performed on vibrational spectroscopic properties based on absorption and Raman scattering intensities. Our top molecules have conversion intensity two orders of magnitude higher than an average molecule from the database. We also discuss how other properties like molecular shape and self-assembling properties influence the detection efficiency. We identify molecular moieties whose presence in the molecules indicates high activity for THz detection and show an example where a simple modification of a frequently used self-assembling compound can enhance activity 85-fold. The capabilities of our screening method are demonstrated on narrow-band and broadband detection examples, and its possible applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopy are also discussed.},

However, another fundamental feature of the QSHE, that of spin-momentum locking in the edge channel, has not been demonstrated. Here, we report that in an applied magnetic field the edge conductance in monolayer WTe 2 , a candidate QSHE material, is suppressed by the component of the field perpendicular to a particular axis, implying that the spin in the edge states lies along this axis. Surprisingly, the axis is independent of edge orientation, chemical potential, and sample, being fixed relative to the monolayer crystal structure, lying at ( 40 ± 2 ) ° to the layer normal within the mirror plane. This finding is consistent with a theoretical model in which the bulk bands nearest the Fermi energy have the same parity, leading to simple spin texture with a single, momentum-independent spin axis that is inherited by the edge modes. In addition, the results strengthen the case for spin-momentum locking and, therefore, that monolayer WTe 2 is a natural two-dimensional topological insulator exhibiting the QSHE.},

  abstract     = {In circuit-based quantum computing the available gate set typically consists of single-qubit gates acting on each individual qubit and at least one entangling gate between pairs of qubits. In certain physical architectures, however, some qubits may be “hidden” and lacking direct addressability through dedicated control and readout lines, for instance, because of limited on-chip routing capabilities, or because the number of control lines becomes a limiting factor for many-qubit systems. In this case, no single-qubit operations can be applied to the hidden qubits and their state cannot be measured directly. Instead, they may be controlled and read out only via single-qubit operations on connected “control” qubits and a suitable set of two-qubit gates. We first discuss the impact of such restricted control capabilities on the performance of specific qubit coupling networks. We then experimentally demonstrate full control and measurement capabilities in a superconducting two-qubit device with local single-qubit control and i swap and controlled-phase two-qubit interactions enabled by a tunable coupler. We further introduce an iterative tune-up process required to completely characterize the gate set used for quantum process tomography and evaluate the resulting gate fidelities.},

We analytically provide three such examples. The first two examples focus on scale-invariant systems, which generalize fermionization to the hydrodynamics of strongly interacting systems, and determine specific initial conditions for perfect density oscillations in a harmonic trap. The third example recovers the dark soliton solution in a one-dimensional Bose condensate. The results can explain a recent puzzling experimental observation in ultracold atomic gases by the Paris group and make further predictions for future experiments. We envision that extensive examples of such an ideal-gas approach to hydrodynamics can be found by systematical numerical search, which can find broad applications in different problems in various subfields of physics.},

To understand the impact of the CDW order on the electronic structure in these systems, we present quantum oscillation measurements on single crystals of CsV 3 Sb 5 . Our data provide direct evidence that the CDW invokes a substantial reconstruction of the Fermi surface pockets associated with the vanadium orbitals and the kagome lattice framework. In conjunction with density functional theory modeling, we are able to identify split oscillation frequencies originating from reconstructed pockets built from vanadium orbitals and Dirac-like bands. Complementary diffraction measurements are further able to demonstrate that the CDW instability has a correlated phasing of distortions between neighboring V 3 Sb 5 planes, and the average structure in the CDW state is proposed. These results provide critical insights into the underlying CDW instability in A V 3 Sb 5 kagome metals and support minimal models of CDW order arising from within the vanadium-based kagome lattice.},

Here, we report a violation originating from thermally induced change in the carrier density. We find that the magnetoresistance of the Weyl semimetal TaP follows an extended Kohler’s rule MR = f [ H / ( n T ρ 0 ) ] , with n T describing the temperature dependence of the carrier density. We show that n T is associated with the Fermi level and the dispersion relation of the semimetal, providing a new way to reveal information on the electronic band structure. We offer a fundamental understanding of the violation and validity of Kohler’s rule in terms of different temperature responses of n T . We apply our extended Kohler’s rule to BaFe 2 ( As 1 − x P x ) 2 to settle a long-standing debate on the scaling behavior of the normal-state magnetoresistance of a superconductor, namely, MR ∼ tan 2 θ H , where θ H is the Hall angle.

Although this phenomenon has been realized experimentally, especially for the high- T c cuprates, the underlying mechanism remains mysterious. Using the recently developed variational non-Gaussian exact diagonalization method, we investigate a particular type of photoenhanced superconductivity by suppressing a competing charge order in a strongly correlated electron-electron and electron-phonon system. We find that the d -wave superconductivity pairing correlation can be enhanced by a pulsed laser, consistent with recent experiments based on gap characterizations. However, we also find that the pairing correlation length is heavily suppressed by the pump pulse, indicating that light-enhanced superconductivity may be of fluctuating nature. Our findings also imply a general behavior of nonequilibrium states with competing orders, beyond the description of a mean-field framework.},

  abstract     = {We develop a fundamental theory of the long-range electrostatic interactions in two-dimensional crystals by performing a rigorous study of the nonanalyticities of the Coulomb kernel. We find that the dielectric functions are best represented by 2 × 2 matrices, with nonuniform macroscopic potentials that are two-component hyperbolic functions of the out-of-plane coordinate z . We demonstrate our arguments by deriving the long-range interatomic forces in the adiabatic regime, where we identify a formerly overlooked dipolar coupling involving the out-of-plane components of the dynamical charges. The resulting formula is exact up to an arbitrary multipolar order, which we illustrate in practice via the explicit inclusion of dynamical quadrupoles. By performing numerical tests on monolayer BN, SnS 2 , and BaTiO 3 membranes, we show that our method allows for a drastic improvement in the description of the long-range electrostatic interactions, with comparable benefits to the quality of the interpolated phonon band structure.},

The ability to visualize these surfaces is essential, but the high dimensionality of the corresponding configuration spaces makes this visualization difficult. Here, we present stochastic hyperspace embedding and projection (SHEAP), a method for energy landscape visualization inspired by state-of-the-art algorithms for dimensionality reduction through manifold learning, such as t -SNE and UMAP. The performance of SHEAP is demonstrated through its application to the energy landscapes of Lennard-Jones clusters, solid-state carbon, and the quaternary system C + H + N + O . It produces meaningful and interpretable low-dimensional representations of these landscapes, reproducing well-known topological features such as funnels and providing fresh insight into their layouts. In particular, an intrinsic low dimensionality in the distribution of local minima across configuration space is revealed.},

  abstract     = {Quantum-mechanical correlations of interacting fermions result in the emergence of exotic phases. Magnetic phases naturally arise in the Mott-insulator regime of the Fermi-Hubbard model, where charges are localized and the spin degree of freedom remains. In this regime, the occurrence of phenomena such as resonating valence bonds, frustrated magnetism, and spin liquids is predicted. Quantum systems with engineered Hamiltonians can be used as simulators of such spin physics to provide insights beyond the capabilities of analytical methods and classical computers. To be useful, methods for the preparation of intricate many-body spin states and access to relevant observables are required. Here, we show the quantum simulation of magnetism in the Mott-insulator regime with a linear quantum-dot array. We characterize the energy spectrum for a Heisenberg spin chain, from which we can identify when the conditions for homogeneous exchange couplings are met. Next, we study the multispin coherence with global exchange oscillations in both the singlet and triplet subspace of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Last, we adiabatically prepare the low-energy global singlet of the homogeneous spin chain and probe it with two-spin singlet-triplet measurements on each nearest-neighbor pair and the correlations therein. The methods and control presented here open new opportunities for the simulation of quantum magnetism benefiting from the flexibility in tuning and layout of gate-defined quantum-dot arrays.},

We first derive general bounds on EP and extractable work, as well as a decomposition of the nonequilibrium free energy into an “accessible free energy” (which can be extracted as work, given a set of constraints) and an “inaccessible free energy” (which must be dissipated as EP). In a similar vein, we consider the thermodynamics of information in the presence of constraints and decompose the information acquired in a measurement into “accessible” and “inaccessible” components. This decomposition allows us to consider the thermodynamic efficiency of different measurements of the same system, given a set of constraints. We use our framework to analyze protocols subject to symmetry, modularity, and coarse-grained constraints and consider various examples including the Szilard box, the 2D Ising model, and a multiparticle flashing ratchet.},

We further discover a “critical-threshold ordering” behavior for fluence above approximately 12 mJ / cm 2 , which we show corresponds to the smallest thermodynamically stable c -axis correlation length needed to maintain long-range quasi-two-dimensional AFM order. We suggest that this behavior arises from the crystalline anisotropy of the magnetic-exchange parameters in Sr 2 IrO 4 , whose strengths are associated with distinctly different timescales. As a result, they play out very differently in the ultrafast recovery processes, compared with the thermal-equilibrium evolution. Thus, our observations are expected to be relevant to a wide range of problems in the nonequilibrium behavior of low-dimensional magnets and other related ordering phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The stochastic motion of Brownian particles out of equilibrium yields rich thermodynamic landscapes studied on a great variety of systems through many different research fields. Here, we study within the field of stochastic thermodynamics the dynamics and energetics of an overdamped Brownian chiral nanoparticle diffusing in a symmetric bistable optical potential formed in the standing wave of two counterpropagating Gaussian beams. Control on the polarizations of each beam creates chiral optical environments by endowing the standing wave with optical chiral densities or optical chiral fluxes without modifying the initial bistability. These chiral densities and fluxes are associated, respectively, with reactive or dissipative chiral optical forces exerted on the diffusing chiral nanoparticle. This optomechanical chiral coupling leads to a modification of the thermal activation process in ways that depend on the nanoparticle enantiomer and on the enantiomorphism of the optical field. Reactive chiral forces contribute to a global enantiospecific change of the Helmholtz free energy, but preserving the symmetry of the bistable potential. Dissipative chiral forces correspond to a nonequilibrium steady state where the barrier-crossing rates become asymmetric while leaving unaffected the initial potential. This symmetry breaking is associated with heat transferred to the thermal bath that can be evaluated. The symmetry breaking yields chiral deracemization schemes that can be explicitly calculated and simulated. Our results reveal how chiral degrees of freedom of both the nanoparticle and the optical field transform into true thermodynamic control parameters. The resulting optomechanical model gives way to new opportunities in the context of chiral sensing at the single-nanoparticle level and to original strategies for chiral discrimination at the nanoscale using the observables associated with the thermodynamics at play, such as escape rates or probability density functions.},

  abstract     = {The spin- 1 / 2 Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice is an iconic frustrated three-dimensional spin system with a rich phase diagram. Besides hosting several ordered phases, the model is debated to possess a spin-liquid ground state when only nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions are present. Here, we contest this hypothesis with an extensive numerical investigation using both exact diagonalization and complementary variational techniques. Specifically, we employ a resonating-valence-bond-like, many-variable, Monte Carlo ansatz and convolutional neural network quantum states for (variational) calculations with up to 4 × 4 3 and 4 × 3 3 spins, respectively. We demonstrate that these techniques yield consistent results, allowing for reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. We consider the ( λ , j 2 / j 1 ) parameter space, with j 2 , j 1 being nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and λ the X X Z interaction anisotropy. Our main results are (1) the determination of the phase transition between the putative spin-liquid phase and the neighboring magnetically ordered phase and (2) a careful characterization of the ground state in terms of symmetry-breaking tendencies. We find clear indications of a dimer order with spontaneously broken inversion and rotational symmetry, calling the scenario of a featureless quantum spin liquid into question. Our work showcases how many-variable variational techniques can be used to make progress in answering challenging questions about three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.},

  abstract     = {We present a quasinormal-mode (QNM) theory for coupled loss and gain resonators working in the vicinity of an exceptional point. Assuming linear media, which can be fully quantified using the complex pole properties of the QNMs, we show how the QNMs yield a quantitatively accurate model to a full classical dipole spontaneous-emission response in Maxwell’s equations at a variety of spatial positions and frequencies (under linear response). We also develop an intuitive QNM coupled-mode theory, which can be used to accurately model such systems using only the QNMs of the bare resonators, where the hybrid QNMs of the complete system are automatically obtained. Near a lossy exceptional point, whose general properties are broadened and corrected through use of QNM theory, we analytically show how the QNMs yield a Lorentzian-like and a Lorentzian-squared-like response for the spontaneous-emission line shape consistent with other works. However, using rigorous analytical and numerical solutions for microdisk resonators, we demonstrate that the general line shapes are far richer than what has been previously predicted. Indeed, the classical picture of spontaneous emission can take on a wide range of positive and negative Purcell factors from the hybrid modes of the coupled loss-gain system. The negative Purcell factors are unphysical and signal a clear breakdown of the classical dipole picture of spontaneous emission in such media, though the concept of a negative local density of states is correct. This finding has enabled a quantum fix to the decay of a two-level-system dipole emitter in amplifying and lossy media [Franke et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 127 , 013602 (2021) ], and we further show and discuss the impact of this fix using the QNMs of the microdisk resonators.

Local yield strain has long been incorporated into elastoplastic models; here we show that softness provides a useful proxy for local yield strain.

Investigations of dynamical phase transitions combine aspects of symmetry, topology, and nonequilibrium physics; however, progress has been hindered by the notorious difficulties of predicting the time evolution of large, interacting quantum systems. Here, we tackle this outstanding problem by determining the critical times of interacting many-body systems after a quench using Loschmidt cumulants. Specifically, we investigate dynamical topological phase transitions in the interacting Kitaev chain and in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. To this end, we map out the thermodynamic lines of complex times, where the Loschmidt amplitude vanishes, and identify the intersections with the imaginary axis, which yield the real critical times after a quench. For the Kitaev chain, we can accurately predict how the critical behavior is affected by strong interactions, which gradually shift the time at which a dynamical phase transition occurs. We also discuss the experimental perspectives of predicting the first critical time of a quantum many-body system by measuring the energy fluctuations in the initial state, and we describe the prospects of implementing our method on a near-term quantum computer with a limited number of qubits. Our work demonstrates that Loschmidt cumulants are a powerful tool to unravel the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems, and our approach can immediately be applied in higher dimensions.},

Here, we overcome this hindrance by utilizing the enhanced light-matter coupling in an optical cavity to perform a minimally invasive continuous measurement and track the time evolution of the atom number in a quasi-two-dimensional atomic gas during evaporation from a tilted trapping potential. We demonstrate sufficient measurement precision to detect atom-number fluctuations well below the level set by Poissonian statistics. Furthermore, we characterize the nonlinearity of the evaporation process and the inherent fluctuations of the transport of atoms out of the trapping volume through two-time correlations of the atom number. Our results establish coupled atom-cavity systems as a novel test bed for observing thermodynamics and transport phenomena in mesoscopic cold atomic gases and, generally, pave the way for measuring multitime correlation functions of ultracold quantum gases.},

In order to describe general network settings, we introduce a multiplex quantum channel, which links an arbitrary number of parties where each party can take the role of sender only, receiver only, or both sender and receiver. We define asymptotic and nonasymptotic local quantum operations and classical communication-assisted secret-key-agreement (SKA) capacities for multiplex quantum channels and provide strong and weak converse bounds. The structure of the protocols we consider, manifested by an adaptive strategy of secret-key and entanglement [Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state] distillation over an arbitrary multiplex quantum channel, is generic. As a result, our approach also allows us to study the performance of quantum key repeaters and measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) setups. For teleportation-covariant multiplex quantum channels, we get upper bounds on the SKA capacities in terms of the entanglement measures of their Choi states. We also obtain bounds on the rates at which secret key and GHZ states can be distilled from a finite number of copies of an arbitrary multipartite quantum state.

The conventional expectation for the dynamics of Fermi polarons is that it is dissipative in character, and any excess energy is rapidly emitted away from the impurity as particle-hole excitations. Here we report a strikingly different type of polaron dynamics in a one-dimensional system of the impurity interacting repulsively with the fermions. When the total momentum of the system equals the Fermi momentum, there emerges a sharp collective mode corresponding to long-lived oscillations of the polaronic cloud surrounding the impurity. This mode can be observed experimentally with ultracold atoms using Ramsey interferometry and radio-frequency spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Order parameters are key to our understanding of phases of matter. Not only do they allow one to classify phases, but they also enable the study of phase transitions through their critical exponents which identify the universal long-range physics underlying the transition. Topological phases are exotic quantum phases which are lacking the characterization in terms of order parameters. While probes have been developed to identify such phases, those probes are only qualitative, in that they take discrete values, and, thus, provide no means to study the scaling behavior in the vicinity of phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a unified framework based on variational tensor networks (infinite projected entangled pair states) for the quantitative study of both topological and conventional phase transitions through entanglement order parameters . To this end, we employ tensor networks with suitable physical and/or entanglement symmetries encoded and allow for order parameters detecting the behavior of any of those symmetries, both physical and entanglement ones. On the one hand, this gives rise to entanglement-based order parameters for topologically ordered phases. These topological order parameters allow one to quantitatively probe the behavior when going through topological phase transitions and, thus, to identify universal signatures of such transitions. We apply our framework to the study of the toric code model in different magnetic fields, which along some special lines maps to the ( 2 + 1 ) D Ising model. Our method identifies 3D Ising critical exponents for the entire transition, consistent with those special cases and general belief. However, we, in addition, also find an unknown critical exponent β * ≈ 0.021 for one of our topological order parameters. We take this—together with known dualities between the toric code and the Ising model—as a motivation to also apply our framework of entanglement order parameters to conventional phase transitions. There, it enables us to construct a novel type of disorder operator (or disorder parameter), which is nonzero in the disordered phase and measures the response of the wave function to a symmetry twist in the entanglement. We numerically evaluate this disorder operator for the ( 2 + 1 ) D transverse field Ising model, where we again recover a critical exponent hitherto unknown in the ( 2 + 1 ) D Ising model, β * ≈ 0.024 , consistent with the findings for the toric code. This shows that entanglement order parameters can provide additional means of characterizing the universal data both at topological and conventional phase transitions and altogether demonstrates the power of this framework to identify the universal data underlying the transition.},

  abstract     = {The physics of the triangular lattice Hubbard model exhibits a rich phenomenology, ranging from a metal-insulator transition, intriguing thermodynamic behavior, and a putative spin liquid phase at intermediate coupling, ultimately becoming a magnetic insulator at strong coupling. In this multimethod study, we combine a finite-temperature tensor network method, minimally entangled thermal typical states (METTS), with two Green-function-based methods, connected-determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory, to establish several aspects of this model. We elucidate the evolution from the metallic to the insulating regime from the complementary perspectives brought by these different methods. We compute the full thermodynamics of the model on a width-four cylinder using METTS in the intermediate to strong coupling regime. We find that the insulating state hosts a large entropy at intermediate temperatures, which increases with the strength of the coupling. Correspondingly, and consistently with a thermodynamic Maxwell relation, the double occupancy has a minimum as a function of temperature which is the manifestation of the Pomeranchuk effect of increased localization upon heating. The intermediate coupling regime is found to exhibit both pronounced chiral as well as stripy antiferromagnetic spin correlations. We propose a scenario in which time-reversal symmetry-broken states compete with stripy-spin states at lowest temperatures.},

A prominent example is interstellar media where complex molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are excited by energetic photons. Until recently, ultrafast dynamics following such excitations remained largely unexplored due to the lack of relevant technologies. Here, we use time-resolved mass spectrometry combining ultrashort femtosecond XUV and IR pulses, to investigate the dynamics induced by high-energy photon excitation in PAHs. We demonstrate that excited cations relax through a progressive loss of vibrational selectivity, created at the early-stage dynamics, and which represents the first steps of a complete intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution. This process is in competition with the recently revealed correlation-band dynamics. These results might have direct consequences for the development of XUV molecular physics and other fields such as astrochemistry.},

  abstract     = {Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have generated excitement around the possibility of efficiently analyzing quantum data. But this excitement has been tempered by the existence of exponentially vanishing gradients, known as barren plateau landscapes, for many QNN architectures. Recently, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have been proposed, involving a sequence of convolutional and pooling layers that reduce the number of qubits while preserving information about relevant data features. In this work, we rigorously analyze the gradient scaling for the parameters in the QCNN architecture. We find that the variance of the gradient vanishes no faster than polynomially, implying that QCNNs do not exhibit barren plateaus. This result provides an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized QCNNs, which highlights QCNNs as being trainable under random initialization unlike many other QNN architectures. To derive our results, we introduce a novel graph-based method to analyze expectation values over Haar-distributed unitaries, which will likely be useful in other contexts. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results.},

Near the CDW transition temperature, the bands around the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary are shifted to high-binding energy, forming an M -shaped band with singularities near the Fermi energy. The Fermi surfaces are partially gapped, and the electronic states on the residual ones should be possibly dedicated to the superconductivity.

  abstract     = {The simplest topologically ordered phase in 2 + 1 D is the deconfined phase of Z 2 gauge theory (realized in the toric code, for example). This phase permits a duality that exchanges electric and magnetic excitations (“ e ” and “ m ” particles). The phase transition where one of these particles condenses, while the other remains gapped, has 3D Ising exponents. But the transition out of the deconfined phase when self-duality symmetry is preserved is more mysterious. It has so far been unclear whether this transition is continuous, but if continuous, it may be the simplest critical point for which a useful continuum Lagrangian is still lacking. These questions are relevant to soft matter, too, since the gauge theory also describes classical membranes in 3D. Here, we study the self-dual transition with Monte Carlo simulations of the Z 2 gauge-Higgs model on cubic lattices of linear size L ≤ 96 . Our results indicate a continuous transition, for example via a striking parameter-free scaling collapse. We use duality symmetry to distinguish the leading duality-odd and duality-even scaling operators A and S . We explain why standard techniques for locating the critical point are ineffective, and we develop an alternative using “renormalization group trajectories” of cumulants. We check that two- and three-point functions are scale invariant, with scaling dimensions x A and x S (autocorrelations in the Monte Carlo dynamics also yield a dynamical exponent z ). Separately, we propose a general picture for emergent 1-form symmetries, in terms of “patching” of membranes or world surfaces. We relate this to the percolation of anyon worldlines in spacetime. The latter yields a fourth exponent for the self-dual transition. We propose variations of the model for further investigation.},

In the accompanying paper, we introduce generalized spectral representations for multipoint correlators. Here, we develop a numerical renormalization group approach, capable of efficiently evaluating these spectral representations, to compute local three- and four-point correlators of quantum impurity models. The key objects in our scheme are partial spectral functions, encoding the system’s dynamical information. Their computation via numerical renormalization group allows us to simultaneously resolve various multiparticle excitations down to the lowest energies. By subsequently convolving the partial spectral functions with appropriate kernels, we obtain multipoint correlators in the imaginary-frequency Matsubara, the real-frequency zero-temperature, and the real-frequency Keldysh formalisms. We present exemplary results for the connected four-point correlators of the Anderson impurity model, and for resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of related impurity models.

The connection between results obtained in either way is made through spectral (or Lehmann) representations, well known for two-point correlation functions. Here, we complete this picture by deriving generalized spectral representations for multipoint correlation functions that apply in all of the commonly used many-body frameworks: the imaginary-frequency Matsubara and the real-frequency zero-temperature and Keldysh formalisms. Our approach separates spectral from time-ordering properties and thereby elucidates the relation between the three formalisms. The spectral representations of multipoint correlation functions consist of partial spectral functions and convolution kernels. The former are formalism independent but system specific; the latter are system independent but formalism specific. Using a numerical renormalization group method described in the accompanying paper, we present numerical results for selected quantum impurity models. We focus on the four-point vertex (effective interaction) obtained for the single-impurity Anderson model and for the dynamical mean-field theory solution of the one-band Hubbard model. In the Matsubara formalism, we analyze the evolution of the vertex down to very low temperatures and describe the crossover from strongly interacting particles to weakly interacting quasiparticles. In the Keldysh formalism, we first benchmark our results at weak and infinitely strong interaction and then reveal the rich real-frequency structure of the dynamical mean-field theory vertex in the coexistence regime of a metallic and insulating solution.},

  abstract     = {We present a new theoretical picture of magnetically dominated, decaying turbulence in the absence of a mean magnetic field. With direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the rate of turbulent decay is governed by the reconnection of magnetic structures, and not necessarily by ideal dynamics, as has previously been assumed. We obtain predictions for the magnetic-energy-decay laws by proposing that turbulence decays on reconnection timescales while respecting the conservation of certain integral invariants representing topological constraints satisfied by the reconnecting magnetic field. As is well known, the magnetic helicity is such an invariant for initially helical field configurations, but it does not constrain nonhelical decay, where the volume-averaged magnetic-helicity density vanishes. For such a decay, we propose a new integral invariant, analogous to the Loitsyansky and Saffman invariants of hydrodynamic turbulence, that expresses the conservation of the random (scaling as volume 1 / 2 ) magnetic helicity contained in any sufficiently large volume. We verify that this invariant is indeed well conserved in our numerical simulations. Our treatment leads to novel predictions for the magnetic-energy-decay laws: In particular, while we expect the canonical t − 2 / 3 power law for helical turbulence when reconnection is fast (i.e., plasmoid-dominated or stochastic), we find a shallower t − 4 / 7 decay in the slow “Sweet-Parker” reconnection regime, in better agreement with existing numerical simulations. For nonhelical fields, for which there currently exists no definitive theory, we predict power laws of t − 10 / 9 and t − 20 / 17 in the fast- and slow-reconnection regimes, respectively. We formulate a general principle of decay of turbulent systems subject to conservation of Saffman-like invariants and propose how it may be applied to MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field and to isotropic MHD turbulence with initial equipartition between the magnetic and kinetic energies.},

  abstract     = {A wave function subject to unitary time evolution and exposed to measurements undergoes pure state dynamics, with deterministic unitary and probabilistic measurement-induced state updates, defining a quantum trajectory. For many-particle systems, the competition of these different elements of dynamics can give rise to a scenario similar to quantum phase transitions. To access this competition despite the randomness of single quantum trajectories, we construct an n -replica Keldysh field theory for the ensemble average of the n th moment of the trajectory projector. A key finding is that this field theory decouples into one set of degrees of freedom that heats up indefinitely, while n − 1 others can be cast into the form of pure state evolutions generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This decoupling is exact for free theories, and useful for interacting ones. In particular, we study locally measured Dirac fermions in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions, which can be bosonized to a monitored interacting Luttinger liquid at long wavelengths. For this model, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian corresponds to a quantum sine-Gordon model with complex coefficients. A renormalization group analysis reveals a gapless critical phase with logarithmic entanglement entropy growth, and a gapped area law phase, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The physical picture emerging here is a measurement-induced pinning of the trajectory wave function into eigenstates of the measurement operators, which succeeds upon increasing the monitoring rate across a critical threshold.},

  abstract     = {Under physiological conditions, ballistic long-range transfer of electronic excitations in molecular aggregates is generally expected to be suppressed by noise and dissipative processes. Hence, quantum phenomena are not considered to be relevant for the design of efficient and controllable energy transfer over significant length scales and timescales. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, here we show that the robust quantum properties of small configurations of repeating clusters of molecules can be used to tune energy-transfer mechanisms that take place on much larger scales. With the support of an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that coherent exciton delocalization and dark states within unit cells can be used to harness dissipative phenomena of varying nature (thermalization, fluorescence, nonradiative decay, and weak intersite correlations) to support classical propagation over macroscopic distances. In particular, we argue that coherent delocalization of electronic excitations over just a few pigments can drastically alter the relevant dissipation pathways that influence the energy-transfer mechanism and thus serve as a molecular control tool for large-scale properties of molecular materials. Building on these principles, we use extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate that they can explain currently not-understood measurements of micron-scale exciton diffusion in nanofabricated arrays of bacterial photosynthetic complexes. Based on these results, we provide quantum design guidelines at the molecular scale to optimize both energy-transfer speed and range over macroscopic distances in artificial light-harvesting architectures.},

  abstract     = {Intense laser-plasma ion sources are characterized by an unsurpassed acceleration gradient and exceptional beam emittance. They are promising candidates for next-generation accelerators towards a broad range of potential applications. However, the laser-accelerated ion beams available currently have limitations in energy spread and peak energy. Here, we propose and demonstrate an all-optical single laser scheme to generate proton beams with low spread at about 1\% level and hundred MeV energy by irradiating the edge of a microtape with a readily available femtosecond petawatt laser. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that when the electron beam extracted from both sides of the tape is injected into vacuum, a longitudinal bunching and transverse focusing field is self-established because of its huge charge (about 100 nC) and small divergence. Protons are accelerated and bunched simultaneously, leading to a monoenergetic high-energy proton beam. The proposed scheme opens a new route for the development of future compact ion sources.},

  abstract     = {The generic behavior of quantum systems has long been of theoretical and practical interest. Any quantum process is represented by a sequence of quantum channels. We consider general ergodic sequences of stochastic channels with arbitrary correlations and non-negligible decoherence. Ergodicity includes and vastly generalizes random independence. We obtain a theorem which shows that the composition of such a sequence of channels converges exponentially fast to a replacement (rank-one) channel. Using this theorem, we derive the limiting behavior of translation-invariant channels and stochastically independent random channels. We then use our formalism to describe the thermodynamic limit of ergodic matrix product states. We derive formulas for the expectation value of a local observable and prove that the two-point correlations of local observables decay exponentially. We then analytically compute the entanglement spectrum across any cut, by which the bipartite entanglement entropy (i.e., Rényi or von Neumann) across an arbitrary cut can be computed exactly. Other physical implications of our results are that most Floquet phases of matter are metastable and that noisy random circuits in the large depth limit will be trivial as far as their quantum entanglement is concerned. To obtain these results, we bridge quantum information theory to dynamical systems and random matrix theory.},

  abstract     = {The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) is a prominent example of variational quantum algorithms. We propose a generalized QAOA called CD-QAOA, which is inspired by the counterdiabatic driving procedure, designed for quantum many-body systems and optimized using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The resulting hybrid control algorithm proves versatile in preparing the ground state of quantum-chaotic many-body spin chains by minimizing the energy. We show that using terms occurring in the adiabatic gauge potential as generators of additional control unitaries, it is possible to achieve fast high-fidelity many-body control away from the adiabatic regime. While each unitary retains the conventional QAOA-intrinsic continuous control degree of freedom such as the time duration, we consider the order of the multiple available unitaries appearing in the control sequence as an additional discrete optimization problem. Endowing the policy gradient algorithm with an autoregressive deep learning architecture to capture causality, we train the RL agent to construct optimal sequences of unitaries. The algorithm has no access to the quantum state, and we find that the protocol learned on small systems may generalize to larger systems. By scanning a range of protocol durations, we present numerical evidence for a finite quantum speed limit in the nonintegrable mixed-field spin- 1 / 2 Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, and for the suitability to prepare ground states of the spin-1 Heisenberg chain in the long-range and topologically ordered parameter regimes.

  abstract     = {When interacting motile units self-organize into flocks, they realize one of the most robust ordered states found in nature. However, after 25 years of intense research, the very mechanism controlling the ordering dynamics of both living and artificial flocks has remained unsettled. Here, combining active-colloid experiments, numerical simulations, and analytical work, we explain how flocking liquids heal their spontaneous flows initially plagued by collections of topological defects to achieve long-ranged polar order even in two dimensions. We demonstrate that the self-similar ordering of flocking matter is ruled by a living network of domain walls linking all ± 1 vortices and guiding their annihilation dynamics. Crucially, this singular orientational structure echoes the formation of extended density patterns in the shape of interconnected bow ties. We establish that this double structure emerges from the interplay between self-advection and density gradients dressing each − 1 topological charge with four orientation walls. We then explain how active Magnus forces link all topological charges with extended domain walls, while elastic interactions drive their attraction along the resulting filamentous network of polarization singularities. Taken together, our experimental, numerical, and analytical results illuminate the suppression of all flow singularities and the emergence of pristine unidirectional order in flocking matter.

We consider mixed Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics of a two-dimensional model of nearest-neighbor-interacting adhesion bonds with intrinsic binding affinity under the action of a shared pulling or pushing force. We consider adhesion bonds that are immobile due to being anchored to the underlying cytoskeleton, as well as adhesion molecules that are transiently diffusing. Highly accurate analytical results are obtained on the pair-correlation level of the Bethe-Guggenheim approximation for the complete thermodynamics and kinetics of adhesion clusters of any size, including the thermodynamic limit. A new kind of dynamical phase transition is uncovered—the mean formation and dissolution times per adhesion bond change discontinuously with respect to the bond-coupling parameter. At the respective critical points, cluster formation and dissolution are the fastest, while the statistically dominant transition path undergoes a qualitative change—the entropic barrier to a completely bound or unbound state is rate-limiting below, and the phase transition between dense and dilute phases above the dynamical critical point. In the context of the Ising model, the dynamical phase transition reflects a first-order discontinuity in the magnetization-reversal time. Our results provide a potential explanation for the mechanical regulation of cell adhesion and suggest that the quasistatic and kinetic responses to changes in the membrane stiffness or applied forces is largest near the statical and dynamical critical points, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Random quantum circuits have played a central role in establishing the computational advantages of near-term quantum computers over their conventional counterparts. Here, we use ensembles of low-depth random circuits with local connectivity in D ≥ 1 spatial dimensions to generate quantum error-correcting codes. For random stabilizer codes and the erasure channel, we find strong evidence that a depth O ( log N ) random circuit is necessary and sufficient to converge (with high probability) to zero failure probability for any finite amount below the optimal erasure threshold, set by the channel capacity, for any D . Previous results on random circuits have only shown that O ( N 1 / D ) depth suffices or that O ( log 3 N ) depth suffices for all-to-all connectivity ( D → ∞ ). We then study the critical behavior of the erasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the failure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero with N . We find that the requisite depth scales like O ( log N ) only for dimensions D ≥ 2 and that random circuits require O ( N ) depth for D = 1 . Finally, we introduce an “expurgation” algorithm that uses quantum measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning them into either additional stabilizers or into gauge operators in a subsystem code. With such targeted measurements, we can achieve sublogarithmic depth in D ≥ 2 spatial dimensions below capacity without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical qubits are achievable with depth 4–8 expurgated random circuits in D = 2 dimensions. These results indicate that finite-rate quantum codes are practically relevant for near-term devices and may significantly reduce the resource requirements to achieve fault tolerance for near-term applications.},

However, experimentally testing these predictions is conditioned by the coupling to the 3D environment. Here, we measure the spectrum of the kinetic energy E ( q ) in an active nematic film in contact with a passive oil layer. At small and intermediate scales, we find the scaling regimes E ( q ) ∼ q − 4 and E ( q ) ∼ q − 1 , respectively, in agreement with the theoretical prediction for 2D active nematics. At large scales, however, we find a new scaling E ( q ) ∼ q , which emerges when the dissipation is dominated by the 3D oil layer. In addition, we derive an explicit expression for the spectrum that spans all length scales, thus explaining and connecting the different scaling regimes. This allows us to fit the data and extract the length scale that controls the crossover to the new large-scale regime, which we tune by varying the oil viscosity. Overall, our work experimentally demonstrates the emergence of scaling laws with universal exponents in active turbulence, and it establishes how the spectrum is affected by external dissipation.},

The irreversible entropy production is expressed in terms of thermodynamic potentials and forces, and its fluctuations satisfy fluctuation theorems. Our theory is ideally suited to formulate a thermodynamics of computing with realistic architectures, where the reduction in transistor size and operating voltages make thermal fluctuations increasingly important. We demonstrate this point in two ways: first, by proposing a stochastic model of a CMOS inverter whose actual transfer function deviates from the deterministic one due to nonequilibrium fluctuations, and, second, by proposing a low-power full-CMOS design for a probabilistic bit (or binary stochastic neuron) exploiting intrinsic noise.},

Linear stability analysis shows that, for small R , disturbances grow at a rate linear in their wave number q and that the dominant instability mode involves twist. The resulting steady state in our numerical studies is isotropic hedgehog-defect turbulence. Past a first threshold R of order unity, we find a slower growth rate, of O ( q 2 ) ; the numerically observed steady state is phase turbulent : noisy but aligned on average. We present numerical evidence in three and two dimensions that this inertia-driven flocking transition is continuous, with a correlation length that grows on approaching the transition.

Furthermore, we show that the effective temperature in the expected thermal-like states after equilibration can exhibit minima in the vicinity of the quantum critical points.

  abstract     = {We propose and validate a novel experimental technique to measure two-point statistics of turbulent flows. It consists of spreading rigid fibers in the flow and tracking their position and orientation in time and is therefore named “fiber tracking velocimetry.” By choosing different fiber lengths, i.e., within the inertial or dissipative range of scales, the statistics of turbulence fluctuations at the selected length scale can be probed accurately by simply measuring the fiber velocity at its two ends and projecting it along the transverse-to-fiber direction. By means of fully resolved direct numerical simulations and experiments, we show that these fiber-based transverse velocity increments are statistically equivalent to the (unperturbed) flow transverse velocity increments. Moreover, we show that the turbulent energy-dissipation rate can be accurately measured exploiting sufficiently short fibers. The technique is tested against standard particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) of flow tracers with excellent agreement. Our technique overcomes the well-known problem of PTV to probe two-point statistics reliably because of the fast relative diffusion in turbulence that prevents the mutual distance between particles to remain constant at the length scale of interest. This problem, making it difficult to obtain converged statistics for a fixed separation distance, is even more dramatic for natural flows in open domains. A prominent example is oceanic currents, where drifters (i.e., the tracer-particle counterpart used in field measurements) disperse quickly, but at the same time their number has to be limited to save costs. Inspired by our laboratory experiments, we propose pairs of connected drifters as a viable option to solve the issue.},

  abstract     = {The groundbreaking success of deep learning in many real-world tasks has triggered an intense effort to theoretically understand the power and limitations of deep learning in the training and generalization of complex tasks, so far with limited progress. In this work, we study the statistical mechanics of learning in deep linear neural networks (DLNNs) in which the input-output function of an individual unit is linear. Despite the linearity of the units, learning in DLNNs is highly nonlinear; hence, studying its properties reveals some of the essential features of nonlinear deep neural networks (DNNs). Importantly, we exactly solve the network properties following supervised learning using an equilibrium Gibbs distribution in the weight space. To do this, we introduce the backpropagating kernel renormalization (BPKR), which allows for the incremental integration of the network weights layer by layer starting from the network output layer and progressing backward until the first layer’s weights are integrated out. This procedure allows us to evaluate important network properties, such as its generalization error, the role of network width and depth, the impact of the size of the training set, and the effects of weight regularization and learning stochasticity. BPKR does not assume specific statistics of the input or the task’s output. Furthermore, by performing partial integration of the layers, the BPKR allows us to compute the emergent properties of the neural representations across the different hidden layers. We propose a heuristic extension of the BPKR to nonlinear DNNs with rectified linear units (ReLU). Surprisingly, our numerical simulations reveal that despite the nonlinearity, the predictions of our theory are largely shared by ReLU networks of modest depth, in a wide regime of parameters. Our work is the first exact statistical mechanical study of learning in a family of deep neural networks, and the first successful theory of learning through the successive integration of degrees of freedom in the learned weight space.},

Economic actors can exploit these degrees of freedom, at a cost, to bend the flow of wealth in their favor. If intervention becomes widespread, microeconomic strategies of different actors can build into emergent macroeconomic effects. How viable is a “rigged” economy? How do growing economic complexity and wealth affect it? We study rigged economies with a toy model. In it, economic degrees of freedom progress from minority to coordination games as intervention increases. Growing economic complexity spontaneously defuses cartels. But excessive complexity leads to large-fluctuations regimes, threatening the system’s stability. Simulations suggest that wealth must grow faster than linearly with economic complexity to avoid this regime and keep economies viable in the long run. We discuss a real-case scenario of multiple economic actors coordinated to result in an emergent upset of the stock market.},

  abstract     = {Suppressing noise in physical systems is of fundamental importance. As quantum computers mature, quantum error correcting codes (QECs) will be adopted in order to suppress errors to any desired level. However in the noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, the complexity and scale required to adopt even the smallest QEC is prohibitive: a single logical qubit needs to be encoded into many thousands of physical qubits. Here we show that, for the crucial case of estimating expectation values of observables (key to almost all NISQ algorithms) one can indeed achieve an effective exponential suppression. We take n independently prepared circuit outputs to create a state whose symmetries prevent errors from contributing bias to the expected value. The approach is very well suited for current and near-term quantum devices as it is modular in the main computation and requires only a shallow circuit that bridges the n copies immediately prior to measurement. Using no more than four circuit copies, we confirm error suppression below 10 − 6 for circuits consisting of several hundred noisy gates (2-qubit gate error 0.5\%) in numerical simulations validating our approach.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of evermore complex entities from prebiotic building blocks is a key aspect of origins of life research. The RNA-world hypothesis posits that RNA oligomers known as ribozymes acted as the first self-replicating entities. However, the mechanisms governing the self-assembly of complex informational polymers from the shortest prebiotic building blocks were unclear. One open issue concerns the relation between concentration and oligonucleotide length, usually assumed to be exponentially decreasing. Here, we show that a competition of timescales in the self-assembly of informational polymers by templated ligation generically leads to nonmonotonic strand-length distributions with two distinct length scales. The first length scale characterizes the onset of a strongly nonequilibrium regime and is visible as a local minimum. Dynamically, this regime is governed by extension cascades, where the elongation of a “primer” with a short building block is more likely than its dehybridization. The second length scale appears as a local concentration maximum and reflects a balance between degradation and dehybridization of completely hybridized double strands in a heterocatalytic extension-reassembly process. Analytical arguments and extensive numerical simulations within a sequence-independent model allowed us to predict and control these emergent length scales. Nonmonotonic strand-length distributions confirming our theory were obtained in thermocycler experiments using random DNA sequences from a binary alphabet. Our work emphasizes the role of structure-forming processes already for the earliest stages of prebiotic evolution. The accumulation of strands with a typical length reveals a possible starting point for higher-order self-organization events that ultimately lead to a self-replicating, evolving system.},

  abstract     = {Generalizing the prior work of P. W. Anderson and E. R. Huggins, we show that a “detailed Josephson-Anderson relation” holds for drag on a finite body held at rest in a classical incompressible fluid flowing with velocity V . The relation asserts an exact equality between the instantaneous power consumption by the drag − F · V and the vorticity flux across the potential mass current − ( 1 / 2 ) ∫ d J ∫ ε i j k Σ i j d ℓ k . Here, Σ i j is the flux in the i th coordinate direction of the conserved j th component of vorticity, and the line integrals over ℓ are taken along streamlines of the potential-flow solution u ϕ = ∇ ϕ of the ideal Euler equation, carrying mass flux d J = ρ u ϕ · d A . Drag and dissipation are thus associated with the motion of vorticity relative to this background ideal potential flow solving Euler’s equation. The results generalize the theories of M. J. Lighthill for flow past a body and, in particular, the steady-state relation ( 1 / 2 ) ε i j k ⟨ Σ j k ⟩ = ∂ i ⟨ h ⟩ , where h = p + ( 1 / 2 ) | u | 2 is the generalized enthalpy or total pressure, extends Lighthill’s theory of vorticity generation at solid walls into the interior of the flow. We use these results to explain drag on the body in terms of vortex dynamics, unifying the theories for classical fluids and for quantum superfluids. The results offer a new solution to the “d’Alembert paradox” at infinite Reynolds numbers, provide an explanation for a long-standing puzzle about the experimental conditions required for anomalous turbulent energy dissipation, and imply the necessary and sufficient conditions for turbulent drag reduction.},

In certain magnetic materials, mechanical vibrations can interact with magnetic excitations (magnons) via the magnetostrictive interaction, resulting in an analogous magnon-induced dynamical backaction. In this article, we directly observe the impact of magnon-induced dynamical backaction on a spherical magnetic sample’s mechanical vibrations.

To date, experiments have focused on feedback protocols for work extraction. Here we address the novel case of dissipation reduction in nonequilibrium systems with feedback. We perform pulling experiments on DNA hairpins with optical tweezers, with a general feedback protocol based on multiple measurements that includes either discrete-time or continuous-time feedback. While feedback can reduce dissipation, it remains unanswered whether it also improves free-energy determination (information-to-measurement conversion). We define thermodynamic information ϒ as the natural logarithm of the feedback efficacy, a quantitative measure of the efficiency of information-to-energy and information-to-measurement conversion in feedback protocols. We find that discrete- and continuous-time feedback reduces dissipation by roughly k B T ϒ without improvement in free-energy determination. Remarkably, a feedback strategy (defined as a correlated sequence of feedback protocols) further reduces dissipation, enhancing information-to-measurement efficiency. Our study underlines the role of temporal correlations to develop feedback strategies for efficient information-to-measurement conversion in small systems.

  abstract     = {Many biological systems synchronize their movement through physical interactions. By far, the most well-studied examples concern physical interactions through a fluid: Beating cilia, swimming sperm and worms, and flapping wings all display synchronization behavior through fluid mechanical interactions. However, as the density of a collective increases, individuals may also interact with each other through physical contact. In the field of “active matter” systems, it is well known that inelastic contact between individuals can produce long-range correlations in position, orientation, and velocity. In this work, we demonstrate that contact interactions between undulating robots yield novel phase dynamics such as synchronized motions. We consider undulatory systems in which rhythmic motion emerges from time-independent oscillators that sense and respond to an undulatory bending angle and speed. In pair experiments, we demonstrate that robot joints will synchronize to in-phase and antiphase oscillations through collisions, and a phase-oscillator model describes the stability of these modes. To understand how contact interactions influence the phase dynamics of larger groups, we perform simulations and experiments of simple three-link undulatory robots that interact only through contact. Collectives synchronize their movements through contact as predicted by the theory, and when the robots can adjust their position in response to contact, we no longer observe antiphase synchronization. Lastly, we demonstrate that synchronization dramatically reduces the interaction forces within confined groups of undulatory robots, indicating significant energetic and safety benefits from group synchronization. The theory and experiments in this study illustrate how contact interactions in undulatory active matter can lead to novel collective motion and synchronization.},

In the 2D vdW ferromagnetic (FM) honeycomb lattice CrI 3 ( T C = 61 K ), acoustic and optical spin waves are found to be separated by a gap at the Dirac points. The presence of such a gap is a signature of topological spin excitations if it arises from the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) or bond-angle-dependent Kitaev interactions within the Cr honeycomb lattice. Alternatively, the gap is suggested to arise from an electron correlation effect not associated with topological spin excitations. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to conclusively demonstrate that the Kitaev interactions and electron correlation effects cannot describe spin waves, Dirac gaps, and their in-plane magnetic field dependence. Our results support the idea that the DM interactions are the microscopic origin of the observed Dirac gap. Moreover, we find that the nearest-neighbor (NN) magnetic exchange interactions along the c axis are antiferromagnetic (AF), and the NNN interactions are FM. Therefore, our results unveil the origin of the observed c -axis AF order in thin layers of CrI 3 , firmly determine the microscopic spin interactions in bulk CrI 3 , and provide a new understanding of topology-driven spin excitations in 2D vdW magnets.},

  abstract     = {When a nanoparticle is irradiated by an intense laser pulse, it turns into a nanoplasma, a transition that is accompanied by many interesting nonequilibrium dynamics. So far, most experiments on nanoplasmas use ion measurements, reflecting the outside dynamics in the nanoparticle. Recently, the direct observation of the ultrafast structural dynamics on the inside of the nanoparticle also became possible with the advent of x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). Here, we report on combined measurements of structural dynamics and speeds of ions ejected from nanoplasmas produced by intense near-infrared laser irradiations, with the control of the initial plasma conditions accomplished by widely varying the laser intensity ( 9 × 10 14 W / cm 2 to 3 × 10 16 W / cm 2 ). The structural change of nanoplasmas is examined by time-resolved x-ray diffraction using an XFEL, while the kinetic energies of ejected ions are measured by an ion time-of-fight method under the same experimental conditions. We find that the timescale of crystalline disordering in nanoplasmas strongly depends on the laser intensity and scales with the inverse of the average speed of ions ejected from the nanoplasma. The observations support a recently suggested scenario for nanoplasma dynamics in the wide intensity range, in which crystalline disorder in nanoplasmas is caused by a rarefaction wave propagating at a speed comparable with the average ion speed from the surface toward the inner crystalline core. We demonstrate that the scenario is also applicable to nanoplasma dynamics in the hard x-ray regime. Our results connect the outside nanoplasma dynamics to the loss of structure inside the sample on the femtosecond timescale.},

Here we propose a method where a single qubit is able to extract, not a single, but many bits of information about the photon number of a microwave resonator using continuous measurement. We realize a proof-of-principle experiment by recording the fluorescence emitted by a superconducting qubit reflecting a frequency comb, thus implementing multiplexed photon counting where the information about each Fock state—from 0 to 8—is simultaneously encoded in independent measurement channels. Direct Wigner tomography of the quantum state of the resonator evidences the backaction of the measurement as well as the optimal information extraction parameters. Our experiment unleashes the full potential of quantum meters by replacing sequential quantum measurements with simultaneous and continuous measurements separated in the frequency domain.},

One crucial question is how this technology can contribute at a conceptual level to help acquire new scientific understanding. Scientists have used AI techniques to rediscover previously known concepts. So far, no examples of that kind have been reported that are applied to open problems for getting new scientific concepts and ideas. Here, we present T heseus , an algorithm that can provide new conceptual understanding, and we demonstrate its applications in the field of experimental quantum optics. To do so, we make four crucial contributions. (i) We introduce a graph-based representation of quantum optical experiments that can be interpreted and used algorithmically. (ii) We develop an automated design approach for new quantum experiments, which is orders of magnitude faster than the best previous algorithms at concrete design tasks for experimental configuration. (iii) We solve several crucial open questions in experimental quantum optics which involve practical blueprints of resource states in photonic quantum technology and quantum states and transformations that allow for new foundational quantum experiments. Finally, and most importantly, (iv) the interpretable representation and enormous speed-up allow us to produce solutions that a human scientist can interpret and gain new scientific concepts from outright. We anticipate that T heseus will become an essential tool in quantum optics for developing new experiments and photonic hardware. It can further be generalized to answer open questions and provide new concepts in a large number of other quantum physical questions beyond quantum optical experiments. T heseus is a demonstration of explainable AI (XAI) in physics that shows how AI algorithms can contribute to science on a conceptual level.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new type of quantum liquids, dubbed Stiefel liquids, based on ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional nonlinear sigma models on target space S O ( N ) / S O ( 4 ) , supplemented with Wess-Zumino-Witten terms. We argue that the Stiefel liquids form a class of critical quantum liquids with extraordinary properties, such as large emergent symmetries, a cascade structure, and nontrivial quantum anomalies. We show that the well-known deconfined quantum critical point and U ( 1 ) Dirac spin liquid are unified as two special examples of Stiefel liquids, N = 5 and N = 6 , respectively. Furthermore, we conjecture that Stiefel liquids with N &gt; 6 are non-Lagrangian, in the sense that under renormalization group they flow to infrared (conformally invariant) fixed points that cannot be described by any renormalizable continuum Lagrangian. Such non-Lagrangian states are beyond the paradigm of parton gauge mean-field theory familiar in the study of exotic quantum liquids in condensed matter physics. The intrinsic absence of (conventional or partonlike) mean-field construction also means that, within the traditional approaches, will be difficult to decide whether a non-Lagrangian state can actually emerge from a specific UV system (such as a lattice spin system). For this purpose we hypothesize that a quantum state is emergible from a lattice system if its quantum anomalies match with the constraints from the (generalized) Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems. Based on this hypothesis, we find that some of the non-Lagrangian Stiefel liquids can indeed be realized in frustrated quantum spin systems, for example, on triangular or kagome lattice, through the intertwinement between noncoplanar magnetic orders and valence-bond-solid orders.},

In this paper, we present experimental evidence for a room-temperature topological phase transition in the quasi-1D material Bi 4 I 4 , mediated via a first-order structural transition between two distinct stacking orders of the weakly coupled chains. Using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on the two natural cleavable surfaces, we identify the high-temperature β phase to be the first weak topological insulator with two gapless Dirac cones on the (100) surface and no Dirac crossing on the (001) surface, while in the low-temperature α phase, the topological surface state on the (100) surface opens a gap, consistent with a recent theoretical prediction of a higher-order topological insulator beyond the scope of the established topological materials databases that hosts gapless hinge states. Our results not only identify a rare topological phase transition between first-order and second-order topological insulators but also establish a novel quasi-1D material platform for exploring unprecedented physics.},

We analyze how many-particle which-way information, continuously tunable by the level of distinguishability of fermionic or bosonic, identical and possibly interacting particles, constrains interference contributions to many-particle observables and thus controls the quantum-to-classical transition in many-particle quantum systems.

The threshold increases further under a circuit-level noise model with small finite bias, up to 2.22\% for infinite bias. Furthermore, we construct families of finite-rate subsystem low-density parity-check codes with three-qubit check operators and optimal-depth parity-check measurement schedules. To the best of our knowledge, these finite-rate subsystem codes outperform all known codes at circuit-level depolarizing error rates as high as 0.2\%, where they have a qubit overhead that is 4.3 × lower than the most efficient version of the surface code and 5.1 × lower than the subsystem toric code.

Here, we present a helix-coil model for secondary-structure formation, where ssDNA bases are organized in two different types of domains (compact and free). The model contains two parameters: the energy gain per base in a compact domain, ε , and the cooperativity related to the interfacial energy between different domains, γ . We test the ability of the model to quantify the formation of secondary structure in ssDNA molecules mechanically stretched with optical tweezers. The model reproduces the experimental force-extension curves in ssDNA of different molecular lengths and varying sodium and magnesium concentrations. Salt-correction effects for the energy of compact domains and the interfacial energy are found to be compatible with those of DNA hybridization. The model also predicts the folding free energy and the average size of domains at zero force, finding good agreement with secondary-structure predictions by mf old.

  abstract     = {Electron spins are amongst the most coherent solid-state systems known. However, to be used in devices for quantum sensing and information processing applications, they must typically be placed near interfaces. Understanding and mitigating the impacts of such interfaces on the coherence and spectral properties of electron spins is critical to realizing such applications, but it is also challenging: Inferring such data from single-spin studies requires many measurements to obtain meaningful results, while ensemble measurements typically give averaged results that hide critical information. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the coherence of near-surface bismuth donor spins in 28-silicon at millikelvin temperatures. In particular, we use strain-induced frequency shifts caused by a metallic electrode to infer spatial maps of spin coherence as a function of position relative to the electrode. By measuring magnetic-field-insensitive clock transitions, we separate magnetic noise caused by surface spins from charge noise. Our results include quantitative models of the strain-split spin resonance spectra and extraction of paramagnetic impurity concentrations at the silicon surface. The interplay of these decoherence mechanisms for such near-surface electron spins is critical for their application in quantum technologies, while the combination of the strain splitting and clock transition extends the coherence lifetimes by up to 2 orders of magnitude, reaching up to 300 ms at a mean depth of only 100 nm. The technique we introduce here to spatially map coherence in near-surface ensembles is directly applicable to other spin systems of active interest, such as defects in diamond, silicon carbide, and rare earth ions in optical crystals.},

The photon echo arises from a “lensing” phenomenon in which the wave packets of fractional excitations move apart and then come back toward each other, amounting to a refocusing of the excitations’ world lines.

  abstract     = {Pursuing fractionalized particles that do not bear properties of conventional measurable objects, exemplified by bare particles in the vacuum such as electrons and elementary excitations such as magnons, is a challenge in physics. Here we show that a machine-learning method for quantum many-body systems that has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy reveals the existence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the region 0.49 ≲ J 2 / J 1 ≲ 0.54 convincingly in spin- 1 / 2 frustrated Heisenberg model with the nearest and next-nearest-neighbor exchanges, J 1 and J 2 , respectively, on the square lattice. This is achieved by combining with the cutting-edge computational schemes known as the correlation ratio and level spectroscopy methods to mitigate the finite-size effects. The quantitative one-to-one correspondence between the correlations in the ground state and the excitation spectra found in the present analyses enables the reliable identification and estimation of the QSL and its nature. The spin excitation spectra containing both singlet and triplet gapless Dirac-like dispersions signal the emergence of gapless fractionalized spin- 1 / 2 Dirac-type spinons in the distinctive QSL phase. Unexplored critical behavior with coexisting and dual power-law decays of Néel antiferromagnetic and dimer correlations is revealed. The power-law decay exponents of the two correlations differently vary with J 2 / J 1 in the QSL phase and thus have different values except for a single point satisfying the symmetry of the two correlations. The isomorph of excitations with the cuprate d -wave superconductors revealed here implies a tight connection between the present QSL and superconductivity. This achievement demonstrates that the quantum-state representation using machine-learning techniques, which had mostly been limited to benchmarks, is a promising tool for investigating grand challenges in quantum many-body physics.},

  abstract     = {Transition-metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers offer attractive opportunities to realize lattices of interacting bosons with several degrees of freedom. Such heterobilayers can feature moiré patterns that modulate their electronic band structure, leading to spatial confinement of single interlayer excitons (IXs) that act as quantum emitters with C 3 symmetry. However, the narrow emission linewidths of the quantum emitters contrast with a broad ensemble IX emission observed in nominally identical heterobilayers, opening a debate regarding the origin of IX emission. Here we report the continuous evolution from a few trapped IXs to an ensemble of IXs with both triplet- and singlet-spin configurations in a gate-tunable 2 H − MoSe 2 / WSe 2 heterobilayer. We observe signatures of dipolar interactions in the IX ensemble regime which, when combined with magneto-optical spectroscopy, reveal that the narrow quantum-dot-like and broad ensemble emission originate from IXs trapped in moiré potentials with the same atomic registry. Finally, electron doping leads to the formation of three different species of localized negative trions with contrasting spin-valley configurations, among which we observe both intervalley and intravalley IX trions with spin-triplet optical transitions. Our results identify the origin of IX emission in MoSe 2 / WSe 2 heterobilayers and highlight the important role of exciton-exciton interactions and Fermi-level control in these highly tunable quantum materials.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of Weyl semimetals (WSMs) has fueled tremendous interest in condensed matter physics. The realization of WSMs requires the breaking of either inversion symmetry (IS) or time-reversal symmetry (TRS). WSMs can be categorized into type-I and type-II WSMs, which are characterized by untilted and strongly tilted Weyl cones, respectively. Type-I WSMs with breaking of either IS or TRS and type-II WSMs with solely broken IS have been realized experimentally, but a TRS-breaking type-II WSM still remains elusive. In this article, we report transport evidence for a TRS-breaking type-II WSM observed in the intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator Mn ( Bi 1 − x Sb x ) 2 Te 4 under magnetic fields. This state is manifested by the electronic structure transition caused by the spin-flop transition. The transition results in an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and negative c -axis longitudinal magnetoresistance attributable to the chiral anomaly in the ferromagnetic phases of lightly hole-doped samples. Our results establish a promising platform for exploring the underlying physics of the long-sought, ideal TRS-breaking type-II WSM.},

  abstract     = {Weakly coupled ferroelectric/dielectric superlattice thin-film heterostructures exhibit complex nanoscale polarization configurations that arise from a balance of competing electrostatic, elastic, and domain-wall contributions to the free energy. A key feature of these configurations is that the polarization can locally have a significant component that is along the thin-film surface normal direction with an overall configuration maintaining zero net in-plane polarization. PbTiO 3 / SrTiO 3 thin-film superlattice heterostructures on a conducting SrRuO 3 bottom electrode on SrTiO 3 have a room-temperature stripe nanodomain pattern with a nanometer-scale lateral period. Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray free electron laser diffraction and scattering experiments reveal that above-bandgap optical pulses induce propagating acoustic pulses and a perturbation of the domain diffuse scattering intensity arising from the nanoscale stripe domain configuration. With 400-nm optical excitation, two separate acoustic pulses are observed: a high-amplitude pulse resulting from strong optical absorption in the bottom electrode and a weaker pulse arising from the depolarization-field-screening effect due to absorption directly within the superlattice. The picosecond scale variation of the nanodomain diffuse scattering intensity is consistent with a larger polarization change than would be expected due to the polarization-tetragonality coupling of uniformly polarized ferroelectrics. The polarization change is consistent, instead, with polarization rotation facilitated by the reorientation of the in-plane component of the polarization at the domain boundaries of the striped polarization structure. The complex steady-state configuration within these ferroelectric heterostructures leads to ultrafast polarization rotation phenomena that have previously been available only through the selection of bulk crystal composition.},

  abstract     = {Fluid dynamics is one of the cornerstones of modern physics and has recently found applications in the transport of electrons in solids. In most solids, electron transport is dominated by extrinsic factors, such as sample geometry and scattering from impurities. However, in the hydrodynamic regime, Coulomb interactions transform the electron motion from independent particles to the collective motion of a viscous “electron fluid.” The fluid viscosity is an intrinsic property of the electron system, determined solely by the electron-electron interactions. Resolving the universal intrinsic viscosity is challenging, as it affects the resistance only through interactions with the sample boundaries, whose roughness not only is unknown but also varies from device to device. Here, we eliminate all unknown parameters by fabricating samples with smooth sidewalls to achieve the perfect slip boundary condition, which has been elusive in both molecular fluids and electronic systems. We engineer the device geometry to create viscous dissipation and reveal the true intrinsic hydrodynamic properties of a 2D system. We observe a clear transition from ballistic to hydrodynamic electron motion, driven by both temperature and magnetic field. We directly measure the viscosity and electron-electron scattering lifetime (the Fermi quasiparticle lifetime) over a wide temperature range without fitting parameters and show they have a strong dependence on electron density that cannot be explained by conventional theories based on the random phase approximation.},

It is considered to be regulated by mechanoresponse, but unlike for single cells, this idea remains heavily debated for tissues. Here, we show that changes in matrix stiffness induce a nonequilibrium transition from tubular to squamous Madin-Darby Canine Kidney II tissues. Nonetheless, despite different cell morphologies and densities, all homeostatic tissues display equivalent topologies, which, hence, must be actively targeted and regulated. On the contrary, the mechanoresponse induces dramatic changes in the large-scale organization of the colonies. On stiff gels, this yields an unreported cooperative state of motile cells displaying higher densities than in the arrested homeostatic state, which suggests a more complex relation between cell density and motility than previously anticipated. Our results unequivocally relate the mechanosensitive properties of individual cells to the evolving macroscopic structures, an effect that could be important for understanding the emergent pathologies of living tissues.},

  abstract     = {Epithelia are ubiquitous tissues that display a large diversity of functions and forms, from totally flat to highly curved. Various morphogenetic events, such as gastrulation or branching morphogenesis, correlate to changes in the curvature of epithelia. Building a physical framework to account for the shape of cells in epithelia is thus an important challenge to understand various normal and pathological biological processes, such as epithelial morphogenesis or cancer metastasis. It is widely recognized that the shape of epithelial cells is determined by the tension generated by the actomyosin cortex and the adhesion of cells to the substrate and to each other. These tensions and adhesions are not homogeneously distributed on the cell surface, which makes a 3D view of the problem valuable. To account for these biological and structural contributions to cell shape, different physical models have been proposed, which include surface energies, adhesions, line tensions, volume compressibility, or elasticity terms. However, an experimental procedure that would allow a validation of a minimal physical model for the shape of epithelial cells in 3D has not yet been proposed. In this study, we first made a quantitative analysis of the correlation between cell thickness and curvature during the formation of the ventral furrow in the early Drosophila embryo. We then cultured Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells on substrates with a sinusoidal profile, allowing us to measure the shape of the cells on various positive and negative curvatures. We found that both in the early Drosophila ventral furrow and in MDCK epithelia cells are thicker when positively curved (on valleys of sinusoidal substrates) than when negatively curved (on the crests). The influence of curvature on the shape of epithelial cells could not be understood with a model using only differential apical, basal, and lateral surface energies. However, the addition of an apical line tension was sufficient to quantitatively account for the experimental measurements. The model also accounts for the shape of MDCK cells that overexpress E-cadherin. On the other hand, when reducing myosin II activity with blebbistatin, we measured a saturation of the difference in cell thickness between valleys and crests, suggesting the need for a term limiting large cell deformations. Our results show that a minimal model that accounts for epithelial cell shape needs to include an apical line tension in addition to differential surface energies, highlighting the importance of structures that produce anisotropic tension in epithelial cells, such as the actin belt linking adherens junctions. In the future, the model could be used to account for the shape of epithelial cells in different contexts, such as branching morphogenesis. Furthermore, our experimental procedure could be used to test a wider range of physical models for the shape of epithelia in curved environments, including, for example, continuous models.

They also couple to a wide variety of fields and forces, making them ideal as sensors. The realization of a mechanically based quantum bit could therefore provide an important new platform for quantum computation and sensing. Here, we show that by coupling one of the flexural modes of a suspended carbon nanotube to the charge states of a double quantum dot defined in the nanotube, it is possible to induce sufficient anharmonicity in the mechanical oscillator so that the coupled system can be used as a mechanical quantum bit. However, these results can only be achieved when the device enters the ultrastrong coupling regime. We discuss the conditions for the anharmonicity to appear, and we show that the Hamiltonian can be mapped onto an anharmonic oscillator, allowing us to work out the energy level structure and find how decoherence from the quantum dot and the mechanical oscillator is inherited by the qubit. Remarkably, the dephasing due to the quantum dot is expected to be reduced by several orders of magnitude in the coupled system. We outline qubit control, readout protocols, the realization of a CNOT gate by coupling two qubits to a microwave cavity, and finally how the qubit can be used as a static-force quantum sensor.},

Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to study a newly discovered Z 2 topological kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 with a superconducting ground state. We observe charge modulation associated with the opening of an energy gap near the Fermi level. When across single-unit-cell surface step edges, the intensity of this charge modulation exhibits a π -phase shift, suggesting a three-dimensional 2 × 2 × 2 charge density wave ordering. Interestingly, while conventional Caroli–de Gennes–Matricon bound states are observed inside the superconducting vortex on the Sb surfaces, a robust zero-bias conductance peak emerges that does not split in a large distance when moving away from the vortex center on the Cs 2 × 2 surfaces, resembling the Majorana bound states arising from the superconducting Dirac surface states in Bi 2 Te 3 / NbSe 2 heterostructures.

  abstract     = {Hydrodynamics provides a universal description of interacting quantum field theories at sufficiently long times and wavelengths, but breaks down at scales dependent on microscopic details of the theory. In the vicinity of a quantum critical point, it is expected that some aspects of the dynamics are universal and dictated by properties of the critical point. We use gauge-gravity duality to investigate the breakdown of diffusive hydrodynamics in two low-temperature states dual to black holes with AdS 2 horizons, which exhibit quantum critical dynamics with an emergent scaling symmetry in time. We find that the breakdown is characterized by a collision between the diffusive pole of the retarded Green’s function with a pole associated to the AdS 2 region of the geometry, such that the local equilibration time is set by infrared properties of the theory. The absolute values of the frequency and wave vector at the collision ( ω eq and k eq ) provide a natural characterization of all the low-temperature diffusivities D of the states via D = ω eq / k eq 2 , where ω eq = 2 π Δ T is set by the temperature T and the scaling dimension Δ of an operator of the infrared quantum critical theory. We confirm that these relations are also satisfied in a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev chain model in the limit of strong interactions. Our work paves the way toward a deeper understanding of transport in quantum critical phases.},

  abstract     = {Anomalous finite-temperature transport has recently been observed in numerical studies of various integrable models in one dimension; these models share the feature of being invariant under a continuous non-Abelian global symmetry. This work offers a comprehensive group-theoretic account of this elusive phenomenon. For an integrable quantum model with local interactions, invariant under a global non-Abelian simple Lie group G , we find that finite-temperature transport of Noether charges associated with symmetry G in thermal states that are invariant under G is universally superdiffusive and characterized by the dynamical exponent z = 3 / 2 . This conclusion holds regardless of the Lie algebra symmetry, local degrees of freedom (on-site representations), Lorentz invariance, or particular realization of microscopic interactions: We accordingly dub it “superuniversal.” The anomalous transport behavior is attributed to long-lived giant quasiparticles dressed by thermal fluctuations. We provide an algebraic viewpoint on the corresponding dressing transformation and elucidate formal connections to fusion identities amongst the quantum-group characters. We identify giant quasiparticles with nonlinear soliton modes of classical field theories that describe low-energy excitations above ferromagnetic vacua. Our analysis of these field theories also provides a complete classification of the low-energy (i.e., Goldstone-mode) spectra of quantum isotropic ferromagnetic chains.},

  abstract     = {For diffusive stochastic dynamics, the probability to observe any individual trajectory is vanishingly small, making it unclear how to experimentally validate theoretical results for ratios of path probabilities. We provide the missing link between theory and experiment by establishing a protocol to extract ratios of path probabilities from measured time series. For experiments on a single colloidal particle in a microchannel, we extract both ratios of path probabilities and the most probable path for a barrier crossing, and find excellent agreement with independently calculated predictions based on the Onsager-Machlup stochastic action. Our experimental results at room temperature are found to be inconsistent with the low-noise Freidlin-Wentzell stochastic action, and we discuss under which circumstances the latter action is expected to describe the most probable path. Furthermore, while the experimentally accessible ratio of path probabilities is uniquely determined, the formal path-integral action is known to depend on the time-discretization scheme used for deriving it; we reconcile these two seemingly contradictory facts by careful analysis of the time-slicing derivation of the path integral. Our experimental protocol enables us to probe probability distributions on path space and allows us to relate theoretical single-trajectory results to measurement.

Optically active spins in diamond have emerged as promising quantum nodes based on their spin-selective optical transitions, long-lived spin ground states, and potential for integration with nanophotonics. Tin-vacancy ( SnV − ) centers in diamond are of particular interest because they exhibit narrow-linewidth emission in nanostructures and possess long spin coherence times at temperatures above 1 K. However, a nanophotonic interface for SnV − centers has not yet been realized. Here, we report cavity enhancement of the emission of SnV − centers in diamond. We integrate SnV − centers into one-dimensional photonic crystal resonators and observe a 40-fold increase in emission intensity. The Purcell factor of the coupled system is 25, resulting in a channeling of the majority of photons (90\%) into the cavity mode. Our results pave the way for the creation of efficient, scalable spin-photon interfaces based on SnV − centers in diamond.},

  abstract     = {We present a statistical approximate solution of the bound, nonhierarchical three-body problem, and extend it to a general analysis of encounters between hard binary systems and single stars. Any such encounter terminates when one of the three stars is ejected to infinity, leaving behind a remnant binary; the problem with binary-single-star scattering consists of finding the probability distribution of the orbital parameters of the remnant binary as a function of the total energy and the total angular momentum. Here, we model the encounter as a series of close, nonhierarchical, triple approaches, interspersed with hierarchical phases, in which the system consists of an inner binary and a star that orbits it; this series of approaches turns the evolution of the entire encounter to a random walk between consecutive hierarchical phases. We use the solution of the bound, nonhierarchical three-body problem to find the walker’s transition probabilities, which we generalize to situations in which tidal interactions are important. Besides tides, any dissipative process may be incorporated into the random-walk model, as it is completely general. Our approximate solution can reproduce the results of the extensive body of past numerical simulations and can account for different environments and different dissipative effects. Therefore, this model can effectively replace the need for direct few-body integrations for the study of binary-single encounters in any environment. Furthermore, it allows for a simply inclusion of dissipative forces typically not accounted for in full N -body integration schemes.},

The problem is mapped to a Markovian process, and we prove that there are large spectral equivalence classes—different configurations have the same spectrum. Optimal gates and the protocol that generate entanglement with the fastest theoretically possible rate are identified. Relaxation towards the asymptotic thermal entanglement proceeds via a series of phase transitions in the local relaxation rate, which is a consequence of non-Hermiticity. In particular, non-Hermiticity can cause the rate to be either faster or, even more interestingly, slower than predicted by the matrix eigenvalue gap. This result is caused by expansion coefficients that grow exponentially with system size, resulting in a “phantom” eigenvalue and is due to nonorthogonality of non-Hermitian eigenvectors. We numerically demonstrate that the phenomenon also occurs in random circuits with nonoptimal generic gates, random U(4) gates, and also without spatial or temporal randomness, suggesting that it could be of wide importance in other non-Hermitian settings, including correlations.},

  abstract     = {A number of experimental platforms relevant for quantum simulations, ranging from arrays of superconducting circuits hosting correlated states of light to ultracold atoms in optical lattices in the presence of controlled dissipative processes, are described as open quantum many-body systems. Their theoretical understanding is hampered by the exponential scaling of their Hilbert space and by their intrinsic nonequilibrium nature, limiting the applicability of many traditional approaches. In this work, we extend the nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to Markovian open quantum systems. Within DMFT, a Lindblad master equation describing a lattice of dissipative bosonic particles is mapped onto an impurity problem describing a single site embedded in its Markovian environment and coupled to a self-consistent field and to a non-Markovian bath, where the latter accounts for fluctuations beyond Gutzwiller mean-field theory due to the finite lattice connectivity. We develop a nonperturbative approach to solve this bosonic impurity problem, which dresses the impurity, featuring Markovian dissipative channels, with the non-Markovian bath, in a self-consistent scheme based on a resummation of noncrossing diagrams. As a first application of our approach, we address the steady state of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with two-body losses and incoherent pump. We show that DMFT captures hopping-induced dissipative processes, completely missed in Gutzwiller mean-field theory, which crucially determine the properties of the normal phase, including the redistribution of steady-state populations, the suppression of local gain, and the emergence of a stationary quantum-Zeno regime. We argue that these processes compete with coherent hopping to determine the phase transition toward a nonequilibrium superfluid, leading to a strong renormalization of the phase boundary at finite connectivity. We show that this transition occurs as a finite-frequency instability, leading to an oscillating-in-time order parameter, that we connect with a quantum many-body synchronization transition of an array of quantum van der Pol oscillators.},

  abstract     = {Electrons with large kinetic energy have a superconducting instability for infinitesimal attractive interactions. Quenching the kinetic energy and creating a flat band renders an infinitesimal repulsive interaction the relevant perturbation. Thus, flat-band systems are an ideal platform to study the competition of superconductivity and magnetism and their possible coexistence. Recent advances in the field of twisted bilayer graphene highlight this in the context of two-dimensional materials. Two dimensions, however, put severe restrictions on the stability of the low-temperature phases due to enhanced fluctuations. Only three-dimensional flat bands can solve the conundrum of combining the exotic flat-band phases with stable order existing at high temperatures. Here, we present a way to generate such flat bands through strain engineering in topological nodal-line semimetals. We present analytical and numerical evidence for this scenario and study the competition of the arising superconducting and magnetic orders as a function of externally controlled parameters. We show that the order parameter is rigid because the three-dimensional quantum geometry of the Bloch wave functions leads to a large superfluid stiffness in all three directions. Using density-functional theory and numerical tight-binding calculations, we further apply our theory to strained rhombohedral graphite and CaAgP materials.},

Here, we present two-dimensional stochastic networks that consist of minimal motifs representing out-of-equilibrium cycles at the molecular scale and support chiral edge currents in configuration space. These currents arise in the topological phase because of the bulk-boundary correspondence and dominate the system dynamics in the steady state, further proving robust to defects or blockages. We demonstrate the topological properties of these networks and their uniquely non-Hermitian features such as exceptional points and vorticity, while characterizing the edge-state localization. As these emergent edge currents are associated with macroscopic timescales and length scales, simply tuning a small number of parameters enables varied dynamical phenomena, including a global clock, dynamical growth and shrinkage, and synchronization. Our construction provides a novel topological formalism for stochastic systems and fresh insights into non-Hermitian physics, paving the way for the prediction of robust dynamical states in new classical and quantum platforms.},

Our technique, by its nature, is noninvasive but is motivated by the widely used invasive network inference method, whereby the responses to active perturbations applied to the network are observed and employed to infer network links (e.g., knocking down genes to infer gene regulatory networks). We test this technique on experimental and simulated data from delay-coupled optoelectronic oscillator networks, with both identical and heterogeneous delays along the links. We show that the technique often yields very good results, particularly if the system does not exhibit synchrony. We also find that the presence of dynamical noise can strikingly enhance the accuracy and ability of our technique, especially in networks that exhibit synchrony.},

  abstract     = {To fully capitalize on the potential and versatility of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), it is essential to develop the capability to interpret different RIXS contributions through calculations, including the dependence on momentum transfer, from first principles for correlated materials. Toward that objective, we present new methodology for calculating the full RIXS response of a correlated metal in an unbiased fashion. Through comparison of measurements and calculations that tune the incident photon energy over a wide portion of the Fe L 3 absorption resonance of the benchmark material BaFe 2 As 2 , we show that the RIXS response in BaFe 2 As 2 is dominated by the direct-channel contribution, including the Raman-like response below threshold. Calculations are initially performed within the first-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) framework, which we then significantly improve by invoking a quasiboson model to describe the secondary excitations within the intermediate state. This enhancement allows the many-electron RIXS signal to be approximated as a convolution of BSE-calculated spectra with effective spectral functions. We construct these spectral functions, also from first principles, by employing the cumulant expansion of the Green’s function and performing a real-time time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the response of the electronic system to the perturbation of the intermediate-state excitation. Importantly, this process allows us to evaluate the indirect RIXS response from first principles, accounting for the full periodicity of the crystal structure and with full dependence on the momentum transfer.},

  abstract     = {The two main classes of liquid-crystal (LC) phases of rodlike molecules are nematics, where the rods align in the same direction (the nematic director n ), and smectics, where the rods not only are aligned but also form layers. The electro-optic effects in LC devices that are a backbone in today’s display industry mainly use the Fréedericksz transition, which is the bulk reorientation of a surface-anchored nematic by an electric field. Conventional (uniaxial) smectics do not present a Fréedericksz transition, because, due to their layered structure, the director reorientation would distort the layers, which would cost too much energy. In a worldwide ongoing effort to extend the variety of LC compounds suitable for applications in the display industry, bent-shaped molecules have recently raised much attention, since they present multiple new LC phases with unusual properties. In this paper, we report on a structural and electro-optic study of the LC phases of a bent-shaped dimer. On cooling from the isotropic liquid, this compound shows a usual nematic ( N ), a twist-bend nematic ( N TB ), and a biaxial smectic- A phase ( Sm A b ). Quite surprisingly, contrary to usual smectics, Sm A b presents a remarkable electro-optic response, with low ( &lt; 4 V ) voltage threshold, no reorganization of the smectic layers, and low ( &lt; 1 ms ) response time (i.e., 30 times faster than the N phase at higher temperature). We interpret this unexpected electro-optic effect as a Fréedericksz transition affecting the secondary director m of the Sm A b , and we model it by analogy with the usual Fréedericksz transition of the n director of the uniaxial N phase. Indeed, a Fréedericksz transition affecting only m in this biaxial fluid smectic does not alter its layered structure and costs little energy. From the point of view of applications, thanks to its low relaxation time, this “biaxial” Fréedericksz transition could be exploited in electro-optic devices that require fast switching.},

  abstract     = {Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, Josephson junction based phase-sensitive experiments are believed and used to provide the most convincing evidence for determining the pairing symmetry. Regardless of different junction materials and geometries used, quantum tunneling involved in these experiments is essentially a nanoscale process, and thus, actual experimental results are extremely sensitive to atomic details of the junction structures. The situation has led to controversial results as to the nature of the pairing symmetry of cuprates: while in-plane junction experiments generally support d -wave pairing symmetry, those based on out-of-plane ( c -axis) Josephson junctions between two rotated cuprate blocks favor s -wave pairing. In this work, we revisit the c -axis experiment by fabricating Josephson junctions with atomic-level control in their interface structure. We fabricate over 90 junctions of ultrathin Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 + x (BSCCO) flakes by state-of-the-art exfoliation technique and obtain atomically flat junction interfaces in the whole junction regions as characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Notably, the resultant uniform junctions at various twist angles all exhibit a single tunneling branch behavior, suggesting that only the first half of a unit cell on both sides of the twisted flakes is involved in the Josephson tunneling process. With such well-defined geometry and structure and the characteristic single tunneling branch, we repeatedly observe Josephson tunneling at a nominal twist angle of 45°, which is against the expectation from a purely d -wave pairing scenario. Our results strongly favor the scenario of a persistent s -wave order parameter in the junction.},

  abstract     = {The memory effect in disordered systems is a key physical phenomenon that has been employed for optical imaging, metrology, and communication through opaque media. Under the conventional memory effect, when the incident beam is tilted slightly, the transmitted pattern tilts in the same direction. However, the “memory” is limited in its angular range and tilt direction. Here, we present a general approach to customize the memory effect by introducing an angular memory operator. Its eigenstates possess perfect correlation for tilt angles and directions that can be arbitrarily chosen separately for the incident and transmitted waves, and can be readily realized with wave front shaping. This work reveals the power of wave front shaping in creating any desired memory for applications of classical and quantum waves in complex systems.},

  abstract     = {Distributed quantum sensing can provide quantum-enhanced sensitivity beyond the shot-noise limit (SNL) for sensing spatially distributed parameters. To date, distributed quantum sensing experiments have mostly been accomplished in laboratory environments without a real space separation for the sensors. In addition, the post-selection is normally assumed to demonstrate the sensitivity advantage over the SNL. Here, we demonstrate distributed quantum sensing with discrete variables in field and show the unconditional violation (without post-selection) of SNL up to 0.916 dB for the field distance of 240 m. The achievement is based on a loophole-free Bell test setup with entangled photon pairs at the averaged heralding efficiency of 73.88\%. Moreover, to test quantum sensing in real life, we demonstrate the experiment for long distances (with 10-km fiber), together with the sensing of a completely random parameter. The results represent an important step towards a practical quantum sensing network for widespread applications.},

This agreement allows us to evaluate the entropy of entanglement of the resonators, estimate the entanglement flux at their output, and to identify the improvements that could bring this device closer to a useful bright source of entangled microwaves for quantum-technological applications.},

We study finite-temperature properties of the strongly coupled two-dimensional doped Hubbard model using the minimally entangled typical thermal states method on width-four cylinders. We discover that a phase characterized by commensurate short-range antiferromagnetic correlations and no charge ordering occurs at temperatures above the half-filled stripe phase extending to zero temperature. The transition from the antiferromagnetic phase to the stripe phase takes place at temperature T / t ≈ 0.05 and is accompanied by a steplike feature of the specific heat. We find the single-particle gap to be smallest close to the nodal point at k = ( π / 2 , π / 2 ) and detect a maximum in the magnetic susceptibility. These features bear a strong resemblance to the pseudogap phase of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. The simulations are verified using a variety of different unbiased numerical methods in the three limiting cases of zero temperature, small lattice sizes, and half filling. Moreover, we compare to and confirm previous determinantal quantum Monte Carlo results on incommensurate spin-density waves at finite doping and temperature.},

These mixed-phase nuclei can display nontrivial spatial arrangements, such as layered and onionlike structures, whose composition varies according to the radial distance, and which so far have been explained on the basis of bulk and surface free-energy differences between the competing phases. Here we extend the generality of these nonclassical nucleation processes, showing that layered and onionlike structures can emerge solely based on structural fluctuations even in the absence of free-energy differences. We consider two examples of competing crystalline structures, hcp and fcc forming in hard spheres relevant for repulsive colloids and dense liquids, and the cubic and hexagonal diamond forming in water relevant also for other group 14 elements such as carbon and silicon. We introduce a novel structural order parameter that combined with a neural-network classification scheme allows us to study the properties of the growing nucleus from the early stages of nucleation. We find that small nuclei have distinct size fluctuations and compositions from the nuclei that emerge from the growth stage. The transition between these two regimes is characterized by the formation of onionlike structures, in which the composition changes with the distance from the center of the nucleus, similar to what is seen in the two-step nucleation process.},

  abstract     = {The physical realization of Z 2 topological order as encountered in the paradigmatic toric code has proven to be an elusive goal. We predict that this phase of matter can be realized in a two-dimensional array of Rydberg atoms placed on the ruby lattice, at specific values of the Rydberg blockade radius. First, we show that the blockade model—also known as a “ P X P ” model—realizes a monomer-dimer model on the kagome lattice with a single-site kinetic term. This model can be interpreted as a Z 2 gauge theory whose dynamics is generated by monomer fluctuations. We obtain its phase diagram using the numerical density matrix renormalization group method and find a topological quantum liquid (TQL) as evidenced by multiple measures including (i) a continuous transition between two featureless phases, (ii) a topological entanglement entropy of ln 2 as measured in various geometries, (iii) degenerate topological ground states, and (iv) the expected modular matrix from ground state overlap. Next, we show that the TQL persists upon including realistic, algebraically decaying van der Waals interactions V ( r ) ∼ 1 / r 6 for a choice of lattice parameters. Moreover, we can directly access topological loop operators, including the Fredenhagen-Marcu order parameter. We show how these can be measured experimentally using a dynamic protocol, providing a “smoking gun” experimental signature of the TQL phase. Finally, we show how to trap an emergent anyon and realize different topological boundary conditions, and we discuss the implications for exploring fault-tolerant quantum memories.},

However, when the motion of a droplet on a surface shows significant hysteresis, it is generally accepted that the solid’s equilibrium properties cannot be determined. Here, we describe a method to measure surface tensions of soft solids with strong wetting hysteresis. With independent knowledge of the surface tension of the wetting fluid and the linear-elastic response of the solid, the solid deformations under the contact line and the contact angle of a single droplet together reveal the difference in surface tension of the solid against the liquid and vapor phases If the solid’s elastic properties are unknown, then this surface tension difference can be determined from the change in substrate deformations with contact angle. These results reveal an alternate equilibrium contact angle, equivalent to the classic form of Young-Dupré, but with surface tensions in place of surface energies. We motivate and apply this approach with experiments on gelatin, a common hydrogel. This article appears in the following collection:},

The construction of the Schwarzschild QNM pseudospectrum reveals the following: (i) the stability of the slowest-decaying QNM under perturbations respecting the asymptotic structure, reassessing the instability of the fundamental QNM discussed by Nollert [H. P. Nollert, About the Significance of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes, Phys. Rev. D 53 , 4397 (1996) ] as an “infrared” effect; (ii) the instability of all overtones under small-scale (“ultraviolet”) perturbations of sufficiently high frequency, which migrate towards universal QNM branches along pseudospectra boundaries, shedding light on Nollert’s pioneer work and Nollert and Price’s analysis [H. P. Nollert and R. H. Price, Quantifying Excitations of Quasinormal Mode Systems, J. Math. Phys. (N.Y.) 40 , 980 (1999) ]. Methodologically, a compactified hyperboloidal approach to QNMs is adopted to cast QNMs in terms of the spectral problem of a non-self-adjoint operator. In this setting, spectral (in)stability is naturally addressed through the pseudospectrum notion that we construct numerically via Chebyshev spectral methods and foster in gravitational physics. After illustrating the approach with the Pöschl-Teller potential, we address the Schwarzschild black hole case, where QNM (in)stabilities are physically relevant in the context of black hole spectroscopy in gravitational-wave physics and, conceivably, as probes into fundamental high-frequency spacetime fluctuations at the Planck scale.},

  abstract     = {According to the classical theory of Brownian motion, the mean-squared displacement of diffusing particles evolves linearly with time, whereas the distribution of their displacements is Gaussian. However, recent experiments on mesoscopic particle systems have discovered Brownian yet non-Gaussian regimes where diffusion coexists with an exponential tail in the distribution of displacements. Here we show that, contrary to the present theoretical understanding, the length scale λ associated with this exponential distribution does not necessarily scale in a diffusive way. Simulations of Lennard-Jones systems reveal a behavior λ ∼ t 1 / 3 in three dimensions and λ ∼ t 1 / 2 in two dimensions. We propose a scaling theory based on the idea of hopping motion to explain this result. In contrast, simulations of a tetrahedral gelling system, where particles interact by a nonisotropic potential, yield a temperature-dependent scaling of λ . We interpret this behavior in terms of an intermittent hopping motion. Our findings link the Brownian yet non-Gaussian phenomenon with generic features of glassy dynamics and open new experimental perspectives on the class of molecular and supramolecular systems whose dynamics is ruled by rare events.},

  abstract     = {The Raman effect, inelastic scattering of light by lattice vibrations (phonons), produces an optical response closely tied to a material’s crystal structure. Here we show that resonant optical excitation of IR and Raman phonons gives rise to a Raman-scattering effect that can induce giant shifts to the refractive index and induce new optical constants that are forbidden in the equilibrium crystal structure. We complete the description of light-matter interactions mediated by coupled IR and Raman phonons in crystalline insulators—currently the focus of numerous experiments aiming to dynamically control material properties—by including a forgotten pathway through the nonlinear lattice polarizability. Our work expands the toolset for control and development of new optical technologies by revealing that the absorption of light within the terahertz gap can enable control of optical properties of materials over a broad frequency range.},

  abstract     = {Reaction-diffusion waves have long been used to describe the growth and spread of populations undergoing a spatial range expansion. Such waves are generally classed as either pulled, where the dynamics are driven by the very tip of the front and stochastic fluctuations are high, or pushed, where cooperation in growth or dispersal results in a bulk-driven wave in which fluctuations are suppressed. These concepts have been well studied experimentally in populations where the cooperation leads to a density-dependent growth rate. By contrast, relatively little is known about experimental populations that exhibit density-dependent dispersal. Using bacteriophage T7 as a test organism, we present novel experimental measurements that demonstrate that the diffusion of phage T7, in a lawn of host E. coli , is hindered by steric interactions with host bacteria cells. The coupling between host density, phage dispersal, and cell lysis caused by viral infection results in an effective density-dependent diffusion coefficient akin to cooperative behavior. Using a system of reaction-diffusion equations, we show that this effect can result in a transition from a pulled to pushed expansion. Moreover, we find that a second, independent density-dependent effect on phage dispersal spontaneously emerges as a result of the viral incubation period, during which, phage is trapped inside the host unable to disperse. Additional stochastic agent-based simulations reveal that lysis time dramatically affects the rate of diversity loss in viral expansions. Taken together, our results indicate both that bacteriophage can be used as a controllable laboratory population to investigate the impact of density-dependent dispersal on evolution, and that the genetic diversity and adaptability of expanding viral populations could be much greater than is currently assumed.

Using photoemission spectroscopy together with first-principles calculations, a 3D Dirac state with linear band dispersion is identified. The characteristic features of massless Dirac fermions are also confirmed by magnetotransport measurements, exhibiting an extremely small cyclotron mass of m * = 0.012 m 0 and a high Fermi velocity of v F = 1.04 × 10 6 m / s . Interestingly, superconductivity occurs below 0.85 K on the (001) surface, while the bulk remains nonsuperconducting. The captured linear temperature dependence of the upper critical field suggests the possible non- s -wave character of this surface superconductivity. Our discovery serves a distinctive platform to study the interplay between 3D TDS and the superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {Neurons in the brain communicate with spikes, which are discrete events in time and value. Functional network models often employ rate units that are continuously coupled by analog signals. Is there a qualitative difference implied by these two forms of signaling? We develop a unified mean-field theory for large random networks to show that first- and second-order statistics in rate and binary networks are in fact identical if rate neurons receive the right amount of noise. Their response to presented stimuli, however, can be radically different. We quantify these differences by studying how nearby state trajectories evolve over time, asking to what extent the dynamics is chaotic. Chaos in the two models is found to be qualitatively different. In binary networks, we find a network-size-dependent transition to chaos and a chaotic submanifold whose dimensionality expands stereotypically with time, while rate networks with matched statistics are nonchaotic. Dimensionality expansion in chaotic binary networks aids classification in reservoir computing and optimal performance is reached within about a single activation per neuron; a fast mechanism for computation that we demonstrate also in spiking networks. A generalization of this mechanism extends to rate networks in their respective chaotic regimes.},

  abstract     = {Never is the difference between thermal equilibrium and turbulence so dramatic, as when a quadratic invariant makes the equilibrium statistics exactly Gaussian with independently fluctuating modes. That happens in two very different yet deeply connected classes of systems: incompressible hydrodynamics and resonantly interacting waves. This work presents the first detailed information-theoretic analysis of turbulence in such strongly interacting systems. The analysis involves both energy and entropy and elucidates the fundamental roles of space and time in setting the cascade direction and the changes of the statistics along it. We introduce a beautifully simple yet rich family of discrete models with triplet interactions of neighboring modes and show that it has quadratic conservation laws defined by the Fibonacci numbers. Depending on how the interaction time changes with the mode number, three types of turbulence were found: single direct cascade, double cascade, and the first-ever case of a single inverse cascade. We describe quantitatively how deviation from thermal equilibrium all the way to turbulent cascades makes statistics increasingly non-Gaussian and find the self-similar form of the one-mode probability distribution. We reveal where the information (entropy deficit) is encoded and disentangle the communication channels between modes, as quantified by the mutual information in pairs and the interaction information inside triplets.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) as a solution to a long-standing problem in spintronics—how to describe spin-transfer torque (STT) between flowing spins of conduction electrons and localized spins within a magnetic material by treating the dynamics of both spin species fully quantum mechanically. In contrast to conventional Slonczewski-Berger STT, where the localized spins are viewed as classical vectors obeying the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and where their STT-driven dynamics is initiated only when the spin polarization of flowing electrons and localized spins are noncollinear , quantum STT can occur when these vectors are collinear but antiparallel . Using tDMRG, we simulate the time evolution of a many-body quantum state of electrons and localized spins, where the former are injected as a spin-polarized current pulse while the latter comprise a quantum Heisenberg ferromagnetic metallic (FM) spin- 1 2 X X Z chain initially in the ground state with spin polarization antiparallel to that of injected electrons. The quantum STT reverses the direction of localized spins, but without rotation from the initial orientation, when the number of injected electrons exceeds the number of localized spins. Such nonclassical reversal , which is absent from Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics, is strikingly inhomogeneous across the FM chain, and it can be accompanied by reduction of the magnetization associated with localized spins, even to zero at specific locations. This feature arises because quantum STT generates a highly entangled nonequilibrium many-body state of all flowing and localized spins, despite starting from the initially unentangled ground state of a mundane FM. Furthermore, the mutual information between localized spins at the FM edges remains nonzero even at infinite separation as the signature of dynamical buildup of long-range entanglement. The growth in time of entanglement entropy differentiates between the quantum and conventional (i.e., noncollinear) setups for STT, reaching a much larger asymptotic value in the former case.},

  abstract     = {Condensed matter systems admit topological collective excitations above a trivial ground state, an example being Chern insulators formed by Dirac bosons with a gap at finite energies. However, in contrast to electrons, there is no particle-number conservation law for collective excitations, which gives rise to particle-number-nonconserving many-body interactions whose influence on single-particle topology is an open issue of fundamental interest in the field of topological quantum materials. Taking magnons in ferromagnets as an example, we uncover topological magnon insulators that are stabilized by interactions through opening Chern-insulating gaps in the magnon spectrum. This finding can be traced back to the fact that the particle-number nonconserving interactions break the effective time-reversal symmetry of the harmonic theory. Hence, magnon-magnon interactions are a source of topology that can introduce chiral edge states, whose chirality depends on the magnetization direction. Importantly, interactions do not necessarily cause detrimental damping but can give rise to topological magnons with exceptionally long lifetimes. We identify two mechanisms of interaction-induced topological phase transitions—one driven by an external field, the other by temperature—and show that they cause unconventional sign reversals of transverse transport signals, in particular, of the thermal Hall conductivity. We identify candidate materials where this many-body mechanism is expected to occur, such as the metal-organic kagome-lattice magnet Cu(1,3-benzenedicarboxylate), the van der Waals honeycomb-lattice magnet CrI 3 , and the multiferroic kamiokite ( Fe 2 Mo 3 O 8 ). Our results demonstrate that particle-number-nonconserving many-body interactions play an important role in generating nontrivial single-particle topology.},

  abstract     = {Multimode optical fibers (MMFs) have gained renewed interest in the past decade, emerging as a way to boost optical communication data rates in the context of an expected saturation of current single-mode fiber-based networks. They are also attractive for endoscopic applications, offering the possibility to achieve a similar information content as multicore fibers, but with a much smaller footprint, thus reducing the invasiveness of endoscopic procedures. However, these advances are hindered by the unavoidable presence of disorder that affects the propagation of light in MMFs and limits their practical applications. We introduce here a general framework to study and avoid the effect of disorder in wave-based systems and demonstrate its application for multimode fibers. We experimentally find an almost complete set of optical channels that are resilient to disorder induced by strong deformations. These deformation principal modes are obtained by only exploiting measurements for weak perturbations harnessing the generalized Wigner-Smith operator. We explain this effect by demonstrating that, even for a high level of disorder, the propagation of light in MMFs can be characterized by just a few key properties. These results are made possible thanks to a precise and fast estimation of the modal transmission matrix of the fiber which relies on a model-based optimization using deep learning frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Spreading processes on networks are ubiquitous in both human-made and natural systems. Understanding their behavior is of broad interest: from the control of epidemics to understanding brain dynamics. While in some cases there exists a clear separation of timescales between the propagation of a single spreading cascade and the initiation of the next—such that spreading can be modeled as directed percolation or a branching process—there are also processes for which this is not the case, such as spiking cascades in neural networks. For a large class of relevant network topologies, we show here that in such a scenario the nature of the overall spreading fundamentally changes. This change manifests itself in a transition between different universality classes of critical behavior, which determines the onset and the properties of neural activity turning epileptic, for example. We present analytical results in the mean-field limit, giving the critical line along which scale-free behavior can be observed. The two limits of this critical line correspond to the universality classes of directed and undirected percolation, respectively. Outside these two limits, this duality manifests itself in the appearance of critical exponents from the universality classes of both directed and undirected percolation. We find that the transition between these exponents is governed by a competition between merging and propagation of activity, and we identify an appropriate scaling relationship for the transition point. Finally, we show that commonly used measures, such as the branching ratio and dynamic susceptibility, fail to establish criticality in the absence of timescale separation, calling for a reanalysis of criticality in the brain.},

The advent and use of coupler elements to tunably control two-qubit interactions has improved operational fidelity in many-qubit systems by reducing parasitic coupling and frequency crowding issues. Nonetheless, two-qubit gate errors still limit the capability of near-term quantum applications. The reason, in part, is that the existing framework for tunable couplers based on the dispersive approximation does not fully incorporate three-body multilevel dynamics, which is essential for addressing coherent leakage to the coupler and parasitic longitudinal ( Z Z ) interactions during two-qubit gates. Here, we present a systematic approach that goes beyond the dispersive approximation to exploit the engineered level structure of the coupler and optimize its control. Using this approach, we experimentally demonstrate CZ and Z Z -free iSWAP gates with two-qubit interaction fidelities of 99.76 ± 0.07\% and 99.87 ± 0.23\% , respectively, which are close to their T 1 limits.},

  abstract     = {The hallmark of active matter is the autonomous directed motion of its microscopic constituents driven by consumption of energy resources. This motion leads to the emergence of large-scale dynamics and structures without any equilibrium equivalent. Though active field theories offer a useful hydrodynamic description, it is unclear how to properly quantify the energetic cost of the dynamics from such a coarse-grained description. We provide a thermodynamically consistent framework to identify the energy exchanges between active systems and their surrounding thermostat at the hydrodynamic level. Based on linear irreversible thermodynamics, we determine how active fields couple with the underlying reservoirs at the basis of nonequilibrium driving. This approach leads to evaluating the rate of heat dissipated in the thermostat, as a measure of the cost to sustain the system away from equilibrium, which is related to the irreversibility of the active field dynamics. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in two popular active field theories: (i) the dynamics of a conserved density field reproducing active phase separation and (ii) the coupled dynamics of density and polarization describing motile deformable droplets. Combining numerical and analytical approaches, we provide spatial maps of dissipated heat, compare them with the irreversibility measure of the active field dynamics, and explore how the overall dissipated heat varies with the emerging order.},

Here, we directly access hydrodynamic and frictional coupling in colloidal suspensions up to arbitrarily high volume fractions using compositionally uniform colloidal spheres with an off-center, fully embedded core. We reveal interparticle hydrodynamic rotation-rotation coupling in charged colloidal crystals. We also find that higher local crystallinity in denser hard-sphere crystalline sediments enhances rotational diffusivity and that nearly arrested particles exhibit a stick-slip rotational motion due to frictional coupling.

Acceleration is driven by 5-fs, &lt; 2.7 − mJ laser incident on a thin, near-critical-density hydrogen gas jet. Low beam divergence is attributed to reduced sensitivity to laser carrier-envelope phase slip, achieved in two ways using gas jet positon control and laser polarization: (i) electron injection into the wake on the gas jet’s plasma density downramp and (ii) use of circularly polarized drive pulses. These results demonstrate the generation of high-quality electron beams from a few-cycle-pulse-driven laser plasma accelerator without the need for carrier-envelope phase stabilization.},

  abstract     = {In many unconventional superconductors, the presence of a pseudogap—a suppression in the electronic density of states extending above the critical temperature—has been a long-standing mystery. Here, we employ combined in situ electrical transport and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements to reveal an unprecedentedly large pseudogap regime in single-layer FeSe / SrTi O 3 , an interfacial superconductor where incoherent Cooper pairs are initially formed above T Δ ≈ 60 K but where a zero-resistance state is achieved only below T 0 &lt; 30 K . We show that this behavior is accompanied by distinct transport signatures of two-dimensional phase fluctuating superconductivity, suggesting a mixed vortex state hosting incoherent Cooper pairs which persist well above the maximum clean limit T c of approximately 40 K. Our work establishes the critical role of reduced dimensionality in driving the complex interplay between Cooper pairing and phase coherence in two-dimensional high- T c superconductors, providing a paradigm for understanding and engineering higher- T c interfacial superconductors.},

By imposing a false-alarm-rate threshold of two per year in each of the four search pipelines that constitute our search, we present 39 candidate gravitational-wave events. At this threshold, we expect a contamination fraction of less than 10\%. Of these, 26 candidate events were reported previously in near-real time through gamma-ray coordinates network notices and circulars; 13 are reported here for the first time. The catalog contains events whose sources are black hole binary mergers up to a redshift of approximately 0.8, as well as events whose components cannot be unambiguously identified as black holes or neutron stars. For the latter group, we are unable to determine the nature based on estimates of the component masses and spins from gravitational-wave data alone. The range of candidate event masses which are unambiguously identified as binary black holes (both objects ≥ 3 M ⊙ ) is increased compared to GWTC-1, with total masses from approximately 14 M ⊙ for GW190924_021846 to approximately 150 M ⊙ for GW190521. For the first time, this catalog includes binary systems with significantly asymmetric mass ratios, which had not been observed in data taken before April 2019. We also find that 11 of the 39 events detected since April 2019 have positive effective inspiral spins under our default prior (at 90\% credibility), while none exhibit negative effective inspiral spin. Given the increased sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, the detection of 39 candidate events in approximately 26 weeks of data (approximately 1.5 per week) is consistent with GWTC-1.},

Recent years have seen a further expansion of this field by engineering topological properties. However, what is missing currently are efficient ways to rapidly explore and optimize band structures and to classify their topological characteristics for arbitrary unit-cell geometries. In this work, we show how deep learning can address this challenge. We introduce an approach where a neural network first maps the geometry to a tight-binding model. The tight-binding model encodes not only the band structure but also the symmetry properties of the Bloch waves. This allows us to rapidly categorize a large set of geometries in terms of their band representations, identifying designs for fragile topologies. We demonstrate that our method is also suitable to calculate strong topological invariants, even when (like the Chern number) they are not symmetry indicated. Engineering of domain walls and optimization are accelerated by orders of magnitude. Our method directly applies to any passive linear material, irrespective of the symmetry class and space group. It is general enough to be extended to active and nonlinear metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {We study many-body quantum dynamics using Floquet quantum circuits in one space dimension as simple examples of systems with local interactions that support ergodic phases. Physical properties can be expressed in terms of multiple sums over Feynman histories, which for these models are paths or many-body orbits in Fock space. A natural simplification of such sums is the diagonal approximation, where the only terms that are retained are ones in which each path is paired with a partner that carries the complex conjugate weight. We identify the regime in which the diagonal approximation holds and the nature of the leading corrections to it. We focus on the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) and of matrix elements of local operators, averaged over an ensemble of random circuits, making comparisons with the predictions of random matrix theory (RMT) and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). We show that properties are dominated at long times by contributions to orbit sums in which each orbit is paired locally with a conjugate, as in the diagonal approximation, but that in large systems these contributions consist of many spatial domains, with distinct local pairings in neighboring domains. The existence of these domains is reflected in deviations of the SFF from RMT predictions, and of matrix element correlations from ETH predictions; deviations of both kinds diverge with system size. We demonstrate that our physical picture of orbit-pairing domains has a precise correspondence in the spectral properties of a transfer matrix that acts in the space direction to generate the ensemble-averaged SFF. In addition, we find that domains of a second type control non-Gaussian fluctuations of the SFF. These domains are separated by walls that are related to the entanglement membrane, known to characterize the scrambling of quantum information.},

  abstract     = {Metasurfaces have been enabling the miniaturization and integration of complex optical functionalities within an ultrathin platform by engineering the scattering features of localized modes. However, these efforts have mostly been limited to the manipulation of externally produced coherent light, e.g., from a laser. In parallel, the past two decades have seen the development of structured surfaces that emit partially coherent radiation via thermally populated, spatially extended (nonlocal) modes. However, the control over thermally emitted light is severely limited compared to optical metasurfaces, and even basic functionalities such as unidirectional emission to an arbitrary angle and polarization remain elusive. Here, we derive the necessary conditions to achieve full control over thermally emitted light, pointing to the need for simultaneously tailoring local and nonlocal scattering features across the structure. Based on these findings, we introduce a platform for thermal metasurfaces based on quasibound states in the continuum that satisfies these requirements and completes the program of compactification of optical systems by enabling a full degree of control of partially coherent light emission from structured thin films, including unidirectional emission of circularly polarized light, focusing, and control of spatial and temporal coherence, as well as wave-front control with designer spin and angular orbital momenta.},

Here, we report the experimental results on the generation of deeply ionized super-heavy ions (Au) with unprecedented energy of 1.2 GeV utilizing ultrathin targets and ultrashort laser pulses at an intensity of 10 22 W / cm 2 . A novel self-calibrated diagnostic method was developed to acquire the absolute energy spectra and charge-state distributions of Au ions abundant at the charge state of 51 + and extending to 61 + . The measured charge-state distributions supported by 2D particle-in-cell simulations serve as an additional tool to inspect the ionization dynamics associated with SHI acceleration, revealing that the laser intensity is the crucial parameter over the pulse duration for Au acceleration. Achieving a long acceleration time without sacrificing the strength of the acceleration field by utilizing composite targets can substantially increase the maximum energy of Au ions.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a near-term experimental platform for realizing an associative memory. It can simultaneously store many memories by using spinful bosons coupled to a degenerate multimode optical cavity. The associative memory is realized by a confocal cavity QED neural network, with the modes serving as the synapses, connecting a network of superradiant atomic spin ensembles,which serve as the neurons. Memories are encoded in the connectivity matrix between the spins and can be accessed through the input and output of patterns of light. Each aspect of the scheme is based on recently demonstrated technology using a confocal cavity and Bose-condensed atoms. Our scheme has two conceptually novel elements. First, it introduces a new form of random spin system that interpolates between a ferromagnetic and a spin glass regime as a physical parameter is tuned—the positions of ensembles within the cavity. Second, and more importantly, the spins relax via deterministic steepest-descent dynamics rather than Glauber dynamics. We show that this nonequilibrium quantum-optical scheme has significant advantages for associative memory over Glauber dynamics: These dynamics can enhance the network’s ability to store and recall memories beyond that of the standard Hopfield model. Surprisingly, the cavity QED dynamics can retrieve memories even when the system is in the spin glass phase. Thus, the experimental platform provides a novel physical instantiation of associative memories and spin glasses as well as provides an unusual form of relaxational dynamics that is conducive to memory recall even in regimes where it was thought to be impossible.},

Crucially, we require coupled learning to be facilitated by physically plausible learning rules, meaning that learning requires only local responses and no explicit information about the desired functionality. We show that such local learning rules can be derived for any physical network, whether in equilibrium or in steady state, with specific focus on two particular systems, namely disordered flow networks and elastic networks.

Previous thermodynamics, nuclear magnetic resonance, and powder-sample neutron scattering measurements on NaYbCh 2 have supported the suggestion of the QSL ground states. The key signature of a QSL, the spin excitation continuum, arising from the spin quantum number fractionalization, has not been observed. Here we perform both elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements as well as detailed thermodynamic measurements on high-quality single-crystal NaYbSe 2 samples to confirm the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 40 mK, and further reveal a clear signature of magnetic excitation continuum extending from 0.1 to 2.5 meV.

We find that the spatial texture of layer configuration results in a luminescence anomaly of the moiré trapped excitons, where a tiny displacement by interactions dramatically increases the brightness and changes polarization from circular to linear. At full filling, radiative recombination predominantly occurs at edges and vacancies of the exciton superlattice. The anomaly also manifests in the cascaded emission of small clusters, producing chains of polarization entangled photons. An interlayer bias can switch the superlattice into a single-orbital triangular lattice with repulsive interactions only, where the luminescence anomaly can be exploited to distinguish ordered states and domain boundaries at fractional filling.},

  abstract     = {Two widely used but distinct approaches to the dynamics of open quantum systems are the Nakajima-Zwanzig and time-convolutionless quantum master equation, respectively. Although both describe identical quantum evolutions with strong memory effects, the first uses a time-nonlocal memory kernel K , whereas the second achieves the same using a time-local generator G . Here we show that the two are connected by a simple yet general fixed-point relation: G = K ^ [ G ] . This allows one to extract nontrivial relations between the two completely different ways of computing the time evolution and combine their strengths. We first discuss the stationary generator, which enables a Markov approximation that is both nonperturbative and completely positive for a large class of evolutions. We show that this generator is not equal to the low-frequency limit of the memory kernel, but additionally “samples” it at nonzero characteristic frequencies. This clarifies the subtle roles of frequency dependence and semigroup factorization in existing Markov approximation strategies. Second, we prove that the fixed-point equation sums up the time-domain gradient or Moyal expansion for the time-nonlocal quantum master equation, providing nonperturbative insight into the generation of memory effects. Finally, we show that the fixed-point relation enables a direct iterative numerical computation of both the stationary and the transient generator from a given memory kernel. For the transient generator this produces nonsemigroup approximations which are constrained to be both initially and asymptotically accurate at each iteration step.},

  abstract     = {Recent experimental and theoretical works have made much progress toward understanding nonequilibrium phenomena in thermalizing systems, which act as thermal baths for their small subsystems, and many-body localized systems, which fail to do so. The description of time evolution in many-body systems is generally challenging due to the dynamical generation of quantum entanglement. In this work, we introduce an approach to study quantum many-body dynamics, inspired by the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Focusing on a family of interacting, Floquet spin chains, we consider a Keldysh path-integral description of the dynamics. The central object in our approach is the influence matrix, which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics of a local subsystem. For translationally invariant models, we formulate a self-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain special values of the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect dephaser (PD). Physically, a PD corresponds to a many-body system that acts as a perfectly Markovian bath on itself: at each period, it measures every spin. For the models considered here, we establish that PD points include dual-unitary circuits investigated in recent works. In the vicinity of PD points, the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a short memory time. In this case, we demonstrate that the self-consistency equation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS) methods, as the influence matrix temporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS computations allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in terms of an effective “statistical-mechanics” description. We finally illustrate the predictive power of this description by analytically computing how quickly an embedded impurity spin thermalizes. The influence matrix approach formulated here provides an intuitive view of the quantum many-body dynamics problem, opening a path to constructing models of thermalizing dynamics that are solvable or can be efficiently treated by MPS-based methods and to further characterizing quantum ergodicity or lack thereof.},

We conjecture that these states have an efficient dual description in terms of a set of marginal density matrices on bounded regions, obeying the same entropy scaling law locally. We prove a restricted version of this conjecture for translationally invariant systems in two spatial dimensions. Specifically, we prove that a translationally invariant marginal obeying three nonlinear constraints—all of which follow from the entropy scaling law straightforwardly—must be consistent with some global state on an infinite lattice. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the maximum-entropy density compatible with those marginals, deriving a variational upper bound on the thermodynamic free energy. The main assumptions of our construction are satisfied exactly by solvable models of topological order and approximately by finite-temperature Gibbs states of certain quantum spin Hamiltonians.},

However, thus far measurements have extended only to small strains, where the response is linear. Here, we apply large elastic strains to FeSe and perform two types of measurement. (1) Using applied strain to control twinning, the nematic resistive anisotropy at temperatures below the nematic transition temperature T s is determined. (2) Resistive anisotropy is measured as nematicity is induced through applied strain at fixed temperature above T s . In both cases, as nematicity strengthens, the resistive anisotropy peaks at about 7\%, then decreases. Below ≈ 40 K , the nematic resistive anisotropy changes sign. We discuss possible implications of this behavior for theories of nematicity. In addition, we report the following. (1) Under experimentally accessible conditions with bulk crystals, stress, rather than strain, is the conjugate field to the nematicity of FeSe. (2) At low temperatures the twin boundary resistance is ∼ 10\% of the sample resistance, and must be properly subtracted to extract intrinsic resistivities. (3) Biaxial in-plane compression increases both in-plane resistivity and the superconducting critical temperature T c , consistent with a strong role of the y z orbital in the electronic correlations.},

  abstract     = {We present a full symmetry classification of fermion matter in and out of thermal equilibrium. Our approach starts from first principles, the ten different classes of linear and antilinear state transformations in fermionic Fock spaces, and symmetries defined via invariance properties of the dynamical equation for the density matrix. The object of classification is then the generators of reversible dynamics, dissipation and fluctuations, featuring’ in the generally irreversible and interacting dynamical equations. A sharp distinction between the symmetries of equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, respectively, arises from the different role played by “time” in these two cases: In unitary quantum mechanics as well as in “microreversible” thermal equilibrium, antilinear transformations combined with an inversion of time define time-reversal symmetry. However, out of equilibrium an inversion of time becomes meaningless, while antilinear transformations in Fock space remain physically significant, and hence must be considered in autonomy. The practical consequence of this dichotomy is a novel realization of antilinear symmetries (six out of the ten fundamental classes) in nonequilibrium quantum dynamics that is fundamentally different from the established rules of thermal equilibrium. At large times, the dynamical generators thus symmetry classified determine the steady-state nonequilibrium distributions for arbitrary interacting systems. To illustrate this principle, we consider the fixation of a symmetry protected topological phase in a system of interacting lattice fermions. More generally, we consider the practically important class of mean field interacting systems, represented by Gaussian states. This class is naturally described in the language of non-Hermitian matrices, which allows us to compare to previous classification schemes in the literature.},

Comparisons with numerically exact calculations, both for the dynamics and the steady state, demonstrate the power of the method.

We control the relative strength of both contributions to the thermoelectric response using an external optical potential in a nearly noninteracting and a strongly interacting system. Without interactions, the magnitude of the particle current can be tuned over a broad range but is restricted to flow from hot to cold in our parameter regime. Strikingly, strong interparticle interactions additionally reverse the direction of the current. We quantitatively model ab initio the noninteracting observations and qualitatively explain the interaction-assisted reversal by the reduction of entropy transport due to pairing correlations.

With higher concentrations of the same types of magnetic defects, the isostructural compound MnSb 2 Te 4 is a better model system for a systematic investigation of the connections among magnetism, topology, and lattice defects. In this work, the impact of antisite defects on the magnetism and electronic structure is studied in MnSb 2 Te 4 . Mn-Sb site mixing leads to complex magnetic structures and tunes the interlayer magnetic coupling between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic. The detailed nonstoichiometry and site mixing of MnSb 2 Te 4 crystals depend on the growth parameters, which can lead to ≈ 40\% of Mn sites occupied by Sb and ≈ 15\% of Sb sites by Mn in as-grown crystals. Single-crystal neutron diffraction and electron microscopy studies show nearly random distribution of the antisite defects. Band structure calculations suggest that the Mn-Sb site mixing favors a ferromagnetic interlayer coupling, consistent with experimental observation, but is detrimental to the band inversion required for a nontrivial topology. Our results suggest a long-range magnetic order of Mn ions sitting on Bi sites in MnBi 2 Te 4 . The effects of site mixing should be considered in all layered heterostructures that consist of alternating magnetic and topological layers, including the entire family of MnTe ( Bi 2 Te 3 ) n , its Sb analogs, and their solid solution.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is a ubiquitous and versatile probe of magnetic order in contemporary spintronics research. Its origins are usually ascribed to extrinsic effects (i.e., spin-dependent electron scattering), whereas intrinsic (i.e., scattering-independent) contributions are neglected. Here, we measure AMR of polycrystalline thin films of the standard ferromagnets Co, Ni, Ni 81 Fe 19 , and Ni 50 Fe 50 over the frequency range from dc to 28 THz. The large bandwidth covers the regimes of both diffusive and ballistic intraband electron transport and, thus, allows us to separate extrinsic and intrinsic AMR components. Analysis of the THz response based on Boltzmann transport theory reveals that the AMR of the Ni, Ni 81 Fe 19 , and Ni 50 Fe 50 samples is of predominantly extrinsic nature. However, the Co thin film exhibits a sizable intrinsic AMR contribution, which is constant up to 28 THz and amounts to more than 2 / 3 of the dc AMR contrast of 1\%. These features are attributed to the hexagonal structure of the Co crystallites. They are interesting for applications in terahertz spintronics and terahertz photonics. Our results show that broadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses provide new and contact-free insights into magnetotransport phenomena of standard magnetic thin films on ultrafast timescales.},

  abstract     = {All clocks, in some form or another, use the evolution of nature toward higher entropy states to quantify the passage of time. Because of the statistical nature of the second law and corresponding entropy flows, fluctuations fundamentally limit the performance of any clock. This suggests a deep relation between the increase in entropy and the quality of clock ticks. Indeed, minimal models for autonomous clocks in the quantum realm revealed that a linear relation can be derived, where for a limited regime every bit of entropy linearly increases the accuracy of quantum clocks. But can such a linear relation persist as we move toward a more classical system? We answer this in the affirmative by presenting the first experimental investigation of this thermodynamic relation in a nanoscale clock. We stochastically drive a nanometer-thick membrane and read out its displacement with a radio-frequency cavity, allowing us to identify the ticks of a clock. We show theoretically that the maximum possible accuracy for this classical clock is proportional to the entropy created per tick, similar to the known limit for a weakly coupled quantum clock but with a different proportionality constant. We measure both the accuracy and the entropy. Once nonthermal noise is accounted for, we find that there is a linear relation between accuracy and entropy and that the clock operates within an order of magnitude of the theoretical bound.},

  abstract     = {The local number variance σ 2 ( R ) associated with a spherical sampling window of radius R enables a classification of many-particle systems in d -dimensional Euclidean space R d according to the degree to which large-scale density fluctuations are suppressed, resulting in a demarcation between hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform phyla. To more completely characterize density fluctuations, we carry out an extensive study of higher-order moments or cumulants, including the skewness γ 1 ( R ) , excess kurtosis γ 2 ( R ) , and the corresponding probability distribution function P [ N ( R ) ] of a large family of models across the first three space dimensions, including both hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform systems with varying degrees of short- and long-range order. To carry out this comprehensive program, we derive new theoretical results that apply to general point processes, and we conduct high-precision numerical studies. Specifically, we derive explicit closed-form integral expressions for γ 1 ( R ) and γ 2 ( R ) that encode structural information up to three-body and four-body correlation functions, respectively. We also derive rigorous bounds on γ 1 ( R ) , γ 2 ( R ) , and P [ N ( R ) ] for general point processes and corresponding exact results for general packings of identical spheres. High-quality simulation data for γ 1 ( R ) , γ 2 ( R ) , and P [ N ( R ) ] are generated for each model. We also ascertain the proximity of P [ N ( R ) ] to the normal distribution via a novel Gaussian “distance” metric l 2 ( R ) . Among all models, the convergence to a central limit theorem (CLT) is generally fastest for the disordered hyperuniform processes in two or higher dimensions such that γ 1 ( R ) ∼ l 2 ( R ) ∼ R − ( d + 1 ) / 2 and γ 2 ( R ) ∼ R − ( d + 1 ) for large R . The convergence to a CLT is slower for standard nonhyperuniform models and slowest for the “antihyperuniform” model studied here. We prove that one-dimensional hyperuniform systems of class I or any d -dimensional lattice cannot obey a CLT. Remarkably, we discover a type of universality in that, for all of our models that obey a CLT, the gamma distribution provides a good approximation to P [ N ( R ) ] across all dimensions for intermediate to large values of R , enabling us to estimate the large- R scalings of γ 1 ( R ) , γ 2 ( R ) , and l 2 ( R ) . For any d -dimensional model that “decorrelates” or “correlates” with d , we elucidate why P [ N ( R ) ] increasingly moves toward or away from Gaussian-like behavior, respectively. Our work sheds light on the fundamental importance of higher-order structural information to fully characterize density fluctuations in many-body systems across length scales and dimensions, and thus has broad implications for condensed matter physics, engineering, mathematics, and biology.},

Exciton polarons have hitherto been studied in translationally invariant degenerate Fermi systems. Here, we show that periodic distribution of electrons breaks the excitonic translational invariance and leads to a direct optical signature in the exciton-polaron spectrum. Specifically, we demonstrate that new optical resonances appear due to spatially modulated interactions between excitons and electrons in an incompressible Mott-like correlated state. Our observations demonstrate that resonant optical spectroscopy provides an invaluable tool for studying strongly correlated states, such as Wigner crystals and density waves, where exciton-electron interactions are modified by the emergence of charge order.},

Architectural advantages of low-frequency fluxoniums include long qubit coherence time, weak hybridization in the computational subspace, suppressed residual Z Z -coupling rate (here 46 kHz), and the absence of either excessive parameter-matching or complex pulse-shaping requirements.},

  abstract     = {Icosahedral virus capsids are closed shells built up with a hexagonal lattice of proteins, which incorporate pentamers at their fivefold vertices. Human adenovirus particles lose pentamers (pentons) during infection under a variety of physicochemical cues, including mechanical pulling of molecular motors and the viscous drag of the cytoplasm. By combining atomic force microscopy experiments with survival analysis and Markovian transition state theory, we investigate the sequence of adenovirus penton disassembly that reveals the aging of the virus structure. We show evidence that the lifetime of pentons gradually decreases, accompanied by capsid softening as neighboring pentons are lost. This cooperative dismantling process, which involves first-neighbor penton-penton distances of at least 45 nm, leads to a 50\% increase in the virus disassembling rate of the virus particle. Theory and experiments fit remarkably well, allowing us to obtain the spontaneous escape rate and the energy barrier of penton disassembly ( ∼ 30 k B T ). The observed increase in the penton’s loss rate reveals long-range structural correlations within the capsid. Our estimations suggest that the mechanical cues arising from the strokes of protein motors carrying the virus to the nucleus could help penton disassembly and warrant the timely delivery of weak-enough capsids for adenovirus infection.

In this work, we study the effects of moiré superlattices on the topological surface states using a continuum model of Dirac electrons moving in a periodic potential. Unlike twisted bilayer graphene, moiré surface states cannot host isolated bands due to their topological nature. Instead, we find (high-order) van Hove singularities (VHS) in the moiré band structure that give rise to divergent density of states (DOS) and enhance interaction effects. Because of spin-momentum locking in moiré surface states, possible interaction channels are limited. In the presence of phonon mediated attraction, superconductivity is strongly enhanced by the power-law divergent DOS at high-order VHS. The transition temperature T c exhibits a power-law dependence on the retarded electron-phonon interaction strength λ * . This enhancement is found to be robust under various perturbations from the high-order VHS.},

  abstract     = {Soft modes are intimately linked to structural instabilities and are key for the understanding of phase transitions. The soft modes in ferroelectrics, for example, map directly the polar order parameter of a crystal lattice. Driving these modes into the nonlinear, frequency-changing regime with intense terahertz (THz) light fields is an efficient way to alter the lattice and, with it, the physical properties. However, recent studies show that the THz electric-field amplitudes triggering a nonlinear soft-mode response are surprisingly low, which raises the question on the microscopic picture behind the origin of this nonlinear response. Here, we use linear and two-dimensional terahertz (2D THz) spectroscopy to unravel the origin of the soft-mode nonlinearities in a strain-engineered epitaxial ferroelectric SrTiO 3 thin film. We find that the linear dielectric function of this mode is quantitatively incompatible with pure ionic or pure electronic motions. Instead, 2D THz spectroscopy reveals a pronounced coupling of electronic and ionic-displacement dipoles. Hence, the soft mode is a hybrid mode of lattice (ionic) motions and electronic interband transitions. We confirm this conclusion with model calculations based on a simplified pseudopotential concept of the electronic band structure. It reveals that the entire THz nonlinearity is caused by the off-resonant nonlinear response of the electronic interband transitions of the lattice-electronic hybrid mode. With this work, we provide fundamental insights into the microscopic processes that govern the softness that any material assumes near a ferroic phase transition. This knowledge will allow us to gain an efficient all-optical control over the associated large nonlinear effects.},

In this work, we use a cold-atom quantum simulator to directly observe the formation dynamics and subsequent spreading of individual magnetic polarons. Measuring the density- and spin-resolved evolution of a single hole in a 2D Hubbard insulator with short-range antiferromagnetic correlations reveals fast initial delocalization and a dressing of the spin background, indicating polaron formation. At long times, we find that dynamics are slowed down by the spin exchange time, and they are compatible with a polaronic model with strong density and spin coupling.

Recently, interest in quantum scars has been revived in a many-body setting of Rydberg atom chains. While previous theoretical works have identified periodic orbits for such systems using time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), the link between periodic orbits and quasimodes has been missing. Here we provide a conceptually simple analytic construction of quasimodes for the nonintegrable Rydberg atom model and prove that they arise from a “requantization” of previously established periodic orbits when quantum fluctuations are restored to all orders. Our results shed light on the TDVP classical system simultaneously playing the role of both the mean-field approximation and the system’s classical limit, thus allowing us to firm up the analogy between the eigenstate scarring in the Rydberg atom chains and the single-particle quantum systems.},

We introduce here a novel platform for coherent SHF optomechanics based on the coupling of polaritons and electrically driven SHF longitudinal acoustic phonons confined in a planar Bragg microcavity. The highly monochromatic phonons with tunable amplitudes are excited over a wide frequency range by piezoelectric transducers, which also act as efficient phonon detectors with a very large dynamical range. The microcavity platform exploits the long coherence time of polaritons as well as their efficient coupling to phonons. Furthermore, an intrinsic property of the platform is the backfeeding of phonons to the interaction region via reflections at the sample boundaries, which leads to quality factor × frequency products ( Q × f ) exceeding 10 14 Hz as well as huge modulation amplitudes of the optical transition energies exceeding 8 meV. We show that the modulation is dominated by the phonon-induced energy shifts of the excitonic polariton component. Thus, the large modulation leads to a dynamical switching of light-matter nature of the particles from a mixed (i.e., polaritonic) one to photonlike and excitonlike states at frequencies up to 20 GHz. On the one hand, this work opens the way for electrically driven polariton optomechanics in the nonadiabatic, sideband-resolved regime of coherent control. Here, the bidirectionality of the transducers can be exploited for light-to-sound-to-rf conversion. On the other hand, the large phonon frequencies and Q × f products enable phonon control with optical readout down to the single-particle regime at relatively high temperatures (of 1 K).},

This electronic transition subsequently triggers a reversible magnetic transition with the emergence of an exotic ferromagnetic state from this paramagnetic compound.

  abstract     = {Powders or cohesive granular materials are widely handled in industries. However, our understanding of the rheology of these materials is limited. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the rheology of a cohesive granular medium, sheared in a normal-stress-imposed plane shear cell over a wide range of shear rate, employing numerical simulations. At high imposed shear rates, the flow is homogeneous, and the rheology is well described by the existing scaling laws, involving the inertial number and the “effective” cohesion number [S. Mandal et al. , Insights into the Rheology of Cohesive Granular Media, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 117 , 8366 (2020) ]. However, at low imposed shear rates, the flow is inhomogeneous, exhibiting the coexistence of flowing and nonflowing regions in the material, popularly known as shear banding. We thoroughly analyze the crucial features of this shear-banded flow regime and discuss striking similarities between the shear banding for granular media and other complex fluids. We reveal that the occurrence of shear banding is related to the existence of a nonmonotonic intrinsic rheological curve and that increasing adhesion increases the nonmonotonicity and the tendency toward shear localization. A simple theoretical model based on a nonlocal rheological model coupled with a nonmonotonic flow curve is proposed and is shown to successfully reproduce all the key features of the shear banding observed in the numerical simulations. The results have important implications for the handling of powders in industries.},

  abstract     = {The interplay between time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and band topology plays a crucial role in topological states of quantum matter. In time-reversal-invariant (TRI) systems, the inversion of spin-degenerate bands with opposite parity leads to nontrivial topological states, such as topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. When the TRS is broken, the exchange field induces spin splitting of the bands. The inversion of a pair of spin-splitting subbands can generate more exotic topological states, such as quantum anomalous Hall insulators and magnetic Weyl semimetals. So far, such topological phase transitions driven by the TRS breaking have not been visualized. In this work, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that the TRS breaking induces a band inversion of a pair of spin-splitting subbands at the TRI points of Brillouin zone in EuB 6 , when a long-range ferromagnetic order is developed. The dramatic changes in the electronic structure result in a topological phase transition from a TRI ordinary insulator state to a TRS-broken topological semimetal (TSM) state. Remarkably, the magnetic TSM state has an ideal electronic structure, in which the band crossings are located at the Fermi level without any interference from other bands. Our findings not only reveal the topological phase transition driven by the TRS breaking, but also provide an excellent platform to explore novel physical behavior in the magnetic topological states of quantum matter.},

This antisymmetric exchange interaction is induced by the broken inversion symmetry at interfaces or in noncentrosymmetric lattices. Significant interfacial DMIs are often found at magnetic/heavy-metal interfaces with large spin-orbit coupling. Recent studies have shown promise for induced DMI at interfaces involving light elements such as carbon (graphene) or oxygen. Here, we report direct observation of induced DMI by chemisorption of the lightest element, hydrogen, on a ferromagnetic layer at room temperature, which is supported by density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrate a reversible chirality transition of the magnetic domain walls due to the induced DMI via hydrogen chemisorption and desorption. These results shed new light on the understanding of DMI in low atomic number materials and the design of novel chiral spintronics and magneto-ionic devices.},

But even a logically reversible operation, when run on a physical processor that operates on different energy levels, requires energy. Here we quantify this energy requirement, providing upper and lower bounds that coincide up to a constant factor. We derive these bounds from a general quantum resource-theoretic argument, which implies that the initial resource requirement for implementing a unitary operation within an error ε grows like 1 / ε times the amount of resource generated by the operation. Applying these results to quantum circuits, we find that their energy requirement can, by an appropriate design, be made independent of their time complexity.},

  abstract     = {Periodically driven coherent conductors provide a universal platform for the development of quantum transport devices. Here, we lay down a comprehensive theory to describe the thermodynamics of these systems. We first focus on moderate thermoelectrical biases and low driving frequencies. For this linear response regime, we establish generalized Onsager-Casimir relations and an extended fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Furthermore, we derive a family of thermodynamic bounds proving that any local matter or heat current puts a nontrivial lower limit on the overall dissipation rate of a coherent transport process. These bounds do not depend on system-specific parameters, are robust against dephasing, and involve only experimentally accessible quantities. They thus provide powerful tools to optimize the performance of mesoscopic devices and for thermodynamic inference, as we demonstrate by working out three specific applications. We then show that physically transparent extensions of our bounds hold also for strong biases and high frequencies. These generalized bounds imply a thermodynamic uncertainty relation that fully accounts for quantum effects and periodic driving. Moreover, they lead to a universal and operationally accessible bound on entropy production that can be readily used for thermodynamic inference and device engineering far from equilibrium. Connecting a broad variety of topics that range from thermodynamic geometry over thermodynamic uncertainty relations to quantum engineering, our work provides a unifying thermodynamic theory of coherent transport that can be tested and utilized with current technologies.},

  abstract     = {In the Landau levels of a two-dimensional electron system or when flat bands are present, e.g., in twisted van der Waals bilayers, strong electron-electron interaction gives rise to quantum Hall ferromagnetism with spontaneously broken symmetries in the spin and isospin sectors. Quantum Hall ferromagnets support a rich variety of low-energy collective excitations that are instrumental to understand the nature of the magnetic ground states and are also potentially useful as carriers of quantum information. Probing such collective excitations, especially their dispersion ω ( k ) , is experimentally challenging due to small sample size and measurement constraints. In this work, we demonstrate an all-electrical approach that integrates a Fabry-Pérot cavity with nonequilibrium transport to achieve the excitation, wave vector selection, and detection of spin waves in graphene heterostructures. Our experiments reveal gapless, linearly dispersed spin wave excitations in the E = 0 Landau level of bilayer graphene, thus providing direct experimental evidence for a predicted canted antiferromagnetic order. We show that the gapless spin wave mode propagates with a high group velocity of several tens of kilometers per second and maintains phase coherence over a distance of many micrometers. Its dependence on the magnetic field and temperature agree well with the hydrodynamic theory of spin waves. These results lay the foundation for the quest of spin superfluidity in this high-quality material. The resonant cavity technique we develop offers a powerful and timely method to explore the collective excitation of many spin- and isospin-ordered many-body ground states in van der Waals heterostructures and opens the possibility of engineering magnonic devices.},

Over an extensive range of droplet sizes and laser intensities, we discover the decay to be surprisingly fast, with decay times as short as 400 fs, nearly independent of the density of the excited states. Using a combination of time-dependent density functional theory and ab initio quantum chemistry calculations, we elucidate the mechanisms of this ultrafast decay process, where pairs of excited helium atoms in one droplet strongly attract each other and form merging void bubbles, which drastically accelerates ICD.},

To date, verified experimental implementations of scrambling have focused on systems composed of two-level qubits. Higher-dimensional quantum systems, however, may exhibit different scrambling modalities and are predicted to saturate conjectured speed limits on the rate of quantum information scrambling. We take the first steps toward accessing such phenomena, by realizing a quantum processor based on superconducting qutrits (three-level quantum systems). We demonstrate the implementation of universal two-qutrit scrambling operations and embed them in a five-qutrit quantum teleportation protocol. Measured teleportation fidelities F avg = 0.568 ± 0.001 confirm the presence of scrambling even in the presence of experimental imperfections and decoherence. Our teleportation protocol, which connects to recent proposals for studying traversable wormholes in the laboratory, demonstrates how quantum technology that encodes information in higher-dimensional systems can exploit a larger and more connected state space to achieve the resource efficient encoding of complex quantum circuits.},

Because of the weak single-photon coupling strength achieved with macroscopic oscillators, most of the existing experiments were conducted with large photon numbers to achieve sizable effects, thereby hiding the original optomechanical nonlinearity. To increase the optomechanical interaction, we make use of subwavelength-sized ultrasensitive suspended nanowires inserted in the mode volume of a fiber-based microcavity. By scanning the nanowire within the cavity mode volume and measuring its impact on the cavity mode, we obtain a map of the 2D optomechanical interaction. Then, by using the toolbox of nanowire-based force-sensing protocols, we explore the backaction of the optomechanical interaction and map the optical force field experienced by the nanowire. These measurements also allow us to demonstrate the possibility to detect variations of the mean intracavity photon number smaller than unity. This implementation should also allow us to enter the promising regime of cavity optomechanics, where a single intracavity photon can displace the oscillator by more than its zero-point fluctuations, which will open novel perspectives in the field.},

  abstract     = {We consider a clean quantum system subject to strong periodic driving. The existence of a dominant energy scale, h D x , can generate considerable structure in an effective description of a system that, in the absence of the drive, is nonintegrable and interacting, and does not host localization. In particular, we uncover points of freezing in the space of drive parameters (frequency and amplitude). At those points, the dynamics is severely constrained due to the emergence of an almost exact, local conserved quantity, which scars the entire Floquet spectrum by preventing the system from heating up ergodically, starting from any generic state, even though it delocalizes over an appropriate subspace. At large drive frequencies, where a naïve Magnus expansion would predict a vanishing effective (average) drive, we devise instead a strong-drive Magnus expansion in a moving frame. There, the emergent conservation law is reflected in the appearance of the “integrability” of an effective Hamiltonian. These results hold for a wide variety of Hamiltonians, including the Ising model in a transverse field in any dimension and for any form of Ising interaction. The phenomenon is also shown to be robust in the presence of two-body Heisenberg interactions with any arbitrary choice of couplings. Furthermore, we construct a real-time perturbation theory that captures resonance phenomena where the conservation breaks down, giving way to unbounded heating. This approach opens a window on the low-frequency regime where the Magnus expansion fails.},

Using confocal microscopes allows performing resonant fluorescence experiments, where the emitted light has the same wavelength as the excitation laser. These challenging experiments are carried out under linear cross-polarization conditions, rejecting laser light from the detector. In this work, we uncover the physical mechanisms that are at the origin of the yet-unexplained high polarization rejection ratio which makes these measurements possible. We show in both experiment and theory that the use of a reflecting surface (i.e., the beam splitter and mirrors) placed between the polarizer and analyzer in combination with a confocal arrangement explains the giant cross-polarization extinction ratio of 10 8 and beyond. We map the modal transformation of the polarized optical Gaussian beam. We find an intensity “hole” in the reflected beam under cross-polarization conditions. We interpret this hole as a manifestation of the Imbert-Fedorov effect, which deviates the beam depending on its polarization helicity. This result implies that this topological effect is amplified here from the usually observed nanometer to the micrometer scale due to our cross-polarization dark-field methods. We confirm these experimental findings for a large variety of commercially available mirrors and polarization components, allowing their practical implementation in many experiments.},

Our formulation results in large impurity problems, which we treat here with efficient quantum chemistry impurity solvers that work on the real-frequency axis, combined with a one-shot G 0 W 0 treatment of long-range interactions. We apply our full cell approach to bulk Si, two antiferromagnetic correlated insulators NiO and α − Fe 2 O 3 , and the paramagnetic correlated metal SrMoO 3 , with impurities containing up to ten atoms and 124 orbitals.

We show that if ν is fractional (i.e., not an integer), this imposes very strong constraints on the low-energy theory of the system and give a framework to understand such constraints in great generality, vastly generalizing the Luttinger and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems. The most powerful constraint comes about if ν is continuously tunable (i.e., the system is charge compressible), in which case, we show that the low-energy theory must have a very large emergent symmetry group—larger than any compact Lie group. An example is the Fermi surface of a Fermi liquid, where the charge at every point on the Fermi surface is conserved. We expect that in many, if not all, cases, even exotic non-Fermi liquids will have the same emergent symmetry group as a Fermi liquid, even though they could have very different dynamics. We call a system with this property an ersatz Fermi liquid. We show that ersatz Fermi liquids share a number of properties in common with Fermi liquids, including Luttinger’s theorem (which is thus extended to a large class of non-Fermi liquids) and periodic “quantum oscillations” in the response to an applied magnetic field. We also establish versions of Luttinger’s theorem for the composite Fermi liquid in quantum Hall systems and for spinon Fermi surfaces in Mott insulators. Our work makes a connection between filling constraints and the theory of symmetry-protected topological phases, in particular through the concept of “’t Hooft anomalies.”},

  abstract     = {The Green function completely encapsulates a system’s linear response to external sources, and plays a central role in optics, electromagnetism, and acoustics. In electromagnetism, a broad range of phenomena are connected to the Green function, including the local density of optical states, superradiance, and the cooperative Lamb shift. Therefore, knowing the Green function is important for progress in fields as diverse as cavity quantum electrodynamics, plasmonics, metamaterials, and photovoltaics. However, experimentally characterizing the full complex Green function is challenging, as it requires amplitude and phase sensitive measurements with deep-subwavelength spatial resolution. Here, we report a method to characterize the full complex Green function with a resolution of λ / 100 by measuring the mutual impedance between two dipoles at microwave frequencies. We apply it to a resonant planar cavity, with both parallel and nonparallel sides, and also explore the effects of modal resonances in a dielectric cube on dipole-dipole interactions. The ability to characterize the Green function with high spatial resolution provides a unique way to investigate cooperative effects in complex photonic systems.},

  abstract     = {Community detection methods attempt to divide a network into groups of nodes that share similar properties, thus revealing its large-scale structure. A major challenge when employing such methods is that they are often degenerate, typically yielding a complex landscape of competing answers. As an attempt to extract understanding from a population of alternative solutions, many methods exist to establish a consensus among them in the form of a single partition “point estimate” that summarizes the whole distribution. Here, we show that it is, in general, not possible to obtain a consistent answer from such point estimates when the underlying distribution is too heterogeneous. As an alternative, we provide a comprehensive set of methods designed to characterize and summarize complex populations of partitions in a manner that captures not only the existing consensus but also the dissensus between elements of the population. Our approach is able to model mixed populations of partitions, where multiple consensuses can coexist, representing different competing hypotheses for the network structure. We also show how our methods can be used to compare pairs of partitions, how they can be generalized to hierarchical divisions, and how they can be used to perform statistical model selection between competing hypotheses.},

  abstract     = {We derive exact nonlocal homogenized constitutive relations for the effective electromagnetic wave properties of disordered two-phase composites and metamaterials from first principles. This exact formalism enables us to extend the long-wavelength limitations of conventional homogenization estimates of the effective dynamic dielectric constant tensor ϵ e ( k I , ω ) for arbitrary microstructures so that it can capture spatial dispersion well beyond the quasistatic regime (where ω and k I are the frequency and wave vector of the incident radiation). We accomplish this task by deriving nonlocal strong-contrast expansions that exactly account for complete microstructural information (infinite set of n -point correlation functions) and hence multiple scattering to all orders for the range of wave numbers for which our extended homogenization theory applies, i.e., 0 ≤ | k I | ℓ ≲ 1 (where ℓ is a characteristic heterogeneity length scale). Because of the fast-convergence properties of such expansions, their lower-order truncations yield accurate closed-form approximate formulas for ϵ e ( k I , ω ) that apply for a wide class of microstructures. These nonlocal formulas are resummed representations of the strong-contrast expansions that still accurately capture multiple scattering to all orders via the microstructural information embodied in the spectral density, which is easy to compute for any composite. The accuracy of these microstructure-dependent approximations is validated by comparison to full-waveform simulation computations for both 2D and 3D ordered and disordered models of composite media. Thus, our closed-form formulas enable one to predict accurately and efficiently the effective wave characteristics well beyond the quasistatic regime for a wide class of composite microstructures without having to perform full-blown simulations. We find that disordered hyperuniform media are generally less lossy than their nonhyperuniform counterparts. We also show that certain disordered hyperuniform particulate composites exhibit novel wave characteristics, including the capacity to act as low-pass filters that transmit waves “isotropically” up to a selected wave number and refractive indices that abruptly change over a narrow range of wave numbers. Our results demonstrate that one can design the effective wave characteristics of a disordered composite by engineering the microstructure to possess tailored spatial correlations at prescribed length scales. Thus, our findings can accelerate the discovery of novel electromagnetic composites.},

Although our model incorporates only the simplest possible form of achiral active stress, active nematic droplets display an unprecedented range of complex morphologies. For extensile activity, fingerlike protrusions grow at points where disclination lines intersect the droplet surface. For contractile activity, however, the activity field drives cup-shaped droplet invagination, run-and-tumble motion, or the formation of surface wrinkles. This diversity of behavior is explained in terms of an interplay between active anchoring, active flows, and the dynamics of the motile disclination lines. We discuss our findings in the light of biological processes such as morphogenesis, collective cancer invasion, and the shape control of biomembranes, suggesting that some biological systems may share the same underlying mechanisms as active nematic droplets.},

We show how this can be achieved using familiar results about the strong coupling dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories and, in particular, the phenomenon of confinement without chiral symmetry breaking. We present simple models that gap fermions while preserving a symmetry group under which they transform in chiral representations. For example, we show how to gap a collection of 4D fermions that carry the quantum numbers of one generation of the standard model, but without breaking electroweak symmetry. We further show how to gap fermions in groups of 16 while preserving certain discrete symmetries that exhibit a mod 16 anomaly.},

Such “Gauss frustration” exhibits rich phenomenology; it may lead to mechanical instabilities, anomalous mechanics, and shape-morphing abilities that can be harnessed in engineering systems. Here we report a new type of geometrical frustration, one that is as general as Gauss frustration. We show that its origin is the violation of Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson compatibility equations and that it appears in Euclidean sheets. Combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the specific case of a Euclidean ribbon with radial and geodesic curvatures. Experiments, conducted using different materials and techniques, reveal shape transitions, symmetry breaking, and spontaneous stress focusing. These observations are quantitatively rationalized using analytic solutions and geometrical arguments. We expect this frustration to play a significant role in natural and engineering systems, specifically in slender 3D printed sheets.},

  abstract     = {Quantum catalysis is a fascinating concept that demonstrates how certain transformations can only become possible when given access to a specific resource that has to be returned unaffected. It was first discovered in the context of entanglement theory, and since then, it has been applied in a number of resource-theoretic frameworks, including quantum thermodynamics. Although, in that case, the necessary (and sometimes also sufficient) conditions on the existence of a catalyst are known, almost nothing is known about the precise form of the catalyst state required by the transformation. In particular, it is not clear whether it has to have some special properties or be finely tuned to the desired transformation. In this work, we describe a surprising property of multicopy states: We show that in resource theories governed by majorization, all resourceful states are catalysts for all allowed transformations. In quantum thermodynamics, this means that the so-called “second laws of thermodynamics” do not require a fine-tuned catalyst; rather, any state, given sufficiently many copies, can serve as a useful catalyst. These analytic results are accompanied by several numerical investigations that indicate that neither a multicopy form nor a very-large-dimension catalyst is required to activate most allowed transformations catalytically.},

The proposed PND method, based on the measurement of one representative reflection, is easy to perform and straightforward to interpret. The absolute sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in MnCO 3 has been independently determined by PND and found to be in agreement with recent results obtained by resonant magnetic synchrotron scattering. This validates the method. In addition, the absolute DMI vector direction in the prototypical room-temperature weak ferromagnet α − Fe 2 O 3 (hematite) has been determined for the first time. To demonstrate the generality of our method, further examples with different symmetries are also presented. Ab initio calculations of the resulting weak noncollinear magnetization using the quantum espresso package, considering DMI in addition to the symmetric magnetic exchange interaction, were also conducted and found to be in agreement with the experimental results from PND.},

Using the two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model at weak coupling as a testing ground, we perform a comparative study of a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art quantum many-body methods. Upon cooling into its insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, the model hosts a rich sequence of distinct physical regimes with crossovers between a high-temperature incoherent regime, an intermediate-temperature metallic regime, and a low-temperature insulating regime with a pseudogap created by antiferromagnetic fluctuations. We assess the ability of each method to properly address these physical regimes and crossovers through the computation of several observables probing both quasiparticle properties and magnetic correlations, with two numerically exact methods (diagrammatic and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo methods) serving as a benchmark. By combining computational results and analytical insights, we elucidate the nature and role of spin fluctuations in each of these regimes. Based on this analysis, we explain how quasiparticles can coexist with increasingly long-range antiferromagnetic correlations and why dynamical mean-field theory is found to provide a remarkably accurate approximation of local quantities in the metallic regime. We also critically discuss whether imaginary-time methods are able to capture the non-Fermi-liquid singularities of this fully nested system.},

  abstract     = {The concept of “Floquet engineering” relies on an external periodic drive to realize novel, effectively static Hamiltonians. This technique is being explored in experimental platforms across physics, including ultracold atoms, laser-driven electron systems, nuclear magnetic resonance, and trapped ions. The key challenge in Floquet engineering is to avoid the uncontrolled absorption of photons from the drive, especially in interacting systems in which the excitation spectrum becomes effectively dense. The resulting dissipative coupling to higher-lying modes, such as the excited bands of an optical lattice, has been explored in recent experimental and theoretical works, but the demonstration of a broadly applicable method to mitigate this effect is lacking. Here, we show how two-path quantum interference applied to strongly correlated fermions in a driven optical lattice suppresses dissipative coupling to higher bands and increases the lifetime of double occupancies and spin correlations by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. Interference is achieved by introducing a weak second modulation at twice the fundamental driving frequency with a definite relative phase. This technique is shown to suppress dissipation in both weakly and strongly interacting regimes of an off-resonantly driven Hubbard system, opening an avenue to realizing low-temperature phases of matter in interacting Floquet systems.},

  abstract     = {The anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is a remarkable tool for analytically studying strongly coupled physics. Thanks to the AdS/CFT correspondence, strongly correlated quantum systems can be understood as weakly coupled gravity theories, which live in a holographic spacetime with an extra emergent dimension and constant negative curvature. Fundamental observables such as correlation functions are identified with scattering amplitudes in curved spacetime, which, in principle, can be computed by using standard perturbation theory. Unfortunately, such holographic calculations are notoriously difficult, even for tree-level processes involving four external particles. Despite relentless efforts over the past two decades, a full solution to this problem was not found. In this article, we introduce a powerful new method that solves this long-standing problem. We give a closed-form formula for all such four-point functions in a class of theories that constitute the best-known paradigms of AdS/CFT. These models exhaust the theories compatible with maximal supersymmetry, and they live in three, four, and six dimensions. Pivotal to our construction is the use of symmetries. We show that in a judiciously chosen limit, symmetry principles dictate a drastic simplification in holographic correlators, allowing them to be directly computed. Having solved this limit, we further show that the full correlators can be recovered from this special configuration by using only symmetries. In addition to providing valuable explicit expressions that have a wide range of applications in AdS/CFT, our analysis leads to several important conceptual lessons. Our results point out remarkable simplicities underlying the holographic correlators, as well as concrete ways to search for such structures. Moreover, our construction identifies previously unknown elegant underlying organizing principles for holographic correlators. These qualitative features of holographic correlators also echo the exciting progress in the scattering amplitude program in flat space, suggesting tantalizing prospects of future cross-fertilization of ideas.},

However, creating localized (screened) charge profiles in the bulk of such electrolytes generally requires the presence of surfaces—for example, provided by colloidal particles or outer surfaces of the material—which poses a fundamental constraint on the material design. Here, we show that topological defects in nematic electrolytes can perform as regions for local charge separation, forming charged defect cores and, in some geometries, even electric multilayers, as opposed to the electric double layers found in isotropic electrolytes. Using a Landau-de Gennes-Poisson-Boltzmann theoretical framework, we show that ions highly effectively couple with the topological defect cores via ion solvability and with the local director-field distortions of the defects via flexoelectricity. The defect charging is shown for different defect types—lines, points, and walls—using geometries of ionically screened flat isotropic-nematic interfaces, radial hedgehog point defects, and half-integer wedge disclinations in the bulk and as stabilized by (charged) colloidal particles. More generally, our findings are relevant for possible applications where topological defects act as diffuse ionic capacitors or as ionic charge carriers.},

  abstract     = {The velocity circulation, a measure of the rotation of a fluid within a closed path, is a fundamental observable in classical and quantum flows. It is indeed a Lagrangian invariant in inviscid classical fluids. In quantum flows, circulation is quantized, taking discrete values that are directly related to the number and the orientation of thin vortex filaments enclosed by the path. By varying the size of such closed loops, the circulation provides a measure of the dependence of the flow structure on the considered scale. Here, we consider the scale dependence of circulation statistics in quantum turbulence, using high-resolution direct numerical simulations of a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii model. Results are compared to the circulation statistics obtained from simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. When the integration path is smaller than the mean intervortex distance, the statistics of circulation in quantum turbulence displays extreme intermittent behavior due to the quantization of circulation, in stark contrast with the viscous scales of classical flows. In contrast, at larger scales, circulation moments display striking similarities with the statistics probed in the inertial range of classical turbulence. In particular, we observe the emergence of the power-law scalings predicted by Kolmogorov’s 1941 theory, as well as intermittency deviations that closely follow the recently proposed bifractal model for circulation moments in classical flows. To date, these findings are the most convincing evidence of intermittency in the large scales of quantum turbulence. Moreover, our results strongly reinforce the resemblance between classical and quantum turbulence, highlighting the universality of inertial-range dynamics, including intermittency, across these two a priori very different systems. This work paves the way for an interpretation of inertial-range dynamics in terms of the polarization and spatial arrangement of vortex filaments.},

This can be accomplished by sampling protein conformational space with molecular simulation methodologies. Despite advances in computing hardware and sampling techniques, simulations always yield a discretized representation of this space, with transition states undersampled proportionally to their associated energy barrier. We present a convolutional neural network that learns a continuous conformational space representation from example structures, and loss functions that ensure intermediates between examples are physically plausible. We show that this network, trained with simulations of distinct protein states, can correctly predict a biologically relevant transition path, without any example on the path provided. We also show we can transfer features learned from one protein to others, which results in superior performances, and requires a surprisingly small number of training examples.},

  abstract     = {The probability of two loci, separated by a certain genome length, being in contact can be inferred using the chromosome conformation capture (3C) method and related Hi-C experiments. How to go from the contact map, a matrix listing the mean contact probabilities between a large number of pairs of loci, to an ensemble of three-dimensional structures is an open problem. A solution to this problem, without assuming an assumed energy function, would be the first step in understanding the way nature has solved the packaging of chromosomes in tight cellular spaces. We created a theory, based on polymer physics characteristics of chromosomes and the maximum entropy principles, referred to as HIPPS (Hi-C-polymer-physics-structures) method, that allows us to calculate the 3D structures solely from Hi-C contact maps. The first step in the HIPPS method is to relate the mean contact probability ( ⟨ p i j ⟩ ) between loci i and j and the average spatial distance ⟨ r ¯ i j ⟩ . This is a difficult problem to solve because the cell population is heterogeneous, which means that a given contact exists only in a small unknown fraction of cells. Despite the population heterogeneity, we first prove that there is a theoretical lower bound connecting ⟨ p i j ⟩ and ⟨ r ¯ i j ⟩ via a power-law relation. We show, using simulations of a precisely solvable model, that the overall organization is accurately captured by constructing the distance map from the contact map even if the cell population is highly heterogeneous, thus justifying the use of the lower bound. In the second step, the mean distance matrix, with elements ⟨ r ¯ i j ⟩ ′ s , is used as a constraint in the maximum entropy principle to obtain the joint distribution of spatial positions of the loci. Using the two steps, we created an ensemble of 3D structures for the 23 chromosomes from lymphoblastoid cells using the measured contact maps as inputs. The HIPPS method shows that conformations of chromosomes are heterogeneous even in a single cell type. The differences in the conformational heterogeneity of the same chromosome in different cell types (normal as well as cancerous cells) can also be quantitatively discerned using our theory. We validate the method by showing that the calculated volumes of the 23 chromosomes from the predicted 3D structures are in good agreement with experimental estimates. Because the method is general, the 3D structures for any species may be calculated directly from the contact map without the need to assume a specific polymer model, as is customarily done.},

When traversing from La to Lu, the out-of-plane lattice constant decreases dramatically with an accompanying increase of Ni d x 2 − y 2 bandwidth; however, surprisingly, the role of oxygen charge transfer diminishes. In contrast, the magnetic exchange grows across the lanthanides, which may be favorable to superconductivity. Moreover, compensation effects from the itinerant 5 d electrons present a closer analogy to Kondo lattices, indicating a stronger interplay between charge transfer, bandwidth renormalization, compensation, and magnetic exchange. We also obtain the microscopic Hamiltonian using the Wannier downfolding technique, which will provide the starting point for further many-body theoretical studies.},

  abstract     = {An accurate description of the optical response of subwavelength metallic particles and nanogap structures is a key problem of plasmonics. Quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT) has emerged as a powerful method to calculate the optical response of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) since it takes into account nonlocality and spill-out effects. Nevertheless, the absorption spectra of metallic NPs obtained with conventional QHT, i.e., incorporating Thomas-Fermi (TF) and von Weizsäcker (vW) kinetic energy (KE) contributions, can be affected by several spurious resonances at energies higher than the main localized surface plasmon (LSP). These peaks are not present in reference time-dependent density-functional-theory spectra, where, instead, only a broad shoulder exists. Moreover, we show here that these peaks incorrectly reduce the LSP peak intensity and have a strong dependence on the simulation domain size so that a proper calculation of QHT absorption spectra can be problematic. In this article, we introduce a more general QHT method accounting for KE contributions depending on the Laplacian of the electronic density ( q ), thus, beyond the gradient-only dependence of the TFvW functional. We show that employing a KE functional with a term proportional to q 2 results in an absorption spectrum free of spurious peaks, with LSP resonance of correct intensity and numerically stable Bennett state. Finally, we present a novel Laplacian-level KE functional that is very accurate for the description of the optical properties of NPs of different sizes as well as for dimers. Thus, the Laplacian-level QHT represents a novel, efficient, and accurate platform to study plasmonic systems.},

Here, for the first time, we derive dynamic message-passing equations that provide an exact description of the dynamics of two, interacting, unidirectional spreading processes on tree graphs, and we develop systematic low-complexity models that predict the spread on general graphs. We also develop a theoretical framework for the optimal control of interacting spreading processes through optimized resource allocation under budget constraints and within a finite time window. Derived algorithms can be used to maximize the desired spread in the presence of a rival competitive process and to limit the spread through vaccination in the case of coupled infectious diseases.

  abstract     = {One of the most fundamental problems in quantum many-body physics is the characterization of correlations among thermal states. Of particular relevance is the thermal area law, which justifies the tensor network approximations to thermal states with a bond dimension growing polynomially with the system size. In the regime of sufficiently low temperatures, which is crucially important for practical applications, the existing techniques do not yield optimal bounds. Here, we propose a new thermal area law that holds for generic many-body systems on lattices. We improve the temperature dependence from the original O ( β ) to O ( β 2 / 3 ) up to a logarithmic factor, thereby suggesting subballistic propagation of entanglement by imaginary-time evolution. This qualitatively differs from the real-time evolution, which usually induces linear growth of entanglement. We also prove analogous bounds for the Rényi entanglement of purification and the entanglement of formation. Our analysis is based on a polynomial approximation to the exponential function which provides a relationship between the imaginary-time evolution and random walks. Moreover, for one-dimensional (1D) systems with n spins, we prove that the Gibbs state is well approximated by a matrix product operator with a sublinear bond dimension for β = o [ log ( n ) ] . This proof allows us to rigorously establish, for the first time, a quasilinear time classical algorithm for constructing a matrix product state representation of 1D quantum Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures of β = o [ log ( n ) ] . Our new technical ingredient is a block decomposition of the Gibbs state that bears a resemblance to the decomposition of real-time evolution given by Haah et al.

In this article, we formalize the task of autonomous temporal probability concentration as the inherent goal of any clockwork based on thermal gradients. Within this framework, we show that a perfect clockwork can be approximated arbitrarily well by increasing its complexity.

  abstract     = {Rubber elasticity is the archetype of the entropic force emerging from the second law of thermodynamics; numerous experimental and theoretical studies on natural and synthetic rubbers have shown that the elasticity originates mostly from entropy change with deformation. Similarly, in polymer gels containing a large amount of solvent, it has also been postulated that the shear modulus (the modulus of rigidity) G , which is a kind of modulus of elasticity, is approximately equivalent to the entropy contribution G S , but this has yet to be verified experimentally. In this study, we measure the temperature dependence of the shear modulus G in a rubberlike (hyperelastic) polymer gel whose polymer volume fraction is at most 0.1. As a result, we find that the energy contribution G E = G − G S can be a significant negative value, reaching up to double the shear modulus G (i.e., | G E | ≃ 2 G ), although the shear modulus of stable materials is generally bound to be positive. We further argue that the energy contribution G E is governed by a vanishing temperature that is a universal function of the normalized polymer concentration, and G E vanishes when the solvent is removed. Our findings highlight the essential difference between rubber elasticity and gel elasticity (which were previously thought to be the same) and push the established field of gel elasticity into a new direction.},

  abstract     = {Controlling an evolving population is an important task in modern molecular genetics, including directed evolution for improving the activity of molecules and enzymes, in breeding experiments in animals and in plants, and in devising public health strategies to suppress evolving pathogens. An optimal intervention to direct evolution should be designed by considering its impact over an entire stochastic evolutionary trajectory that follows. As a result, a seemingly suboptimal intervention at a given time can be globally optimal as it can open opportunities for desirable actions in the future. Here, we propose a feedback control formalism to devise globally optimal artificial selection protocol to direct the evolution of molecular phenotypes. We show that artificial selection should be designed to counter evolutionary trade-offs among multivariate phenotypes to avoid undesirable outcomes in one phenotype by imposing selection on another. Control by artificial selection is challenged by our ability to predict molecular evolution. We develop an information theoretical framework and show that molecular timescales for evolution under natural selection can inform how to monitor a population in order to acquire sufficient predictive information for an effective intervention with artificial selection. Our formalism opens a new avenue for devising artificial selection methods for directed evolution of molecular functions.},

Here, we report bimodal motility in autophoretic droplet swimmers, driven by characteristic interfacial flow patterns for each propulsive mode. We demonstrate a dynamical transition from quasiballistic to bimodal chaotic propulsion by controlling the viscosity of the environment. To elucidate the physical mechanism of this transition, we simultaneously visualize hydrodynamic and chemical fields and interpret these observations by quantitative comparison to established advection-diffusion models. We show that, with increasing viscosity, higher hydrodynamic modes become excitable and the droplet recurrently switches between two dominant modes due to interactions with the self-generated chemical gradients. This type of self-interaction promotes self-avoiding walks mimicking examples of efficient spatial exploration strategies observed in nature.},

A key emergent description of fundamental excitations in ASIs is that of magnetic monopoles—mobile quasiparticles that carry an effective magnetic charge. Here, we demonstrate that the archetypal square ASI lattice can host, in specific regions of its magnetic phase diagram, plasmalike regimes containing a high density of mobile magnetic monopoles. These regimes result from the magnetic field-tunable tension on the Dirac strings connecting mobile monopoles. By passively “listening” to spontaneous monopole noise under conditions of strict thermal equilibrium, we reveal their intrinsic dynamics and show that monopole kinetics are most diffusive (that is, minimally correlated) in the plasma regime. These results open the door to on-demand monopole regimes having continuously field-tunable densities and dynamic properties, thereby providing a new paradigm for probing the physics of effective magnetic charges in synthetic matter.},

They produce gapless or zero-energy boundary excitations, including Majorana zero modes and chiral Majorana edge states with topologically protected phase coherence essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Candidate TSCs are very rare in nature. Here, we propose a novel route toward emergent quasi-one-dimensional (1D) TSCs in naturally embedded quantum structures such as atomic line defects in unconventional spin-singlet s -wave and d -wave superconductors. We show that inversion symmetry breaking and charge transfer due to the missing atoms lead to the occupation of incipient impurity bands and mixed-parity spin-singlet and -triplet Cooper pairing of neighboring electrons traversing the line defect. Nontrivial topological invariants arise and occupy a large part of the parameter space, including the time-reversal symmetry-breaking Zeeman coupling due to applied magnetic field or defect-induced magnetism, creating TSCs in different topological classes with robust Majorana zero modes at both ends of the line defect. Beyond providing a novel mechanism for the recent discovery of zero-energy bound states at both ends of an atomic line defect in monolayer Fe(Te,Se) superconductors, the findings pave the way for new material realizations of the simplest and most robust 1D TSCs using embedded quantum structures in unconventional superconductors with large pairing energy gaps and high transition temperatures.},

Here, we study how the minimum number of variables needed to accurately describe the important features of a data set—the intrinsic dimension ( I d )—behaves in the vicinity of phase transitions. We employ state-of-the-art nearest-neighbors-based I d estimators to compute the I d of raw Monte Carlo thermal configurations across different phase transitions: first-order, second-order, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless. For all the considered cases, we find that the I d uniquely characterizes the transition regime. The finite-size analysis of the I d allows us to not only identify critical points with an accuracy comparable to methods that rely on a priori identification of order parameters but also to determine the corresponding (critical) exponent ν in the case of continuous transitions. For the case of topological transitions, this analysis overcomes the reported limitations affecting other unsupervised learning methods. Our work reveals how raw data sets display unique signatures of universal behavior in the absence of any dimensional reduction scheme and suggest direct parallelism between conventional order parameters in real space and the intrinsic dimension in the data space.},

Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements unveil a massive Dirac gap at the MnBi 2 Te 4 surface and a gapless Dirac cone on the other side. Remarkably, the Dirac gap (about 28 meV) at the MnBi 2 Te 4 surface decreases monotonically with increasing temperature and closes right at the Curie temperature, thereby representing the first smoking-gun spectroscopic evidence of a magnetization-induced topological surface gap among all known magnetic topological materials. We further demonstrate theoretically that the half-magnetic topological insulator is desirable to realize the surface anomalous Hall effect, which serves as direct proof of the general concept of axion electrodynamics in condensed matter systems.},

  abstract     = {Agile cryptography allows for a resource-efficient swap of a cryptographic core in case the security of an underlying classical cryptographic algorithm becomes compromised. Conversely, versatile cryptography allows the user to switch the cryptographic task without requiring any knowledge of its inner workings. In this paper, we suggest how these related principles can be applied to the field of quantum cryptography by explicitly demonstrating two quantum cryptographic protocols, quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret sharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform. Crucially, the protocols differ only in their classical postprocessing. The system is also suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with deployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature phase-shift keying encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first time, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver, enhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are inherently multipartite, and we prove that they are secure not only when a player internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external) eavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed. In our first proof-of-principle demonstration of an agile and versatile quantum communication system, the quantum states are distributed at GHz rates. A 1-bit message may be securely signed using our QDS protocols in less than 0.05 ms over a 2-km fiber link and in less than 0.2 s over a 20-km fiber link. To our knowledge, this also marks the first demonstration of a continuous-variable direct QSS protocol.},

We report on the first direct in situ measurement of density fluctuations across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition. This measurement allows us to introduce a general and straightforward way to extract the static structure factor, estimate the spectrum of elementary excitations, and image the dominant fluctuation patterns. We observe a strong response in the static structure factor and infer a distinct roton minimum in the dispersion relation. Furthermore, we show that the characteristic fluctuations correspond to elementary excitations such as the roton modes, which are theoretically predicted to be dominant at the quantum critical point, and that the supersolid state supports both superfluid as well as crystal phonons.},

These solutions, however, are not applicable to larger systems, especially when the target state cannot be reached through a local transformation. Here, we demonstrate fast coherent transport of an atomic wave packet over a distance of 15 times its size—a paradigmatic case of quantum processes going beyond the two-level system. Our measurements of the transport fidelity reveal the existence of a minimum duration—a quantum speed limit—for the coherent splitting and recombination of matter waves. We obtain physical insight into this limit by relying on a geometric interpretation of quantum state dynamics.

  abstract     = {The Kitaev honeycomb model has attracted significant attention due to its exactly solvable spin-liquid ground state with fractionalized Majorana excitations and its possible materialization in magnetic Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit couplings. Recently, the 5 d -electron compound H 3 LiIr 2 O 6 has shown to be a strong candidate for Kitaev physics considering the absence of any signs of a long-range ordered magnetic state. In this work, we demonstrate that a finite density of random vacancies in the Kitaev model gives rise to a striking pileup of low-energy Majorana eigenmodes and reproduces the apparent power-law upturn in the specific heat measurements of H 3 LiIr 2 O 6 . Physically, the vacancies can originate from various sources such as missing magnetic moments or the presence of nonmagnetic impurities (true vacancies), or from local weak couplings of magnetic moments due to strong but rare bond randomness (quasivacancies). We show numerically that the vacancy effect is readily detectable even at low vacancy concentrations and that it is not very sensitive either to the nature of vacancies or to different flux backgrounds. We also study the response of the site-diluted Kitaev spin liquid to the three-spin interaction term, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and imitates an external magnetic field. We propose a field-induced flux-sector transition where the ground state becomes flux-free for larger fields, resulting in a clear suppression of the low-temperature specific heat. Finally, we discuss the effect of dangling Majorana fermions in the case of true vacancies and show that their coupling to an applied magnetic field via the Zeeman interaction can also account for the scaling behavior in the high-field limit observed in H 3 LiIr 2 O 6 .},

  abstract     = {Tissue, cell, and nucleus morphology change during tumor progression. In 2D confluent cell cultures, different tissue states, such as fluid (unjammed) and solid (jammed), are correlated with cell shapes. These results do not have to apply a priori to three dimensions. Cancer cell motility requires and corresponds to a fluidization of the tumor tissue on the bulk level. Here, we investigate bulk tissue fluidity in 3D and determine how it correlates with cell and nucleus shape. In patient samples of mamma and cervix carcinoma, we find areas where cells can move or are immobile. We compare 3D cell spheroids composed of cells from a cancerous and a noncancerous cell line. Through bulk mechanical spheroid-fusion experiments and single live-cell tracking, we show that the cancerous sample is fluidized by active cells moving through the tissue. The healthy, epithelial sample with immobile cells behaves more solidlike. 3D segmentations of the samples show that the degree of tissue fluidity correlates with elongated cell and nucleus shapes. This correlation links cell shapes to cell motility and bulk mechanical behavior. We find two active states of matter in solid tumors: an amorphous glasslike state with characteristics of 3D cell jamming and a disordered fluid state. Individual cell and nucleus shape may serve as a marker for metastatic potential to foster personalized cancer treatment. This article appears in the following collection:},

A comparison with the experimental data collected on MAGNDATA shows that the most stable magnetic configurations in nature are linear combinations of only few CMPs. Furthermore, a high-throughput calculation for all candidate magnetic structures is performed in the framework of spin-density functional theory (SDFT). We benchmark the predictive power of CMP + SDFT with 2935 calculations, which show that (i) the CMP expansion administers an exhaustive list of candidate magnetic structures, (ii) CMP + SDFT can narrow down the possible magnetic configurations to a handful of computed configurations, and (iii) SDFT reproduces the experimental magnetic configurations with an accuracy of ± 0.5 μ B . For a subset the impact of on-site Coulomb repulsion U is investigated by means of 1545 CMP + SDFT + U calculations revealing no further improvement on the predictive power.},

  abstract     = {Unitary circuits subject to repeated projective measurements can undergo an entanglement phase transition (EPT) as a function of the measurement rate. This transition is generally understood in terms of a competition between the scrambling effects of unitary dynamics and the disentangling effects of measurements. We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence of scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from measurements alone. This finding motivates us to introduce measurement-only models , in which the “scrambling” and “unscrambling” effects driving the EPT are fundamentally intertwined and cannot be attributed to physically distinct processes. These models represent a novel form of an EPT, conceptually distinct from that in hybrid unitary-projective circuits. We explore the entanglement phase diagrams, critical points, and quantum code properties of some of these measurement-only models. We find that the principle driving the EPTs in these models is frustration , or mutual incompatibility, of the measurements. Surprisingly, an entangling (volume-law) phase is the generic outcome when measuring sufficiently long but still local ( ≳ 3 -body) operators. We identify a class of exceptions to this behavior (“bipartite ensembles”) which cannot sustain an entangling phase but display dual area-law phases, possibly with different kinds of quantum order, separated by self-dual critical points. Finally, we introduce a measure of information spreading in dynamics with measurements and use it to demonstrate the emergence of a statistical light cone, despite the nonlocality inherent to quantum measurements.},

We show how to use the stochastic x-ray field statistics to overcome this difficulty through correlation signals averaged over independent pulse realizations. No control is required over the spectral phase of the pulse, enabling immediate application of existing, noisy x-ray free-electron-laser pulses. The proposed stimulated Raman technique provides the combined broad observation bandwidth and high time-frequency resolution needed for the observation of elementary molecular events. A model is used to simulate chaotic free-electron-laser pulses and calculate their correlation properties. The resulting joint temporal and spectral resolution is exemplified for a molecular model system with time-dependent frequencies and for the RNA base uracil passing through a conical intersection. Ultrafast coherences, which constitute a direct signature of the nonadiabatic dynamics, are resolved. The detail and depth of physical information accessed by the proposed stochastic signal are virtually identical to those obtained by phase-controlled pulses.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of multiple parameters in quantum metrology is important for a vast array of applications in quantum information processing. However, the unattainability of fundamental precision bounds for incompatible observables greatly diminishes the applicability of estimation theory in many practical implementations. The Holevo Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB) provides the most fundamental, simultaneously attainable bound for multiparameter estimation problems. A general closed form for the HCRB is not known given that it requires a complex optimization over multiple variables. In this work, we develop an analytic approach to solving the HCRB for two parameters. Our analysis reveals the role of the HCRB and its interplay with alternative bounds in estimation theory. For more parameters, we generate a lower bound to the HCRB. Our work greatly reduces the complexity of determining the HCRB to solving a set of linear equations that even numerically permits a quadratic speedup over previous state-of-the-art approaches. We apply our results to compare the performance of different probe states in magnetic field sensing and characterize the performance of state tomography on the code space of noisy bosonic error-correcting codes. The sensitivity of state tomography on noisy binomial code states can be improved by tuning two coding parameters that relate to the number of correctable phase and amplitude damping errors. Our work provides fundamental insights and makes significant progress toward the estimation of multiple incompatible observables.},

The protocol relies on the transient response of a dispersively coupled measurement resonator to map the state of the qubit to “bright” and “dark” cavity pointer states that are characterized by a large differential photon occupation. Following this mapping, we photodetect the resonator using the Josephson photomultiplier, which transitions between classically distinguishable flux states when cavity photon occupation exceeds a certain threshold. Our technique provides access to the binary outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage without the need for quantum-limited preamplification and thresholding at room temperature. We achieve raw single-shot measurement fidelity in excess of 98\% across multiple samples using this approach in total measurement times under 500 ns. In addition, we show that the backaction and crosstalk associated with our measurement protocol can be mitigated by exploiting the intrinsic damping of the Josephson photomultiplier itself.},

  abstract     = {It is interesting to observe that all optical materials with a positive refractive index have a value of index that is of order unity. Surprisingly, though, a deep understanding of the mechanisms that lead to this universal behavior seems to be lacking. Moreover, this observation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that a single isolated atom is known to have a giant optical response, as characterized by a resonant scattering cross section that far exceeds its physical size. Here, we theoretically and numerically investigate the evolution of the optical properties of an ensemble of ideal atoms as a function of density, starting from the dilute gas limit, including the effects of multiple scattering and near-field interactions. Interestingly, despite the giant response of an isolated atom, we find that the maximum index does not indefinitely grow with increasing density but rather reaches a limiting value of n ≈ 1.7 . This limit arises purely from electrodynamics, as it occurs at densities far below those where chemical processes become important. We propose an explanation based upon strong-disorder renormalization group theory, in which the near-field interaction combined with random atomic positions results in an inhomogeneous broadening of atomic resonance frequencies. This mechanism ensures that, regardless of the physical atomic density, light at any given frequency only interacts with at most a few near-resonant atoms per cubic wavelength, thus limiting the maximum index attainable. Our work is a promising first step to understand the limits of the refractive index from a bottom-up, atomic physics perspective, and it also introduces the renormalization group as a powerful tool to understand the generally complex problem of multiple scattering of light overall.},

At temperatures well below the melting point, friction is strongly temperature dependent and follows an Arrhenius behavior, which we interpret as resulting from the thermally activated diffusive motion of surface ice molecules. We find that this motion is hindered when the contact pressure is increased; in this case, the friction increases exponentially, and the slipperiness of the ice disappears. Close to the melting point, the ice surface is plastically deformed due to the pressure exerted by the slider, a process depending on the slider geometry and penetration hardness of the ice. The ice penetration hardness is shown to increase approximately linearly with decreasing temperature and sublinearly with indentation speed. We show that the latter results in a nonmonotonic dependence of the ploughing force on sliding speed. Our results thus clarify the complex dependence of ice friction on temperature, contact pressure, and speed.},

We present neutron powder diffraction data using new ultrahigh-pressure techniques to measure the magnetic structure of Mott-insulating 2D honeycomb antiferromagnet FePS 3 at pressures up to 183 kbar and temperatures down to 80 K. These data are complemented by high-pressure magnetometry and reverse Monte Carlo modeling of the spin configurations. As pressure is applied, the previously measured ambient-pressure magnetic order switches from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic interplanar interaction and from 2D-like to 3D-like character. The overall antiferromagnetic structure within the a b planes, ferromagnetic chains antiferromagnetically coupled, is preserved, but the magnetic propagation vector is altered from k = ( 0 , 1 , 1 2 ) to k = ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , a halving of the magnetic unit cell size. At higher pressures, coincident with the second structural transition and the insulator-metal transition in this compound, we observe a suppression of this long-range order and emergence of a form of magnetic short-range order which survives above room temperature. Reverse Monte Carlo fitting suggests this phase to be a short-ranged version of the original ambient-pressure structure—with the Fe moment size remaining of similar magnitude and with a return to antiferromagnetic interplanar correlations. The persistence of magnetism well into the HP-II metallic state is an observation in contradiction with previous x-ray spectroscopy results which suggest a spin-crossover transition.},

To make these devices robust to experimental imperfections, we require some form of quantum error correction. Current approaches focus on topological codes, as they appear to be in the realm of experimental capabilities. These techniques will likely lead to the first proof of principle of fault tolerance in the next 5 yr. In the long run, however, these approaches require a very large number of physical qubits to construct a fault-tolerant quantum circuit that can run interesting algorithms. As an alternative, it is proposed that quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes could serve as an architecture that circumvents this problem. The best candidate class of quantum LDPC codes were discovered by Tillich and Zémor and are called hypergraph product codes. These codes have a constant encoding rate and were recently shown to have a constant fault-tolerant error threshold. With these features, they asymptotically offer a smaller overhead compared to topological codes. Here, we demonstrate how to perform Clifford gates on this class of codes using code deformation. To this end, we introduce wormhole defects on hypergraph product codes. Together with state injection, we can perform a universal set of gates within a single block of the class of hypergraph product codes.},

  abstract     = {Interacting many-body systems with explicitly accessible spatiotemporal correlation functions are extremely rare, especially in the absence of Bethe-ansatz or Yang-Baxter integrability. Recently, we identified a remarkable class of such systems and termed them dual-unitary quantum circuits. These are brickwork-type local quantum circuits whose dynamics are unitary in both time and space. The spatiotemporal correlation functions of these systems turn out to be nontrivial only at the edge of the causal light cone and can be computed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. Dual unitarity, however, requires fine-tuning, and the degree of generality of the observed dynamical features remains unclear. Here, we address this question by studying perturbed dual-unitary quantum circuits. Considering arbitrary perturbations of the local gates, we prove that for a particular class of unperturbed elementary dual-unitary gates the correlation functions are still expressed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. These matrices, however, are now contracted over generic paths connecting the origin to a fixed end point inside the causal light cone. The correlation function is given as a sum over all such paths. Our statement is rigorous in the “dilute limit,” where only a small fraction of the gates is perturbed, and in the presence of random longitudinal fields, but we provide theoretical arguments and stringent numerical checks supporting its validity even in the clean case (no randomness) and when all gates are perturbed. As a by-product of our analysis, in the case of random longitudinal fields—which turns out to be equivalent to certain classical Markov chains—we find four types of non-dual-unitary (and nonintegrable) interacting many-body systems where the correlation functions are exactly solvable and given—without approximations—by the path-sum formula.},

  abstract     = {An anapole state that breaks inversion and time-reversal symmetries while preserving translation symmetry of an underlying lattice has aroused great interest as a new quantum state, but only a few candidate materials have been reported. Recently, in a spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator Sr 2 ( Ir 1 − x Rh x ) O 4 , the emergence of a possible hidden-order phase with broken inversion symmetry has been suggested at T Ω above the Néel temperature by optical second-harmonic-generation measurements. Moreover, polarized neutron diffraction measurements revealed broken time-reversal symmetry below T Ω , which was supported by subsequent muon spin relaxation experiments. However, the nature of this mysterious phase remains largely elusive. Here, we investigate the hidden-order phase through the combined measurements of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy with exceptionally high-precision magnetic torque and the nematic susceptibility with elastoresistance. A distinct twofold in-plane magnetic anisotropy along the [110] Ir-O-Ir bond direction sets in below about T Ω , providing thermodynamic evidence for a nematic phase transition with broken C 4 rotational symmetry. However, in contrast to the even-parity nematic transition reported in other correlated electron systems, the nematic susceptibility exhibits no divergent behavior towards T Ω . These results provide bulk evidence for an odd-parity order parameter with broken rotational symmetry in the hidden-order state. We discuss the hidden order in terms of an anapole state, in which the polar toroidal moment is induced by two current loops in each IrO 6 octahedron of opposite chirality. Contrary to the simplest loop-current pattern previously suggested, the present results are consistent with a pattern in which the intra-unit cell loop current flows along only one of the diagonal directions in the IrO 4 square.},

  abstract     = {The Lie-Trotter formula, together with its higher-order generalizations, provides a direct approach to decomposing the exponential of a sum of operators. Despite significant effort, the error scaling of such product formulas remains poorly understood. We develop a theory of Trotter error that overcomes the limitations of prior approaches based on truncating the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. Our analysis directly exploits the commutativity of operator summands, producing tighter error bounds for both real- and imaginary-time evolutions. Whereas previous work achieves similar goals for systems with geometric locality or Lie-algebraic structure, our approach holds, in general. We give a host of improved algorithms for digital quantum simulation and quantum Monte Carlo methods, including simulations of second-quantized plane-wave electronic structure, k -local Hamiltonians, rapidly decaying power-law interactions, clustered Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model, and quantum ferromagnets, nearly matching or even outperforming the best previous results. We obtain further speedups using the fact that product formulas can preserve the locality of the simulated system. Specifically, we show that local observables can be simulated with complexity independent of the system size for power-law interacting systems, which implies a Lieb-Robinson bound as a by-product. Our analysis reproduces known tight bounds for first- and second-order formulas. Our higher-order bound overestimates the complexity of simulating a one-dimensional Heisenberg model with an even-odd ordering of terms by only a factor of 5, and it is close to tight for power-law interactions and other orderings of terms.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate trapping of electrons in a millimeter-sized quadrupole Paul trap driven at 1.6 GHz in a room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum setup. Cold electrons are introduced into the trap by ionization of atomic calcium via Rydberg states and stay confined by microwave and static electric fields for several tens of milliseconds. A fraction of these electrons remain trapped longer and show no measurable loss for measurement times up to a second. Electronic excitation of the motion reveals secular frequencies that can be tuned over a range of several tens to hundreds of MHz. Operating a similar electron Paul trap in a cryogenic environment may provide a platform for all-electric quantum computing with trapped electron spin qubits.},

Polariton Bose-Einstein condensation and photon lasing have been widely accepted in the limits of low and high carrier densities, but identification of the expected Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state at intermediate densities remains elusive, as the optical-gain mechanism cannot be directly inferred from existing experiments. Here, using a microcavity with strong polarization selectivity, we gain direct experimental access to the reservoir absorption in the presence of polariton condensation and lasing, which reveals a fermionic gain mechanism underlying the polariton laser. A microscopic many-particle theory shows that this polariton lasing state is consistent with an open-dissipative-pumped system analog of a polaritonic BCS state.},

However, the scattering mechanisms central to the fundamental transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we reveal signatures of significant phonon-electron scattering in the type-II Weyl semimetal WP 2 via temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Over a large temperature range, we find that the decay rates of the lowest energy A 1 modes are dominated by phonon-electron rather than phonon-phonon scattering. In conjunction with first-principles calculations, a combined analysis of the momentum, energy, and symmetry-allowed decay paths indicates this results from finite momentum interband and intraband scattering of the electrons. The excellent agreement with theory further suggests that such results could be true for the acoustic modes. We thus provide evidence for the importance of phonons in the transport properties of topological semimetals and identify specific properties that may contribute to such behavior in other materials.},

Our study reveals that the THMs are protected by second Chern numbers, and the TSMs are protected by a topological invariant composed of two first Chern numbers, each belonging to a Chern insulator existing in subdimensions. With the synthetic coordinates fixed, the THMs and TSMs, respectively, manifest as topological edge modes and topological corner modes (TCMs) in the real space, which are experimentally observed in a 2D acoustic lattice. These TCMs are not related to quantized polarizations, making them fundamentally distinctive from existing examples.

Addition of qubits to this waveguide system also enables direct quantum control over topological edge states that form in finite waveguide systems, useful for instance in constructing a topologically protected quantum communication channel.

  abstract     = {Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) provides a unique framework to elucidate the interplay between strong correlations and topological phenomena in two-dimensional systems. The existence of multiple electronic degrees of freedom—charge, spin, and valley—gives rise to a plethora of possible ordered states and instabilities. Identifying which of them are realized in the regime of strong correlations is fundamental to shed light on the nature of the superconducting and correlated insulating states observed in the TBG experiments. Here, we use unbiased, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations to solve an effective interacting lattice model for TBG at charge neutrality. Besides the usual cluster Hubbard-like repulsion, this model also contains an assisted-hopping interaction that emerges due to the nontrivial topological properties of TBG. Such a nonlocal interaction fundamentally alters the phase diagram at charge neutrality, gapping the Dirac cones even for infinitesimally small interactions. As the interaction strength increases, a sequence of different correlated insulating phases emerge, including a quantum valley Hall state with topological edge states, an intervalley-coherent insulator, and a valence bond solid. The charge-neutrality correlated insulating phases discovered here provide the sought-after reference states needed for a comprehensive understanding of the insulating states at integer fillings and the proximate superconducting states of TBG.},

  abstract     = {The bond-dependent Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with anyonic excitations has recently attracted considerable attention. However, in solid-state materials other spin interactions are present, and among such additional interactions, the off-diagonal symmetric Gamma interaction, another type of bond-dependent term, has been particularly challenging to fully understand. A minimal Kitaev-Gamma model has been investigated by various numerical techniques under a magnetic field, but definite conclusions about field-induced spin liquids remain elusive. One reason for this may lie in the limited sizes of the two-dimensional geometry it is possible to access numerically, and missed incommensurately ordered states may be interpreted as a spin liquid. Here we focus on the Kitaev-Gamma ladder model as a guide to the phase space of disordered states which could potentially become a spin liquid in the two-dimensional limit. We determine the entire phase diagram in the presence of a magnetic field along the [111] direction. Because of the competition between the interactions and the field, an extremely rich phase diagram emerges with 15 distinct phases. Focusing near the antiferromagnetic Kitaev region, we identify nine different phases solely within this region: several incommensurate magnetically ordered phases, spin-nematic, and two chiral phases with enhanced entanglement. Of particular interest is a highly entangled phase with staggered chirality with zero-net flux occurring at intermediate field, which along with its companion phases outlines a heart-shaped region of high entanglement, the heart of entanglement. We compare our results for the ladder with a C 3 symmetric cluster of the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, and offer insight into possible spin liquids in the two-dimensional limit.},

The dynamics leading to these polarized ideological opinions pose a challenge: How can such correlations emerge, without assuming them a priori in individual preferences or in a preexisting social structure? Here, we propose a simple model that qualitatively reproduces ideological opinion states found in survey data, even between rather unrelated, but sufficiently controversial, topics. Inspired by skew coordinate systems recently proposed in natural language processing models, we solidify these intuitions in a formalism of opinions unfolding in a multidimensional space where topics form a nonorthogonal basis. Opinions evolve according to the social interactions among the agents, which are ruled by homophily: Two agents sharing similar opinions are more likely to interact. The model features phase transitions between a global consensus, opinion polarization, and ideological states. Interestingly, the ideological phase emerges by relaxing the assumption of an orthogonal basis of the topic space, i.e., if topics thematically overlap. Furthermore, we analytically and numerically show that these transitions are driven by the controversialness of the topics discussed; the more controversial the topics, the more likely are opinions to be correlated. Our findings shed light upon the mechanisms driving the emergence of ideology in the formation of opinions.},

The total magnetization is found to exhibit subexponential relaxation analogous to classical glassy dynamics, but in the quantum case this relaxation originates from the buildup of nonclassical correlations. In both experiment and semiclassical simulations, we find the evolution toward a randomized state is independent of the strength of disorder up to a critical value. This hints toward a unifying description of relaxation dynamics in disordered isolated quantum systems, analogous to the generalization of statistical mechanics to out-of-equilibrium scenarios in classical spin glasses.},

We utilize higher levels of the fluxonium to read out the qubit state and to initialize the qubit with 97\% fidelity corresponding to cooling it to 190 μ K . Instead of using standard microwave pulses, we control the qubit only with fast-flux pulses, generating control fields much larger than the qubit frequency.

  abstract     = {The coexistence of many competing species in an ecological community is a long-standing theoretical and empirical puzzle. Classic approaches in ecology assume that species fitness and interactions in a given environment are mainly driven by a few essential species traits, and coexistence can be explained by trade-offs between these traits. The apparent diversity of species is then summarized by their positions (“ecological niches”) in a low-dimensional trait space. Yet, in a complex community, any particular set of traits and trade-offs is unlikely to encompass the full organization of the community. A diametrically opposite approach assumes that species interactions are disordered, i.e., essentially random, as might arise when many species traits combine in complex ways. This approach is appealing theoretically, and can lead to novel emergent phenomena, fundamentally different from the picture painted by low-dimensional theories. Nonetheless, fully disordered interactions are incompatible with many-species coexistence, and neither disorder nor its dynamical consequences have received direct empirical support so far. Here we ask what happens when random species interactions are minimally constrained by coexistence. We show theoretically that this leads to testable predictions. Species interactions remain highly disordered, yet with a “diffuse” statistical structure: interaction strengths are biased so that successful competitors subtly favor each other, and correlated so that competitors partition their impacts on other species. We provide strong empirical evidence for this pattern, in data from grassland biodiversity experiments that match our predictions quantitatively. This is a first-of-a-kind test of disorder on empirically measured interactions, and unique evidence that species interactions and coexistence emerge from an underlying high-dimensional space of ecological traits. Our findings provide a new null model for inferring interaction networks with minimal prior information and a set of empirical fingerprints that support a statistical physics-inspired approach of complex ecosystems.},

We derive the optimal conditions under which the dressed state is fully protected from dephasing when using either one or two dressing fields. The latter provides better protection, circumvents qubit phase rotation, and suppresses the sensitivity to drive noise. We further derive expressions for all residual, higher-order sensitivities. We experimentally study the scheme by protecting a collective excitation of an atomic ensemble, where inhomogeneous dephasing originates from thermal motion. Using photon storage and retrieval, we demonstrate complete suppression of inhomogeneous dephasing and, consequently, a prolonged memory time. Our scheme may be applied to eliminate motional dephasing in other systems, improving the performance of quantum gates and memories with neutral atoms. It is also generally applicable to various gas, solid, and engineered systems, where sensitivity to variations in time, space, or other domains limits possible scale-up of the system.},

We find that, with increasing hole concentration, the long-range checkerboard order gradually evolves into short-range glassy patterns consisting of diluted charge puddles. Each charge puddle has a unidirectional nematic internal structure and exhibits clear pair density modulations as revealed by the spatial variations of the superconducting coherence peak and gap depth. Both the charge puddles and the nematicity vanish completely in the strongly overdoped nonsuperconducting regime, when another type of short-range order with 2 × 2 periodicity emerges.

  abstract     = {Atomic diffusion is a spontaneous process and significantly influences properties of materials, such as fracture toughness, creep-fatigue properties, thermal conductivity, thermoelectric properties, etc. Here, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on both ab initio and machine-learning potentials, we demonstrate that an atomic one dimensional cooperative diffusion exists in the simple cubic high-pressure finite-temperature phase of calcium in the premelting regime, where some atoms diffuse cooperatively as chains or even rings, while others remain in the solid state. This intermediate regime is triggered by anharmonicity of the system at high temperature and is stabilized by the competition between the internal energy minimization and the entropy maximization, and has close connections with the unique electronic structures of simple cubic Ca as an electride with a pseudogap. This cooperative diffusion regime explains the abnormal enhancement of the melting line of Ca under high pressure and suggests that the cooperative chain melting is a much more common high-temperature feature among metals under extreme conditions than hitherto thought. The microscopic electronic investigations of these systems combining ab initio and machine-learning data point out the direction for further understanding of other metallic systems such as the glass transition, liquid metals, etc.},

  abstract     = {Advances in high-speed imaging techniques have opened new possibilities for capturing ultrafast phenomena such as light propagation in air or through media. Capturing light in flight in three-dimensional x y t space has been reported based on various types of imaging systems, whereas reconstruction of light-in-flight information in the fourth dimension z has been a challenge. We demonstrate the four-dimensional light-in-flight imaging based on the observation of a superluminal motion captured by a new time-gated megapixel single-photon avalanche diode camera. A high-resolution light-in-flight video is generated without laser scanning, camera translation, interpolation, or dark noise subtraction. An unsupervised machine-learning technique is applied to analyze the measured spatiotemporal data set. A theoretical formula is introduced to perform least-square regression for numerically solving a nonlinear inverse problem, and extra-dimensional information is recovered without prior knowledge. The algorithm relies on the mathematical formulation equivalent to the superluminal motion in astrophysics, which is scaled by a factor of a quadrillionth. The reconstructed light-in-flight trajectory shows good agreement with the actual geometry of the light path. Applicability of the reconstruction approach to more complex scenes with multiple overlapped light trajectories is verified based on a data set generated by Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach could potentially provide novel functionalities to high-speed imaging applications such as non-line-of-sight imaging and time-resolved optical tomography.},

  abstract     = {In a complex and ever-changing environment, various signal transduction pathways mediate outside signals and stress to a living cell and its intracellular responses. Eukaryotic cells utilize the DNA synthesis phase (S-phase) checkpoint to respond to DNA damage and replication stress, and the activation of the S-phase checkpoint defers the routine progression in the S phase. Through the analysis of microfluidic single-cell measurements, we find that the behavior of yeast cells exhibits bimodal distribution in the activation of the S-phase checkpoint, and the nonactivated portion of cells obeys the exponential decay law over time, the rate of which is dictated by HU dosage. Mathematical modeling and further experimental evidence from different mutant strains support the idea that the activation of the yeast S-phase checkpoint is a stochastic barrier-crossing process in a double-well system, where the barrier height is determined by both DNA replication stress and autophosphorylation of the key effector kinase Rad53. Our approach, as a novel methodology, is generally applicable to quantitative analysis of the signal transduction pathways at the single-cell level.},

  abstract     = {Recently reported with nontrivial topological properties and magnetic orders, MnBi 2 Te 4 is an intrinsic, magnetic topological insulator which holds promise for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, the layer-dependent magnetism of MnBi 2 Te 4 , which is fundamental and crucial for further exploration of related quantum phenomena in this system, remains elusive. Here, by using polar reflective magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that few-layered MnBi 2 Te 4 exhibits an evident odd-even layer-number effect, i.e., the oscillations of the coercivity of the hysteresis loop (at μ 0 H c ) and the spin-flop transition (at μ 0 H 1 ), concerning the Zeeman energy and magnetic anisotropy energy. Noticeably, an anomalous magnetic hysteresis loop is observed in the even-number septuple-layered MnBi 2 Te 4 , which might be attributed to the thickness-independent surface-related magnetization. A linear-chain model is applied to elucidate this odd-even layer-number effect of the spin-flop field and to determine the evolution of the magnetic states when subjected to an external magnetic field. A mean-field method further allows us to fully map the MnBi 2 Te 4 flake’s magnetic phase diagrams in the parameter space of the magnetic field, layer number, and, especially, temperature. By harnessing the unusual layer-dependent magnetic properties, our work paves the way for further study of quantum phenomena of MnBi 2 Te 4 .},

  abstract     = {Herein we show that nonresonant inelastic x-ray scattering involving an s core level is a powerful spectroscopic method to characterize the excited states of transition metal compounds. The spherical charge distribution of the s core hole allows the orientational dependence of the intensities of the various spectral features to produce a spatial charge image of the associated multiplet states in a straightforward manner, thereby facilitating the identification of their orbital character. In addition, the s core hole does not add an extra orbital angular momentum component to the multiplet structure so that the well-established Sugano-Tanabe-Kamimura diagrams can be used for the analysis of the spectra. For α -MnS we observe the spherical charge density corresponding to its high-spin 3 d 5 ( A 1 6 ) ground state configuration and we were able to selectively image its excited states and identify them as t 2 g ( T 2 5 ) and e g ( E 5 ) with an energy splitting 10 D q of 0.78 eV.},

  abstract     = {Rectified electric current induced by irradiating light, a so-called photocurrent, is an established phenomenon in optoelectronic physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive classification of the photocurrent response arising from the parity violation in bulk systems. We clarify the contrasting role of T and P T symmetries and consequently find new types of photocurrent phenomena characteristic of parity-violating magnets—the intrinsic Fermi surface effect and the gyration current. In particular, the gyration current is induced by circularly polarized light, and it is the counterpart of the shift current caused by linearly polarized light. This photocurrent adds a new functionality of materials studied in various fields of condensed matter physics such as multiferroics and spintronics. A list of materials is provided. Furthermore, we show that the gyration current is strongly enhanced by topologically nontrivial band dispersion. On the basis of the microscopic analysis of Dirac models, we demonstrate the divergent photocurrent response and elucidate the importance of the tilting of Dirac cones.},
