  abstract     = {In the long-term deployment of mobile robots, changing appearance brings challenges for localization. When a robot travels to the same place or restarts from an existing map, global localization is needed, where place recognition provides coarse position information. For visual sensors, changing appearances such as the transition from day to night and seasonal variation can reduce the performance of a visual place recognition system. To address this problem, we propose to learn domain-unrelated features across extreme changing appearance, where a domain denotes a specific appearance condition, such as a season or a kind of weather. We use an adversarial network with two discriminators to disentangle domain-related features and domain-unrelated features from images, and the domain-unrelated features are used as descriptors in place recognition. Provided images from different domains, our network is trained in a self-supervised manner which does not require correspondences between these domains. Besides, our feature extractors are shared among all domains, making it possible to contain more appearance without increasing model complexity. Qualitative and quantitative results on two toy cases are presented to show that our network can disentangle domain-related and domain-unrelated features from given data. Experiments on three public datasets and one proposed dataset for visual place recognition are conducted to illustrate the performance of our method compared with several typical algorithms. Besides, an ablation study is designed to validate the effectiveness of the introduced discriminators in our network. Additionally, we use a four-domain dataset to verify that the network can extend to multiple domains with one model while achieving similar performance.},

  abstract     = {Grasping objects in clutter is more difficult than grasping a separated single object. An important issue is that unsafe grasps may occur, in case, one object sits or leans on another, which could cause the collapse of objects. In addition, reachability of each object surrounded by other obstacles also has to be considered. So the order of multiple objects for grasping and the grasp configuration of each object must be planned simultaneously. This article combines grasp order and grasp configuration planning to perform fast and safe multiobject grasping in cluttered scenes. First, a comprehensive grasp configuration database is built to provide enough feasible grasp configurations for the objects. Then, we propose an obstruction degree to estimate the likelihood of reachability of each grasp configuration as well as each object. This measurement also implicitly infers object interactions. Finally, grasp order and grasp configurations are planned together to deal with the constraints caused by reachability and object interaction. Simulations and experiments in a series of cluttered scenes demonstrate that our method can grasp objects efficiently and can greatly reduce unsafe grasps.},

Consequently, very few full-body powered exoskeletons were developed to address these challenges, in spite of increasing demand for physical assistance at full-body level. This article presents an overall design and development of a powered full-body exoskeleton called “FB-AXO.” Primarily, FB-AXO consists of two main subsystems, a lower-body and an upper-body subsystem connected together through waist and spine modules. FB-AXO is developed for the support of weaker ageing adults so that they can continue functioning their daily activities. At the onset of the project, a set of functional and design requirements has been formulated with an extensive end-user involvement and then used in realizing the FB-AXO. The final FB-AXO design comprises of 27 degrees of freedom, of which 10 are active and 17 are passive, having a total system weight of 25 kg. Overall, the article elaborates comprehensively the design, construction, and preliminary testing of FB-AXO. The work effectively addresses design challenges including kinematic compatibility and modularity with innovative solutions. The details of the mechanics, sensors, and electronics of the two subsystems along with specifics of human-exoskeleton interfaces and ranges of motion are also provided. The FB-AXO exoskeleton effectively demonstrated to assist full-body motions such as normal walking, standing, bending as well as executing lifting and carrying tasks to meet the daily living demands of older users.},

  abstract     = {Accurately detecting the appropriate grasp configurations is the central task for the robot to grasp an object. Existing grasp detection methods usually overlook the depth image or only regard it as a two-dimensional distance image, which makes it difficult to capture the three-dimensional structural characteristics of target object. In this article, we transform the depth image to point cloud and propose a two-stage grasp detection method based on candidate grasp detection from RGB image and spatial feature rescoring from point cloud. Specifically, we first adopt the recently proposed high-performance rotation object detection method for aerial images, named R3Det, to grasp detection task, obtaining the candidate grasp boxes and their appearance scores. Then, point clouds within each candidate grasp box are normalized and evaluated to get the point cloud quality scores, which are fused with the established point cloud quantity scoring model to obtain spatial scores. Finally, appearance scores and their corresponding spatial scores are combined to output high-quality grasp detection results. The proposed method effectively fuses three types of grasp scoring modules, thus is called Score Fusion Grasp Net. Besides, we propose and adopt top-k grasp metric to effectively reflect the success rate of algorithm in actual grasp execution. Score Fusion Grasp Net obtains 98.5% image-wise accuracy and 98.1% object-wise accuracy on Cornell Grasp Dataset, which exceeds the performances of state-of-the-art methods. We also use the robotic arm to conduct physical grasp experiments on 15 kinds of household objects and 11 kinds of adversarial objects. The results show that the proposed method still has a high success rate when facing new objects.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the time-varying leader–follower formation control problem for nonholonomic mobile robots, under communication and visibility constraints. Although the leader–follower formation control under visibility constraints has been studied, the elimination of the off-tracking effect has not been widely addressed yet. In this work, a new method to eliminate the off-tracking effect, considering the time-invariant formation as a tractor–trailer system, for unknown and circular tractor paths, taking into account the visibility constraints, is proposed. For a time-varying formation with not circular tractor’s path, the proposed method significantly reduces the off-tracking. Only the relative position and the relative orientation, provided by the on board monocular camera, are required. Thus, both the leader robot’s absolute position and the leader robot’s velocities are not needed. Furthermore, to avoid explicit communication among the robots, an extended state observer is implemented to estimate both the translational and the rotational leader’s velocity. In this way, the desired tasks are executed and achieved in a decentralized manner. For a time-varying formation, with constant leader robot’s velocities, the proposed control strategy, based on the kinematic model, guarantees that the formation errors asymptotically converge to the origin. Based on the Lyapunov theory, the stability proof of the formation errors dynamics is shown. Simulation results, considering time-varying leader robot’s velocities, show the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

Due to its hysteresis and dynamic-related nonlinearity, accurate displacement tracking control of piezoelectric actuator is challenging. Besides, in some low-cost practical systems with low sampling rate, transmission delay causes mismatches between feedback and real displacement, further increasing the challenge in tracking control. In this article, a neural network-based model predictive controller (MPC) is proposed for precise tracking control of piezoelectric actuator’s displacement in situation where feedback is slow and delayed. The prediction model is based on a nonlinear-autoregressive-moving-average-with-exogenous-inputs framework, which outputs entire prediction horizon of future displacement in a single time, and is fulfilled by a multilayer feedforward neural network. An extended Kalman filter-based estimation for displacement is introduced to relieve the influence of feedback delays so as to improve dynamic performance of the controller. Another neural network is trained to provide initial values for MPC to reduce computation costs and improve performance in dynamic tracking. In a series of tracking experiments, the effectiveness of proposed controller is verified.},

The distributed driving is realized by multiple driving units connected in series and parallel. Firstly, the drive unit stiffness matrix is deduced, and the expression equations of the cascaded total stiffness matrix of the drive module are obtained. After the simulation study, the curve of the stiffness of a single drive unit with a magnetic field and the stiffness of multiple drive units connected in series and parallel are in the absence of the magnetic field. The change curve of the stiffness of the booster module with the number of drive units under the excitation and saturation magnetic field excitation conditions is to achieve the effect of dynamically controlling the structural stiffness of the drive unit by controlling the size of the magnetic field and to obtain a general formula through data fitting. The number of drive units required under a fixed magnetic field excitation can ensure that the error is within 5%.

  abstract     = {In the task of carrying heavy objects, it is easy to cause back injuries and other musculoskeletal diseases. Although wearable robots are designed to reduce this danger, most existing exoskeletons use high-stiffness mechanisms, which are beneficial to load-bearing conduction, but this restricts the natural movement of the human body, thereby causing ergonomic risks. This article proposes a back exoskeleton composed of multiple elastic spherical hinges inspired by the biological spine. This spine exoskeleton can assist in the process of bending the body and ensure flexibility. We deduced the kinematics model of this mechanism and established an analytical biomechanical model of human–robot interaction. The mechanism of joint assistance of the spine exoskeleton was discussed, and experiments were conducted to verify the flexibility of the spine exoskeleton and the effectiveness of the assistance during bending.},

  abstract     = {To improve the accuracy of terrain classification during mobile robot operation, an adaptive online terrain classification method based on vibration signals is proposed. First, the time domain and the combined features of the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains in the original vibration signal are extracted. These are adopted as the input of the random forest algorithm to generate classification models with different dimensions. Then, by judging the relationship between the current speed of the mobile robot and its critical speed, the classification model of different dimensions is adaptively selected for online classification. Offline and online experiments are conducted for four different terrains. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively avoid the self-vibration interference caused by an increase in the robot’s moving speed and achieve higher terrain classification accuracy.},

The optimized toolpaths were simulated and tested with an industrial robot showing minimal error compared to the desired optimized toolpaths. The results obtained from the presented implementation on three different trajectories demonstrate that the proposed methodology can reduce the manual error induced using as a reference the CAD-workpiece surface.},

  abstract     = {Robots need the ability to tackle problems of movement generalization in variable task state and complex environment. Dynamical movement primitives can effectively endow robots with humanoid characteristics. However, when the initial state of tasks changes, the generalized trajectories by dynamical movement primitives cannot retain shape features of demonstration, resulting in the loss of imitation quality. In this article, a modified dynamical movement primitives based on Euclidean transformation is proposed to solve this problem. It transforms the initial task state to a virtual situation similar to the demonstration and then utilizes the dynamical movement primitive method to realize movement generalization. Finally, it reverses the movement back to the real situation. Besides, the information of obstacles is added to Euclidean transformation based dynamical movement primitives framework to endow robots with the ability of obstacle avoidance. The normalized root-mean-square error is proposed as the criterion to evaluate the imitation similarity. The feasibility of this method is verified through writing letters, wiping whiteboard in two-dimensional task, and stirring mixture in three-dimensional task. The results show that the similarity of movement imitation in the proposed method is higher than dynamical movement primitives when the initial state changes. Meanwhile, Euclidean transformation based dynamical movement primitives can still greatly retain shape feature of demonstration while avoiding obstacles in an unstructured environment.},

This quasi-systematic review identifies and synthesizes the evidence on social robots that have recently been deployed in museum settings. It specifically focuses on their intended purpose, their acceptability and factors important for successful human–robot interaction in this setting. Four databases (PsycINFO, SCOPUS, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore) were systematically searched to retrieve literature published within the last 10 years on human–robot interaction studies with social robots deployed in museum settings. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the studies, qualitative and quantitative findings were summarized. A total of 604 items were identified, of which 12 were included in the review. Robots in 11 studies were physical and 1 was an embodied conversational agent presented as a virtual robot. In 75% of the studies ( n = 9), the purpose of the robots was to act as museum guides, while in 17% ( n = 2) they entertained visitors and in 8% ( n = 1) the robot taught visitors in a museum outreach programme. Overall, many of the robots were found to be acceptable for use within museum settings. Three main themes for successful social human–robot interaction were evident across the findings: (1) facial expressions, (2) movement and (3) communication and speech. There is a great opportunity for social robots to be deployed within museum settings, as guides, educators, entertainers or a combination thereof. State-of-the-art methods have led to the development of museum robots that are more capable of social interaction; however, more work is required to develop speech capabilities that work in the ‘wild’. Future work should combine the factors that have been identified within this review to improve human–robot interaction.},

To solve the above problems, a fine reconstruction of underwater images with the target feature missing from the environment feature was proposed. Firstly, the salient features of underwater images are obtained in terms of positive and negative sample learning. Secondly, a layered environmental attention mechanism is proposed to retrieve the relevant local and global features in the context. Finally, a coarse-to-fine image reconstruction model, with gradient penalty constraints, is constructed to obtain the fine restoration results. Contrast experiment between the proposed algorithm and the existing image reconstruction methods has been done in stereo quantitative underwater image data set, real-world underwater image enhancement data set, and underwater image data set, clearly proving that the proposed one is more effective and superior.},

The hydraulic system with load-sensing system and its controlling model were established and then the load-sensing system was modeled and simulated in Advanced Modeling Environment for SIMulation. The optimal proportional–integral–derivative parameters were determined by the optimized algorithm. The simulation results illustrated that the inlet and outlet pressure difference of throttle and the flow rate through throttle are 42 bar and 29.65 L/min, respectively, all the time when the load pressure varies from 0 bar to 100 bar. The load-sensing system has good power follow-up and high control accuracy. And then the experimental bench of auto-adaptive leveling hydraulic suspension was researched and developed to verify the leveling performance. The experimental results demonstrate that auto-adaptive leveling hydraulic suspension can keep frame leveling dynamically on upslope, downslope, side slope, and continuous undulating road surface. The maximum errors of the pitch angle and the tilt angle are −0.93° and 0.97°. The feasibility of the designed hydraulic suspension was verified.

To improve the weight-to-payload ratio of surgery robot end-effector, the energy consumption and stability of robot joint drive and reducing the displacement and deformation of needle insertion in soft tissue. This article discusses the new static torque balancing method and multi-needle insertion soft tissue stabilization mechanisms that may be used in previously articulated seed implantation robots. Compared with the existing balancing system schemes, we adopt the idea of mutual conversion of gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy and establish a static balancing model. With preloaded displacement parameter of the spring α , the variable gravity torque balance of robot arm can be achieved. Torque and equivalent gravity balancing distribution with the spring balance system and the quantitative evaluation experiment were performed, and experiment results provide evidence that these spring balance devices can basically compensate the gravity torque of the robot arm. In addition, we used nonlinear spring–damper model to establish multi-needles insertion soft tissue force model. Then, a variable multi-needle insertion soft tissue stabilization device is designed with six working modes. The innovative design of this device is the use of the first four needles that are introduced simultaneously on either side of the midline. Initially completed displacement simulation of different numbers of needle insertion prostate tissue, experiment results indicate that multi-needle puncture mechanism could reduce prostate displacement in the y - or z -direction. By this method, the prostate may be fixed, thus this mechanism maybe reduces rotation of the prostate and enabling subsequent needles to be inserted accurately.},

In this article, we present a novel path planning algorithm for an autonomous land vehicle. According to the characteristics of autonomous movement towards the autonomous land vehicle, an improved A-Star path planning algorithm is designed. The disadvantages of using the A-Star algorithm for path planning are that the path planned by the A-Star algorithm contains many unnecessary turning points and is not smooth enough. Autonomous land vehicle needs to adjust its posture at each turning point, which will greatly waste time and also will not be conducive to the motion control of autonomous land vehicle. In view of these shortcomings, this article proposes a new heuristic function combined with the artificial potential field method, which contains both distance information and obstacle information. Our proposed algorithm shows excellent performance in improving the execution efficiency and reducing the number of turning points. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm, compared with the traditional A-Star algorithm, makes the path smoother and makes the autonomous land vehicle easier to control.},

A three-dimensional loading robot based on a pneumatic three-universal–prismatic–universal parallel mechanism is designed to apply time-varying three-dimensional loads on a target. Based on the principle of vector superposition, inverse and forward kinematics are deduced. A second-order mathematical model of a metal seal pneumatic cylinder driven by a flow proportional valve is established. Based on the immersion and invariance technique, the leakage flow in the cylinder is taken as the interference term and estimated. Meanwhile, because of the strong nonlinearity of the actuator, based on suitable disturbance estimation, the control rate of the system is designed through the sliding mode surface, and the stability of the control algorithm is analyzed on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory. The experimental results show that the immersion and invariance controller exhibits a better control performance than the proportional–integral–differential controller: the steady-state control mean square error is reduced by approximately 21% on average and the dynamic (0.2 Hz) tracking mean square error is approximately 10.35 N.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to design a nervous system model to drive the realistic muscle-driven legs for the locomotion of a quadruped robot. We evaluate our proposed nervous system model with a hind leg simulated model and robot. We apply a two-level central pattern generator for each leg, which generates locomotion rhythms and reproduces cat-like leg trajectories by driving different sets of the muscles at any timing during one cycle of moving the leg. The central pattern generator receives sensory feedback from leg loading. A cat simulated model and a robot with two hind legs, each with three joints driven by six muscle models, are controlled by our nervous system model. Even though their hind legs are forced backward at a wide range of speeds, they can adapt to the speed variation by autonomously adjusting its stride and cyclic duration without changing any parameters or receiving any descending inputs. In addition to the autonomous speed adaptation, the cat hind leg robot switched from a trot-like gait to a gallop-like gait while speeding up. These features can be observed in existing animal locomotion tests. These results demonstrate that our nervous system is useful as a valid and practical legged locomotion controller.},

Unfortunately, the only global reward shared by all agents in the cooperative tasks may lead to the lazy agent problem. To cope with such a problem, we propose a generating individual intrinsic reward algorithm, which introduces an intrinsic reward encoder to generate an individual intrinsic reward for each agent and utilizes the hypernetworks as the decoder to help to estimate the individual action values of the decomposition methods based on the generated individual intrinsic reward. Experimental results in the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark prove that the proposed algorithm can increase learning efficiency and improve policy performance.},

The possibility that the workers develop work-related musculoskeletal disorders, while performing high intensity and repetitive installation and commissioning work over a long period of time, is very high. A mechanical design of a passive upper extremities exoskeleton suit to reduce the muscles effort of upper limbs is proposed in this article. Thereby, a decrease in the work-related musculoskeletal disorders risk is expected. To evaluate the ergonomic contribution of the passive upper extremities exoskeleton suit, both static and dynamic tool lift experiments were designed, in which 10 volunteers were asked to participate in the experiments. The surface electromyography is captured from these volunteers to measure the magnitude of muscle output forces that are applied with and then without passive upper extremities exoskeleton suit assistance during the process of manual handling, and the tests are collected for comparison. Results show that there is a significant decrease in the output force and fatigue in deltoid, biceps brachii, and brachioradiali, especially in biceps brachial which is up to 67.8%. The implementation of passive upper extremities exoskeleton suit is not only a benefit to reduce workers’ upper extremities fatigue but also ultimately increase the work efficiency by minimizing work-related musculoskeletal disorders and safety accidents.},

In this article, we propose a high-precision and robust localization system based on laser and artificial landmarks. The proposed localization system is mainly composed of three modules, namely scoring mechanism-based global localization module, laser and artificial landmark-based localization module, and relocalization trigger module. Global localization module processes the global map to obtain the map pyramid, thus improve the global localization speed and accuracy when robots are powered on or kidnapped. Laser and artificial landmark-based localization module is employed to achieve robust localization in highly dynamic scenes and high-precision localization in target areas. The relocalization trigger module is used to monitor the current localization quality in real time by matching the current laser scan with the global map and feeds it back to the global localization module to improve the robustness of the system. Experimental results show that our method can achieve robust robot localization and real-time detection of the current localization quality in indoor scenes and industrial environment. In the target area, the position error is less than 0.004 m and the angle error is less than 0.01 rad.},

It combines the feature extraction structure of MobileNet and the encoding path of pyramid scene parsing network. The depthwise separable convolution, the spatial pyramid pooling, and the feature fusion are employed to reduce the onboard computing time of pyramid scene parsing mobile network. A unique data set called Hangzhou Dianzi University Terrain Dataset is constructed for terrain segmentation, which contains more than 4000 images from 10 different scenes. The data set was collected from a robot’s perspective to make it more suitable for robotic applications.

In this article, to design manipulators with flexible links for pick-and-place operations, an integrated structure and control design framework is proposed. The dynamic model of a coaxis planar parallel manipulator is obtained by the finite element method, an effective method.

Thus humans are able to continually learn and increase their experience. It is also obvious importance for autonomous mobile robot. The simultaneous localization and mapping system plays an important role in localization and navigation of robot. The loop-closure detection method is an indispensable part of the relocation and map construction, which is critical to correct mappoint errors of simultaneous localization and mapping. Existing visual loop-closure detection methods based on deep learning are not capable of continual learning in terms of cross-scene environment, which bring a great limitation to the application scope. In this article, we propose a novel end-to-end loop-closure detection method based on continual learning, which can effectively suppress the decline of the memory capability of simultaneous localization and mapping system by introducing firstly the orthogonal projection operator into the loop-closure detection to overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem of mobile robot in large-scale and multi-scene environments. Based on the three scenes from public data sets, the experimental results show that the proposed method has a strong capability of continual learning in the cross-scene environment where existing state-of-the-art methods fail.},

However, two points have been neglected: firstly, few of them focus on fusing the image level and semantic level features in neural networks, which usually resulting in tracking failure when differentiating the target from other distractors of the same class. Secondly, the robustness of the previous redetection scheme is limited by simply expanding the search region. To address these two issues, we propose a novel multilevel feature-weighted Siamese region proposal network tracker, which employs a feature fusion module to construct discriminative feature embedding and a similarity-based attention module to suppress the distractors in the search region. Furthermore, a color-based constraint module is presented to further suppress the distractors with the same class to the target. Finally, a well-designed global redetection scheme is built to handle long-term tracking tasks. The proposed tracker achieves state-of-art performance on a series of popular benchmarks, including object tracking benchmark 2013 (0.699 in success score), object tracking benchmark 2015 (0.700 in success score), visual object tracking 2017 (0.470 in expected average overlap score), and visual object tracking (0.485 in expected average overlap score).},

In this article, we solve the problem of image restoration by combining the optical flow information between frames in the video with the spatial information from multiple perspectives. To solve the problems of noise in the single-frame images of video frames, we propose a complete two-stage video repair method. We combine the spatial information of images from different perspectives and the optical flow information of the video sequence to assist and constrain the repair of damaged images in the video. This method combines the interframe information of the front and rear image frames with the multiview image information in the video and performs video repair based on optical flow and a conditional generation adversarial network. This method regards video inpainting as a pixel propagation problem, uses the interframe information in the video for video inpainting, and introduces multiview information to assist the repair based on a conditional generative adversarial network.

As a basic part of the feature-based SLAM system, the feature tracking method using event cameras is still an open question. In this article, we present a novel asynchronous event feature generation and tracking algorithm operating directly on event-streams to fully utilize the natural asynchronism of event cameras. The proposed algorithm consists of an event-corner detection unit, a descriptor construction unit, and an event feature tracking unit. The event-corner detection unit addresses a fast and asynchronous corner detector to extract event-corners from event-streams. For the descriptor construction unit, we propose a novel asynchronous gradient descriptor inspired by the scale-invariant feature transform descriptor, which helps to achieve quantitative measurement of similarity between event feature pairs. The construction of the gradient descriptor can be decomposed into three stages: speed-invariant time surface maintenance and extraction, principal orientation calculation, and descriptor generation. The event feature tracking unit combines the constructed gradient descriptor and an event feature matching method to achieve asynchronous feature tracking. We implement the proposed algorithm in C++ and evaluate it on a public event dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves improvement in terms of tracking accuracy and real-time performance when compared with the state-of-the-art asynchronous event-corner tracker and with no compromise on the feature tracking lifetime.},

  abstract     = {The tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (TRUAV) has vertical take-off and landing and high-speed flight capabilities through conversion and reconversion modes, thereby presenting wide application prospects. This article presents a compact tilt tri-rotor UAV. For flying in the conversion mode, the TRUAV needs to realize the transition of two control logic and two kinds of actuators in both of the rotor and fixed-wing modes, achieving the control of the multi-input multioutput, input nonaffine, and nonlinear multichannel cross-coupling UAV system. Furthermore, the lateral dynamics of a tilt tri-rotor UAV is more unstable for unpaired rotors. These system characteristics present a great challenge to conversion control. To solve these problems, the nonlinear dynamic model of the vehicle in the conversion mode is provided. Furthermore, a cascade control system consisting of position control, velocity control, angle control, angular velocity control, and control mixer is proposed. The simulation result of the control system shows steady flight and a fast transition in the conversion mode with modeling uncertainty in case of no wind.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the coordination control problem of group tracking consensus is considered for networked nonholonomic mobile multirobot systems (NNMMRSs). This problem framework generalizes the findings of complete consensus in NNMMRSs and group consensus in networked Lagrangian systems (NLSs), enjoying capacious application backgrounds. By leveraging a kinematic controller embedded in the adaptive torque control protocols, a new convergence criterion of group consensus is established. In contrast to the formulation under strict algebraic assumptions, it is found that group tracking consensus for NNMMRSs can be realized under a simple geometrical condition. The system stability analysis is dictated by the property of network topology with acyclic partition. Finally, the theoretical achievements are verified by illustrative numerical examples. The results show an interesting phenomenon that, for NNMMRSs, the state responses exhibit negative correlation with the algebraic connectivity and coupling strength.},

This article then investigates the possibility of introducing solution-dependent modifications to both approaches that could increase the reliability of basic walking pattern generation models in terms of smooth single support–double support phase transitioning and power consumption optimization. The algorithms were coded into offline walking pattern generators for NAO humanoid robot as a valid example and the two approaches were compared against each other in terms of stability, power consumption, and computational effort as well as against their basic unmodified counterparts.},

Sliding mode control is a special method widely used to handle nonlinear robot control. However, the existing control law for sliding mode control has limitations in the chattering and convergence rate. The sliding mode manifold and reaching law are firstly discussed in this article. In the meanwhile, a proposed control law for sliding mode control combining linear sliding mode manifold and double-power reaching law is developed, which is based on the robot dynamic equation derived by the Udwadia–Kalaba theory. Furthermore, a compared control law for sliding mode control combining linear sliding mode manifold with exponential reaching law is presented to test the proposed control law for sliding mode control. The comparison indicates that the proposed law effectively improves the performance in convergence rate and the chattering of constraint tracking control. Finally, the two control laws for sliding mode control are applied to the Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm robot system with modeling error and uncertain external disturbance to demonstrate the merit and validation of the proposed scheme.},

The proposed approach extracts spatial–temporal three-dimensional convolutional neural network features from video stream and view-invariant features from skeleton stream, respectively. Furthermore, these two streams are encoded into three-dimensional feature spaces, which are represented as red, green, and blue images for subsequent network input. We proposed the two-stream You Only Look Once-based networks which are capable of fusing video and skeleton information by using the processing pipeline to provide two fusion strategies, boxes-fusion or layers-fusion. We test the temporal action detection performance of two-stream You Only Look Once network based on our data set High-Speed Interplanetary Tug/Cocoon Vehicles-v1, which contains seven activities in the home environment and achieve a particularly high mean average precision. We also test our model on the public data set PKU-MMD that contains 51 activities, and our method also has a good performance on this data set.

To improve the load capacity of the robot, the lifting and horizontal movement are, respectively, supported by an independent lifting mechanism and a lateral movement mechanism. Unlike the previous passive and active suction, the powerful suction power of the robot is provided by the four-ducted fan. Meanwhile, the obstacle-climbing force is caused by the forward of the four-ducted fan that improves the crossing obstacle ability. In addition, an incremental sliding mode algorithm is applied for controlling the posture when the robot crosses obstacles, which can ensure the stable performance of the cleaning robot under disturbance. Some simulations and experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the designed facade cleaning robot.},

Path planning is one of the core areas which needs to be improvised at a higher level. Optimization is playing a more prominent role these days. The nature-inspired algorithm is contributing to a greater extent in achieving optimization. This article presents the modified cuckoo search algorithm using tournament selection function for robot path planning. Path length and Path time are the algorithm’s parameters to validate the effectiveness and acceptability of the output. The cuckoo search algorithm’s fundamental working principle is taken as the baseline, and the tournament selection function is adapted to calculate the optimum path for robots while navigating from its initial position to final position. The tournament selection function is replacing the concept of random selection done by the cuckoo search algorithm. The use of tournament selection overcomes local minima for robots while traversing in the configuration space and increases the probability of giving more optimum results. The conventional cuckoo search algorithm whose random selection mechanism may lead to premature convergence may fall into the local minima. The use of tournament selection function increases the probability of giving better results as it allows all the possible solution to take part in the tournament. The results are analysed and compared with other relevant work like cuckoo search algorithm and particle swarm optimization technique and presented in the article. The proposed method produced a better output in terms of path length and path time.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the rehabilitation robot has been developed for rehabilitation therapy. However, there are few studies on upper arm exoskeletons for rehabilitation training of muscle strength. This article aims to design a surface electromyography-controlled lightweight exoskeleton rehabilitation robot for home-based progressive resistance training. The exoskeleton’s lightweight structure is designed based on the kinematic model of the elbow joint and ergonomics sizes of the arm. At the same time, the overall weight of the exoskeleton is controlled at only 3.03 kg. According to the rehabilitation training task, we use torque limit mode to ensure stable torque output at variable velocity. We also propose a surface electromyography-based control method, which uses k- Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify surface electromyographic signals under progressive training loads, and utilizes principal component analysis to improve the recognition accuracy to control the exoskeleton to provide muscle strength compensation. The assessment experiment of the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot shows that the dynamic recognition accuracy of this control method is 80.21%. Muscle activity of biceps brachii and triceps brachii under each training load decreases significantly when subjects with the exoskeleton robot. The results indicate that the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot can output the corresponding torque to assist in progressive resistance training. This study provides a solution to potential problems in the family-oriented application of exoskeleton rehabilitation robots.},

The proposed solution finds each vehicle’s path by solving an optimization problem over a planning horizon while obeying specific rules. The basic structure in our solution is the centralized task assignment problem, and it produces near-optimal solutions. The solution can handle moving, pop-up targets, and UAV loss. It is a complicated optimization problem, and its solution is to be produced in a very short time. To simplify the optimization problem and obtain the solution in nearly real time, we have developed some rules. Among these rules, there is one that involves the kinematic constraints in the construction of paths. There is another which tackles the real-time decision-making problem using heuristics imitating human-like intelligence. Simulations are realized in MATLAB environment.

The dynamic simulator identified the final position of each ellipsoidal body segment taking its rotational motion into consideration in addition to its bulk motion at each sampling point to describe its specific motion naturally. The total motion induced a micro-Doppler effect and created a micro-Doppler signature that varied in response to changes in the input parameters, such as varying body segment size, velocity, and radar location. Micro-Doppler signature identification of the radar signals returned from the target objects that were animated by the simulator required kinematic modeling based on a short-time Fourier transform analysis of the signals.

An extended state observer (ESO)-based integral line-of-sight (ILOS) with an integral sliding mode adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed as the main control framework. First, a novel ESO is employed to estimate the surge and sway velocities based on the kinetic model, which are difficult to measure directly. Then, the adaptive ILOS guidance law is proposed, in which the integral vector is incorporated into the adaptive method to estimate the current velocities. Meanwhile, an improved fuzzy algorithm is introduced to optimize the look-ahead distance. Second, the controller is extended to deal with the USV yaw and surge velocity signal tracking using the integral sliding mode technique. The uncertainties of the USV are approximated via the adaptive fuzzy method, and an auxiliary dynamic system is presented to solve the problem of actuator saturation. Then, it is proved that all of the error signals in the closed-loop control system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a comparative simulation substantiates the availability and superiority of the proposed method for ESO-based ILOS path following of USV.},

  abstract     = {To move out of the lab, service robots must reveal a proven robustness so they can be deployed in operational environments. This means that they should function steadily for long periods of time in real-world areas under uncertainty, without any human intervention, and exhibiting a mature technology readiness level. In this work, we describe an incremental methodology for the implementation of an innovative service robot, entirely developed from the outset, to monitor large indoor areas shared by humans and other obstacles. Focusing especially on the reliability of the fundamental localization system of the robot in the long term, we discuss all the incremental software and hardware features, design choices, and adjustments conducted, and show their impact on the performance of the robot in the real world, in three distinct 24-h long trials, with the ultimate goal of validating the proposed mobile robot solution for indoor monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS) face significant challenges in trajectory tracking and motion planning because of external disturbance (current and payload) and kinematic redundancy. Former algorithms can finish the tracking of end-effector (EE) and free of singularity redundancy solution alone. However, only a few analytical studies have been conducted on coordinated motion planning of UVMS considering the dynamics controller. This article introduces a combined dynamics and kinematics networked fuzzy task priority motion planning method to solve the above problems. It avoids the assumption of perfect dynamic control. Firstly, to eliminate the kinematics error, a dynamic transformation method from joint space to task space is proposed. Without chattering, an outer loop sliding mode controller is designed for tracking EE’s trajectory. Further, to ensure the underwater vehicle’ posture stability and joint constraint, a task priority frame with kinematics error is used to planning the coordinated motion of UVMS, in which the posture and joint limits map into the null space of prioritized tasks, and weight gains are adopted to guarantee orthogonality of secondary tasks. On top of that, the gain weighted are updated by the networked fuzzy logic. The proposed algorithm achieves better coordinated motion planning and tracking performance. Effectiveness is validated by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Various robotic rehabilitation devices have been developed for acute stroke patients to ease therapist’s efforts and provide high-intensity training, which resulted in improved strength and functional recovery of patients; however, these improvements did not always transfer to the performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). This is because previous robotic training focuses on the proximal joints or training with exoskeleton-type devices, which do not reflect how humans interact with the environment. To improve the training effect of ADLs, a new robotic training paradigm is suggested with a parallel manipulator that mimics rotational ADL tasks. This study presents training of the proximal and distal joints simultaneously while performing manipulation tasks in a device named spherical parallel instrument for daily living emulation (SPINDLE). Six representative ADLs were chosen to show that both proximal and distal joints are trained when performing tasks with SPINDLE, as compared to the natural ADLs. These results show that SPINDLE can train individuals with movements similar to the ADLs while interacting with the manipulator. We envision using this compact tabletop device as a home-training device to increase the performance of ADLs by restoring the impaired motor function of stroke patients, leading to improved quality of life.},

The robot will inevitably use both arms to grasp payloads and transfer them. The force control of the arms in closed chains is an important problem. In this article, the coordinated kinematic and dynamic equations of the dual-arm astronaut are established by considering the closed-chain constraint relationship. Two compliance control methods for dual-arm astronaut coordinated payload manipulating are proposed. The first method is called master–slave force control and the second is the shared force control. For the former, the desired path and operational force of the master arm should be given in advance and that of slave arm are calculated from the dual-arm robot closed-chain constraint equation. In the share control mode, the desired path and end operational force of dual arms are decomposed from the dual-arm robot closed-chain constraint equation directly and equally. Finally, the two control algorithms are verified by simulation. The results of analysis of variance of the simulation data show that the two control methods have no obvious difference in the accuracy of force control but the second control method has a higher position control accuracy, and this proves that the master–slave mode is better for tasks with explicit force distribution requirements and the shared force control is especially suitable for a high-precision requirement.},

The polishing force on the object surfaces is required to be constant to obtain better results. Thus, the proposed robotic polishing system was designed with a stepper motor, ball screw, and force sensor. The proposed system acquired a rough robot polishing/fettling trajectory and adopted a fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative controller to regulate the trajectory to maintain the desired contact force response from a ceramic object. We developed the temporary desired value technique to make the polishing force response close to the desired one. We validated the system on a six-degrees-of-freedom Staubli TX 40L robotic arm. Experiments were performed to test the effectiveness of the system. The robot trajectory responses showed that the proposed system performed well in tracking the desired force in the polishing/fettling process. We used a 3D microscope to verify that the molding defect of the ceramic pot was significantly removed to evaluate the polishing/fettling quality.},

Then, an error-related weight coefficient of the objective function is proposed to balance the weight of the position error and orientation error in the objective function. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the benchmark function, the 6-DOF and 7-DOF serial manipulator model. Experimental results show that the improvement of the algorithm and improved objective function can significantly improve the accuracy of the IK.

  abstract     = {Due to generally limited computing capability of an individual robot, cloud-based robotic systems are increasingly used. However, applications in large-scale multi-robot systems will be hindered by communication congestion and consequent lack of computing resources. In this study, an intern-sufficient cloud is investigated to alleviate the burden of communication and thus support more robots. At the same time, it enables heterogeneously idle computing resources of robots inside the system to be shared on demand, instead of relying on cloud servers and communication infrastructures, to make the scope of application wider. To this end, a hierarchical communication mechanism and a resource schedule algorithm are proposed. In the mechanism, the transmission power, signal-to-noise ratio, available bandwidth, and other relevant features are taken into account to estimate link quality for data transmission. Then, the constrained communication conditions and heterogeneous computing resources are balanced by the resource scheduling algorithm, so that the most appropriate computing resources of the robots are contributed to the mobile cloud. Furthermore, a multitarget navigation task is applied on the cloud to validate the work. Thereby, simulations and experiments are performed. The results show that the proposed intern-sufficient cloud can provide stable resources of communication and computation for a multi-robot system with 20 physical robots while achieving more effective multitarget navigation.},

The static assumption is valid only in a small region, and it limits the application of visual SLAM in dynamic environments. The recently proposed state-of-the-art SLAM solutions for dynamic environments use different semantic segmentation methods such as mask R-CNN and SegNet; however, these frameworks are based on a sparse mapping framework (ORBSLAM). In addition, segmentation process increases the computational power, which makes these SLAM algorithms unsuitable for real-time mapping. Therefore, there is no effective dense RGB-D SLAM method for real-world unstructured and dynamic environments. In this study, we propose a novel real-time dense SLAM method for dynamic environments, where 3D reconstruction error is manipulated for identification of static and dynamic classes having generalized Gaussian distribution. Our proposed approach requires neither explicit object tracking nor object classifier, which makes it robust to any type of moving object and suitable for real-time mapping. Our method eliminates the repeated views and uses consistent data that enhance the performance of volumetric fusion. For completeness, we compare our proposed method using different types of high dynamic dataset, which are publicly available, to demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach. Experiments show that its tracking performance is better than other dense and dynamic SLAM approaches.},

We propose two dynamically feasible B-spline based rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) approaches, which are named DB-RRT and FMDB-RRT, to achieve path planning and trajectory planning simultaneously for omnidirectional mobile robots. DB-RRT combines the convex hull property of the B-spline and RRT’s rapid expansion capability to generate a safe and dynamically feasible trajectory. Firstly, we analyze the tree’s sustainable growth ability and put forward the dynamically feasible region. A geometric method is proposed to judge whether finding a dynamically feasible trajectory quickly. Secondly, we design two steer functions to guide the tree’s growth, improve efficiency, and decrease the number of iterations. To further increase the clearance and reduce the randomness of the trajectory, we propose FMDB-RRT, which uses the path of fast marching to guide the rapid growth of DB-RRT. Then, assuming that the number of sampled points is sufficient to represent the dynamically feasible region, the DB-RRT is proved to be probabilistically complete. Finally, by conducting experimental comparisons with other algorithms in different environments and deploying the proposed algorithm to an omnidirectional mobile robot, the effectiveness and good performance of the algorithm have been verified.},

Although many approaches on visual servoing have been proposed, surprisingly, only a few of them have taken into account system dynamics in the control design of a visual servoing system. In addition, the depth information of feature points is essential in the image-based visual servoing architecture. As a result, to cope with the aforementioned problems, this article proposes a Kalman filter-based depth and velocity estimator and a modified image-based dynamic visual servoing architecture that takes into consideration the system dynamics in its control design. In particular, the Kalman filter is exploited to deal with the problems caused by vision latency and image noise so as to facilitate the estimation of the joint velocity of the robot using image information only. Moreover, in the modified image-based dynamic visual servoing architecture, the computed torque control scheme is used to compensate for system dynamics and the Kalman filter is used to provide accurate depth information of the feature points. Results of visual servoing experiments conducted on a two-degree of freedom planar robot verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {For spatial multibody systems, the dynamic equations of multibody systems with compound clearance joints have a high level of nonlinearity. The coupling between different types of clearance joints may lead to abundant dynamic behavior. At present, the dynamic response analysis of the spatial parallel mechanism considering the three-dimensional (3D) compound clearance joint has not been reported. This work proposes a modeling method to investigate the influence of the 3D compound clearance joint on the dynamics characteristics of the spatial parallel mechanism. For this purpose, 3D kinematic models of spherical clearance joint and revolute joint with radial and axial clearances are derived. Contact force is described as normal contact and tangential friction and later introduced into the nonlinear dynamics model, which is established by the Lagrange multiplier technique and Jacobian of constraint matrix. The influences of compound clearance joint and initial misalignment of bearing axes on the system are analyzed. Furthermore, validation of dynamics model is evaluated by ADAMS and Newton–Euler method. This work provides an essential theoretical basis for studying the influences of 3D clearance joints on dynamic responses and nonlinear behavior of parallel mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the aim was to grasp and lift an unknown object without causing any permanent change on its shape using a robotic hand. When people lift objects, they add extra force for safety above the minimum limit value of the grasp force. This extra force is expressed as the “safety margin” in the literature. In the conducted study, the safety margin is minimized and the grasp force was controlled. For this purpose, the safety margin performance of human beings for object grasping was measured by the developed system. The obtained data were assessed for a fuzzy logic controller (FLC), and the fuzzy safety margin derivation system (SMDS) was designed. In the literature, the safety margin rate was reported to vary between 10% and 40%. To be the basis for this study, in the experimental study conducted to measure the grip performance of humans, safety margin ratios ranging from 9% to 20% for different surface friction properties and different weights were obtained. As a result of performance tests performed in Matlab/Simulink environment of FLC presented in this study, safety margin ratios ranging from 8% to 21% for different surface friction properties and weights were obtained. It was observed that the results of the performance tests of the developed system were very close to the data of human performance. The results obtained demonstrate that the designed fuzzy SMDS can be used safely in the control of the grasp force for the precise grasping task of a robot hand.},

LVD-NMPC uses an a-priori process model and a learned vision dynamics model used to calculate the dynamics of the driving scene, the controlled system’s desired state trajectory, and the weighting gains of the quadratic cost function optimized by a constrained predictive controller. The vision system is defined as a deep neural network designed to estimate the dynamics of the image scene. The input is based on historic sequences of sensory observations and vehicle states, integrated by an augmented memory component. Deep Q-learning is used to train the deep network, which once trained can also be used to calculate the desired trajectory of the vehicle. We evaluate LVD-NMPC against a baseline dynamic window approach (DWA) path planning executed using standard NMPC and against the PilotNet neural network. Performance is measured in our simulation environment GridSim, on a real-world 1:8 scaled model car as well as on a real size autonomous test vehicle and the nuScenes computer vision dataset.},

To guarantee the sustainability of drug dispensation, it is required that FMDS replenish drugs rapidly. The traditional order picking model (OPM) is difficult to meet the demand of prompt replenishment. To solve the problems of prolonged refilling route and inefficiency of drugs replenishment, a mixed refilling model based on multiple steps traveling salesman problem model (MTSPM) and vehicle routing problem model (VRPM) is proposed, and it is deployed in two circumstances of FMDS, including temporary replenishment mode (TRM) and concentrate replenishment mode (CRM). It not only meted the demand under different circumstances of drug replenishment but also shortened the refilling route significantly. First, the new pick sets were generated. Then, the orders of pick sets were optimized and the new paths were achieved. When the number of pickings is varied no more than 20, experiment results declared that the refilling route is the shortest by utilizing MTSPM when working under the TRM condition. Comparing MTSPM with OPM, the rate of refilling route length decreased up to 32.18%. Under the CRM condition, the refilling route is the shortest by utilizing VRPM. Comparing VRPM with OPM, the rate of refilling route length decreased up to 58.32%. Comparing VRPM with MTSPM, the rate of refilling route length has dropped more than 43.26%.},

  abstract     = {The main purpose of this article is to study the detection of transparent film on the surface of tobacco packs. Tobacco production line needs an industrial robot to remove the transparent film in the process of unpacking. Therefore, after the industrial robot removes the transparent film, it is necessary to use machine vision technology to determine whether there is transparent film residue on the surface of tobacco packaging. In this article, based on the study of the optical features of semitransparent objects, an algorithm for detecting the residue of transparent film in tobacco packs based on surface features is proposed. According to the difference of surface features between tobacco and film, a probability distribution model considering highlights, saturation, and texture density is designed. Because the probability distribution model integrates many features of tobacco and film, it is more reasonable to distinguish the tobacco film regions. In this article, an appropriate foreground box with a trapezoidal mask and image segmentation algorithm GrabCut is used to segment the foreground area of tobacco pack more accurately, and the possible film area is obtained by image differential and morphological processing. Finally, on the basis of comparing the effect of various machine learning algorithms on the image classification of possible film regions, support vector machine based on color features is used to judge the possible film region. Application results of the system show that the method proposed in this article can effectively detect whether there is film residue on the surface of tobacco pack.},

This article proposes a three-neighbor search A* algorithm combined with artificial potential fields to optimize the path planning problem of mobile robots. The algorithm integrates and improves the partial artificial potential field and the A* algorithm to address irregular obstacles in the forward direction. The artificial potential field guides the mobile robot to move forward quickly. The A* algorithm of the three-neighbor search method performs accurate obstacle avoidance. The current pose vector of the mobile robot is constructed during obstacle avoidance, the search range is narrowed to less than three neighbors, and repeated searches are avoided. In the matrix laboratory environment, grid maps with different obstacle ratios are compared with the A* algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed improved algorithm avoids concave obstacle traps and shortens the path length, thus reducing the search time and the number of search nodes. The average path length is shortened by 5.58%, the path search time is shortened by 77.05%, and the number of path nodes is reduced by 88.85%. The experimental results fully show that the improved A* algorithm is effective and feasible and can provide optimal results.},

An unmanned aerial–aquatic rotorcraft (UAAR) is introduced to complete the task of navigating between air and underwater, and the trajectory optimization problem for this task is focused on in this study. The dynamics of a four-axle rotorcraft with eight rotors operating in air and underwater is described. On this basis, the trajectory optimization model is established, wherein the constraints on control variables and states in different media are included. The optimization index is denoted as the weighted sum of the terminal states. In view of the weakness of the teaching- and learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm, the formula for updating the individual grade in the teaching process is modified. Thus, this ensures that the algorithm avoids converging at the local optimum and improves the solution quality. Finally, an improved TLBO (ITLBO)-based trajectory optimization method for UAAR navigating between air and water is developed. The control variables are discretized with respect to height at a set of Chebyshev collocation points to reduce the terminal error of states, and the values of control variables at other heights are obtained via interpolation. In the simulation studies, the ITLBO-based method exhibits better performance in terms of optimizing the index when compared to the other two algorithms. Furthermore, the effects of the distribution and number of collocation points on the results are analyzed.},

It can also be reconfigured in different working conditions, such as crossing an inaccessible gap, and thus has the potential to be used in flaw detection, surface cleaning, and exploration of ferromagnetic structures.},

The proposed manipulator allows to realize five independent movements—three translations and two rotations motion pattern (3T2R). Analytical relationships between the coordinates of the end-effector and five controlled movements provided by manipulator’s drives (generalized coordinates) were determined. The approach of reachable workspace calculation was defined with respect to available design constraints of the manipulator based on the obtained algorithms of the inverse and forward kinematics. Case studies are considered based on the obtained algorithms of inverse and forward kinematics. For the inverse kinematic problem, the solution is obtained in accordance with the given laws of position and orientation change of the end-effector, corresponding to the motion along a spiral-helical trajectory. For the forward kinematic problem, various assemblies of the manipulator are obtained at the same given values of the generalized coordinates. An example of reachable workspace designing finalizes the proposed study. Dimensions and extreme values of the end-effector orientation angles are calculated.},

Firstly, the singularities are separated into forearm and wrist singularities to obtain the singular factors of the manipulator respectively. Secondly, a new mathematical function of the approximate damped reciprocal of the singular factor is proposed. Thirdly, the singularities are avoided by modifying the Jacobian matrixes of the manipulator with the approximate damped reciprocal algorithm.

All components were effectively connected and preliminarily evaluated especially regarding the response time and target spray accuracy. A simulation system was built considering the real crop geometric shape and nozzle spray pattern using the Monte Carlo method. The spray simulator was used to optimize the spray height objective function of spray deposition rate and coefficient of variance for the spray deposition. The spray process can be easily visualized and compared for different spray parameters. The indoor experiment setup was built to test and optimize the parameters of the overall system, which is flexible to verify the system. Afterward, the outdoor tractor-based equipment was designed to test the system for the field environment. The experimental result showed that 80% of the crop had a spray deviation from 0 mm to 28 mm and the proposed spraying system can reduce 46.8% usage of the chemical compared to the uniform spray method.},

We target object removal in large-scale indoor spaces and propose a novel pipeline of multiview inpainting to achieve color consistency and boundary consistency in multiple images. The first step of the pipeline is to create color prior information on masks by coloring point clouds from multiple images and projecting the colored point clouds onto the image planes. Next, a generative inpainting network accepts a masked image, a color prior image, imperfect guideline, and two different masks as inputs and yields the refined guideline and inpainted image as outputs. The color prior and guideline input ensure color and boundary consistencies across multiple images. We validate our pipeline on real indoor data sets quantitatively using consistency distance and similarity distance, metrics we defined for comparing results of multiview inpainting and qualitatively.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a systematic procedure is given for determining a robust motion control law for autonomous quadcopters, starting from an input–output linearizable model. In particular, the suggested technique can be considered as a robust feedback linearization (FL), where the nonlinear state-feedback terms, which contain the aerodynamic forces and moments and other unknown disturbances, are estimated online by means of extended state observers. Therefore, the control system is made robust against unmodelled dynamics and endogenous as well as exogenous disturbances. The desired closed-loop dynamics is obtained by means of pole assignment. To have a feasible control action, that is, the forces produced by the motors belong to an admissible set of forces, suitable reference signals are generated by means of differentiators supplied by the desired trajectory. The proposed control algorithm is tested by means of simulation experiments on a Raspberry-PI board by means of the hardware-in-the-loop method, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, it is compared with the standard FL control method, where the above nonlinear terms are computed using nominal parameters and the aerodynamical disturbances are neglected. The comparison shows that the control algorithm based on the online estimation of the above nonlinear state-feedback terms gives better static and dynamic behaviour over the standard FL control method.},

Human-like morphology and motion are often considered key features for intuitive human–robot interactions because they allow human peers to easily predict the final intention of a robotic movement. Here, we present a novel motion planning algorithm, the H uman-like U pper-limb M otion P lanner, for the upper limb of anthropomorphic robots, that generates collision-free trajectories with human-like characteristics. Mainly inspired from established theories of human motor control, the planning process takes into account a task-dependent hierarchy of spatial and postural constraints modelled as cost functions. For experimental validation, we generate arm-hand trajectories in a series of tasks including simple point-to-point reaching movements and sequential object-manipulation paradigms. Being a major contribution to the current literature, specific focus is on the kinematics of naturalistic arm movements during the avoidance of obstacles. To evaluate human-likeness, we observe kinematic regularities and adopt smoothness measures that are applied in human motor control studies to distinguish between well-coordinated and impaired movements. The results of this study show that the proposed algorithm is capable of planning arm-hand movements with human-like kinematic features at a computational cost that allows fluent and efficient human–robot interactions.},

The identified ocean flow field is used to eliminate false alarms, where an abnormal trajectory may be caused by unexpected flow. The convergence of the algorithms is justified through the theory of adaptive control. The proposed strategy is robust to speed constraints and inaccurate flow modeling. Experimental results are collected on an indoor testbed formed by the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimp and Georgia Tech Wind Measuring Robot, while simulation study is performed for ocean flow field.

  abstract     = {Mission-critical exploration of uncertain environments requires reliable and robust mechanisms for achieving information gain. Typical measures of information gain such as Shannon entropy and KL divergence are unable to distinguish between different bimodal probability distributions or introduce bias toward one mode of a bimodal probability distribution. The use of a standard deviation (SD) metric reduces bias while retaining the ability to distinguish between higher and lower risk distributions. Areas of high SD can be safely explored through observation with an autonomous Mars Helicopter allowing safer and faster path plans for ground-based rovers. First, this study presents a single-agent information-theoretic utility-based path planning method for a highly correlated uncertain environment. Then, an information-theoretic two-stage multiagent rapidly exploring random tree framework is presented, which guides Mars helicopter through regions of high SD to reduce uncertainty for the rover. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we compare our information-theoretic framework with a rover-only approach and a naive approach, in which the helicopter scouts ahead of the rover along its planned path. Finally, the model is demonstrated in a case study on the Jezero region of Mars. Results show that the information-theoretic helicopter improves the travel time for the rover on average when compared with the rover alone or with the helicopter scouting ahead along the rover’s initially planned route.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the application of two-dimensional (2D) barcode is more and more extensive and has been used as landmarks for robots to detect and peruse the information. However, it is hard to obtain a sharp 2D barcode image because of the moving robot, and the common solution is to deblur the blurry image before decoding the barcode. Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem, where ringing artifacts are commonly presented in the deblurred image, which causes the increase of decoding time and the limited improvement of decoding accuracy. In this article, a novel approach is proposed using blur-invariant shape and geometric features to make a blur-readable (BR) 2D barcode, which can be directly decoded even when seriously blurred. The finder patterns of BR code consist of two concentric rings and five disjoint disks, whose centroids form two triangles. The outer edges of the concentric rings can be regarded as blur-invariant shapes, which enable BR code to be quickly located even in a blurred image. The inner angles of the triangle are of blur-invariant geometric features, which can be used to store the format information of BR code. When suffering from severe defocus blur, the BR code can not only reduce the decoding time by skipping the deblurring process but also improve the decoding accuracy. With the defocus blur described by circular disk point-spread function, simulation results verify the performance of blur-invariant shape and the performance of BR code under blurred image situation.},

Aiming at the problems of low positioning accuracy of Lidar (light detection and ranging) simultaneous localization and mapping with nonlinear and non-Gaussian noise characteristics, this article presents a mobile robot simultaneous localization and mapping method that combines Lidar and inertial measurement unit to set up a multi-sensor integrated system and uses a rank Kalman filtering to estimate the robot motion trajectory through inertial measurement unit and Lidar observations. Rank Kalman filtering is similar to the Gaussian deterministic point sampling filtering algorithm in structure, but it does not need to meet the assumptions of Gaussian distribution. It completely calculates the sampling points and the sampling points weights based on the correlation principle of rank statistics. It is suitable for nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems. With multiple experimental tests of small-scale arc trajectories, we can see that compared with the alone Lidar simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm, the new algorithm reduces the mean error of the indoor mobile robot in the X direction from 0.0928 m to 0.0451 m, with an improved accuracy rate of 46.39%, and the mean error in the Y direction from 0.0772 m to 0.0405 m, which improves the accuracy rate of 48.40%.

In the coarse-to-fine matching scheme, we propose disparity constraint and 3D normal vector constraint between adjacent levels through which the disparity map and 3D normal vector map at a coarser level are used to restrict the search range of disparity and normal vector at a fine level. The experimental results with the Chang’e-3 rover dataset and the KITTI dataset show that the proposed stereo matching method is efficiently and accurately compared with the state-of-the-art 3D labeling algorithm, especially in low-texture or textureless regions. The computational efficiency of this method is about five to six times faster than the state-of-the-art 3D labeling method, and the accuracy is better.},

The research of this article focuses on the dynamic parameter identification method of the redundant manipulator. In the study, the spinor theory is applied to the Newton–Euler dynamic equation, the Coulomb + viscous friction model is adopted, and the minimum parameter set is obtained by linearization derivation. The parameter identification of the manipulator is realized using the method of offline identification of the measured current, and the coefficient of the excitation trajectory is optimized using the nonlinear optimization function. Finally, the parameter set with high accuracy is obtained, and the motion trajectory of each joint can be obtained. The scheme has high accuracy and can meet the needs of practical application. To verify the accuracy and reliability of this method, we have carried out experiments on a service robot “Walker” and obtained the desired results.},

A hybrid observer, which combines the fast convergence from adaptive observer and the strong robustness from sliding mode observer, is proposed to detect and estimate UAV actuator faults accurately with model uncertainties and disturbances. A nonlinear quadrotor UAV model with model uncertainties and disturbances is considered and a more precise unified expression for actuator faults that do not require knowing where the upper or lower bound is provided. The original system is decomposed into two subsystems by coordinate transformation to improve detection accuracy for small amplitude bias faults and avoid external influences. The hybrid observer is then designed to estimate subsystem states and faults with good stability by selecting a Lyapunov function. A fault-tolerant controller is obtained depending on fault estimation by compensating the normal controller (proportion integral differential [PID] controller). Several numerical simulations confirmed that unknown actuator faults can be accurately detected, estimated, and compensated for even under disturbance conditions.},

Further, we discuss the possibilities and challenges that such a system offers and give an overview of requirements that are key to realizing the potential of drones for improved asset management. These requirements are based on years of operational experience with electrical substations combined with the lessons learned during the development and testing of our drone system.

Second, the expectation line is defined to model driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle. Finally, the long short-term memory-based method is applied to the expectation line so that the future trajectory of the vehicle could be predicted.

  abstract     = {In this article, an energy-efficient gait planning algorithm that utilizes both 3D body motion and an allowable zero moment point region (AZR) is presented for biped robots based on a five-mass inverted pendulum model. The product of the load torque and angular velocity of all joint motors is used as an energy index function (EIF) to evaluate the energy consumption during walking. The algorithm takes the coefficients of the finite-order Fourier series to represent the motion space of the robot body centroid, and the motion space is gridded by discretizing these coefficients. Based on the geometric structure of the leg joints, an inverse kinematics method for calculating grid intersection points is designed. Of the points that satisfy the AZR constraints, the point with the lowest EIF value in each network line is selected as the seed. In the neighborhood of the seed, the point with the minimum EIF value in the motion space is successively approximated by the gradient descent method, and the corresponding joint angle sequence is stored in the database. Given a distance to be traveled, our algorithm plans a complete walking trajectory, including two starting steps, multiple cyclic steps, and two stopping steps, while minimizing the energy consumption. According to the preset AZR, the joint angle sequences of the robot are read from the database, and these sequences are adjusted for each step according to the zero-moment-point feedback during walking. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, both dynamic simulation and walking experiment in the real environment were carried out. The experimental results show that compared with algorithms based on the fixed body height or vertical body motion, our gait algorithm has a significant energy-saving effect.},

At the same time, the high-level semantic information and low-level semantic information obtained through multi-level and multi-scale feature extraction can effectively improve the capture of global information and improve the performance of large-scale target segmentation. The encoder–decoder gradually recovers spatial information while capturing high-level semantic information, resulting in sharper object boundaries. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed Refine-DeepLab model, evaluate our approaches thoroughly on the PASCAL VOC 2012 data set without MS COCO data set pretraining, and achieve a state-of-art result of 81.73% mean interaction-over-union in the validate set.},

While existing lane recognition algorithms demonstrated over 90% detection rate, the validation test was usually conducted on limited scenarios. Significant gaps still exist when applied in real-life autonomous driving. The goal of this article was to identify these gaps and to suggest research directions that can bridge them. The straight lane detection algorithm based on linear Hough transform (HT) was used in this study as an example to evaluate the possible perception issues under challenging scenarios, including various road types, different weather conditions and shades, changed lighting conditions, and so on. The study found that the HT-based algorithm presented an acceptable detection rate in simple backgrounds, such as driving on a highway or conditions showing distinguishable contrast between lane boundaries and their surroundings. However, it failed to recognize road dividing lines under varied lighting conditions. The failure was attributed to the binarization process failing to extract lane features before detections. In addition, the existing HT-based algorithm would be interfered by lane-like interferences, such as guardrails, railways, bikeways, utility poles, pedestrian sidewalks, buildings and so on. Overall, all these findings support the need for further improvements of current road lane detection algorithms to be robust against interference and illumination variations. Moreover, the widely used algorithm has the potential to raise the lane boundary detection rate if an appropriate search range restriction and illumination classification process is added.},

These cameras enhance the perception of the environment and so are particularly suitable for autonomous robot navigation applications. Advanced deep learning approaches for 3D object recognition are based on complex algorithms and demand powerful hardware resources. However, autonomous robots and powered wheelchairs have limited resources, which affects the implementation of these algorithms for real-time performance. We propose to use instead a 3D voxel-based extension of the 2D histogram of oriented gradients (3DVHOG) as a handcrafted object descriptor for 3D object recognition in combination with a pose normalization method for rotational invariance and a supervised object classifier. The experimental goal is to reduce the overall complexity and the system hardware requirements, and thus enable a feasible real-time hardware implementation. This article compares the 3DVHOG object recognition rates with those of other 3D recognition approaches, using the ModelNet10 object data set as a reference. We analyze the recognition accuracy for 3DVHOG using a variety of voxel grid selections, different numbers of neurons ( N h ) in the single hidden layer feedforward neural network, and feature dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis. The experimental results show that the 3DVHOG descriptor achieves a recognition accuracy of 84.91% with a total processing time of 21.4 ms. Despite the lower recognition accuracy, this is close to the current state-of-the-art approaches for deep learning while enabling real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based grasping plays an important role in the robot providing better services. It is still challenging under disturbed scenes, where the target object cannot be directly grasped constrained by the interferences from other objects. In this article, a robotic grasping approach with firstly moving the interference objects is proposed based on elliptical cone-based potential fields. Single-shot multibox detector (SSD) is adopted to detect objects, and considering the scene complexity, Euclidean cluster is also employed to obtain the objects without being trained by SSD. And then, we acquire the vertical projection of the point cloud for each object. Considering that different objects have different shapes with respective orientation, the vertical projection is executed along its major axis acquired by the principal component analysis. On this basis, the minimum projected envelope rectangle of each object is obtained. To construct continuous potential field functions, an elliptical-based functional representation is introduced due to the better matching degree of the ellipse with the envelope rectangle among continuous closed convex curves. Guided by the design principles, including continuity, same-eccentricity equivalence, and monotonicity, the potential fields based on elliptical cone are designed. The current interference object to be grasped generates an attractive field, whereas other objects correspond to repulsive ones, and their resultant field is used to solve the best placement of the current interference object.

  abstract     = {Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are expected to play an important role in endowing the advanced robot with the compliant manipulation, which is very important for a robot to coexist and cooperate with humans. However, the strong nonlinear characteristics of PAMs hinder its wide application in robots, and therefore, advanced control algorithms are urgently needed for making the best use of the advantages and bypassing the disadvantages of PAMs. In this article, we propose a full-order sliding mode control extended state observer (fSMC-ESO) algorithm that combines the ESO and the fSMC for a robotic joint actuated by a pair of antagonistic PAMs. The fSMC is employed to eliminate the chattering and to guarantee the finite-time convergence, and the ESO is adopted to observe both the total disturbance and the states of the robot system, so that we can inhibit the disturbance and compensate the nonlinearity efficiently. Both simulations and physical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. We suggest that the proposed method can be applied to the robotic systems actuated by PAMs and remarkably improve the performance of the robot system.},

In this article, a practically oriented UUV formation control structure and method are proposed for the problem of large communication in leader–follower approach. To solve the problem of large communication in multi-UUVs, local sensing means of acoustic positioning is used to provide the real relative distance and angle information for the follower UUV. So, only a small amount of state information of the leader UUV needs to be sent to the follower UUV by acoustic communication. Then, the formation control structure in absence of follower position information is proposed. In this control structure, only the relative distance and angle, as well as velocity and heading of the leader UUV, are used for the formation controller design of the follower UUV. Backstepping and Lyapunov methods are used to design the formation controller without position information of the follower UUV. Two formation configurations of rectangle and triangle with five UUVs are simulated to verify the effectiveness of the method proposed. The simulation results show that the follower UUV can successfully constitute and maintain the desired formation by controlling each real relative distance and angle.},

The dynamics of this class of robots are strong, nonlinear, and subject to external disturbance. To compensate the effect of the unknown upper bounded external disturbances, a robust sliding mode controller based on an integral adaptive law is proposed. The salient feature of the developed controller resides in taking into account that the system is MIMO and the upper bound of disturbances is not priori known. Therefore, we relied on an estimation of each perturbation separately for each subsystem. Hence, the proposed controller provides a minimum acceptable errors and bounded adaptive laws with minimum of chattering problem. To complete the goal of the trajectory tracking, we apply a kinematic controller that takes into account the nonholonomic constraint of the robot. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed tracking dynamic and kinematic controllers are analytically proved using Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results based on a comparative study show that the proposed controllers ensure better performances in terms of good robustness against disturbances, accuracy, minimum tracking errors, boundness of the adaptive gains, and minimum chattering effects.},

Identifying the pedestrians from confused planar objects is a challenging problem in the field of pedestrian recognition. In this article, we focus on the 2D fake pedestrian identification based on light-field (LF) imaging and convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we expand the previous dataset to 1500 samples, which is a mid-size dataset for LF images in all public LF datasets. Second, a joint CNN classification framework is proposed, which uses both RGB image and depth image (extracted from the LF image) as input. This framework can fully mine 2D feature information and depth feature information from corresponding images. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient to identify the fake pedestrian in a 2D plane and achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.0%. This work is expected to be used in recognition of 2D fake pedestrian and may help researchers solve other computer vision problems.},

Continuous action reward function and position reward function are presented, by which the training speed is increased and the performance of the generated trajectory is improved. Using pretrained PPO, a new agent can be trained efficiently for a new task. A reinforcement learning framework is built, in which an agent can be trained to generate a reference trajectory or a series of guidance instructions.

Four solutions, based on the algorithm of Hert and Lumelsky, are tested with the aim of improving the compactness of the partitions.

Force impulse for self-assembly is derived as the function of joint angles/velocities, base pose, and impact direction. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as multiobjective optimization to minimize force impulse, base attitude disturbance, and energy consumption in the load-carrying process. A two-stage trajectory planning algorithm is proposed. To be specific, at the first stage, multiple desired configurations at the contact point are generated by position-level inverse kinematics with Newton–Raphson iterative method. At the second stage, joint trajectories satisfying joint angle limits and desired motion of the payload are parameterized by coefficients of sinusoidal polynomial functions. Multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the problem of multiobjective trajectory planning, and screening process is conducted to reserve nondominated solutions in limits of joint torques. The algorithm is implemented to a seven degrees of freedom space manipulator, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results.},

Firstly, the kinematic model and static model are established. The influence of the maximum cable force on the workspace is analyzed, and the position of the cable connection points on the end effector is discussed. Then, the stiffness of the CDPR is analyzed, which reveals that a large difference of the width-to-height ratio between the end effector and the base improves the stiffness condition number and average stiffness of the CDPR. Considering the size of the cleaning module, the horizontal cross layout is adopted and cable connection points are determined.

Firstly, to implement the robot manipulator visual object tracking task with strong robustness under the weak FOV constraints, an improved TLD algorithm is proposed.

Finally, the visual sliding mode control law is designed according to the image feature errors to control the motion of the robot manipulator so as to complete the visual tracking task of the robot manipulator to the manipulated object in complex natural scenes with high robustness. Several robot manipulator VS experiments were conducted on a six-degrees-of-freedom MOTOMANSV3 industrial manipulator under different natural scenes.

The guidance and control layer can be described in terms of theory and application. At the theoretical level, the line of sight guidance algorithm and incremental proportional integral control algorithm are introduced to eliminate system control lag. Among them, the best line of sight guidance and incremental proportional integral control parameters are selected by the Elitist strategies genetic algorithm, and the initial parameters are set according to human driving experience initial control parameters. At the application level, the BECKHOFF controller, a kind of programmable logic controller, acts as the main guidance and control unit in the four-level control system, fixed speed is given to the autonomous articulated vehicle by setting the engine speed and transmission gear, and steering wheel angle is adjusted in real time by the BECKHOFF controller. In the sensor level, a simplified sensor configuration is used to reduce overall cost. The comparative simulation results of no controller, the incremental proportional integral controller, line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with human driving experience initial control parameters, line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with random initial control parameters, and elitist strategies genetic algorithm-line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with human driving experience initial control parameters manifest evidently that the proposed elitist strategies genetic algorithm-line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with human driving experience initial control parameters has almost no steady-state error, no overshoot, and short settling time.

  abstract     = {Mobile robots that operate in real-world environments need to be able to safely navigate their surroundings. Obstacle avoidance and path planning are crucial capabilities for achieving autonomy of such systems. However, for new or dynamic environments, navigation methods that rely on an explicit map of the environment can be impractical or even impossible to use. We present a new local navigation method for steering the robot to global goals without relying on an explicit map of the environment. The proposed navigation model is trained in a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Advantage Actor–Critic method and is able to directly translate robot observations to movement commands. We evaluate and compare the proposed navigation method with standard map-based approaches on several navigation scenarios in simulation and demonstrate that our method is able to navigate the robot also without the map or when the map gets corrupted, while the standard approaches fail. We also show that our method can be directly transferred to a real robot.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a modification of hybrid A* method used for navigation of spherical mobile robots with the ability of limited partial lateral movement driven by pendulum. For pendulum-driven spherical robots with nonzero minimal turning radius, our modification helps to find a feasible and achievable path, which can be followed in line with the low time cost. Because of spherical shell shape, the robot is point contact with the ground, showing different kinematic model compared with common ground mobile robots such as differential robot and wheeled car-like robot. Therefore, this article analyzes the kinematic model of spherical robot and proposes a novel method to generate feasible and achievable paths conforming to kinematic constraints, which can be the initial value of future trajectory tracking control and further optimization. A concept of optimal robot’s minimum area for rotation is also proposed to improve search efficiency and ensure the ability of turning to any orientation by moving forward and backward in a finite number of times within limited areas.},

  abstract     = {Indoor object detection is a very demanding and important task for robot applications. Object knowledge, such as two-dimensional (2D) shape and depth information, may be helpful for detection. In this article, we focus on region-based convolutional neural network (CNN) detector and propose a geometric property-based Faster R-CNN method (GP-Faster) for indoor object detection. GP-Faster incorporates geometric property in Faster R-CNN to improve the detection performance. In detail, we first use mesh grids that are the intersections of direct and inverse proportion functions to generate appropriate anchors for indoor objects. After the anchors are regressed to the regions of interest produced by a region proposal network (RPN-RoIs), we then use 2D geometric constraints to refine the RPN-RoIs, in which the 2D constraint of every classification is a convex hull region enclosing the width and height coordinates of the ground-truth boxes on the training set. Comparison experiments are implemented on two indoor datasets SUN2012 and NYUv2. Since the depth information is available in NYUv2, we involve depth constraints in GP-Faster and propose 3D geometric property-based Faster R-CNN (DGP-Faster) on NYUv2. The experimental results show that both GP-Faster and DGP-Faster increase the performance of the mean average precision.},

The purpose of this article is to analyze the modeling preference and trend of the current automobile market in time, which can assist the modeling design of new models of automobile main engine factories and strengthen their branding family. Intelligent rapid modeling shortens the current modeling design cycle, so that the product rapid iteration is to occupy an active position in the automotive market. In this article, aiming at the family analysis of automobile front face, the image database of automobile front face modeling analysis was created. The database included two data sets of vehicle signs and no vehicle signs, and the image data of vehicle front face modeling of most models of 22 domestic mainstream brands were collected. Then, this article adopts the image classification processing method in computer vision to conduct car brand classification training on the database. Based on ResNet-8 and other model architectures, it trains and classifies the intelligent vehicle brand classification database with and without vehicle label. Finally, based on the shape coefficient, a 3D wireframe model and a curved surface model are obtained. The experimental results show that the 3D curve model can be obtained based on a single image from any angle, which greatly shortens the modeling period by 92%.},

  abstract     = {Locomotive robots based on tensegrities have recently drawn much attention from various communities. A common strategy to realize long-distance locomotion is combining several basic gaits that are designed in advance. Considering the unavoidable uncertainties of the environment and the real locomotive system, selecting the gaits with high robustness is essential to the implementation of long-distance locomotion of tensegrity robots. However, no quantitative approach for robustness evaluation of rolling gaits is reported in recent research work. In this study, a practical and quantitative method is proposed for the robustness evaluation of rolling gaits of tensegrity robots. A mathematical model is built to describe the evaluation process, and the success rate of rolling is adopted as an indicator of robustness. Sensitivity analysis and robust evaluation are conducted on the rolling gaits of a typical six-strut tensegrity robot. Specifically, the sensitivities of the rolling gaits to five uncertain parameters (i.e. tendon stiffness, initial tendon prestress, the equivalent mass of nodes, actuation lengths of actuators, and slope of ground) are investigated and discussed in detail, and the robustness of the rolling gaits is evaluated by correlated random sampling. Experiments on a physical prototype of the six-strut tensegrity robot are carried out to verify the proposed concept and method.},

However, the nonlinearity and hysteresis of SMA material seriously affect the precise control. In this article, a novel disturbance compensation-based adaptive control scheme is developed to improve the control performance of SMA actuator system. Firstly, the nominal model is constructed based on the physical process. Next, an estimator is developed to online update not only the unmeasured system states but also the total disturbance. Then, the novel adaptive controller, which is composed of the nominal control law and the compensation control law, is designed. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated in the SMA experimental setup. The comparison results have demonstrated that the proposed control method can track reference trajectory accurately, reject load variations and stochastic disturbances timely, and exhibit satisfactory robust stability. The proposed control scheme is system independent and has some potential in other types of SMA-actuated systems.},

  abstract     = {As a fundamental assumption in simultaneous localization and mapping, the static scenes hypothesis can be hardly fulfilled in applications of indoor/outdoor navigation or localization. Recent works about simultaneous localization and mapping in dynamic scenes commonly use heavy pixel-level segmentation net to distinguish dynamic objects, which brings enormous calculations and limits the real-time performance of the system. That restricts the application of simultaneous localization and mapping on the mobile terminal. In this article, we present a lightweight system for monocular simultaneous localization and mapping in dynamic scenes, which can run in real time on central processing unit (CPU) and generate a semantic probability map. The pixel-wise semantic segmentation net is replaced with a lightweight object detection net combined with three-dimensional segmentation based on motion clustering. And a framework integrated with an improved weighted-random sample consensus solver is proposed to jointly solve the camera pose and perform three-dimensional object segmentation, which enables high accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the prior information of the generated map and the object detection results is introduced for better estimation. The experiments on the public data set, and in the real-world demonstrate that our method obtains an outstanding improvement in both accuracy and speed compared to state-of-the-art methods.},
