  abstract     = {Financial and operational risk management are central concepts at the intersection of finance, operations, and commodity risk management. Yet, empirical evidence on their effects on inventory is lacking. We use a fine‐grained data set comprising the financial and operational risk management decisions of gold miners from 2003 to 2011 to empirically assess the effects of risk management on inventory. Faced with volatile gold prices, miners may manage (output) risk financially by committing to sell future gold production and lock in prices. They may also manage (input) costs operationally by varying the quality of ore they extract and process, thereby altering the costs they incur and influencing inventory holdings. In addition to affecting profitability, we show that these two risk management strategies have implications for inventory holdings. We find that a one‐standard deviation increase in financial risk management (FRM) is associated with an 14.3% decrease in inventory, as FRM decreases the option value of delaying processing inventory. On the other hand, a one‐standard deviation increase in operational risk management (ORM) is associated with a 3.5% increase in inventory. We also find evidence that, in this context, FRM and ORM could be viewed as complements.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy generation at the point of consumption (i.e., distributed generation) reduces consumer&#39;s electricity expenditure, and eliminates the cost, complexity, and inefficiency associated with power transmission and distribution. In this study, we address the problem of how a consumer should invest in distributed renewable generation to minimize the total expected cost of meeting his electricity demand. In contrast to the existing literature that focuses on grid‐connected, large‐scale investments in renewable power generation in the wholesale electricity market, we address investment in stand‐alone, distributed renewable energy by an individual consumer who participates in a regulated, retail electricity market. We formulate an infinite‐horizon, continuous‐time model in which the utility moves first, and announces a retail electricity rate. Each consumer then acts strategically in deciding if, when, and how much distributed generation capacity to install. We find the subgame‐perfect Nash equilibrium of this dynamic Stackelberg game by first deriving the consumer&#39;s optimal investment time and the resulting optimal capacity of his installed distributed generation. Using those results, we quantify the ensuing cost savings to the consumer, which average over 22% across a range of model parameters. Next, we evaluate the impact of consumer&#39;s investment in renewable energy on the revenue of his electric utility, and arrive at the structure of the pricing policy that maximizes that revenue. We quantify the revenue increase available to the utility from following this revenue‐maximizing pricing when serving either a single consumer or multiple heterogeneous consumers, and find that it averages over 10% in our numerical studies.},

  abstract     = {Many manufacturing firms have become increasingly flexible in that they can rapidly idle and restart production in response to changing commodity prices. We study how operational flexibility alters both the timing and financing decisions in the firm. We perform this analysis in a dynamic model in which a firm has multiple debt issues and decisions are made to maximize shareholder value. We compare the decisions of a flexible firm, which can temporarily shut down to avoid operational losses, with those of a rigid firm which is not able to stop operating even in states where operational losses occur. On one hand, firms with operational flexibility can better exploit a larger tax shield by taking on more debt. On the other hand, taking on more debt may be less harmful for a rigid firm, since it increases the default threshold thereby reducing the region where operational losses are experienced due to inflexibility. We explore how the two forces trade off between the benefit of tax shield and the cost of default. We find that, even though bondholders charge a higher fair premium for debt issued by the inflexible firm, the rigid firm will utilize more debt. We also show that, all things being equal, firms with operational flexibility invest earlier and use less debt to finance the opportunity. Dynamic models that trade off tax shields with bankruptcy costs and ignore operational flexibility may result in theoretical leverage ratios being biased high.},

Our focus is the Caribbean region, which faces increasing disaster threats due to weather‐related events and has committed to share its resources for regional integration. We collaborate with the inter‐governmental Caribbean Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), which is interested in creating a methodology to equitably (fairly) allocate the costs necessary to operationalize this commitment. We present alternative cost allocation methods among the partner countries by considering their risk level and their ability to pay. Specifically, we adapt some techniques such as the Shapley value, the equal profit method, and the alternative cost avoided method, and we also propose a new insurance‐based allocation scheme to determine the country contributions. This mechanism, which is formulated as a linear programming model, sets country premiums by considering the expected value and the standard deviation of country demands and their gross national income. We discuss the structural properties of these methods and numerically evaluate their performance in achieving an equitable allocation scheme with respect to three equity indicators based on the Gini coefficient. Our proposed cost‐sharing mechanism not only achieves superior solutions compared with other methodologies with respect to the proposed equity metrics, but is also computationally efficient. We numerically illustrate how it can be used to obtain alternative cost allocation plans by giving different weights to disaster risk and economic standing parameters, and we analyze the benefits and fairness of the partnership in a transparent way.},

  abstract     = {Improving access to family planning services is key to achieving many of the United Nations sustainable development goals. To scale up access in remote areas and urban slums, many developing countries deploy mobile family planning teams that visit “outreach sites” several times per year. Visit frequencies have a significant effect on the total number of clients served and hence the impact of the outreach program. Using a large dataset of visits in Madagascar, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, our study models the relationship between the number of clients seen during a visit and the time since the last visit and uses this model to analyze the characteristics of optimal frequencies. We use the latter to develop simple frequency policies for practical use, prove bounds on the worst‐case optimality gap, and test the impact of the policies with a simulation model. Our main finding is that despite the complexity of the frequency optimization problem, simple policies yield near‐optimal results. This holds even when few data are available and when the relationship between client volume and the time since the last visit is misspecified or substantially biased. The simulation for Uganda shows a potential increase in client numbers of between 7% and 10%, which corresponds to more than 12,000 additional families to whom family planning services could be provided. Our results can assist policymakers in determining when to start data‐driven frequency determination and which policies to implement.},

  abstract     = {In many low‐ and middle‐income countries, including Zambia, stockouts of life‐saving medicines threaten the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); it is therefore vital to reduce stockouts through the use of improved inventory control policies. The associated medicine distribution problem is challenging because it involves seasonality and uncertainty in both demand and lead times, heterogeneous delivery locations, and lost demand. Besides service level and inventory costs, equity across delivery locations must also be considered. This empirical study is based on an independently validated simulation model constructed from extensive field data, and addresses the lack of rigorous recommendations of inventory policies in this context. It compares the current base‐stock and other policies proposed in the practitioner&#39;s literature with an optimization‐based policy adapted from research on industrial settings. Although the optimization‐based policy may need more implementation efforts, it generally outperforms the other evaluated policies. Our results also suggest that the prevalent proportional inventory rationing rules may lead to substantial service level discrepancies between facilities. Finally, the performance metrics of service level and distribution equity can be at odds, prompting non‐trivial design trade‐offs and considerations. This work motivated the development of a digital distribution information system involving smartphones with barcode scanners deployed in 60 health centers, posts, and district hospitals in Zambia until 2018.},

  abstract     = {The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals provide a road map for countries to achieve peace and prosperity. In this study, we address two of these sustainable development goals: achieving food security and reducing inequalities. Food banks are nonprofit organizations that collect and distribute food donations to food‐insecure populations in their service regions. Food banks consider three criteria while distributing the donated food: equity, effectiveness, and efficiency. The equity criterion aims to distribute food in proportion to the food‐insecure households in a food bank&#39;s service area. The effectiveness criterion aims to minimize undistributed food, whereas the efficiency criterion minimizes the total cost of transportation. Models that assume predetermined weights on these criteria may produce inaccurate results as the preference of food banks over these criteria may vary over time, and as a function of supply and demand. In collaboration with our food bank partner in North Carolina, we develop a single‐period, weighted multi‐criteria optimization model that provides the decision‐maker the flexibility to capture their preferences over the three criteria of equity, effectiveness, and efficiency, and explore the resulting trade‐offs. We then introduce a novel algorithm that elicits the inherent preference of a food bank by analyzing its actions within a single‐period. The algorithm does not require direct interaction with the decision‐maker. The non‐interactive nature of this algorithm is especially significant for humanitarian organizations such as food banks which lack the resources to interact with modelers on a regular basis. We perform extensive numerical experiments to validate the efficiency of our algorithm. We illustrate results using historical data from our food bank partner and discuss managerial insights. We explore the implications of different decision‐maker preferences for the criteria on distribution policies.},

  abstract     = {There are 26 million refugees worldwide seeking safety from persecution, violence, conflict, and human rights violations. Camp‐based refugees are those that seek shelter in refugee camps, whereas urban refugees inhabit nearby, surrounding populations. The systems that supply aid to refugee camps may suffer from ineffective distribution due to challenges in administration, demand uncertainty and volatility in funding. Aid allocation should be carried out in a manner that properly balances the need of ensuring sufficient aid for camp‐based refugees, with the ability to share excess inventory, when available, with urban refugees that at times seek nearby camp‐based aid. We develop an inventory management policy to govern a camp&#39;s sharing of aid with urban refugee populations in the midst of uncertainties related to camp‐based and urban demands, and replenishment cycles due to funding issues. We use the policy to construct costs associated with: (i) referring urban populations elsewhere, (ii) depriving camp‐based refugee populations, and (iii) holding excess inventory in the refugee camp system. We then seek to allocate aid in a manner that minimizes the expected overall cost to the system. We propose two approaches to solve the resulting optimization problem, and conduct computational experiments on a real‐world case study as well as on synthetic data. Our results are complemented by an extensive simulation study that reveals broad support for our optimal thresholds and allocations to generalize across varied key parameters and distributions. We conclude by presenting related discussions that reveal key managerial insights into humanitarian aid allocation under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Related to several efforts by governments to attain United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, subsidy vouchers are used to provide monetary support to income‐eligible (IE) families who cannot afford child care. However, IE families are often unable to accept an offered voucher due to an inadequate supply of voucher‐accepting child care providers that best suit their needs. Child Care Resource and Referral agencies (CCR&amp;Rs), which administer these programs, can influence the family&#39;s propensity to accept a voucher by investing funds both in outreach to increase the number of voucher‐accepting providers in each region, and in provider services to improve the service delivery to families. This study analyzes how a CCR&amp;R should allocate its limited funds between these two types of activities to ensure equitable access to child care across the different regions of its service area. We show that it might be optimal for the CCR&amp;R to invest more funds in outreach in the region with a lower proportion of IE families. This is especially true when: the external considerations (e.g., public transportation and infrastructure) in that region have a greater impact on a family&#39;s acceptance propensity; the marginal return of investment in outreach in that region is higher and abundant funds are available; the socioeconomic distress experienced by families in that region is significantly higher; or a large amount of funds is earmarked for outreach in that region. We contextualize our study for a CCR&amp;R in Massachusetts and conclude that the proposed investment decisions can improve equity outcomes by 7.0%.},

We call these development‐aid supply chains (DASC) distinct from commercial or humanitarian supply chains. With little available formally on DASCs in the literature, we carried out a field study across five solar lantern supply chains in Haiti set up for recovery following the massive 2010 earthquake. Stakeholder resource‐based view allowed us to use stakeholder theory, utility theory, and the resource‐based view in analyzing how these supply chains work. We observed how donor cash in these supply chains brings together global original equipment manufacturers; national‐level distributors; impact investors; microfinance institutions; retailers; and micro‐entrepreneurs. Many of these entities are social enterprises that bridge development‐minded donors with commercially oriented retailers and micro‐entrepreneurs. The result of these bridging efforts is the flow of goods, cash, and social impact data. Our conceptual model flags the problem that donor funding, while crucial for reducing deprivation in the short term, may increase the dependence on aid rather than reduce it.},

UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 addresses this problem and urges stakeholders to take effective measures to end all forms of labor exploitation by 2030. Labor exploitation is often a direct consequence of forced migration, and humanitarian operations have a key role to play in tackling this issue worldwide. Academic research can facilitate this by providing the necessary decision‐making tools to support antislavery practitioners in humanitarian organizations and governments. For effective resource allocation, these practitioners need tools to help them systematically identify and assess the risks of labor exploitation in an area. In this study, we develop a multi‐method approach that combines various data sources to capture the issue&#39;s complex and multidimensional nature. Through satellite remote sensing, we first identify 50 informal settlements hosting migrant workers in the strawberry production area of Southern Greece. We then apply a multi‐criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method to a subset of six informal settlements in order to evaluate their labor exploitation risks based on eight criteria. In addition to being practically implemented by a humanitarian organization and a government agency in Greece, our study advances research on humanitarian operations and labor exploitation by elucidating how a multi‐method approach can be used for data‐driven prioritization of interventions against labor exploitation. Our approach offers opportunities for other applications in the field of humanitarian operations.},

It is essential that development scholars and practitioners have tools to understand the dynamics of these systems and the key drivers of their behavior, such as barriers to progress and leverage points for driving sustainable change. System dynamics tools are well suited to address this challenge, but they must first be adapted for the data‐poor and fragmented environment of development work. Our key contribution is to extend the causal loop diagram (CLD) with a data layer that describes the status of and change in each variable based on available data. By testing dynamic hypotheses against the system&#39;s actual behavior, it enables analysis of a system&#39;s dynamics and behavioral drivers without simulation. The data‐layered CLD was developed through a 4‐year engagement with USAID/Uganda. Its contributions are illustrated through an application to agricultural financing in Uganda. Our analysis identified a lack of demand for agricultural loans as a major barrier to broadening agricultural financing, partially refuting an existing hypothesis that access to credit was the main constraint. Our work extends system dynamics theory to meet the challenges of this practice environment, enabling analysis of the complex dynamics that are crucial to achieving the SDGs.},

  abstract     = {Non‐profit organizations (NPOs) play a critical role in advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, directing resources from donors to aid recipients. To achieve this, they often rely on donations of physical goods, which can not only further the mission of the NPO, but also give new life to used goods destined for the landfill. However, not all donations are wanted or needed—the NPO may be space constrained or the donation may be of poor quality. Accepting unwanted donations imposes non‐trivial operational costs on the NPO or its downstream partners. Nonetheless, NPOs often hesitate to reject unwanted items, fearing negative repercussions for future donations. To better understand these repercussions, we study how donors respond to rejection using a controlled experiment. Subjects repeatedly choose whether to complete a real‐effort task that generates a donation, which is rejected with a fixed probability whose value is unknown to them. We measure subjects’ donation decisions and beliefs about the probability that their donations are accepted. We compare these measures against a for‐profit experimental condition wherein the subject, not an NPO, receives the payment generated by the real‐effort task. Our results identify a mechanism by which rejections affect donations: via a reduction in donors’ beliefs about future success. Moreover, we identify a novel instance of self‐serving bias : when high effort is required to make a donation, subjects’ beliefs respond significantly more negatively to rejection in the donation condition than in the for‐profit condition. We propose ways in which NPOs can alleviate this bias.},

We explicitly model a distinguishing feature of primary care settings: patient office revisit intervals are determined jointly by the physician and her patients. Using our model, we identify settings where patients and physicians adopt e‐visits. We analytically characterize the impact of e‐visits on key system outcomes: panel size, patient health, and physician compensation. Notably, we identify settings—defined in terms of patient panel features, parameters of primary care delivery, and physician compensation scheme—in which at least one of the system outcomes suffers under e‐visits. Our modeling approach highlights the importance of considering patient and physician responses to primary care interventions to understand their full impact.},

  abstract     = {As an important domain of disaster management, accident prevention is an urgent and crucial subject because of the high frequency and severe consequences of industrial accidents in recent times. Current researchers focus on organization‐level safety antecedents, among which leadership receives the highest attention. However, formal leadership of senior managers is limited by the level‐by‐level effect attenuation, such that frontline accidents cannot be controlled substantially. Thus, this study proposes the construct of informal safety leadership (ISL), which emerges among frontline workers through socially cognitive interactions. We develop a moderated mediating conceptual model to explore the ISL emergence mechanism from the social‐cognitive perspective. Across two studies, that is, a three‐wave field study and an agent‐based modeling simulation experiment, we find that three social‐cognitive elements are positively associated with ISL emergence, which in turn predicts safety organizational citizenship behavior and perceived followership. Moreover, this relationship is conditional on formal leadership support. We contribute to disaster management literature by articulating how informal leaders emerge from the operational frontline to possess safety leadership traits. We also give insight into leadership emergence by clearly indicating that who becomes a leader is an inherently social process, dependent on peers who bestow influence to a person engaging in leader‐like behaviors. We thus provide a unique perspective on practical efforts to leverage benefits of the closest and most immediate leadership in frontline accident prevention.},

  abstract     = {While batch processes are ubiquitous across industries, there is little understanding of the determination of the capacity (i.e., the maximum long‐term output rate) of such processes. In this study, we consider processes with collaboration (activities may require multiple resources simultaneously) and multitasking (the same resource may be needed for multiple activities), and characterize the capacity of an arbitrary deterministic, single‐product process with batch processing and (activity) setup times . Such a process can be viewed as an “intermittent” process in which production occurs in discrete quantities; specifically, in multiples of the batch size. To obtain a corresponding “smooth” process, we use the most natural transformation that eliminates batching and setups, and simply prorates the processing and setup time per flow unit. The main result of our analysis is that capacity remains unaffected in this transformation. Then, using recent developments in the literature on process capacity, the capacity of the transformed process can be obtained by computing the fractional chromatic number of an associated graph—this latter problem can be formulated as a linear program.},

  abstract     = {This study studies the impact of loss aversion on queue configurations in a doubled‐ended queueing system such as taxi stations. We assume that there exist two types of demands/passengers, namely, the short‐haul and long‐haul, with long‐haul demand offering a larger monetary reward for drivers. Loss‐averse drivers decide to either join or balk based on their overall utility. We first consider the passenger‐side system to be a loss system; that is, an arriving passenger balks if there is no taxi waiting for her. We derive the system performance of two queue configurations, that is, a pooled queue and two dedicated queues. By comparing the total passenger boarding rates, we find that the pooled queue is not always preferable. From the drivers’ perspective, the pooled queue generates a rather stable waiting time and hence mitigates their loss aversion in the waiting time dimension; nevertheless, it creates uncertainty in the reward dimension and thus brings about potential loss. We also compare the two configurations regarding the boarding rate of each type of passengers. We show that dedicated queues can achieve a Pareto improvement; that is, they can generate a higher boarding rate for each type of passenger when drivers are sufficiently loss averse in the reward dimension and not so in the waiting time dimension. Nevertheless, dedicated queues may decrease both passenger boarding rates. We then extend our setting by incorporating passengers’ joining/balking decisions and find that our managerial insights derived from the lost‐demand system still hold.},

We model the problem as a multi‐class queueing network with new and returning customers, time‐dependent arrivals, and abandonment. We derive its fluid approximation; a system of ordinary linear differential equations with continuous, piecewise smooth, right‐hand sides. Based on the fluid model, we propose a novel approach to determine optimal stationary staffing levels for new and returning customer queues in anticipation of future time‐varying dynamics. Using system accessibility as a proxy for service quality and staffing levels as a proxy for investment, we demonstrate how to apply our approach to two families of time‐varying arrival functions motivated by real‐world applications: an advertising campaign and a clinical setting. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that our approach creates staffing policies that maximize throughput while balancing acquisition and retention efforts more effectively (i.e., equitable abandonment from each customer class) than commonly used near‐stationary methods such as variants of square‐root staffing policies. Our model confirms that acquisition and retention efforts are intimately linked; this has been found in empirical studies but not captured in the operations literature. We suggest that in time‐varying environments, focusing on either alone is not sufficient to maintain high levels of throughput and service quality.},

  abstract     = {We examine a model in which a supplier sells products through an online platform and an offline retailer under conditions of demand uncertainty. The actual demand potential can be observed (or predicted accurately using rich sales data) by the platform and retailer, but not by the supplier. The model addresses the following issues. First, the supplier optimizes its multi‐channel strategy, including a selling format choice in the online channel and optimal pricing. Specifically, although a traditional wholesale model is used offline, both wholesale and agency models are prepared online. Given a commission rate set by the platform for the agency model, the supplier chooses one selling format from the two models. The second one is related to the platform&#39;s information‐sharing policy. The platform can commit to sharing its demand information with the supplier. This study elucidates how the platform&#39;s information sharing alters the supplier&#39;s multi‐channel management and subsequently affects the retailer eventually. Results show that the platform charges its commission rate so that the supplier chooses the agency model, unless the consumer demand is sufficiently uncertain. We also demonstrate that the platform&#39;s information sharing capability makes the agency model more likely to be adopted. However, information transparency arising from the platform&#39;s voluntary information disclosure can be unfavorable to the retailer. Finally, we demonstrate that, with information sharing, a shift from wholesale to agency models can be desirable not only for the platform and supplier, but also for the retailer (i.e., Pareto‐improving).},

However, such cascading has not yet become institutionalized. We partnered with a leading sustainability electronics company—here called “Tronics”—to investigate which Chinese suppliers are more likely to adopt sustainable procurement and when Tronics&#39; power—measured by its percentage of its Chinese suppliers&#39; business—is more/less relevant. We gathered secondary (audit and company records) and primary (survey) data on Tronics&#39; relationship with 134 Chinese suppliers, and complemented these sources with three archival datasets from CDP&#39;s Supply Chain Program, the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System of China, and the World Economic Reports. The results show that Chinese suppliers that either have an integrated management system composed of economic, environmental, and social pillars or engage with key stakeholder networks are more likely to adopt sustainable procurement practices, and that these effects are boosted when Tronics&#39; power is low to moderate. Interestingly, Chinese suppliers with sustainability violations are not necessarily less likely to adopt sustainable procurement practices. When Tronics represents a large percentage of a supplier&#39;s business, it can persuade a noncompliant supplier to adopt sustainable procurement practices, though it has limited power over suppliers that exhibit critical violations.

It is usually difficult in practice to describe precisely the joint demand and yield distribution, although partial statistical information and empirical data about this ambiguous distribution are often accessible. We combat the issue of distributional ambiguity by taking a data‐driven distributionally robust optimization approach to hedge against all distributions that are sufficiently close to a uniform and discrete distribution of empirical data, where closeness is measured by the type‐∞ Wasserstein distance. We adopt the minimax regret decision criterion to assess the optimal order quantity that minimizes the worst‐case regret. Several properties about the minimax regret model, including optimality condition, regret bound, and the worst‐case distribution, are presented. The optimal order quantity can be determined via an efficient golden section search. We extend the analysis to the Hurwicz criterion model, which generalizes the popular albeit pessimistic maximin model (maximizing the worst‐case expected profit) and its (less noticeable) more optimistic counterpart—the maximax model (maximizing the best‐case expected profit). Finally, we present numerical comparisons of our data‐driven minimax regret model with data‐driven models based on the Hurwicz criterion and with a minimax regret model based on partial statistical information on moments.},

A provider&#39;s ERD is defined as consumers’ ex‐ante expected valuation minus their ex‐post realized valuation of the provider&#39;s service. Our analysis reveals that providers’ contract strategies critically depend on their ERDs rather than the true service valuations. A provider with a higher ERD is more likely to enforce contracts, regardless of whether the true service valuation is higher than that of the competitor. Providers should enforce contracts only when they have positive ERDs. Furthermore, contracts have a competition‐intensifying effect: when providers enforce contracts, their competition on promoting consumer expectations through marketing efforts is intensified, leading to higher ERDs with contracts than without contracts. Finally, consumers and society as a whole may benefit from higher switching costs because positive ERDs may mislead consumers to make wrong switching decisions and switching costs can help deter such switching behaviors.},

We explore the two voting systems, the Majority System (MS) and the Electoral College (EC). We prove equilibrium existence and uniqueness under MS in a deterministic model; in addition, their closed form expressions are provided when fixing the subset of regions and relaxing the non‐negative investing constraint. For the stochastic case, we use Monte Carlo simulations to compute the players&#39; payoffs. For the EC, given the lack of equilibrium in pure strategies, we propose an iterative algorithm to find equilibrium in mixed strategies in a subset of the simplex lattice. We illustrate numerical instances under both election systems, and contrast players&#39; equilibrium strategies. We show that polarization induces candidates to focus on larger regions with negative biases under MS, whereas candidates concentrate on swing states under EC.

Many investors with good evaluation skills do not have substantial past investment experience but still can lead investment rounds. This helps provide investment opportunities to lay‐investors who otherwise do not get to join investors with proven records. Without identifying such investors with potential, platforms lose the opportunity to put together investors to fund worthy startups and lose business. We develop a Bayesian model to address this problem and improve funding operations of equity‐based crowdfunding platforms. Specifically, the model helps platforms to better assess investors’ evaluation skills, identify lead investors for lay‐investors to follow, and increase funding opportunities on the platforms. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, we gathered data from 319 actual investors listed on one of the largest crowdfunding platforms in the United States, picked startups randomly for investors to evaluate, and had investors evaluate startups in two ways—our approach and the conventional approach. We also discuss an extension of this Bayesian model that penalizes investors in case investors perform well by randomness. Furthermore, we used a Bayesian framework to help platforms better predict startup valuations accounting for investors’ evaluation skills.},

We focus on a setting wherein the manufacturer has decided to adopt the component but has not introduced the end product to the market and the manufacturer&#39;s task is to negotiate with the supplier for the procurement price before a deadline. The only uncertainty is the number of manufacturers adopting this component, which determines the supplier&#39;s outside option. With this uncertainty, delaying the agreement could be preferable because the manufacturer may receive a price cut if the supplier&#39;s outside option turns out to be weak. However, delay could also be costly as the supplier may refuse to sell or ask for a high price if many adopters show up. Thus, the timing of agreement for the manufacturer is a trade‐off between the benefit of collecting more information and the risk of losing the limited supply (or paying a high price). Given that the firms are rational, information is symmetric, and the manufacturer&#39;s outside option is to use older technologies, we derive the manufacturer&#39;s optimal timing strategy—how to set the deadline and whether to delay the agreement. Interestingly, we find that the manufacturer can benefit more from waiting when there is a greater chance that other higher‐value buyers exist.

  abstract     = {Fixed‐bin selective assembly (FBSA) is a method for producing high‐tolerance specification assembly from lower precision components. This study investigates the design tolerance implications of an external supplier sharing dimensional information about shipped parts to be used for FBSA. An approach for reducing surplus components in FBSA is to predictively adjust the assembler&#39;s manufacturing process so that components produced internally better match those of incoming parts. However, it is unclear how the assembler&#39;s use of timely dimensions information—that is fully shared or is shared for a limited period, about the mean, variance, or both—of an externally sourced mating part would influence procedures for setting tolerances in an FBSA context. We develop and evaluate a Bayesian prediction‐based model with estimated parameters from a US assembler of bearings. Our results indicate that adjustments made using predictions from solely historical data produced comparable assembly efficiency to those made with shared information about only the dimensional variance of incoming parts. Prediction‐based adjustments, when only information about the dimensional mean was shared, yielded comparable matchable degrees to that when the mean and variance were both known. Furthermore, contrary to convention, looser tolerances were required to increase selective assembly efficiency. The shared information had a larger effect on the matchable degree than the modification of design tolerances in the absence of such information sharing. The insights have implications for coordinated component design and quality control. Author Video},

  abstract     = {We consider add‐on pricing in a distribution channel where a retailer sells a base good and an add‐on, supplied by two manufacturers, respectively, to consumers. The retailer decides whether to sell the two products through either bundling or add‐on pricing and sets the corresponding retail prices. Under add‐on pricing, the add‐on price is unobservable to consumers when they make the purchase decision of the base good. Each manufacturer, if independent of the retailer, sets the wholesale price. Under four channel structures differed by whether either manufacturer is independent of the retailer, we specify the scenario that is optimal for the retailer to adopt add‐on pricing and show the contrasting impact from the two manufacturers. When all three firms are integrated, the retailer in general prefers add‐on pricing to bundling when the cost of base good is low and the cost of add‐on is high. Using this case as the benchmark, we show that add‐on pricing is more (less) likely to be adopted when the add‐on (base) manufacturer is independent, and add‐on pricing is again more likely to be adopted when all three firms are independent. In addition to the demand smoothing effect of bundling, we identify two drivers from the supply side: the margin squeezing effect of bundling from the add‐on manufacturer and the margin smoothing effect of bundling from the base manufacturer, where the former encourages add‐on pricing whereas the latter discourages it. The interplay of these drivers largely influences the retailer&#39;s add‐on strategy and renders the preceding results. Several extensions are discussed, including correlated consumer valuations of base good and add‐on, an alternate decision sequence, knowledgeable consumers (about add‐on price), simultaneous offering of bundling and add‐on pricing, and bilateral monopoly.},

Rigorous mixed integer and constraint programming models are presented, as well as an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve large‐scale problems. The proposed heuristic solution framework is equipped with efficient evolution and local search mechanisms as well as new feasibility detection and makespan estimation methods. To that end, new theorems are derived that extend previous theoretical contributions of the literature. Computational experiments on existing benchmark datasets show that the proposed solution methods outperform the current state‐of‐the‐art. Overall, 59 new best solutions and 61 new lower bounds are produced for a total of 228 benchmark problem instances of the literature. To explore the impact of the arbitrary precedence graphs, lower bounds and heuristic solutions are generated for new large‐scale problems. These experiments illustrate that the machine assignment flexibility and density of the precedence graphs, affect not only the makespan, but also the difficulty of producing good upper bounds.},

  abstract     = {Do humanitarian organizations exhibit similar risk‐taking behavior? This study analyzed 60 interviews from 24 case studies on four types of organizations involved in disaster response: established, expanding, extending, and emergent. By elaborating on organizational attention theory, this study investigated how organizational tasks, structures, attention, and context combine to influence organizational risk‐taking behavior by different organizational types during sudden‐onset disasters. Counterintuitively, the results indicate that two organizational types shift their risk‐taking behavior in reverse directions during disaster response stages. Expanding organizations (e.g., primary disaster response NGOs) are generally risk‐averse during the immediate response stage but become risk‐taking during the short‐term recovery stage. In contrast, extending organizations (e.g., homeless shelters) are risk‐taking during the immediate response but become risk‐averse during short‐term recovery. While established organizations are generally risk‐averse, the study differentiated between two sub‐types of established organizations with nuanced differences in risk‐taking behavior. Finally, while emergent organizations show a propensity toward risk‐taking, the results differentiate between two emergent sub‐types, where the socially emergent sub‐type (e.g., church volunteer groups) shows more pronounced risk‐taking behavior than the enterprise emergent subtype (e.g., corporate volunteer groups). The study contributes to organizational attention theory by showing how the varied risk‐taking behaviors are related to the three dimensions of performance (resource agility, resource adaptability, and resource alignment), commonly referred to as the Triple‐A model. The study implications provide researchers and managers with a framework to help understand and predict risk‐taking behavior by organizational types and sub‐types during disaster relief operations.},

  abstract     = {The quality of many online services (such as online games, video streaming, cloud services) depends not only on the service capacity but also on the number of users using the service simultaneously. For a new online service, the potential users are often uncertain about both the capacity and congestion level of the service, and hence are uncertain about the quality of service (QoS). In this study, we consider users’ participation‐dependent social learning (PDSL), that is, learning of the QoS through participants’ online reviews. The key difference from the traditional social learning mechanism is that the learning object (QoS) is not a fixed value, but instead, it depends on the number of review participants. We study how such a new learning process affects the service provider&#39;s dynamic pricing strategy in four different market scenarios, depending on whether the decisions are for two periods or infinite periods and whether users are aware of the congestion effect or not. Our analysis yields several key insights. First, the presence of PDSL significantly affects the provider&#39;s optimal pricing policy. In a two‐period market with congestion‐unaware users, the provider would always set a flat price when there is no PDSL; in contrast, when there is PDSL, the optimal price can either increase or decrease, depending on the capacity and the prior mean QoS belief. Second, users’ congestion‐awareness causes the provider to set a non‐decreasing pricing policy in the two‐period market, while the provider&#39;s steady‐state pricing policy in the infinite‐period market increases with the capacity and the prior QoS belief. Third, the existence of PDSL increases the provider&#39;s profit in all four market scenarios as long as the provider&#39;s capacity is larger than users’ prior mean QoS belief.},

  abstract     = {Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are among the largest health emergencies nowadays. Although a large proportion of NCDs can be prevented effectively via good life habits, these remain ubiquitous and one main reason is people&#39;s self‐control problem caused by time‐inconsistent, present‐biased preferences. In this situation, we wonder whether a “long‐term” conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, which is known to be effective in shaping people&#39;s behaviors but expensive, can be a viable solution. We establish a model which can be fine‐tuned by many parameters, and show that our results are robust in a wide range of parameters. We identify the optimal CCT scheme which helps people achieve their long‐term plan while generating the lowest cash flow. Our results suggest interesting managerial insights like that the amount of necessary financial incentives can depend on people&#39;s age, and that the government&#39;s optimal CCT scheme does not depend on the level of people&#39;s naivete. Also, it is profitable for companies to hold such a program and sell enrollment to customers as self‐commitment devices. However, companies may exploit customers’ naivete to maximize their profit while hurting social welfare. We also examine situations that people&#39;s behaviors can only be monitored indirectly through inaccurate signals and that people are heterogeneous in how present‐biased they are.},

  abstract     = {Experimental results support that overconfident newsvendors deviate from the optimal inventory levels to place orders closer to the mean of demand distributions, thereby lowering profits. To improve performance, we investigate whether nonstandard preferences based on prospect theory can manage overconfident newsvendors. We develop a framework where a manager determines a profit‐based target, which serves as a reference point in the newsvendor&#39;s utility function. We show that target‐setting can induce optimal orders for low‐margin products. We extend our model to a duopoly and show that the type of competition determines whether target‐setting improves performance beyond the monopolist setting. Decentralized competition, where competing newsvendors have different managers, reduces the effectiveness of target‐setting. However, centralized competition, where competing newsvendors share the same manager, increases the range of profit margins within which target‐setting can achieve the system‐optimal order quantities. We compare profit‐margin targets with gross‐profit targets throughout our analysis. Although the targets offer similar performance, we find that profit‐margin [gross‐profit] targets dominate for extremely [moderately] low‐margin products when the manager is uncertain about the newsvendor&#39;s overconfidence level. However, when managing a newsvendor with an uncertain degree of loss aversion, we find that profit‐margin targets offer greater benefits regardless of the product&#39;s profitability.},

We examine the conditions under which firms should collaborate rather than compete in new drug development. We model the collaboration vs. competition decision problem for two firms using a game‐theoretic model and derive the collaboration conditions. Our study demonstrates that development cost and uncertainties in drug treatment efficacy and safety and patient enrollment drive the collaboration or competition decision for firms. We establish conditions based on probabilities of success of drug development, cost rates, and potential market shares under which the firms should collaborate, and show that there exist scenarios under which the firms actually collaborate on the lower efficacy drug. As such, firms need to take into consideration various factors such as the probability of success, the potential market share, and the development cost of each competing drug when determining whether to collaborate or compete in developing new drugs. Finally, we apply our analytical model to illustrate a case study involving collaboration between Bristol‐Myers Squibb and Pfizer. Author Video},

  abstract     = {As more customers purchase pre‐owned apparel, firms are increasingly adopting resale based business models. These models typically operate as either (i) a trade‐in and resale program, wherein a firm offers a trade‐in discount on a new product and resells the traded‐in products, or (ii) a P2P resale marketplace where customers can buy and sell used products to each other. Since different firms choose different resale strategies, it is not clear which strategy is more profitable. Furthermore, although firms that adopt each resale model also promote their environmental benefits, there are concerns that these firms are greenwashing, that is, misrepresenting the environmental benefits of their business models. Hence, we investigate the profitability and environmental impacts of these resale marketplace models and find that the trade‐in model may be more profitable despite the lower reverse logistics cost in the P2P model, and the P2P resale marketplace may be more profitable despite the trade‐in program having direct control over the supply and demand of used products. Furthermore, both models can be better for the environment depending on the product characteristics and perceived quality difference between the used products sold in these programs. We further identify when each model is better for profitability and environment concurrently and when there is misalignment. Other results and managerial insights include comparative pricing of new and used products, market coverage, total sales, and resales, and the impact of product durability on pricing. The insights presented in this study provide useful guidelines for firms, non‐governmental organizations, and environmental advocacy groups. Author Video},

We consider a log‐log demand model, and two ways of how the price in the aggregate data is calculated, simple average price or weighted average price. We study whether there exists estimation bias in each of the two cases as well as the direction of the bias. We show that in general, the correlation between “average price” and “price dispersion” in each time period has an effect on the direction of the bias. We then propose ways to reduce the aggregation bias. We prove that when the price processes satisfy certain mild conditions, our debiasing procedure can recover the true parameters asymptotically. We also obtain statistical properties of the debiased parameters. We perform numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The numerical results show that our proposed bias mitigation approach has the potential of effectively reducing the bias in both synthetic and practical settings.},

  abstract     = {We propose a model to assess the value of a distributor in a dynamic stochastic cooperative advertising supply chain in which a manufacturer wholesales its product to a distributor who in turn sells it to a retailer. Moreover and importantly, the distributor also intermediates the pricing and advertising decisions between the manufacturer and the retailer. For the resulting three‐player hierarchical game formulation of the supply chain, we characterize the feedback Stackelberg equilibrium in terms of a system of coupled algebraic equations and show it to admit a unique solution. We find that the value added by the distributor to the supply chain depends critically on the nature of the demand function for the product, a result that has practical implications for the kinds of product where having a distributor is most desirable. Second, our model indicates that the presence of the distributor can enhance the margins of both the retailer and the manufacturer relative to the case of no distributor, and provide explicit conditions for this to occur. Third, we present numerical analysis that indicates that if the distributor generates sufficiently large transportation cost savings, then the three‐echelon supply chain can lead in the long run to higher market awareness, lower advertising expenditure, and higher value extracted, relative to the two‐echelon model. Finally, in addition to retailer advertising that is subsidized by the manufacturer, we also provide the manufacturer an option to do national advertising and show its viability.},

  abstract     = {This study considers a public service system consisting of two service providers with different service capacities and qualities, such as healthcare or transportation systems. Such a system is called a two‐tier service system (TTS). The service provider with higher service capacity and quality charges a higher price and is called a “charge service provider,” denoted by CSP, while the other service provider charges a lower price and is called a “free service provider,” denoted by FSP. We study the TTS where customers prefer the CSP to the FSP in spite of the higher price of CSP. The strong preference of CSP to FSP, which can be due to bounded rationality, leads to imbalanced workload for the TTS which implies an inefficient use of limited resources. Although both can offer a common set of services, the CSP is overly demanded and highly congested, while the FSP is under‐utilized. We first study analytically an extreme case where the preference for CSP is so strong that customers choosing the CSP are delay insensitive and those choosing the FSP are delay sensitive. Then, we extend our analysis to more general cases where customers are delay sensitive in both channels and have asymmetric preferences for service providers. Using a stylized queueing model and equilibrium customer choice analysis, we show that under certain conditions, the two‐tier system may reduce congestion and the total social cost in the system. This study offers social planners the guidance in designing less congested, more cost‐efficient, and sustainable public service systems.},

  abstract     = {We consider a for‐profit cooperative that sets a quality‐based payment to its risk‐averse farmers in order to incentivize them to invest in quality improvements. The quality of the farmer&#39;s harvest is affected by his investments during the growing season. To satisfy both the farmer and the cooperative, the payment must be competitive with the open‐market prices. Cooperatives often set payments that mimic the open‐market prices; however, this practice fails to incentivize farmers to invest in quality. Our work is motivated by the evidence of farmer underinvestment in crop quality in the olive oil industry. We define and analyze a model of this system where farmers operate under random yield, quality, and open‐market price. We find that farmers consistently underinvest in crop quality under the payment policy that mimics the open‐market prices because (1) the cooperative can command a higher retail price than a farmer and (2) farmers are risk averse. We propose two alternative payment policies that are new to the agricultural literature, both of which can coordinate farmer decisions with the system but differ in terms of ease of implementation and susceptibility to risk aversion. We identify an easy‐to‐implement policy that can lead to meaningful gains when introduced in conjunction with crop insurance. We calibrate our model using data from the olive oil industry in Turkey and find a profit improvement of 10–15% over the current open‐market payment approach.},

Demands of different classes in the same period could be correlated, while demands across periods are independent but not necessarily identical. In each period, the firm jointly makes the decisions regarding demand fulfillment, production/ordering, and disposal. The objective is to minimize the total discounted expected cost over the entire planning horizon including linear ordering cost, inventory holding/lost‐sales cost, expiration cost, and disposal cost. By establishing new properties of multimodularity, we explore some monotonicity and bounded sensitivity properties of the optimal policies. The optimality analysis enables us to propose a novel approximation approach, called adaptive approximation approach , which can be recursively calculated through a single‐dimension dynamic program. Numerical studies demonstrate that our proposed approximation approach is nearly optimal with the average optimality gap 0.30% and significantly outperforms the existing heuristics in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Popular tariffs in the telecommunications market, such as three‐part tariffs and flat‐rate plans, specify an allowance below which customers enjoy a free and high‐quality service. When they consume beyond the allowance, customers either need to pay for the overage (under three‐part tariffs) or receive a degraded service (under flat‐rate plans), thus experiencing an overage disutility. Some network service providers have recently begun to allow data trading among their subscribers, who can now sell their allowances or buy up to meet their needs. We study whether and how allowing user trading can enhance a service provider&#39;s profitability. Considering a monopolistic firm, we find that allowing trading among users improves system‐wide consumption efficiency and reduces overage disutility at the expense of losing overage revenue. Overall, trading can be beneficial to the firm. Particularly, the profitability of the firm is critically driven by addressing customers’ overage disutility. Moreover, allowing trading always improves social welfare and can also improve consumer surplus. Finally, on a self‐operated platform, the firm may find it not profitable to charge a transaction fee but will regulate up the trading price.},

We study the effectiveness of reminders in the context of EE tasks in manufacturing facilities. Technical assistance programs make EE recommendations to participating manufacturing sites and remind them regularly to pay attention to implementation. Our analysis shows that these reminders lead to a more widespread implementation of EE improvement suggestions and are particularly useful when facilities undertake multiple EE tasks in parallel, or when other unrelated sustainability tasks are being pursued in parallel. Next, we conduct a field study by leveraging a policy intervention called “Touchbase Tuesdays” that was implemented by our partner organization based on the results from our analysis. This field study provides additional causal evidence of the effect of reminders on EE task implementation. Overall, we observe that simple reminders can deliver substantial increases in task implementation rates in this context.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid development of online marketplaces has given rise not only to co‐opetitive relationships between sellers but also to information asymmetries between online marketplaces and sellers. This study studies information sharing in an e‐commerce setting consisting of an online marketplace, an upstream manufacturer and a reseller, where the online marketplace possesses superior demand information, while the manufacturer and reseller engage in a co‐opetitive structure. The reseller procures products from the manufacturer under a wholesale price contract, and both the manufacturer and reseller sell the products through the online marketplace by paying a proportional commission fee. We examine four information‐sharing scenarios: no information sharing (S1), full information sharing (S2), information sharing only with the manufacturer (S3), and information sharing only with the reseller (S4). Our analysis shows that when the intensity of competition between the manufacturer and reseller is relatively low and demand variability is moderate, the online marketplace prefers full information sharing; otherwise, it prefers to share its demand information only with the manufacturer. Moreover, interestingly, we find that the manufacturer always prefers the scenario with full information sharing to the scenario that endows her with an informational advantage over the reseller. In contrast, depending on the competitive intensity and demand variability, the reseller prefers either the scenario in which the online marketplace shares demand information with him only or that in which demand information is shared with the manufacturer only. Furthermore, we find that the equilibrium information‐sharing outcome can be either full information sharing or information sharing only with the manufacturer. The rationale behind these results hinges on the interactions among the signaling cost , efficiency effect , and co‐opetitive relationship between the manufacturer and reseller.},

  abstract     = {When releasing a new version of a durable product, a firm aims to attract new customers as well as persuade its existing customer base to upgrade. This is commonly achieved through a rollover strategy , which comprises the price of the new product as well as the decision to discontinue the sale of the existing product ( solo rollover ) or to sell the existing product at a discounted price ( dual rollover ). In this study, we argue that the timing of the new product release is an important—but commonly overlooked—third lever in the design of a successful rollover strategy. The release timing influences the consumers&#39; perception of obsolescence, by which an existing product is considered obsolete merely by reference to a new product. This reinforces the upgrading behavior of existing customers, but it also necessitates deep discounts of the existing product to keep its sale viable in a dual rollover. We analyze the impact of the release timing on solo and dual rollovers in markets for digital goods (i.e., where production costs are negligible) that are composed of naive and sophisticated consumers. Under the assumption that both the old and the new product would offer a similar utility if there was no perceived obsolescence, we show that in both markets a firm selecting the release times from a continuous timeline can induce sufficiently large parts of its existing customer base to upgrade so that a solo rollover is optimal. We also characterize the resulting market segmentation, and we offer managerial as well as policy advice.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we study a hybrid RDC‐DC serial inventory system where the regional distribution center (RDC) replenishes its stock from an outside supplier (OS), while the distribution center (DC) faces random demand and replenishes its stock from the RDC. Unlike in the traditional serial system, the DC itself can replenish its inventory from outside as well. We firstly derive structural properties for the optimal long‐run average cost and the optimal stationary policy by vanishing discount approach, and then propose two simple and easy‐to‐implement policies. The first policy, which we call the three‐index policy , combines the characteristics of the echelon‐base‐stock policy for the serial system (Clark and Scarf. 1960. Management Sci . 6 (4): 475–490) and the dual‐index policy for the dual‐sourcing system (Veeraraghavan and Scheller‐Wolf. 2008. Oper. Res . 56 (4): 850–864). We show that the order‐up‐to level of the DC from the RDC can be computed by a newsboy fractile. A simulation‐based optimization procedure for the policy is provided. We then develop the approximate linear programming ( ALP ) policy based on the three‐index policy and the multimodularity of the problem. This policy applies the linear programming approach to approximately solve the value function of the dynamic programming formulation. Numerical results show that both the three‐index policy and the ALP policy are comparable to the optimal policy computed via dynamic programming, and the latter performs slightly better. Moreover, the OS of the DC can draw considerable cost savings under both policies. We also conduct a numerical study with problem parameters calibrated using actual data from a consumer goods company in China to glen insights on the management of the system.},

However, in practice, some information that is essential for centralized management is usually privately known, which provides incentives for strategic behaviors of drivers and could lead to suboptimal system performance. We design a two‐step mechanism and prove that, in step 1, drivers’ choices of whether or not to enter the managed system following the approximate optimal solution satisfy Bayesian‐Nash equilibrium (BNE), and in step 2, that truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for all drivers under any circumstance. We investigate the properties of the resulting equilibria, and further modify the mechanism to ensure that the desired approximate system optimum solution is the only resulting BNE. Numerical examples show that the mechanism design not only enhances the average system performance but also increases the system robustness.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to evaluate the cost of agents’ self‐routing in a service system with inbound and outbound customers. We assume that inbound customers arrive over time depending on the waiting time offered, while outbound customers can be contacted at all times. Furthermore, agents are in control of routing decisions and are aware of the state of the system. Accordingly, they decide whether to serve an inbound or outbound customer, or to idle. The system manager seeks to provide a suitable trade‐off between agents’ choice of serving inbound and outbound customers by incentivizing their actions through linear payouts. Hence, there arises a problem of determining the cost of agents’ self‐routing, which can be interpreted as a variant of the principal‐agent problem where the agents’ efforts are directed toward selecting their routing policy. Through a Markov decision process, we show that the agents’ optimal policy is a reservation threshold policy for inbound customers, and express the compensation parameters that minimize staffing cost. We conclude that motivating idling decisions through linear payouts incurs high costs. This justifies the current practice of using automated routing in call centers. Moreover, paying for idling cannot reduce staffing cost. However, discriminating between delayed and non‐delayed customers in the reward structure presents a high potential of reducing agents’ pay. Finally, in situations where agents do not know the status of their colleagues, our analysis argues in favor of not revealing the state of the system to them through delay announcements when the objective waiting time is low.},

The demand information is relevant to the supplier&#39;s capacity decision. We address the question of whether the supplier benefits from installing nonlinear capacity reservation contracts rather than wholesale price contracts. We contribute to the literature by providing the first internally valid comparison of both contracts with human decision makers. We setup an experimental study with four treatments (both contracts as well as different supplier margins). From a supplier&#39;s perspective, we observe that the capacity reservation contract significantly outperforms the wholesale price contract; however, the supplier&#39;s benefit from using capacity reservation is much higher under low margins than under high margins. Regarding supply chain performance, the positive effect for the supplier exceeds the negative effect for the buyer in the low margin setting, while the two effects neutralize each other in the high margin setting. We identify behavioral factors explaining deviations from the theoretical predictions. In particular, we observe naïve anchoring and trust as strong behavioral drivers common to both contract types.

  abstract     = {Most automobile manufacturers use franchised dealers to distribute their products and to perform sales‐related and after‐sales services. However, the link between dealers’ service quality and manufacturer performance is not well understood. Some studies suggest that these services’ quality affects product sales, repeat sales, and brand reputation. Others posit that dealer services are a commodity, and their quality may only affect sales in the extremes. We constructed data representing sales and service quality ratings of 1078 U.S. automobile dealerships over a year in five different car classes. We find that the quality of after‐sales services positively influences sales of the brand in the dealer&#39;s region. Manufacturers whose dealers struggle with after‐sales services take a hit in market share even in markets where they enjoy superior competitive status. We also find that sales‐related services gain importance in highly competitive markets where the manufacturer has few dealers and competitors have many.},

  abstract     = {Course assignment is a very widespread problem in education and beyond. Typically, students have preferences for bundles of course seats or course schedules over the week, but courses have limited capacity. This is an interesting and frequent application of distributed scheduling, where payments cannot be used to implement the efficient allocation. First‐Come First‐Served (FCFS) is simple and the most widely used assignment rule in practice, but it leads to inefficient outcomes and envy in the allocation. It was recently shown that randomized economic mechanisms that do not require monetary transfers can have attractive economic and computational properties, which were considered incompatible for deterministic alternatives. We use a mixed‐methods design including field and laboratory experiments, a survey, and simulations to analyze such randomized mechanisms empirically. Implementing randomized scheduling in the field also required us to develop a solution to a new preference elicitation problem that is central to these mechanisms. The results of our empirical work shed light on the advantages that randomized scheduling mechanisms have over FCFS in the field, but also on the challenges. The resulting course assignment system was adopted permanently and is now used to solve course assignment problems with more than 1700 students every year.},

There exists a threshold value with respect to the number of downstream retailers, below which the bright side of supplier encroachment documented in the existing literature exists; that is, encroachment can benefit not only the encroaching supplier itself but also the retailers. However, when the number of downstream retailers exceeds this threshold value, the further intensified downstream competition dampens the effect of wholesale price reduction arising from supplier encroachment. Supplier encroachment becomes always detrimental to the retailer. Moreover, with the increasing number of retailers, the supplier may become worse off when being endowed with the option of downstream encroachment, even when the supplier does not actually execute this option. We further investigate the supplier&#39;s optimal market penetration strategy when it can enroll a new retailer or open a direct channel, or it is costly to establish the indirect channel. We show that the main results remain qualitatively unchanged when the two selling channels are imperfect substitutes or retailers are asymmetric.},

With a mean–variance problem formulation, we first derive the optimal hedging strategy, given the production quantities. This leads to an explicit objective function with which bounds on optimal production quantities are identified. Thus, optimization of the production policies can be readily solved numerically as a static minimization problem. This way, we are able to give a complete characterization of the mean–variance efficient frontier, and quantify the contribution of the hedging strategy by the variance reduction it achieves. Furthermore, the model and results are extended to allow dynamic production control that tracks the demand rates.},

  abstract     = {Female user (driver and rider) safety is a serious concern for ride‐hailing platforms. One way to address this concern is to migrate from the traditional “pooling” system that matches riders with drivers without considering gender to a “hybrid” system with a “female‐only” option. Will such a hybrid system result in a win‐win‐win outcome for all involved parties (riders, drivers, and the platform)? To answer this question, we investigate the performance of the two operational systems: a pooling system and a hybrid system. For each system, we analyze a two‐stage queueing game to determine the equilibrium “joining” and “participating” behavior of riders and drivers, and then derive the platform&#39;s optimal pricing and wage decisions. We posit a mismatch cost incurred by a safety‐concerned female user when she is matched with a male counterpart in a ride. By comparing the equilibrium outcomes associated with the pooling and the hybrid systems, we draw the following conclusions: when safety‐concerned female users’ mismatch cost is above a certain level, switching from a pooling system to a hybrid system can result in a win‐win outcome for safety‐concerned female users and the platform. However, male and safety‐unconcerned female users might be worse off due to this change in the system configuration. Our results also help us to rectify some of our intuitions about these two systems. One, in the pooling system, reducing the mismatch cost associated with safety‐concerned female drivers may not lead to more female riders joining the pooling system, even though it boosts the platform&#39;s profit in general. Two, in the hybrid system, it is not necessary for female riders to pay a higher price when they opt for female drivers instead of male drivers. We also relate our results to certain system configurations adopted by various ride‐hailing platforms to address female safety concerns in different countries.},

In particular, we address the joint design of incentives (via “crowd‐sourcing”) and spatial capacity allocations (enabled by “geo‐fencing”). From the platform&#39;s perspective, we formulate stylized models based on strategic double‐ended queues. We optimize the design and operations of such systems in a case study using a data set from a leading free‐float bicycle‐sharing system, and solve it via mixed‐integer second‐order conic programs (SOCPs). Both stylized results and computational studies generate insights about fundamental trade‐offs and triangular relationships among operational costs, capacity utilization rates and service levels. Interestingly, we identify the role of spatial capacity (parking) management to fine‐tune the market thickness (transient service availability) in such a two‐sided marketplace. We show that a “capacity‐dependent approximation” can be very close to optimality, and outperforms policies ignoring capacity management. We also demonstrate that this framework can be operationalized in multiple directions, which generates insights concerning matching efficiency, performance comparison between crowd‐sourcing and repositioning, strategic server behaviors and network externalities. Our insights guide the platform and the policy‐maker to embrace “crowd‐sourcing” and “geo‐fencing” technologies for shared‐mobility systems.},

  abstract     = {We present a new crossing number problem, which we refer to as the edge‐constrained weighted two‐layer crossing number problem (ECW2CN). The ECW2CN arises in layout planning of hose coupling stations at BASF, where the challenge is to find a crossing minimal assignment of tube‐connected units to given positions on two opposing layers. This allows the use of robots in an effort to reduce the probability of operational disruptions and to increase human safety. Physical limitations imply maximal length and maximal curvature conditions on the tubes as well as spatial constraints imposed by the surrounding walls. This is the major difference of ECW2CN to all known variants of the crossing number problem. Such as many variants of the crossing number problem, ECW2CN is NP ‐hard. Because the optimization model grows fast with respect to the input data, we face out‐of‐memory errors for the monolithic model. Therefore, we develop two solution methods. In the first method, we tailor Benders decomposition toward the problem. The Benders subproblems are solved analytically and the Benders master problem is strengthened by additional cuts. Furthermore, we combine this Benders decomposition with ideas borrowed from fix‐and‐relax heuristics to design the Dynamic Fix‐and‐Relax Pump (DFRP). Based on an initial solution, DFRP improves successively feasible points by solving dynamically sampled smaller problems with Benders decomposition. Because the optimization model is a surrogate model for its time‐dependent formulation, we evaluate the obtained solutions for different choices of the objective function via a simulation model. All algorithms are implemented efficiently using advanced features of the GuRoBi‐Python API, such as callback functions and lazy constraints. We present a case study for BASF using real data and make the real‐world data openly available.},

For various such diseases, the deployment of mobile screening teams forms an important instrument to reduce prevalence toward elimination targets. There is considerable variety in planning methods for the deployment of these mobile teams in practice, but little understanding of their effectiveness. Moreover, there appears to be little understanding of the relationship between the number of mobile teams and progress toward the goals. This research considers capacity planning and deployment of mobile screening teams for one such neglected tropical disease: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness). We prove that the deployment problem is strongly NP‐Hard and propose three approaches to find (near) optimal screening plans. For the purpose of practical implementation in remote rural areas, we also develop four simple policies. The performance of these methods and their robustness is benchmarked for a HAT region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Two of the four simple practical policies yield near optimal solutions, one of which also appears robust against parameter impreciseness. We also present a simple approximation of prevalence as a function of screening capacity, which appears rather accurate for the case study. While the results may serve to more effectively allocate funding and deploy mobile screening capacity, they also indicate that mobile screening may not suffice to achieve HAT elimination.},

  abstract     = {To address the food assistance crisis during the Covid pandemic, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) launched a multi‐billion dollar “Farmers to Families Food Box program” (Box program) by working with approved suppliers (or distributors) to purchase fresh produce, dairy, and meat directly from farmers and package them into boxes. Recognizing that food banks did not have spare capacity to support the Box program, how should these food boxes be distributed to people who are in need? The USDA developed a novel solution by asking: (a) suppliers to distribute food boxes directly to agencies (shelters, food pantries, and soup kitchens); and (b) food banks to serve as “virtual intermediaries” to coordinate supply and demand between suppliers and agencies. However, as food banks were overwhelmed with their regular operations for distributing donated food during the pandemic, the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank (LARFB) found it difficult to develop and deploy a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the Box program with limited manpower and expertise. In this study, we describe a DSS co‐developed by LARFB, Salesforce, and UCLA. Unlike other DSSs developed in normal circumstances, the development and deployment of the DSS were conducted virtually within 45 days. Without this DSS, it would have been impossible for LARFB to support the Box program. Because this DSS was developed in a record time, we discuss several limitations and suggest future research opportunities for managing food bank operations during a pandemic.},

Various factors contribute to the complexity of the problem, one of which is product‐machine mapping: Each machine may be qualified to produce multiple products and each product can be produced on multiple machines. To meet a build‐plan, the factory needs to not only determine a multi‐machine multi‐product production schedule that accounts for sequence‐dependent setup time, but also a qualification schedule which prescribes whether and when a machine should undergo a qualification process such that it is ready to produce a product. We consider processing characteristics including sequence‐dependent setups, job splitting, and machine eligibility in addition to qualification. We formulate the mathematical model as an MILP problem that minimizes the total weighted delay. In this study, we describe two heuristic solution approaches developed for this complex decision setting and the application at Intel. We compare our approach with Intel&#39;s current approach which is a spreadsheet‐based manual approach that relies on the experience of the factory planner. The results indicate that our approach, which we call the GS approach, dominates in terms of minimizing the delay. Our approach performs well when capacity is tight and additional qualifications are considered while the Intel approach may perform better on reducing the setup and qualification time in certain problem instances, particularly those with loose capacity. As a result, an integrated approach which selects the better solution from both approaches is proposed, which shows significant reduction over the current approach in both the weighted delay and the setup and qualification time.},

  abstract     = {Retailers are often short on capacity, so a logical assumption would be that retailers could improve their profits by acquiring more. In this study, we show that this is not necessarily true, because retailer&#39;s capacity has a strategic role in channel distribution. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple suppliers and a common retailer. Our analysis reveals that, first, when the retailer&#39;s capacity is limited, its suppliers will compete head‐to‐head for the retailer&#39;s capacity, thereby driving down the equilibrium wholesale prices. Second, when the number of suppliers is large, the retailer finds it optimal to limit its own capacity to induce fierce competition among the suppliers. The result also holds when the suppliers and the retailer are contracted through two‐part tariffs. Third, when capacity is scarce, the retailer prefers two‐part tariffs to wholesale prices, while the suppliers prefer wholesale prices to two‐part tariffs. This is because two‐part tariffs enhance the retailer&#39;s capacity allocation power, which is translated into retailer profit. Nonetheless, when suppliers can freely choose between two‐part tariffs and wholesale prices, they always choose two‐part tariffs, leading to a form of prisoner&#39;s dilemma. We also demonstrate the robustness of our findings by considering substitutable and complementary products, exclusive contracts, and positive capacity cost. Our results underscore the importance of considering the retailer&#39;s capacity in channel management.},

  abstract     = {Organizations routinely introduce hitherto‐unexplored interventions to improve their supply chains. Consider a principal (e.g., a firm) that implements a “seemingly helpful” intervention: For any fixed actions of the principal and the agents (e.g., consumers), the principal&#39;s payoff is higher in the presence of the intervention than in its absence. While one would expect such well‐intentioned interventions to benefit the principal, several papers within the operations management (OM) literature show that the principal&#39;s equilibrium payoff can be hurt, even ignoring the intervention&#39;s implementation cost. While this conclusion is often based on analyzing a single‐shot, simultaneous‐move game, repeated interactions can also serve as an appropriate environment in many cases. A fundamental question arises: Does this conclusion hold even under repeated interactions? We study this question using the framework of infinitely repeated games and the notion of a precommitment equilibrium from the literature on reputation in repeated games. We identify two key characteristics that determine whether a seemingly beneficial intervention helps, or can possibly hurt the firm: (i) nature of the intervention (ceteris paribus, does it induce agents to react in a manner favorable to the principal?), and (ii) extent of interaction (single shot at one extreme and infinitely repeated at the other). Interestingly, we demonstrate the following two possibilities using settings analyzed in the recent OM literature: seemingly beneficial interventions can (a) hurt the firm in a single‐shot analysis but benefit under repeated interactions, and (b) continue to hurt the firm under repeated interactions. We also obtain easy‐to‐interpret conditions under which the benefit of such interventions is guaranteed under repeated interactions.},

  abstract     = {We examine the impact of consumer search from the perspective of revenue‐maximizing optimal auction design. In this two‐sided market, advertisers are endowed with privately known qualities, and consumers incur heterogeneous search costs when clicking on advertisements displayed by the search engine. Our general approach eliminates ad hoc restrictions and therefore allows us to uncover the salient economic trade‐offs. We adopt the optimal mechanism design approach to examine this two‐sided private information problem. The optimal mechanism design approach gives rise to the truly revenue‐maximizing scheme, and yields managerial implications that are substantially different from the literature. We show that from the revenue maximization perspective, the search engine necessarily displays the advertisers in the descending order of their qualities. The search engine shall insert unnecessary hassles to induce the revenue‐maximizing search behaviors. Thus, each consumer stops searching pre‐maturely compared to the socially optimal search behavior. In addition, the search engine shall implement probabilistic forced termination upon consumers’ clicking on advertisements, and this probability is higher for advertisers with poorer qualities. When each advertiser has a two‐dimensional type on consumer learning and matching, even if consumers’ search costs become negligible, the allocative inefficiency does not vanish. Moreover, no strategic obfuscation is imposed. When allowing for non‐independent qualities, we show that product variety does not constitute a rationale for advertisers’ favoritism.},

  abstract     = {Agencies that provide relief to disaster survivors raise funds from diversified sources, such as foundations, private donors, and lenders. The output of a relief operation, such as lives saved, is a function of several factors: disaster intensity, relief agency&#39;s effectiveness, and the size of donor fund. In an uncertain funding environment with delays, a stop‐gap loan can help decrease deprivation at the onset of disaster. When funding materializes, surplus fund net of loan and interest facilitates a second relief operation. We analyze a multistage framework in a game‐theoretic context to study the decisions of the parties involved: relief agency (loan sought and effectiveness), lender (interest rate), and donor (funding level). We find that the size of loan increases in funding delay, even though the lender increases interest rate. The donor increases funding to ensure a larger fund availability (net of loan and interest). While the uncertainty in funding delay motivates the relief agency to seek a larger loan, we find that the maximum number of survivors receiving aid decreases. In case of logistics delays, we find that the speed of response decreases in disaster intensity, enabling a larger number of survivors to receive aid as the cost of logistics decreases. It also increases the loan size and donor funding. However, the relief agency fails to cover all survivors if the disaster intensity is large as the response speed does not decrease below a threshold.},

  abstract     = {We consider a surgical case scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the expected time span of the schedule subject to a prespecified upper bound on the expected waiting time for each patient. The problem is challenging due to its combinatorial and nonlinear nature, and we focus on developing approximate methods to solve the problem. Specifically, we study two approximation methods. In the certainty equivalent method, we approximate the expected time span of the cases by assuming that the waiting time of each surgical case is a deterministic value. In the variance bounding method, we approximate the expected time span based on upper bounds on the variance of the surgical case waiting times. We show that the certainty equivalent method leads to a lower bound on the optimal expected time span, while the variance bounding method leads to an upper bound. Both methods suggest a simple sequencing rule, which is to sort the surgical cases in the ascending order of the surgical duration variability. Based on the upper and lower bounds, we derive a closed‐form, distribution‐free relative error bound for our sequencing rule, and show that it is uniformly bounded with respect to the number of cases. We also conduct a case study based on real‐life data on hernia repair procedures at the Jewish General Hospital in Montréal, to demonstrate our analytical models and their potential benefits for improving surgical scheduling. Finally, we conclude the paper by mentioning a few future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain efficiency, especially for the pharmaceutical (pharma) supply chain due to its unique characteristics. However, limited data have prevented forecasters from pursuing advanced models. Such problems exist even when long history of demand data is available because historical data in the distant past may bring little value as market situation changes. In the meantime, demands are also affected by many hidden factors that again require a large amount of data and more sophisticated models to capture. We propose to overcome these challenges by a novel demand forecasting framework which “borrows” time series data from many other products (cross‐series training) and trains the data with advanced machine learning models (known for detecting patterns). We further improve performance of the cross‐series models through various “grouping&quot; schemes, and learning from non‐demand features such as downstream inventory data across different products, information of supply chain structure, and relevant domain knowledge. We test our proposed framework with many modeling possibilities on two large datasets from major pharma manufacturers and our results show superior performance. Our work also provides empirical evidence of the value of downstream inventory information in the context of demand forecasting. We conduct prior and post‐hoc field work to ensure the applicability of the proposed forecasting approach.},

To mitigate such uncertainty, crowdfunding platforms often allow campaign creators to post communicative messages—that is, campaign updates and creator comments—to dynamically disclose further information about the campaigns. In addition, previous funding transactions of ongoing campaigns are made publicly available, giving rise to herding among backers. In this research, we aim to understand how communicative messages and herding interactively shape the behavior of backers contributing to crowdfunding campaigns. Our results show that the frequency of communicative messages has a positive effect on backer contributions; however, it attenuates successors&#39; herding momentum toward predecessors, perhaps because the information disclosed in those messages lowers the informational value of previous funding transactions. To investigate the role of message contents, we extract topics addressed in update and comment messages using a Latent Dirichlet allocation model. The results reveal that distinct messages have different impacts on backers&#39; contribution and herding behavior, and such discrepancies are found to be topic specific. This study not only contributes to operations management literature on crowdfunding but also offers implications for campaign creators and platform managers.},

The success of this practice hinges on the ability to efficiently attract workers who produce quality work from among the crowd. We draw on the foundations of Self‐Determination Theory and the heuristic‐systematic model to examine the ways that variations in messages presented to crowdsourced agents can serve as a mechanism to enhance participation and associated performance outcomes. Data from a field experiment involving a retail inventory audit task reveal that messages appealing to the crowd&#39;s consumer identity, as opposed to crowdsourcing platform identification or firm identification, generally lead to superior performance outcomes, particularly shorter reservation time, higher task quality approval, and post‐task satisfaction. However, these effects are contingent on the valence of the message frame and the nature of the task. These findings shed light on elements critical to the successful utilization of this new type of crowdsourced “employment” in supply chain and operations tasks and suggest the careful crafting of crowdsourced task messages as a low‐cost way for managers to improve task performance outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of Americans and puts a significant burden on the healthcare system. The medical community sees screening patients to identify and treat prediabetes and diabetes early as an important goal; however, universal population screening is operationally not feasible, and screening policies need to take characteristics of the patient population into account. For instance, the screening policy for a population in an affluent neighborhood may differ from that of a safety‐net hospital. The problem of optimal diabetes screening—whom to screen and when to screen—is clearly important, and small improvements could have an enormous impact. However, the problem is typically only discussed from a practical viewpoint in the medical literature; a thorough theoretical framework from an operational viewpoint is largely missing. In this study, we propose an approach that builds on multiple methods—partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), hidden Markov model (HMM), and predictive risk modeling (PRM). It uses available clinical information, in the form of electronic health records (EHRs), on specific patient populations to derive an optimal policy, which is used to generate screening decisions, individualized for each patient. The POMDP model, used for determining optimal decisions, lies at the core of our approach. We use HMM to estimate the cohort‐specific progression of diabetes (i.e., transition probability matrix) and the emission matrix. We use PRM to generate observations—in the form of individualized risk scores—for the POMDP. Both HMM and PRM are learned from EHR data. Our approach is unique because (i) it introduces a novel way of incorporating predictive modeling into a formal decision framework to derive an optimal screening policy; and (ii) it is based on real clinical data. We fit our model using data on a cohort of more than 60,000 patients over 5 years from a large safety‐net health system and then demonstrate the model&#39;s utility by conducting a simulation study. The results indicate that our proposed screening policy outperforms existing guidelines widely used in clinical practice. Our estimates suggest that implementing our policy for the studied cohort would add one quality‐adjusted life year for every patient, and at a cost that is 35% lower, compared with existing guidelines. Our proposed framework is generalizable to other chronic diseases, such as cancer and HIV.},

  abstract     = {The content of climate change disclosures of large, global companies evolved from 2007 to 2016. Within that window, the same set of firms started measuring and disclosing their supply chain carbon emissions. Does carbon footprinting influence the nature and content of a firm&#39;s disclosure on the climate change risks that are expected to affect its business? We explore this question using more than 10,925 climate change disclosures collected by the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) from 2,003 firms worldwide. We use singular value decomposition and text similarity scores to quantitatively examine the content of the CDP disclosures from 2007 to 2016. Using fixed effects and dynamic panel models, we find that measuring supply chain carbon emissions (Scope 3) explains a substantial shift in the content and nature of the disclosures. We find no evidence that measuring and disclosing direct emissions (Scope 1) are associated with substantial changes in the content of the disclosures. One explanation for this is that most of the climate change‐related risks are in the supply chain, not within the company boundaries of large, global firms. Our results show the importance of encouraging firms to voluntarily measure their supply chain carbon emissions if they are not yet aware of their contribution and exposure to climate change. Our work shows that firms’ response to climate change is dynamic, and it may take a decade to detect these shifts.},

  abstract     = {Public health supply chains are channels through which health commodities are distributed among end clients. In developing countries, significant resource constraints hamper the effective and efficient delivery of health commodities, leading to supply chain failures such as “stock‐outs.” While the prevalence of commodity stock‐outs is well‐acknowledged, there is little by way of systematic and rigorous empirical research that sheds light on the factors that drive such stock‐outs in developing countries. The study documented in this article is anchored in the “logistics cycle” framework that is well‐accepted and widely adopted by organizations involved in managing public health supply chains. Using this framework, we empirically investigate how commodity range and a health facility&#39;s logistics management information system (LMIS) practices impact the likelihood of stock‐outs. We estimate our models using a novel field dataset spanning 4000 health facilities across five developing countries. Our results indicate that the likelihood of stock‐outs increases with an expansion in the range of health commodities offered through the public health supply chain. However, the detrimental impact of offering a wider range of health commodities is more severe in resource‐constrained rural facilities relative to their urban counterparts. Further, we find that urban facilities can significantly reduce the likelihood of stock‐outs by updating their LMIS records on a daily basis. However, in rural facilities, daily LMIS updating is beneficial only when used in conjunction with an electronic LMIS. Our findings have implications for resource allocation to reduce the risk of health commodity stock‐outs in developing countries.},

We confirm a causal relationship that explains the highly publicized auto industry non‐compliance phenomenon where on‐road NOx emissions exceeded standards. Based on a 15‐year on‐road vehicle emissions dataset covering 148,837 vehicles from 42 automakers in the EU, we use regression discontinuity to identify the causal impact of standards tightening on non‐compliance by controlling other confounding factors. Our results suggest that in the absence of effective monitoring, tightening standards directly drives up automakers’ non‐compliance. Furthermore, we find that automakers facing more intense substitution pressure from competitors or with less advanced emissions control technology have a higher non‐compliance rate. Our findings speak to both policymakers as well as managers in the private sector. When setting limit‐based performance goals in situations with conflicting interests and imperfect monitoring, they should anticipate non‐compliance from the regulated parties. Our results suggest that tightening standards in such situations should be accompanied by stricter monitoring or other actions that discourage non‐compliance.},

Using a reverse auction setting in which supplier competition is determined by number ( n ) of participating suppliers (bidders), we show how buyer&#39;s exposure to supplier non‐performance risk is influenced by n . In particular, we characterize conditions under which supplier non‐performance risk is increasing in n . We then formulate a buyer&#39;s decision on the optimal n for uniformly distributed costs that allows it to resolve its cost vs. risk trade‐off. We further investigate other strategies like dual sourcing, better screening, and lower threshold on acceptable bids, that the buyer can use, together with limiting n , to limit non‐performance risk and control its overall procurement cost. Managerially, our findings indicate that an OEM buyer procuring non‐strategic (non‐critical) components could increase its exposure to supplier non‐performance risk by leveraging too much competition, especially among small entrant suppliers. In such situations a buyer can manage its input cost and risk by limiting supplier competition.},

This is the first study to address this issue, using a multiple discrete choice model for horizontally differentiated goods. The authors argue that the dual impact of product line length is due to competing effects of the two constituent dimensions of product line structure: a positive effect of product line width (total number of product configurations offered) and a negative effect of average line depth (average number of SKUs per product configuration). They also examine the moderating role of choice diversification propensity manifested in multiple discreteness. An empirical application in the potato chip market confirms the expectations regarding the competing effects of the two product line dimensions and hence the dual impact of product line length. Furthermore, the negative effect of average line depth is found to be more pronounced for households with higher choice diversification propensity. These findings are not only novel but also meaningful since simulations show that the corresponding effects influence product line management decisions and new product design.},

  abstract     = {The goals of the guaranteed support price (GSP) scheme, adopted by several developing countries to support their farmers and the underprivileged population, are threefold: (a) as a supply‐side incentive, to ensure high output from the farmers, (b) as a demand‐side provisioning tool, to subsidize the consumption needs of the poor, and (c) to maintain an adequate amount of foodgrains as reserve stock, to mitigate the adverse effects of yield uncertainty (food security). We offer analytically supported insights on the fundamental aspects of this scheme by analyzing a Stackelberg game between a homogenous population of small farmers and a social planner. We model the strategic behavior of the farmers and the consuming population (Above‐ and Below‐Poverty‐Line consumers), and compare the equilibrium outcome with that under the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme, where the social planner simply distributes the budget among the BPL consumers. The comparison of the social planner&#39;s surplus depends on the marginal value from maintaining a reserve stock (i.e., the significance of food security). If this value is high, then the surplus under the GSP scheme strictly dominates that under DBT; otherwise, the surplus is identical. The comparison of the production by the farmers depends on two economic forces—the poorness of the BPL consumers and yield uncertainty. If the poorness is extreme, then the two schemes lead to identical production. If yield uncertainty is dominant, then DBT is ineffective in improving production while the GSP scheme can induce a strictly higher production by strategically choosing the reserve stock.},

This choice is not clear since better information may not be attainable, and if it is attainable, it may not improve operational decision‐making. In light of this dilemma, we collaborate with a multinational division of a Fortune 500 manufacturing firm to develop stochastic linear programming models that quantify the value of disruption duration information. Our models allow us to examine characteristics of the disrupted part that may be associated with the value of better information. We focus on characteristics that are knowable at the outset of the disruption, as those can help the firm decide whether to invest in collecting better information. Using our research partner&#39;s supply chain and production data, we find that the value of information can vary materially—from &lt; 1% to over 99% of the cost of the disruption, underscoring the value of identifying disruptions that are sensitive to information quality. To address this, we use the company&#39;s data to identify several part‐related characteristics that influence the value of disruption duration information. These findings can help managers to identify parts in their own supply chains whose impact in a disruption is sensitive to different levels of duration information, and allow them to make informed decisions on whether or not to gather better information when a disruption strikes.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the tension between accounting and financial functions of an OEM who manufactures and remanufactures capital‐intensive products. The OEM operates a servicizing business model in which it leases a product, remanufactures the product returned at the end of the lease, and re‐leases the remanufactured product ( usecycle ), with multiple such usecycles. The accounting function at the firm would suggest that the OEM: (i) recovers the initial manufacturing cost of the product over its useful life as prescribed by IRS guidelines via depreciation; (ii) remanufactures the product as long as its initial manufacturing cost is not fully recovered; and (iii) removes the product from the books immediately after it has completely depreciated. In contrast, the financial function would consider the initial manufacturing cost of the product to be a sunk cost and would suggest that the firm continues to remanufacture the product as long as the remanufacturing cost is lower than the cost of a new unit. In this study, we investigate and prescribe ways to resolve this tension using analytical models. Specifically, we first show that the optimal durations over which the product should be used and lease prices that maximize the OEM&#39;s accounting profit and financial profit are different. We then discuss two operational approaches to align the accounting and operational perspectives while following IRS guidelines. Finally, informed by this analysis, we develop policy prescriptions to promote remanufacturing of multiple usecycle products. Overall, this analysis highlights the role of regulatory guidelines on remanufacturing operations and the inter‐functional effort required by OEMs to successfully integrate remanufacturing operations in their business strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we consider a resource recovery planning problem under a public–private partnership. The local authority&#39;s problem is to determine the waste sorting scheme, and also a cost‐sharing budget, to minimize her expected payout, subject to a requirement of economic feasibility of the private operator. Given the budget and sorting scheme, the private operator&#39;s problem is to site and operate resource recovery facilities, and his goal is to maximize his expected total profits. A salient feature of the problem is that the feedstock condition (composition and volume) is uncertain, but can be influenced by the sorting‐at‐source scheme implemented. This feature drives the interactions of the public and private partners. We develop a bilevel resource recovery planning model in the framework of distributionally robust optimization, where a decision‐dependent ambiguity set is defined to model the influence of sorting schemes on the feedstock uncertainty. We perform the model analysis on the cost‐share ratio, which suggests the importance of sorting investment in achieving the sustainable resource recovery. Computationally, we show that the solutions of the bilevel problem can be obtained by solving one instance of a mixed‐integer linear program that does not induce any additional integer variable. Our proposed optimization framework provides a useful decision‐analysis tool for effectively utilizing and balancing the instruments of sorting and facility installation investments for resource recovery planning under feedstock ambiguity. For instance, the computational experiments with partial real data in the Singapore context justify several important insights: (i) the suitable sorting scheme implementation serves as a cost‐effective instrument that could significantly enhance the utility of the cost sharing; (ii) the sorting dependency of feedstock condition is critical in affecting the private operator&#39;s recovery performance; and (iii) the robust planning is effective in hedging against ambiguously poor feedstock condition. These findings should deserve attentions of both public and private sectors in current waste management practice.},

The orders of the retail branches to the headquarters arrive sequentially, and each allocation decision has to be made before the next order arrives. The objective of the headquarters is to maximize the overall firm profit, that is, the total profit of all the retail branches. Each retail branch makes ordering decision independently by using private information about its local market condition in order to maximize its own profit. Hence, they may strategically inflate their order quantities in their favor, potentially hurting the firm profit. We first discuss the importance of capacity rationing in maximizing the firm&#39;s profit by finding the first‐best allocation outcome, the optimal solution without information asymmetry. Based on this, we design mechanisms that effectively overcome the information asymmetry. First, we design a simple threshold‐type mechanism where truthful reporting is optimal and capacity rationing is implemented by limiting allocation beyond a pre‐specified threshold. We show this mechanism is optimal within the class of mechanisms that do not allow any side payments. We also design a mechanism with side payments that is optimal among all possible mechanisms. In particular, we show that this payment‐based mechanism achieves the first‐best allocation, fully overcoming information asymmetry. Although optimal, it may not be practical because of the complexity in the side payment menu, so we also propose a simple variant of it with only a few parameters. Our extensive numerical study shows that our simple threshold‐type and payment‐based mechanisms achieve near‐optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {The operations management literature has recently begun to analyze how novel data sources help practitioners better understand product demand. We extend this stream of research by analyzing how air quality, a prominent environmental factor that has received little attention in prior studies, can impact product demand. Specifically, we examine how air quality affects the demand for different product color options, and find a greater demand for blue‐color product option on air‐polluted days (vs. clear days). We attribute this pattern to compensatory consumption induced by need deprivation. Specifically, poor air quality deprives people of the visual experience of seeing a blue sky, leading them to seek compensation by acquiring blue‐color options. By analyzing a three‐year purchase‐related dataset from an online retailer (Study 1) and conducting a field experiment (Study 2) and two laboratory experiments (Studies 3 and 4), we establish the external validity, internal validity, and robustness of this finding. We also provide empirical support for deprived visual experience as the mechanism: The proposed effect is driven by air quality indicators that affect visibility (Study 1) and is mediated by experienced visibility (Study 3). We further identify a theoretically relevant individual difference variable as a moderator: prior experience with air pollution, which strengthens the proposed effect in the laboratory setting because prior experience enables people to “relive” the deprived visual experience more vividly (Study 4). Given the prevalence of air pollution across the globe, our research sheds light on how practitioners can improve their operational decisions by factoring in air quality.},

As a result, a startup not only seeks funding from its angel investor, but also strives to ensure that their expertise promotes entrepreneurial success. This study formalizes a model of optimal equity sharing with angel investors in light of the facts that (i) they have private information about their expertise, (ii) the expertise impacts the efficacy of subsequent operating decisions, and (iii) equity sharing alters control rights linked to these decisions. We demonstrate that an entrepreneur will exhibit seemingly excessive optimism in decision‐making when angel investors claim they bring high expertise (skills) to the table. This apparent optimism is not a sign of naiveté but rather an effective device to discipline boasting by angels. The results demonstrate the critical role of expertise and decision rights in constructing ownership‐sharing agreements with angel investors. They also demonstrate a case in which the private information of investors (rather than that of insiders) is important, and how such adverse selection concerns entail aggressive operational choices, rather than the typical response of caution, coupled with limited equity usage that accounts for not just the transfer of ownership, but also the transfer of decision rights.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in Information Technology have provided an opportunity to significantly improve the effectiveness of inventory systems. The use of in‐cycle demand information enables faster reaction to demand fluctuations. In particular, for the newsvendor (NV) system, we exploit the newly available data to perform an additional review (AR) of inventory at an endogenously determined, a priori set time during the sales period, and perform an additional replenishment if necessary. We implemented our innovative model at a market‐leading media group. The results of the initial pilot were dramatic, indicating that the proposed model achieves an increase of 4%–24% in profits compared to the policy before implementation. As a result, the company started following the proposed model for all their printed magazines and observed a significant reduction in operational costs. In a generalized setting, we provide a tractable search‐based optimization algorithm, based on the problem&#39;s structural properties, for determining the optimal initial quantity, AR timing, and quantity to restock at that time. Based on these theoretical results, we propose a simple heuristic that can be used for many practical situations including our implementation at Yedioth. Through a computational experiment, we show that our algorithm finds the optimal solution quickly and that the proposed heuristic performs well. We also provide additional insights into the problem—for instance, that our system exhibits properties similar to inventory pooling, provided that the demand rate is large enough.},

  abstract     = {Conventional wisdom suggests that by including a decoy product in the choice set for consumers, a firm can drive consumers to select more profitable non‐decoy products. Explanations offered to explain such outcomes are rooted in the psychology of consumer behavior. A scan of retail practice, however, indicates that decoys might also be included in a product assortment for economic reasons. For example, products with very low sales potential are often included in offerings by bricks‐and‐mortar and online retailers. This leads us to investigate and offer an alternative supply side explanation for the presence of decoy products in a supply chain. More specifically, we show that in a distribution channel with multiple asymmetric manufacturers and a single retailer, there exists the possibility of an equilibrium which includes a decoy product. Such an equilibrium is characterized by the retailer stocking positive quantities of products from a subset of low‐cost manufacturers (active manufacturers) and negligible or even zero stock of a decoy product sourced from a higher cost manufacturer. The retailer includes a decoy product in the assortment since it helps to obtain better contractual terms from the active manufacturers. Recognizing this, upstream active manufacturers not only compete for market share but are also induced to cooperate (in setting wholesale prices) so as to ensure that the manufacturer of the decoy product is driven out of the market. We also find that the degree of product substitutability moderates which manufacturer&#39;s product is a decoy. Our findings provide theoretical support for industry practice as well as implications for retail assortment decisions.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by dual sales channel operations in cross‐border e‐commerce, we analyze an e‐tailer&#39;s strategic waiting decision for channel disruption information in a global supply chain. The e‐tailer operates two sales channels: a bonded‐warehouse channel with products prestocked before channel disruption for demand fulfillment; and a direct‐shipping channel with products delivered directly from an overseas supplier. The direct‐shipping channel is exposed to disruption risk that might be caused by extreme weather events. Forecasts about the disruption are accurate, and the e‐tailer has the option of waiting for disruption forecasts and postponing order decisions in the bonded‐warehouse channel. We find that the e‐tailer is better off waiting if the direct‐shipping channel is either much more or much less important than the bonded‐warehouse channel. By waiting, the e‐tailer has the flexibility to adjust the stock in the bonded‐warehouse channel (depending on whether the direct‐shipping channel will be disrupted), enhancing channel coordination. However, anticipating the e‐tailer&#39;s improved channel coordination, the supplier might increase wholesale prices to extract more profits from the e‐tailer. If the direct‐shipping channel is highly important, waiting brings a significant benefit from channel coordination, offsetting the cost increase in the bonded‐warehouse channel. If the direct‐shipping channel is much less important, this channel provides the e‐tailer with leverage against the supplier in wholesale pricing; the e‐tailer waits strategically for sourcing cost reduction. This study emphasizes the role of strategic waiting for disruption information and signifies the importance of considering horizontal channel coordination and vertical interaction along supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Refurbishing of used products is increasingly being recognized as a value recovery strategy in sustainable operations. Hence, manufacturers, retailers, as well as third‐party firms, engage in refurbishing. Manufacturers, to some extent, can deter other players from refurbishing through various means such as product design, intellectual property, and restricting access to spare parts and diagnostic tools. While previous research has extensively examined the question of whether a manufacturer should allow an independent third‐party player to refurbish used products, the question of whether a manufacturer should allow his retailer to refurbish them, to our knowledge, remains unanswered. In this study, we examine whether a manufacturer should refurbish used products himself or allow his retailer to refurbish them. We compare two closed‐loop supply chain structures: Model‐M, where the manufacturer refurbishes used products; and Model‐R, where the retailer refurbishes. In a two‐period setting, new products are sold in both periods and some of the first‐period products are refurbishable in the second period. We show that when either (i) the refurbishability of used products is low and the attractiveness of refurbishing (value of the refurbished product as compared to the refurbishing cost) is either moderate or sufficiently high, or (ii) the refurbishability is high and the attractiveness of refurbishing is moderate, the manufacturer, despite forgoing profits and facing competition from refurbished products, is better off with letting the retailer refurbish used products (Model‐R) than with refurbishing them himself (Model‐M). Identifying a novel mechanism through which the manufacturer benefits in Model‐R is our key theoretical contribution to the closed‐loop supply chain literature. Moreover, we provide some useful and interesting insights to policymakers related to customer welfare and the environment. We also analyze the performances of these models (Model‐M and Model‐R) in terms of supply chain efficiency. In addition, we discuss how some of our key results change if a third‐party refurbisher coexists with the manufacturer and the retailer. Our results not only support some of the current policies and practices but also shed some light on their limitations and suggest some avenues for improvement.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturing servitization has become a major trend in industry that is implemented by so called integrated production and service systems (IPSSs) to offer not only products but also their associated services. In this study, we explore the capacity allocation policy for an IPSS that consists of a manufacturing facility and a service center. The IPSS serves two classes of customers, each demanding a specific product produced at the manufacturing facility and, subsequently, the associated service offered by the service center. We formulate this problem of resource allocation as a Markov decision process. Our analysis suggests that it is optimal to serve the customer with the larger cost saving rate and slower service rate, where the cost saving rate equals service rate times the sum of holding cost and waiting cost. Then we explore production control policies coupled with optimal service ones. We demonstrate that, with light service traffic, the system under the optimal production policy becomes similar to a make‐to‐stock system. Such a system can effectively hedge the system uncertainty. Therefore, the optimal production policy for the IPSS is also a hedging point policy. Under this policy, switching and idling curves split the state space into three regions: one without any production, the two others for production of two type products, respectively. We also discuss the optimal control policies of the two extensions of the IPSS (one with multiple types of product and customers, and the other with a single product and two classes of customers) and find that the characters of the optimal production and service policy still hold. Finally, we develop three heuristic integrated scheduling policies. Numerical experiments show that one is very effective.},

Since consumers who buy and use the product will learn its quality, the firm&#39;s early period price will endogenously determine the number of informed consumers in the later period. Without price commitment, the high‐quality firm prefers the pooling outcome in the first period, generating enough informed consumers to induce a separating equilibrium outcome in the second period where both types of firms serve only their respective first‐period buyers. By contrast, if firms can commit to future prices, the high‐quality firm can signal its quality by committing to an increasing price‐path, either a lower‐than‐first‐best price for the early period with a first‐best price for the later period or the first‐best early period price with a higher‐than‐first‐best future price. Price commitment will benefit the high‐quality firm by lowering its signaling cost and hurt the low‐quality firm by increasing its cost of mimicking the high‐quality firm. Interestingly, the firm&#39;s price commitment can either increase or decrease consumer surplus and social welfare. We show that a longer time horizon can allow the high‐quality firm to costlessly signal its quality by maintaining its high first‐best price for all periods.

However, their applications are significantly hindered by the difficulty of obtaining solutions. In this study, we introduce reducible MDPs whose exact solutions can be obtained by solving simpler MDPs, termed the coordinate MDPs . The value function and an optimal policy of a reducible MDP are linear functions of those of the associated coordinate MDP. Because the coordinate MDP does not involve the multi‐dimensional endogenous state, we achieve dimension reduction on a reducible MDP. Extending the MDP framework to multiple players, we introduce reducible stochastic games . We show that these games reduce to simpler coordinate games that do not involve the multi‐dimensional endogenous state. We specify sufficient conditions for the existence of a pure‐strategy Markov perfect equilibrium in reducible stochastic games and derive closed‐form expressions for the players’ equilibrium values. The reducible framework encompasses a variety of linear and nonlinear models and offers substantial simplification in analysis and computation. We provide guidelines and illustrative examples on formulating problems as reducible models. We demonstrate the applicability and modeling flexibility of reducible models in a wide range of contexts including capacity and inventory management and duopoly competition.},

The manufacturing capacity addition and technology development occurs in parallel, with preliminary results from a technology project&#39;s success providing valuable information to the manufacturer in adding capacity. We solve a stochastic dynamic program with Bayesian updates to obtain the manufacturer&#39;s expected profit‐maximizing capacity investment decision. Our model and applications are motivated by the Critical Materials Institute (CMI) (funded by the Department of Energy), which manages research projects focused on mitigating critical material constraints, vital to renewable energy technologies such as direct‐drive wind turbines, electric vehicles, and energy‐efficient lighting. We capture three unique aspects of the problem: first, the learning from project progress depends on task‐based stochastic outcomes and a project&#39;s percent‐done. Second, the underlying technology&#39;s profitability is based on a model of competition. Third, we evaluate the impact of progress across a portfolio of projects based on a manufacturer&#39;s capacity addition. We develop a heuristic that produces results that are close to optimal and can thus be used for large problem sizes. The managerial insights from an application of our model to CMI projects include: (i) technology projects that report the percent‐done of a project earlier increase expected manufacturer profit; (ii) careful choice of “safe bets,” that is, technologies with low profitability but a high probability of success, can increase expected manufacturer profit; (iii) a portfolio of projects can increase profits significantly over separate project evaluation; and (iv) dynamic management of project resources can increase overall profit.},

  abstract     = {Applications of government subsidies to speed up consumer trade‐ins of used products can be commonly observed in practice. This study investigates the design of such trade‐in subsidy programs and aims to provide implementable insights for practice. In particular, we focus on two open problems in the literature, (i) how to optimally allocate the subsidy budget among the multiple products covered by the trade‐in program, and (ii) how to most effectively utilize the assigned budget to incentivize consumer trade‐ins for each product. We develop a three‐stage Stackelberg game model that captures the essence of the interaction between the government&#39;s subsidy decision, the manufacturer&#39;s trade‐in rebate decision, and the consumer&#39;s product replacement decision. We show that a sharing subsidy scheme under which the government subsidy is proportional to the manufacturer&#39;s rebate is more effective in encouraging consumer trade‐ins than fixed‐amount subsidies. Moreover, a product with a higher environmental impact, a larger market size, a longer lifespan, or a lower value to consumers typically demands a larger subsidy budget allocation. We further use our results to derive a simple proportional budget allocation rule that can provide robust and near‐optimal performance. We illustrate our results by a case study based on the “old‐for‐new&quot; program in China that subsidizes home appliance trade‐ins. Our results indicate that policy makers should pay attention to the correlation between government subsidies and manufacturer&#39;s rebate as well as key product and market characteristics when designing a subsidy scheme for trade‐in programs.},

  abstract     = {The development of e‐commerce has greatly facilitated the practice that suppliers encroach upon the retail realm of downstream retailers through direct channels (e.g., online stores). The literature in this area has investigated profit‐maximizing firms, but the role of other organizational structures is not well understood. This study studies supplier encroachment in which the retailer is a dual‐purpose corporation that pursues his own profit as well as consumer surplus. We find that the retailer&#39;s pursuit of consumer surplus can not only intensify market competition and thus reducing the margin of direct selling, but also motivate the encroaching supplier to set a higher wholesale price compared with the case of no encroachment. The presence of a dual‐purpose retailer reduces the effectiveness of using the wholesale price as a lever by the supplier. Therefore, encroaching upon a dual‐purpose retailer can hurt the supplier. We examine whether a retailer can benefit from being a dual‐purpose corporation and how the retailer&#39;s dual objectives affect consumer surplus. Interestingly, a dual‐purpose retailer can earn a higher profit than a for‐profit retailer as the dual‐purpose structure helps deter encroachment (i.e., doing well by doing good). Also, consumer surplus in the case of a dual‐purpose retailer can be lower than that with a for‐profit retailer. This is because the commitment to be a dual‐purpose retailer reduces supplier encroachment and thus reduces the total quantity sold to consumers.},

  abstract     = {Identifying an efficient and fair allocation of limited donated hearts to patients on the waiting list is one of the top priorities in heart transplantation management. The recent heart allocation rule by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has emphasized medical urgency to address the heart transplant crisis by further dividing the previous sickest patient group into three subgroups. However, there is a significant debate on optimality and fairness of this policy because although it can help reduce pre‐transplant mortality, it may reduce post‐transplant survival. We undertake a rigorous study to address this debate by measuring the impacts of a variety of perspectives on the waiting list and patients. We show that the optimal policy of our proposed fluid model is a dynamic priority rule, and provide insight on the impact of fairness constraints on such priorities. We quantify the price that the society pays for following a medical urgency approach, which favors the sickest patients, compared to a utilitarian approach, which seeks to maximize total quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs). Our results, produced by a validated simulation model, reveal that the said price is 7.7% of total QALYs and increases to 11% by considering a broader regional sharing aligned with four‐hour heart cold ischemic time. We study other relevant objectives/measures in transplantation and our results show that the utilitarian policy outperforms the medical urgency policy in other measures as well. Our analysis provides novel insights on optimal patient allocation and sheds light on the debate around this challenging problem.},

  abstract     = {Although spam email messages have been the primary source of cybercrime since the early Internet era, there is no quick fix to this problem. Governments have established anti‐spam legislation, but surprisingly, there has been no measurement of policy impact. This study aims to fill the gap by utilizing a quasi‐experimental setting in South Korea, where the anti‐spam policy was substantially amended in November 2014. A significant change was in the default setting, switching from an opt‐out to an opt‐in scheme, which required that commercial email senders obtain recipients&#39; prior consent. Also, the law notably escalated the deterrent penalties for perpetrators. To empirically examine the policy effectiveness, we use a large‐scale data set of 5.61 billion spam emails originating from over 38,000 spammers in 226 countries during twenty months in 2014–2015. Our findings suggest that the amended policy adopting the opt‐in scheme decreased the volume of spam originating from Korea by 16.1%. The expected economic gain from the increased productivity of recipients is 7.649 million USD per year. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting that a well‐designed policy can lower cybersecurity incidents that threaten organizations, operations, and individuals. Our finding also provides important implications for policymakers and managers in designing effective policies with data‐driven evidence.},

  abstract     = {We study a generalized operating room planning and scheduling (GORPS) problem at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) in Ontario, Canada. GORPS allocates elective patients and resources (i.e., operating rooms, surgeons, anesthetists) to days, assigns resources to patients, and sequences patients in each day. We consider patients’ due‐date, resource eligibility, heterogeneous performances of resources, downstream unit requirements, and lag times between resources. The goal is to create a weekly surgery schedule that minimizes fixed‐ and over‐time costs. We model GORPS using mixed‐integer and constraint programming models. To efficiently and effectively solve these models, we develop new‘ multi‐featured logic‐based Benders decomposition approaches. Using data from TGH, we demonstrate that our best algorithm solves GORPS with an average optimality gap of 2.71% which allows us to provide our practical recommendations. First , we can increase daily OR utilization to reach 80%—25% higher than the status quo in TGH. Second , we do not require to optimize for the daily selection of anesthetists—this finding allows for the development of effective dominance rules that significantly mitigate intractability. Third , solving GORPS without downstream capacities (like many papers in literature) makes GORPS easier to solve, but such OR schedules are only feasible in 24% of instances. Finally , with existing ORs’ safety capacities, TGH can manage 40% increase in its surgical volumes. We provide recommendations on how TGH must adjust its downstream capacities for varying levels of surgical volume increases (e.g., current urgent need for more capacity due to the current Covid‐19 pandemic).},

Specifically, we focused on the behavior of customers who underestimate or overestimate their past electricity usage compared to their actual consumption. We merged daily energy consumption with a pre‐experiment survey for the customers. We found that goal‐setting and feedback mechanisms have a markedly different impact on each type of misperception. Underestimating customers reduced energy consumption only under the “goal‐setting with feedback&quot; treatment. Conversely, overestimating customers reduced energy consumption even under the “goal‐setting without feedback&quot; condition. The underlying mechanism is suggested as updating biased beliefs toward goal achievement. Overall, the results demonstrate that personalized nudges lead to heterogeneous behavioral responses and that service providers and policymakers can use these signals to enrich their planning of behavioral nudges.},

In collaboration with a large online P2P lending platform, we conduct a randomized field experiment to investigate the effect of social notifications targeted at different contact groups (core‐circle and peripheral‐circle groups). Our results indicate that notifying social contacts of a delinquent regarding the overdue payment significantly improves the repayment rate. Compared with the control group in which no notification messages are sent to social contacts, notification‐triggered social sanctions and social support reduce the default rate by more than 50% in both core‐circle and peripheral‐circle groups. Furthermore, we find that social notifications targeted at peripheral‐circle social contacts are only effective in the short term, and its effectiveness decreases with repeated use.

Categorizing offline stores by assortment and price, we find that the entry of regular‐price narrow‐assortment stores generates a complementary effect that increases online purchases, while the entry of discount wide‐assortment stores leads to a substitution effect that reduces online purchases. The store entry of other types has no significant effect on online purchases. We further find that the complementary effect is mainly driven by the mechanism of unsatisfied product exploration due to a narrow assortment in stores, rather than the mechanism of product uncertainty reduction due to overlapping products with lower prices online. Therefore, the complementary effect not only increases the online purchases of store‐brand products but also creates spillovers to other brands. Moreover, the substitution effect driven by the reduced transportation cost is mitigated primarily by consumers’ proximity to pre‐existing stores.},

The drivers are independent workers who share a part of their revenue with the principal, who owns the platform. While drivers have flexible schedules, the fairness of labor contracts and control exercised by the principal have come into question lately. Suggested options include treating the drivers as employees and/or safeguarding a minimum income for them. We study a rideshare platform with blended driver capacity: full time employees with a fixed wage rate, and independent drivers who are paid a share of revenue. We examine a scenario where the principal establishes the number of employee drivers, revenue sharing, and a base price for the platform; and the independent drivers then determine whether to join the platform. We identify economic equilibrium for two different demand rationing strategies: preference for employee drivers, and equal opportunity for all drivers (driver‐agnostic). We find that a blended platform capacity becomes viable if the wage rate is moderate, pool of independent drivers is large, and the ride‐seeker market is large. We show that the unpredictability of driver&#39;s reservation value motivates the principal to hire more employee drivers and to increase the base price. Our result that a driver‐agnostic demand rationing causes fewer independent drivers to join the platform is somewhat counterintuitive and is explained by how revenue sharing affects demand rationing. We find that the ride seekers prefer preferential demand rationing over driver‐agnostic rationing.},

As such, understanding how firms respond to such crises is of significant interest to firm stakeholders, such as investors, customers, regulators, NGOs, employees, and local communities. In this study, we examine whether publicly disclosed SP accidents cause firms to alter their approach to environmental management, as expressed by the adoption of environmental management practices (EMPs). Using a unique panel data from 2002 to 2013, representing over 400 publicly traded US manufacturing firms, we find that in the absence of a SP accident, firms adopt more EMPs each year. However, when firms experience a SP accident they respond in surprising ways: while sustainability leading firms do not alter their existing approach to EMP adoption, regardless of the severity of the accident, all other firms do. Firms which are not sustainability leaders escalate the number of EMPs they adopt after low severity accidents and de‐escalate the number of EMPs they adopt after high severity accidents. We also find that de‐escalation can last for up to 3 years and firms do not seem to recover from de‐escalation in future years. Finally, incurring more accidents or more severe accidents leads to greater de‐escalation. Given that the number of EMPs firms adopt determines a firm&#39;s environmental performance, de‐escalation can have significant negative consequences for both the natural environment and firms themselves.},

To illustrate the potential usefulness of our model, we provide an analysis of the system of twenty‐two German banks.

  abstract     = {Hotel franchising presents a unique network context for investigating inter‐organizational collaboration. Franchisees and franchisors must collaborate closely but face incompatible incentives in allocating financial and human resources to invest in three types of operations: centralized, network‐level operations run by the franchisor; distributed, outlet‐level operations managed by franchisees; and coordinated operations, which use franchisee and franchisor inputs. This study employs a mixed‐methods design to empirically examine the effects of these three types of investments on outlet‐level performance while considering franchisees&#39; dependence on the franchisor for sales. To ground our understanding of the phenomenon, we interview US hotel industry experts, then test the conceptual model with a panel data set of 3500 franchised US hotel properties. We find that franchisee dependence moderates the impact of all three types of investments. Specifically, a high‐dependence franchisee&#39;s centralized investments and coordinated investments, and a low‐dependence franchisee&#39;s distributed investments are associated with higher levels of outlet performance. We discuss how structural embeddedness drives these effects and explore its implications for service supply chain design and collaborative operations management.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by “company+farmer” farming operations of Wens, New Hope Liuhe, and Huiren, this study formalizes the impact of production‐management and resource‐providing types of contract farming, in which the buying firm commits to an ex ante procurement price and promises to buy the high‐value agricultural product (HVA) from contract farmers. We analyze the buyer&#39;s cost reduction effort and its impact on farmer participation to characterize the effect of contract farming on the agricultural product supply and all stakeholders. Additionally, we explore the impact of the HVA&#39;s production cost. We analytically show that all contract and non‐contract farmers are better off after an introduction of contract farming for HVA. Hence, contract farming can improve the farmers’ income and alleviate poverty. However, if HVA is costly to produce, there will be an inequality‐widening type of contract farming in which contract farmers are more efficient than non‐contract farmers, and the income disparity among farmers will widen. Otherwise, there will be an inequality‐reducing type in which contract farmers are less efficient than non‐contract farmers such that the income disparity among farmers will decrease. More importantly, the buyer benefits from a lower HVA&#39;s production cost, but this can hurt all contract and non‐contract farmers for a given equilibrium type. Moreover, reducing the HVA&#39;s production cost can increase the supply of a substitutable traditional product along with the switch of equilibrium from the inequality‐widening type to the inequality‐reducing one.},

  abstract     = {We study a dynamic pricing problem where the observed cost in each selling period varies from period to period, and the demand function is unknown and only depends on the price. The decision maker needs to select a price from a menu of K prices in each period to maximize the expected cumulative profit. Motivated by the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm for the multi‐armed bandit problem, we propose a UCB‐Like policy to select the price. When the cost is a continuous random variable, as the cost varies, the profit of the optimal price can be arbitrarily close to that of the second‐best price, making it very difficult to make the correct decision. In this situation, we show that the expected cumulative regret of our policy grows in the order of (log T ) 2 , where T is the number of selling periods. When the cost takes discrete values from a finite set and all prices are optimal for some costs, we show that the expected cumulative regret is upper bounded by a constant for any T . This result suggests that in this situation, the suboptimal price will only be selected in a finite number of periods, and the trade‐off between earning and learning vanishes and learning is no longer necessary beyond a certain period.},

In this study, we seek to quantify the effects of online–offline service integration on the e‐healthcare providers’ demand and reputational outcomes, noting that it is not altogether clear how the service integration function will affect the providers who adopt such a function in e‐healthcare platforms. Leveraging a quasi‐natural experiment on an e‐healthcare platform, we conducted difference‐in‐differences analyses in tandem with a variety of matching strategies, including propensity score matching and look‐ahead propensity score matching. Furthermore, we explored the moderating roles of provider‐specific characteristics. Our results reveal a set of robust and interesting findings: (i) e‐healthcare providers, on average, experience increases in online demand and decreases in offline demand post online–offline service integration; (ii) the service integration function also improves the professional reputation of participating providers; (iii) the impact of channel integration on the outcomes is weaker for providers with lower (vs. higher) professional titles; and (iv) the providers who specialize in treating chronic (vs. acute) diseases experience greater increases in online demand and reputational outcomes, yet insignificant changes in offline demand. This work contributes to related prior literatures on healthcare operations management, e‐healthcare, and online–offline channel integration, offering design implications for the service operations of e‐healthcare platforms.},

  abstract     = {Studies show that merchants are heterogeneous in profitability from offering promotions on third‐party‐online‐promotion marketplaces who often charge a single commission rate. Using a data analytics system, a marketplace can classify merchants according to their heterogeneous characteristics and offer merchant‐type specific commission rates. In this study, we construct a game‐theoretic model consisting a marketplace with two types of merchants who have heterogeneous proportion of consumers who are informed about their offering. The types are merchants’ private information, but the marketplace can invest in data analytics capability to classify merchants as per their types with a probability. We study a signal‐based strategy, where the marketplace invests in data analytics capability and offers a specific commission rate to individual merchant based on the merchant‐type classification and compare it with a single‐rate strategy of offering one commission rate to all merchants. We show that the relative strength and weakness of the signal‐based strategy depend on the merchant type distribution and the investment cost of improving the classification accuracy rate. Interestingly, the marketplace can be better off with the single‐rate strategy when a merchant type dominates the market. Moreover, we show that the signal‐based strategy, can lead to an increase in profit for merchants and an increase in consumer surplus. This is so because the marketplace’s signal‐based strategy has a cascade effect on consumers through the merchant’s optimal discount rate strategy. We conclude by identifying the conditions for a win–win–win situation wherein investment in data analytics capabilities by the marketplace also benefits merchants and consumers.},

  abstract     = {Fairness is a natural concern when model‐based decisions affect human beings. In personnel‐management decisions, employees’ perceptions of fairness depend both upon the decision processes as well as the resulting outcomes. Acting as a key part of decision processes, operational models often emphasize equality, or sameness, of outcomes among individuals. Fair outcomes, as a manifestation of distributive justice, involve balancing two competing aspects: equality and equity. Equity, in opposition to equality, is concerned with an individual’s outcomes being commensurate with their inputs. While both aspects of distributive justice can be an expectation of members of an organization, they present an inherent trade‐off; more of one requires less of the other. In order to balance the trade‐off between equity and equality, we propose a bi‐objective, non‐linear optimization model, which is then extended to a mixed‐integer formulation in a service‐oriented case study. Specifically, the case study model allocates physicians’ contracted clinical time across multiple emergency department locations. Deviations from physicians’ equity‐weighted preferences for where they work are minimized and a Pareto frontier of objectively fair solutions is derived. As a result, the time physicians were allocated to locations they did not prefer was substantially reduced. In addition, pre‐ and post‐implementation surveys revealed statistically significant improvements in employee reported perceptions of fairness, transparency, and overall satisfaction with the work‐time‐allocation process. The evidence supports the conclusion that decision models designed to result in unequal outcomes can still be perceived as fair by the employees they affect.},

In particular, we focus on the use of green labels that specify time slots as environmentally friendly and that intrinsically motivate customers to choose a specific delivery time slot in lieu of price incentives based on extrinsic motivation. We argue that this is important since green labels’ intrinsic nature affects costumer choice in fundamentally different ways than price incentives. We conduct two experiments and two simulation studies to study the effects of using green labels. Our experimental findings suggest that: (i) green labels are an effective tool to steer shoppers toward a certain delivery option, (ii) green labels are more effective for people who are more eco‐conscious, (iii) green labels remain effective in the presence of price incentives, while price incentives offer little added value beyond that of just green labels, and (iv) the effectiveness of green labels vs. price discounts remains high when time slots are less appealing (i.e., longer). Our simulation findings suggest that green slots, compared to price incentives or no incentives, offer providers a way to effectively steer consumer time slot choices to yield shorter routes, fewer delivery vehicles used, and more per‐customer revenue. We thus conclude that steering individuals to select delivery time slots through intrinsic motivation via green labels may be a promising, no‐cost direction for (online) retailers and an important topic for further research.},

  abstract     = {Bundling strategies have been widely adopted by online retail platforms that use agency selling, where suppliers pay a commission fee to the platform to gain access and sell directly to consumers. We study the optimal bundling strategy for a retail platform through which two independent suppliers distribute their products. The suppliers first set their product prices, and, subsequently, the platform decides whether to offer the two products as a bundle and, if so, the price of the bundled product. By analyzing a two‐stage Stackelberg game, we find that the platform adopts the bundling strategy only when the commission rate and the product prices are sufficiently high. The existence of the bundling option does not affect the suppliers’ optimal pricing decisions if the product costs are either above a high threshold or below a low threshold. However, the suppliers may strategically raise the retail prices to induce the platform to offer bundled products when the marginal costs are in the medium range. The strategic interaction between the platform and suppliers leads to interesting insights into the bundling problem. For example, the retail platform may not prefer a high commission rate (i.e., a greater bargaining power) if the platform has the option to provide the bundled product. Additionally, the platform having even the possibility of bundling may hurt the platform&#39;s profit, but it always benefits the suppliers.},

  abstract     = {In laboratory experiments, we compare the performance of short‐term and long‐term contracts in a two‐period supplier–buyer dyad with asymmetric cost information. We find that buyers tend to reject offers if the payoff inequality increases from one period to the next. We coin this dynamic form of inequity aversion as “ratcheting aversion.” We show that under short‐term contracting, the buyer&#39;s ratcheting aversion limits the supplier&#39;s leeway to exploit information revelation in earlier periods because suppliers fear contract rejections in later periods. As a result, the suppliers&#39; empirical benefit of offering long‐term contracts over short‐term contracts is significantly larger than theory predicts. Furthermore, long‐term contracts enable supply chain partners to achieve less volatile supply chain performance than short‐term contracts because the buyers&#39; ratcheting aversion leads to more contract rejections under short‐term contracting. While normative theory predicts that suppliers should include all future informational rents of the buyers in the first‐period offer, thereby creating large payoff differences between periods, we show that it can be behaviorally optimal for the supplier to make offers that lead to more equitable payoffs between periods.},

  abstract     = {Research suggests that increased reliance on digital sources (e.g., blogs, social media, online forums) exhibited by the emerging millennial workforce may affect procurement decisions. These arguments contend with studies which indicate that organizational buyers rely on decision shortcuts (e.g., brand, loyalty, and peer opinions) to mitigate risk or to simplify purchase decisions. One can argue that buyers gain more information from digital sources, which may attenuate the role of these shortcuts. At the same time, digital sources may be used to strengthen prior beliefs, which can increase bias toward decision proxies. This study draws from information processing theory to understand the role of digital sources of information in decision‐making, in the context of business purchasing. Based on the Accessibility‐Diagnosticity framework, we introduce a Digital Embeddedness construct to conceptualize the extent to which information from digital sources is integral to an individual’s decision‐making. Analysis of survey responses from 196 purchasing managers suggests that more digitally embedded buyers are more willing to adopt innovations, yet interestingly, focus more on vendors from strong brands and peer opinions. We also find that while more digitally embedded buyers feel more cognitively attached to their existing vendors, this attachment does not translate into purchase loyalty. We discuss implications for buyer‐supplier relations and B2B marketing. By elucidating individual‐level differences in the use of digital sources, this research also has implications for future work that examines the interpretation of digital information to inform business decisions.},

  abstract     = {We consider the classical appointment scheduling problem that does not have a session length constraint. The decision is to determine job allowances to minimize total expected weighted costs of waiting times of jobs and idle times of the service provider. In particular, we study a simple yet effective scheduling policy—the so‐called “constant&quot; policy, which allocates a constant job allowance for each appointment. Prior studies on appointment scheduling suggest a “dome”‐shaped structure for the optimal job allowance over the planning horizon. This implies that job allowance does not vary significantly in the middle of the schedule sequence, but varies at the beginning as well as the end of the optimal schedule. We show that an even simple scheduling policy—the constant policy, is asymptotically optimal thus provide theoretical justification for such a widely used policy. Using a dynamic programming formulation, we express each job&#39;s waiting time as the maximum of a random walk, which allows us to bound the performance gap between the constant policy and the optimal schedule based on classical results on D / G /1 queues. We derive an explicit upper bound for the performance gap when either of the following conditions holds: (i) the server idling cost is relatively small compared to the job waiting cost, and (ii) the number of appointments is sufficiently large. We also extend this result to a more general setting with multiple service types. Numerical experiments show that the constant policy is near optimal even when the number of appointments is small or when the server idling cost is moderately large, which complements our theoretical results. Our result provides a justification and strong support for the constant policy under certain mild conditions. Moreover, with minor modifications, the constant policy can be adapted to more general scenarios with patient no‐shows, or with heterogeneous appointment types.},

  abstract     = {Conceptualized as a meta‐construct , operations‐related structural flux (ORSF) refers to appointments and exits—voluntary or involuntary—of operations‐related executives, to and from the firm. This research leverages the contingency theory perspective to show that ORSF’s influence on firm performance is contingent on contextual circumstances of such executive changes, specifically, appointments and exits—voluntary or involuntary. Examining executive turnover data from North American public firms between 2000 and 2016, the authors find that the firm‐level context of operations executives’ turnover is consequential for firm performance. On average, operations appointments are adaptive, but operations exits, including those due to both voluntary and involuntary reasons, disrupt firm performance. However, parallel effects are not evident for marketing‐ and finance‐related appointments and exits. Furthermore, our study reveals that exit of one operations executive hurts firm performance (measured in terms of Tobin’s q) by 3.3%. A post‐hoc analysis finds that firm performance of the sample firms that witness involuntary operations‐related exits (IVOpE)is, on average, 9.2% lower than that of the sample firms that do not witness IVOpE. These results indicate the outsized influence of operations‐related executives, who collectively are generally responsible for much of a firm’s budget, workforce, resources, structures, and capabilities.},

Multiple factors—regulation, natural gas prices, renewable energy adoption, and environmental activism—have each been lauded by various stakeholders for this trend. To improve our understanding of this environmental technology transition, it is important to determine the extent to which each of these factors has accelerated coal unit retirements. We do so in this study through an accelerated failure time model that utilizes data on US coal‐fired generating units from 2008 through 2016. Our findings indicate that environmental regulation, reduced natural gas price volatility, increased utilization of renewable capacity, and the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign have all accelerated coal unit retirements. We do not, however, find evidence that natural gas price levels or the penetration of renewable capacity have accelerated coal unit retirements. Among the significant drivers, we estimate that the Beyond Coal campaign has had the greatest effect per unit, reducing expected operating life by an average of 24.4 months. However, among these factors, federal regulation affected the greatest number of coal units, and thus had the greatest aggregate impact on coal retirements. In post hoc analysis, we estimate that 40% of the generation that had been provided by retired coal‐fired units spilled over to surviving coal‐fired units. However, we estimate the 60% that was displaced from the coal fleet resulted in a 103.6 to 178.2 million metric ton net reduction in CO 2 emissions each year.},

We study the problem of how to select and sequence a group of quiz questions so as to optimize the quality of customer segmentation. We assume that the customer will sequentially scan the list of questions. After reading a question, the customer makes two, possibly correlated, random decisions: (i) she first decides whether to answer this question or not, and then (ii) decides whether to continue reading the next question or not. We further assume that the utility of questions that have been answered can be captured by a monotone and submodular function. In general, our problem falls into the category of non‐adaptive active learning‐based customer profiling. Note that under our model, the probability of a question being answered depends on the location of that question, as well as the set of other questions placed ahead of that question, this makes our problem fundamentally different from existing studies on submodular optimization. We develop a series of question selection and sequencing strategies with provable performance bound. Although we focus on the application of quiz design in this study, our results apply to a broad range of applications, including assortment optimization with position bias effect.},

In this model, there is a universe of products and customers arrive at each product with a certain probability. If the arrived product is unavailable, then the seller can recommend a subset of available products and the customer will purchase one of the recommended products or choose not to purchase with certain transition probabilities. The distinguishing features of the model are that the seller can control which products to recommend depending on the arrived product, and each customer either purchases a product or leaves the market after one transition. We study the assortment optimization problem under this model. Particularly, we show that it is NP‐Hard even if the customer can transition from each product to at most two products. Despite the computational complexity, we provide polynomial time algorithms or approximation algorithms for several special cases, such as when the customer can only transition from each product to at most a given number of products and the size of each recommended set is bounded. Our approximation algorithms are developed by invoking the submodularity arguments, or connecting the problem with maximum constraint satisfaction problem and applying randomized rounding techniques to its semidefinite programming relaxation. We also provide a tight worst‐case performance bound for revenue‐ordered assortments. In addition, we propose a compact mixed‐integer program formulation, which is efficient for moderate size problems. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The smallholder farmer sells agricultural products through the intermediary platform but lacks financial resources for planting. In addition to traditional bank financing (provided by a bank), the creditworthy intermediary platform can provide loans directly to the farmer (known as direct financing ) or serve as a guarantor if the farmer&#39;s creditworthiness is insufficient to access bank loans (known as guarantor financing ). We show that under guarantor and direct financing, the smallholder farmer&#39;s production level can be even higher than that in a centralized system. The farmer prefers direct financing when the production cost is low but the unit commission fee is sufficiently high. Otherwise, he prefers guarantor financing. The intermediary platform will encourage the farmer to resort to bank financing when the farmer&#39;s production cost is sufficiently high and the commission fee is low. Otherwise, it will provide direct financing. Guarantor financing makes the platform weakly worse off than direct financing and will be adopted only when the platform is also capital‐constrained. The involvement of the intermediary platform significantly improves the welfare of the farmer and the total profit of the supply chain. Moreover, the increased concern for social responsibility of the intermediary platform can lead to a win‐win‐win outcome for the farmer, the platform, and the whole supply chain.},

Designing data center networks properly is imperative for Internet‐related service and cloud computing providers to gain competitive edges through cost efficiency and service quality. In this study, we formulate a mathematical programming model to address the data center network design problem, in which the objective is to minimize total operating cost and the service delay penalty by optimizing data center location, footprint allocation, and resource provisioning decisions, while incorporating essential features, such as latency, power, multiple resources, configuration limits, and interdependent footprints. We employ a queueing model to approximate the service latency and provide tractable reformulations. To enhance computational efficiency for large‐scale problems, we further develop Lagrangian relaxation methods and generate strengthening cuts by exploiting the structural properties of the problem. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed model, which jointly optimizes location, allocation, and resource provisioning, can achieve significant cost reductions and improvements in service quality compared with a hierarchical approach that optimizes these decisions sequentially. Moreover, our proposed solution methods outperform state‐of‐the‐art commercial software in terms of computational efficiency. Based on real‐world datasets, the proposed model selects data centers that have been chosen by major cloud computing infrastructure providers.

This inferential emphasis is most obvious in the common practice of using statistical tests (e.g., the Hausman test) to choose between fixed‐ and random‐effects specifications, often ignoring the assumptions underpinning these tests. For instance, the Hausman test depends on the true within‐panel (longitudinal) and between‐panel (cross‐sectional) parameters being equal. This assumption is often not justified, because longitudinal and cross‐sectional variances and covariances may manifest different underpinning mechanisms. In addition to different mechanisms often resulting in different variables determining within and between effects, within and between variables may also have different meanings. To help researchers make theoretically informed choices, we formulate five questions that can guide researchers to think of model specification in a theoretically rigorous way. We examine these issues with examples from both general management and operations management research. Importantly, we argue that addressing the questions regarding model specification must involve primarily theoretical and contextual judgment, not statistical tests.},

To mitigate risk and improve operational productivity, artificial intelligence (AI), a key disruptive technology, has been increasingly employed in many industries. In this study, we examine the relationship between CSR and idiosyncratic risk (IR) as moderated by AI innovation and operational efficiency based on data from 1614 firms in China during the period from 2010 to 2017. The empirical results show that CSR can negatively affect IR, while beyond a certain level, it acts in the opposite direction, exhibiting a U‐shaped relationship. In particular, operational efficiency shifts the turning point of the U‐shaped curve to the right, implying that firms with high operational efficiency can obtain a higher optimal benefit by improving their CSR. Furthermore, AI innovation flattens the U‐shaped curve, thereby weakening CSR&#39;s positive impact on IR. This result indicates that AI innovation is not always beneficial. As AI innovation can have some substitution effect on CSR, enterprises should focus on either CSR or AI innovation as their main differentiation strategy to maximize the utilization of resources. We further instrument CSR using the social expenditure ratio of the province where the firm is headquartered to address a potential endogeneity concern.

We model a Stackelberg game where the supplier offers risk protection from quality uncertainty to a 3PR. The 3PR faces a convex increasing remanufacturing cost and a sales revenue that is increasing and concave in the volume resold. We show general conditions under which a unique contract exists and can be expressed in closed form. We calibrate our model using a dataset on supplier contracts and equipment conditions provided by a 3PR. Our managerial insights are derived from the data and summarized as follows. First, there is a benefit to suppliers from characterizing the quality of used assets. Therefore, they should consider adjusting contracts to reflect asset quality. Second, suppliers can increase profit by contracting based on quality grade and using a portfolio of contracts. Third, we show that the asset age impacts contract terms, with suppliers with assets at a lower age keeping a higher revenue share and observing a greater fraction of equipment remanufactured. This suggests that suppliers should consider the benefits of disposition contracts when making equipment replacement decisions.},

  abstract     = {Given the promise of three‐dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing, some innovative consumer goods companies have started to experiment with such a technology for on‐demand production. In this study, we consider two adoption cases of 3D printing in a dual‐channel (i.e., online and in‐store) retail setting, and evaluate its impact on a firm’s product offering, pricing, and inventory decisions. Our analysis uncovers the following effects of 3D printing. First, 3D printing at the factory has the substitution effect of technological innovation for online demands, as 3D printing replaces the traditional mode of production. Such technology substitution not only leads to increased product variety offered online, which allows the firm to charge a price premium for online customers, but also induces the firm to offer a smaller product variety and a reduced price in‐store. There is an additional environmental benefit when more customers are steered from the in‐store channel to the online channel. Second, when 3D printing is used in‐store as well, in addition to the substitution effect, the firm also achieves a structural effect due to the fundamental change in the supply chain structure. Since the in‐store demand is served in a build‐to‐order fashion, the firm achieves postponement benefits in inventory management. The environmental benefit is the most significant in this case. Moreover, using 3D printing in‐store will require a new supplier–retailer relationship. We find that cost‐sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chains where 3D printing is used in‐store and the supplier controls the raw material inventory.},

  abstract     = {Data sharing between upstream and downstream entities is vital for the success of a supply chain. However, distrust, privacy concerns, data misuse, and the asymmetric valuation of shared data between entities often hinder data sharing. This problem calls for a secure, efficient, fair, and trustworthy data‐sharing mechanism. The key to such a successful system hinges on how to trace the data usage, determine the value of the seller’s data to the buyer and then compensate the seller accordingly. To this end, we design and implement a blockchain‐enabled data‐sharing marketplace for a stylized supply chain. We demonstrate how a blockchain can be used to overcome these impediments in supply‐chain data sharing and provide a detailed tutorial with a step‐by‐step implementation for how to set up such a data exchange prototype using Hashgraph.},

We start by introducing several key concepts, namely, L ♮ ‐convexity and M ♮ ‐convexity and their variants, followed by a discussion of some fundamental properties that are most useful for studying operations models. We then illustrate various applications of these concepts and properties. Examples include network flow problem, stochastic inventory control, appointment scheduling, game theory, portfolio contract, discrete choice model, and bike sharing. We focus our discussion on demonstrating how discrete convex analysis can shed new insights on existing problems, and/or bring about much more simpler analyses and algorithm developments than previous methods in the literature.

  abstract     = {Regions with carbon emission regulations bear the risk of “carbon leakage” if local producers shift production capacity to an unregulated region. We investigate the problem for a producer subject to geographically asymmetric emission regulation with uncertain future emission price. The producer has two ex ante options to lower its compliance cost: investing in clean production technology in the regulated region and building production capacity in the unregulated region. The producer determines its production quantities ex post , after emission price uncertainty is resolved. We study two anti‐leakage policies, Border Tax (BT) and Output‐Based Allocation (OB), where the former adopts a “stick” approach that penalizes offshore production and the latter adopts a “carrot” approach that grants free emission allowances for production in the regulated region. First, we show that the emission price uncertainty can exert opposing effects in the absence of an anti‐leakage policy: When the expected emission price is low (high), a higher uncertainty aggravates (mitigates) carbon leakage. Second, through a comprehensive comparison, we highlight that while both BT and OB are able to reduce carbon leakage, BT has a stronger effect in both the regulated and unregulated regions in multiple dimensions, especially when the carbon leakage risk is high. Third, we find that a higher emission price uncertainty weakens the effect of both BT and OB. We therefore suggest that emission price uncertainty should be accounted for when formulating anti‐leakage policies. Finally, we extend our analysis to a competitive case and find that the superiority of BT relative to OB is enhanced.},

Modeling and performance analysis of inpatient flow present unique features and challenges that differ from operations in other service industries. In this study, we review recent modeling and analytical advances in the setting of inpatient flow management, with a particular focus on service time models motivated from the observations of inpatient discharges. We first compare two new service time models developed to capture the time‐of‐day inpatient flow dynamics, and reveal interesting connections between the two models. We then review analytical methods developed to analyze systems with the new service time models. Based on one method, which is amenable to a one‐dimensional exact analysis under certain conditions, we further introduce its approximations that have explicit analytical forms and enable efficient computations in large systems. In particular, we showcase how to leverage a powerful tool, Stein’s method framework, in the hospital setting for steady‐state approximations and characterizing error bounds. We conclude this study by a literature review on other important aspects in inpatient flow management and propose future research directions, from both the modeling and analytical perspectives.},

  abstract     = {One effective means to hedge against uncertainty and better match supply with demand in a swiftly changing environment is to adopt a flexible operations strategy that allows timely response to realized demand. The notion of flexible processes and operations has led to significant impact on the performance of many manufacturing and service applications. However, investing a fully flexible system is usually prohibitively expensive with overwhelming implementation complexity and overhead. As a result, the search for efficient system designs with only a limited amount of flexibility but can capture the majority of the benefits achieved by a fully flexible system has been an active research question in the operations literature. Fortunately, it has been widely observed that even just a small amount of flexibility, if configured in a right way, can be extremely effective in hedging against demand uncertainty and mitigating supply–demand mismatch. In this review, we shall present and discuss some recent developments in flexible operations over the past decade. We organize our review into models with independent and dependent capacity allocation decisions across time periods. In the former setting, capacity allocation decisions in one period do not affect future demand fulfillment decisions and one can start over every period as if one is dealing with a single‐period model, whereas in the latter case capacity allocation decisions in one period would have an impact on the decisions in future periods. The review concludes with some discussions about topics for future research exploration.},

Each firm has exclusive access to a signal useful in updating market forecast. The quality of the signal received exclusively by a supplier is low when it adheres to the retail channel but improves after it engages in direct selling. Firms communicate signals along two directions. Competing suppliers or retailers may exchange signals in between, while suppliers may acquire retailers’ signals with payments. A firm can voluntarily share its undisclosed signals—including its exclusive signal and the signals received from information flow—with other firms through vertical interactions as per the specified decision sequence. Firms rely on available signals to decide prices and quantities. Direct selling by suppliers produces structure and information effects. The structure effect arises as suppliers gain flexibility in balancing sales across channels. The information effect arises as suppliers receive exclusive signals of improved quality and initiate signal acquisition from retailers, influencing the availability and utilization of signals among firms in responsive decision making. Channel structure, competition intensity, and cost of direct sales are important factors affecting suppliers’ incentive for direct selling and the magnitude of the arising structure and information effects on firms’ profit performance.},

Agents exert effort to improve their solutions but face uncertainty about their solution performance. The organizer is interested in obtaining multiple solutions—agents whose solutions contribute to the organizer’s utility are called contributors. Motivated by mixed policies observed in practice, where some tournaments are open and others restrict entry, we study when it is optimal for the organizer to conduct an open tournament or to restrict entry. Our analysis shows that whether an open tournament is optimal is tied to: (1) the variance of uncertainty as compared to the impact of effort; (2) the number of contributors, and (3) the skewness of the uncertainty distribution. Our results help explain mixed policies about restricting entry observed in practice as well as recent empirical and experimental findings.},

  abstract     = {Contests have long existed to source ideas and solutions. The emergence of crowdsourcing contest platforms greatly reduces the costs and broadens the reach of running contests by facilitating access to a large pool of labor, making contests a cost‐efficient approach to procure ideas/solutions even for employers of limited resources. As a result, the use of contests surges and there is a flux of small‐to‐medium size contests to these platforms. This study focuses on these new waves of small‐to‐medium‐size contests on crowdsourcing contest platforms and extends the literature in several ways: First, prior literature focuses extensively on contest prize, we also consider the effect of contest duration, which plays salient role on contest platforms. Our findings provide evidence that contest duration affects both the number and the quality of contestants attracted to a contest. Second, prior literature assumes contests exist independently and that the quality distribution of contestants is exogenous; accordingly, the number of contestants can be regarded as a proxy of contest performance. We show that contest design parameters have direct effects on the quality distribution of contestants. Specifically, increasing contest duration, while attracting more contestants, results in a downward shift on the quality distribution of the contestants attracted to the contest. Third, recognizing that each contest does not exist independently on crowdsourcing contest platforms, we also incorporate the number of competing contests in our model. Our results provide practical recommendations on how to set up successful contests and attract high‐quality contestants to a contest on a crowdsourcing contest platform.},

  abstract     = {It has long been recognized that many inventory models most relevant to practice are inherently high‐dimensional, and hence generally believed to become computationally intractable as certain problem parameters grow large (suffering from the “curse of dimensionality”). In the last decade, asymptotic analysis has shown that in many interesting settings such problems can actually be well‐approximated by much simpler optimization problems, leading to new algorithms and insights. In this survey, we review the state‐of‐the‐art as regards applying asymptotic analysis to such challenging inventory problems. In addition to surveying the literature, we present a detailed introduction to the relevant tools and methodologies through three in‐depth case studies in which asymptotic analysis has recently led to major progress: lost‐sales models, dual‐sourcing models, and Assemble‐to‐Order systems in the presence of large lead times.},

  abstract     = {Data‐driven sequential decision has found a wide range of applications in modern operations management, such as dynamic pricing, inventory control, and assortment optimization. Most existing research on data‐driven sequential decision focuses on designing an online policy to maximize revenue. However, the research on uncertainty quantification on the underlying true model function (e.g., demand function), a critical problem for practitioners, has not been well explored. In this study, using the problem of demand function prediction in dynamic pricing as the motivating example, we study the problem of constructing accurate confidence intervals for the demand function. The main challenge is that sequentially collected data lead to significant distributional bias in the maximum likelihood estimator or the empirical risk minimization estimate, making classical statistical approaches such as the Wald’s test no longer valid. We address this challenge by developing a debiased approach and provide the asymptotic normality guarantee of the debiased estimator. Based this the debiased estimator, we provide both point‐wise and uniform confidence intervals of the demand function.},

  abstract     = {Payment for results (PfR) funding approach, where donors reimburse the non‐profit organization (NPO) based on outcomes, is being increasingly adopted in the non‐profit sector. However, there is also concern expressed by many voluntary organizations that such a funding approach puts an undue financial burden on small NPOs and could actually be detrimental to social welfare. In this study, we build a theoretical framework to analyze PfR funding mechanisms. We use a sequential game to model the interaction between the donor and the NPO, with the donor as the first mover. This model captures how PfR funding is typically implemented in practice using social impact bonds (SIB), wherein social investors provide the upfront funding needed by the NPO to implement the project. The donor provides funding, based on the actual benefit delivered, at the end of the project and the investors are paid back using these funds. We find that higher targets set by the donor do not necessarily translate to higher expected utility or expected benefit delivered under PfR. When comparing the performance of PfR and traditional funding (TF) mechanisms, we find that the donor typically has a higher expected utility under the PfR mechanism when the probability of a negative outcome shock is either high or low, and is better off using the TF approach otherwise. When the donor’s opportunity cost of funding the project is high, the donor is better off using a PfR mechanism when her belief about the NPO having low efficiency is sufficiently high. Interestingly, we find that for a large range of parameter values there is a mismatch between the approach that gives a higher expected utility to the donor and the approach that maximizes the expected social benefit delivered. Our model and analysis suggest that the optimal funding approach, and the optimal target set under PfR, depend on the NPO’s financing cost from social investors and project outcome uncertainty.},

We focus on the implementation of centralized decision‐making and the introduction of an information technology (IT)‐enabled intraoperative prompt, on efficiency, as measured by preoperative patient processing time. We analyze over 33,000 individual surgical cases in a unique field experimental setting to conduct an empirical investigation of the effects of each intervention on patients&#39; time spent in preoperative processing. To identify the causal effect of each process change, we leverage our field experimental research design and cast our analyses in the difference‐in‐differences modeling framework. We compare the preoperative patient processing time of two distinct patient groups, a treatment group that is impacted by the implemented operational changes and a control group that was not impacted by the changes, before and after each process change. Our results suggest a 3.4% reduction in preoperative processing time with only centralized decision‐making in place, yet suggest a 10.8% reduction in preoperative processing time when centralized decision‐making is paired with the IT‐enabled intraoperative prompt. We also find evidence of a complementarity effect between our process changes and surgeon prior process experience. Our study contributes to the healthcare operations literature by demonstrating the benefits of coordinated information flow within the patient supply chain. We offer insights for hospital managers and healthcare operations scholars alike on the role of information coordination in improving preoperative patient flow with minimal impact on existing resources and staff.},

  abstract     = {How to avoid project failures driven by overoptimistic schedules? Managers often attempt to mitigate the duration underestimation and improve the accuracy of project schedules by providing their planners with excessively detailed project specifications. While this traditional approach may be intuitive, solely providing more detailed information has proven to have a limited effect on eliminating behavioral biases. We experimentally test the effectiveness of providing detailed specification and compare it to an alternative intervention of providing historical information about the average duration of similar projects in the past. We find that both interventions mitigate the underestimation bias. However, since providing detailed project specification results in high variance of estimation errors due to sizable over‐ and underestimates, only the provision of historical information leads to more accurate project duration estimates. We also test whether it is more effective to anchor planners by providing historical information simultaneously with the project specification or to provide the historical information only after beliefs regarding the project duration are formed, in which case planners can regress their initial estimates toward the historical average. We find that the timing of disclosing information does not play a role as the estimation bias is mitigated and the accuracy is improved in both conditions. Finally, we observe that the subjective confidence in the accuracy of duration estimates does not vary across the interventions, suggesting that the confidence is neither a function of the amount nor the detail of available information.},

Organizations typically have no solution to spare parts shortages other than expensive expediting orders, or waiting for a part to arrive with the next replenishment. We investigate whether on‐site three‐dimensional (3D) printing of spare parts can bring relief. Our work extends dual‐sourcing literature with fixed order cycles by considering two emergency supply options: expediting regular parts and 3D printing lower quality parts. We model the replenishment and emergency supply decisions as a Markov decision process and find that the optimal inventory control policy consists of two thresholds that control when to expedite, when to print and when to wait for regular parts via the next replenishment. We apply our model to a case study of the Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA) for her United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali. Our results show that on‐site 3D printing, much more so than expediting, leads to large operational cost savings through on‐site inventory reductions and increased asset availability, thus increasing the ability of the RNLA to operate in remote locations. These results extend to many other organizations that operate in remote locations, for example, those in the mining and offshore industry.},

In this study, we propose a planning approach for ad publishers to better allocate their ad resources. Specifically, we propose a framework comprising two building blocks: (i) a mixed‐integer nonlinear programming model that solves for the optimal ad resource allocation plan, which maximizes the publisher’s revenue, for which we have developed an efficient solution algorithm; and (ii) an arbitrary‐point‐inflated Poisson regression model that deals with users’ ad clicking behavior, whereby we directly forecast the number of clicks, instead of relying on the click‐through rate (CTR) as in the literature. The two blocks are closely related in the sense that the output of the regression model serves as the input to the optimization model and the optimization model motivates the development of the regression model. We conduct extensive numerical experiments based on a data set spanning 20 days provided by a leading social network sites firm. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of our approach.},

We argue that dispute resolution will reduce buyers’ reliance on reputation systems in their hiring decisions to varying extents, depending on the nature of the work required. We assess these predictions using proprietary data capturing projects, service providers, bids, and hiring decisions around a natural experiment: the introduction of a new dispute resolution system at a major online service procurement platform. We provide evidence consistent with our expectations; introducing a dispute resolution system led buyers to reduce their consideration of service provider rating volumes in hiring decisions, particularly for projects where service provider performance could be evaluated objectively by a third party (e.g., data entry, as opposed to more subjective, creative work, like logo design). We also report a variety of additional analyses, which demonstrate the robustness of our findings to alternative measures, dynamics of the effects depending on buyers’ experience with the dispute process, and the impact of the dispute service on buyers’ propensity to enter ratings of service providers. These findings provide empirical evidence that dispute resolution can be an effective, alternative means of mitigating supplier quality risks in online service procurement markets in place of ex‐ante signals of provider quality. However, this is particularly true in settings where the output of work contracted can be objectively evaluated by a third party.},

Customer‐base diversification is further shown to enhance firm performance during periods of increasing policy uncertainty, but not when policy uncertainty decreases. Overall, our evidence suggests that firms respond to increasing policy uncertainty by diversifying their customer base and such behavior contributes positively to firm performance.},

  abstract     = {We study gain‐sharing agreements in a target price‐minimum quality payment system. Our work is inspired by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) bundled payment model. In our model, patients receive care from a hospital and a post‐acute care provider. A third‐party payer establishes target levels for total billing by the hospital and provider, and a target on the overall quality of care. The hospital and provider receive fee‐for‐service (FFS) billings during an episode of care, defined as the period that starts with an admission of a patient to the hospital and ends 90 days post‐discharge. The hospital may also receive an incentive payment if total FFS billing by both parties is below the target price and total quality by both parties is above the minimum quality. The goal of the incentive payment is to encourage hospitals to enter into “gain‐sharing” agreements with providers. We model the interactions between the three parties. We show that while using a gain‐sharing agreement might be a “win‐win‐win” scenario for the three parties, good design of the payment scheme by the payer is essential to incentivize a hospital to participate in the bundled payment model (e.g., CJR) and sign a gain‐sharing agreement with the provider. Furthermore, we illustrate that a target price‐minimum quality bundled payment model would be more effective, in care‐coordination, in healthcare settings where the provider is much more effective than the hospital in reducing its billing.},

  abstract     = {In this study, as an alternative to the surplus utility, we propose a performance‐price‐ratio (PPR) utility and specialize the customer choice model with a PPR maximization criterion. With the PPR‐based choice model, we investigate a pricing game between retailers in a competitive market. Through transferring the decision variable from price to performance‐price ratio, the first‐order condition of the game becomes a linear equation system, which enables us to develop a closed‐form equilibrium solution. The solution reveals how product performance and price sensitivity affect equilibrium pricing, market share, and revenue. With the developed theoretical results, we carry out empirical studies with a rich data set obtained from the China TV market. At the individual product level and the brand level, we calibrate the PPR‐based choice model and the widely used surplus‐based model with a Bayesian information criteria‐based stepwise multivariate regression method. The regression results suggest that the PPR‐based model fits both the product‐level and brand‐level data better than the surplus‐based model. Through the stepwise selection of independent variables, we find that the leading features affecting a TV’s performance are 3D TV functionality and its screen size. Moreover, we explore how the market equilibrium evolves with the game decision sequence, market structure, and new product entry.},

First, women are more collaborative than men in the role of both buying agents and supply agents. Second, information about counterparts’ gender affects behaviors, as both genders are more collaborative when paired with women than when paired with men. Finally, all‐women supply chain pairs outperform all other gender pairings in supply chain efficiency. Our results suggest that women exhibit an advantage over men in supply chain collaboration, and that employing women is advantageous irrespective of gender diversity concerns.},

  abstract     = {Social media has been increasingly integrated into firm operations. Past literature documented the operational value of the content generated by social media users but paid little attention to the users’ incentives to generate and share content. We fill in the gap by linking a user’s social network to her content contribution. Specifically, we distinguish the role of the followee network (the group of people being followed by the user) from the role of the follower network. When a user follows more people, she may spend more time in consuming content than generating content (the substitution effect); she may gain more conflicting information from her followees, obfuscating her incentives to generate content (the information overload effect). Conversely, gathering more information from her followees may facilitate her own content generation (the information sharing effect). Through different identification strategies using multiple datasets from two influential social media platforms, we find that the effects of followees and followers are asymmetric in signs and different in magnitudes. Most notably, a user generates less content with a larger followee network, especially when she faces more time constraints. Our findings suggest social media platforms and companies leveraging social media in their operations incorporate network analytics to promote their user engagement.},

  abstract     = {Inventory optimization approaches typically optimize steady‐state performance, but do not consider the transition of an initial state to the optimized state. In this study, we address this transition. Our research is motivated by a company that implemented an improved inventory policy for its spare parts division. The improved policy suggested new base stock levels for the majority of the parts. For parts with increased base stock levels, inventory increases were realized after the part lead times, but for low‐demand parts with decreased base stock levels, inventory reductions were slow. As a result, inventory cost increased over the first months after the new inventory policy had been introduced and exceeded the inventory budget substantially. To avoid such undesirable effects, base stock level changes must be phased in. We consider a multi‐item spare parts inventory system, initially operating under an item approach inventory policy that achieves identical fill rates for all parts. Our approach addresses the transition to a superior system approach inventory policy that maximizes the system fill rate. We model the inventory transition as a finite‐horizon optimization problem and apply column generation and a marginal analysis heuristic to determine transient base stock levels for all parts. Using data from the company that motivated our research, we illustrate how the transition can be controlled to quickly improve fill rates without exceeding the initial inventory budget.},

Over a planning horizon of T periods, demand distributions can change up to O ( log T ) times, but the firm does not know the demand distributions before or after each change, the time periods when changes occur, or the number of changes. Therefore, the firm needs to detect changes and learn the demand distributions only from historical sales data. We show that with censored demand, active exploration in the inventory space is needed for a reasonable detecting and learning algorithm. We provide a theoretical lower bound by partitioning all admissible policies into either exploration‐heavy or exploitation‐heavy, and for both categories we prove that the convergence rate cannot be better than Ω ( T ) . We then develop a nonparametric learning algorithm for this problem and prove that it achieves a convergence rate that (almost) matches the theoretical lower bound.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we examine the effect of the differences in both sales ability and reservation utility on the design of the pricing scheme and compensation contract under asymmetric information. Heterogeneity with ability‐dependent reservation utility generates conflicted screening and pooling effects that preclude separating and pooling equilibria, respectively; with which agents may work harder under either centralized or delegated pricing scheme than if they were homogeneous and, in certain scenarios, no premiums (information rents) are paid. These findings are driven by the dynamics between the differences in agents’ reservation utilities and in their effort costs or rewards that arise when their true types are concealed. We show that optimal separating contracts generate the same profit under centralized and delegated pricing because separating contracts under centralization retain the pricing flexibility of delegation. However, a certain form of pooling contract under delegated pricing can outperform the optimal pooling contract under centralization because the upside of pricing flexibility under delegation dominates the downside caused by reduced effort incentives. Under the optimal contracts, delegated pricing is as profitable to the firm as centralized pricing when the difference of reservation utilities is small or when the difference is large but the ability gap is small, and delegation is preferred when the difference of reservation utilities is moderate or when both the difference and the ability gap are large.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the dynamic and differential effects of prefunding on reward‐based crowdfunding markets plagued by information asymmetry. Prefunding, an innovative feature in crowdfunding, enables founders to share project information with potential backers before fundraising begins. By collecting and analyzing daily project‐level panel data from one of the world&#39;s largest crowdfunding platforms, we found that projects with the prefunding feature were more likely to succeed in reaching their funding goals and the effects of prefunding on the amount of funds raised remained positive and significant over time. In probing why this occurred, we used text analyses and revealed that the mechanisms driving the funding premium were the specific types of prefunding information shared between founders and potential backers (volume, length, and sentiment). Furthermore, in examining the sources of funds, we found that prefunding information first attracts funding from regular backers, followed by lottery backers. This herding behavior creates two intertwined funding streams—a primary and a secondary—for prefunding projects. Finally, using counterfactual decomposition analysis, we identified the types of projects that benefited the most from prefunding and found that prefunding democratizes funding outcomes. These findings and insights into information sharing, herding, and differential effects of prefunding contribute to the OM‐IS research on operational designs of reward‐based crowdfunding platforms that serve early‐stage ventures in online environments with minimal informational oversight and regulations.},

We show that the firm&#39;s optimal inventory policy in each period may order new inventory up to a state‐dependent order‐up‐to level subject to the firm&#39;s capital and IBF loan constraints, or salvage existing inventory down to a state‐dependent salvage‐down‐to level. We further partially characterize the structures of the two state‐dependent levels in each period. Through analytical and numerical studies, we offer a number of new insights regarding the optimal inventory management for a capital‐constrained firm with access to inventory‐based financing. In particular, we find that when the firm anticipates a shortage of capital with which to meet high demands in a future period, it may strategically over‐stock its inventory in earlier periods in order to secure the necessary capital. Through extensive numerical studies, our study also demonstrates how some of the key parameters may affect the optimal inventory policy and the value of IBF.},

  abstract     = {The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has introduced several Episode‐based Payment Models. Episodes are combinations of pre‐acute, acute, and post‐acute services for particular medical conditions. During the year, CMS pays hospitals according to historical norms. At the end of the year, these payments are reconciled against a target price, resulting in either a gain or a loss for the hospital. The hospital may also realize gains or losses from its internal operations. It may incentivize physicians to select certain treatment levels that improve quality and reduce costs by offering to share gains and losses. CMS has placed restrictions on what gains or losses may be shared and implemented stop‐loss and stop‐gain (SLSG) provisions for the hospital and the physicians. In this study, we consider a class of affine gainsharing functions that calculate a physician’s per‐episode share based on both the aggregate performance across all physicians, and the cost and quality outcomes achieved by that physician. We show that when there are no sharing restrictions and no SLSG provisions, an optimal gainsharing function lies in the class of affine functions. In contrast, when there are SLSG constraints, the contract design problem is analytically challenging. Therefore, we perform a series of numerical experiments, which reveal that the hospital SLSG provisions, the maximum savings potential, and the hospital’s risk preferences determine the amount of gains and losses that the hospitals share and the resulting treatment levels. From the CMS perspective, we show that SLSG constraints matter more to hospitals with higher historical average billing and higher risk aversion.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a dynamic contracting problem in a supply chain with a manufacturer selling a seasonal product through a retailer over two periods. In period 1, which is before the selling season, neither firm knows the demand information. The manufacturer runs on the regular production mode with low production cost but long lead time. In period 2, which refers to the selling season, only the retailer can update the demand information, so information asymmetry exists in the supply chain. The manufacturer may further produce and supplement the retailer via a second contract. However, only a mode of quick response with a shorter lead time but higher cost is viable, if the manufacturer decides not to carry inventory from period 1 to period 2. We formulate this dynamic contracting problem into four models based on whether the manufacturer adopts quick response or carries inventory. We show that the adoption of quick response may not always benefit the manufacturer due to the information rent she has to sacrifice, and the manufacturer may be better off under a higher cost of quick response. Interestingly, the capability of inventory carryover always hurts the manufacturer regardless of the implementation of QR. Essentially, we find that one of the hurdles of implementing these capabilities comes from the incentive issues in a decentralized supply chain. The retailer may ask for information rent whenever the manufacturer adopts a capability for supplying him in period 2, especially if this capability is inflexible that requires advance production before demand realization.},

  abstract     = {The detection of environmental violators is critical to the long‐term adoption of sustainability in supply chain management. However, there exist manufacturing facilities that report false environmental monitoring data, thereby seriously hampering governments’ efforts to identify true offenders and to properly intervene. We integrate waste gas data from the world’s largest Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) with a publicly available Violation and Punishment Dataset (VPD) to build prediction models for the identification of environmental violators. We utilize and create innovative machine learning approaches to overcome analytical challenges associated with empirical data. First, we use a feature engineering approach to generate features from the raw, and possibly fraudulent, reporting data. This overcomes the challenges associated with low fidelity, irregularity, and the presence of extreme values in the raw dataset. Second, while building prediction models, we develop new approaches to positive and unlabeled learning to overcome the challenges posed by sparsity and mislabeled data. Our prediction model achieves satisfactory results in a related field test. Our study develops new techniques for big data analytics, which greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness in detection of environmental violators and enhance operational outcomes of environmental protection agencies. This research is a joint effort between academia and practitioners, as evidenced by the participation of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of People’s Republic of China. The Ministry kindly granted us direct data access, as well as opportunities to interview Subject Matter Experts at the Ministry, which led to research insights incorporated in this manuscript. Our research findings have global implications, as CEMS devices are universally adopted to monitor waste gas emissions.},

However, even when the large manufacturer is disadvantaged for refusing to bribe, we show that it can benefit from this corrupted auction when the difference in production efficiency or the bribe is high so that the “positive force” (i.e., cost advantage) derived from the right of first refusal dominates the information disadvantage. Hence, under a specific condition, the large manufacturer has no incentive to expose the collusion between the intermediary and the corrupt manufacturer. Such a “silence tactic” provides a plausible explanation for the prevalence of corrupt auctions in practice.},

  abstract     = {Over the years, online retailers have increasingly embraced live chat to improve customer service and facilitate transactions. We examine how online sellers’ use of live chat influences their online traffic conversion into sales. Like brick‐and‐mortar stores, a fundamental task for online stores is to convert traffic into purchases, an important problem in retail service operations management. We argue that live chat can increase online sales conversion by performing the functions of informing and persuading . We explore how the two roles of live chat interact with existing information regarding sellers and their products, such as product descriptions, ratings, price, and reviews, as these types of information also influence consumers’ perceived product quality and help mitigate uncertainties in product fit to their needs. We apply a random‐coefficient model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework and test the model using a panel dataset from Taobao, the leading C2C platform in China. Our results suggest that live chat has a positive impact on conversion and that the strength of this positive effect depends on seller and product characteristics. The positive effect is stronger when product information on web pages is less comprehensive (where live chat manifests an informative role), and when the perceived value of the product is higher (where live chat manifests a persuasive role) with either a higher product rating or a lower product price. Our results provide relevant and useful implications for online merchants and platform owners.},

The seller fine‐tunes the price near an incumbent price in order to maximize the total revenue. The existing literature focuses on policies that are asymptotically optimal, that is, near optimal when the selling horizons are sufficiently long, but little is known about the optimal Bayesian policies, especially over short horizons. We formulate the problem as a finite‐horizon stochastic dynamic program and identify a connection between the optimality equations and the generalized Weierstrass transform (GWT). We fully characterize the structure of the Bayesian optimal policy for the linear Gaussian demand model and prove that the optimal policy adjusts the myopic price away from the incumbent price. A notable exception occurs when the two prices coincide and the precision of the posterior belief exceeds a threshold, in which case it is optimal to forgo learning and use a fixed‐price policy. Exploiting the structural results makes it possible to compute the optimal policy efficiently on an ordinary computer.},

  abstract     = {For experience goods (products or services), given the uncertainty about their actual quality and the growing popularity of social media, potential customers nowadays depend on experiences of peers who have used the goods previously to learn about their quality. In this paper, we study how such customer learning affects a firm&#39;s (credible) quality disclosure strategy as well as other relevant decisions. To model such learning, we adopt the anecdotal reasoning framework, which we show to be rational and a special case of the Bayesian framework. There are two main insights that we glean from this study. First, we find that the incorporation of the learning behavior significantly alters the optimal disclosure strategy from its single threshold structure in the extant literature to a multi‐threshold policy. Specifically, firms with high‐ or low‐quality goods prefer not disclosing quality information in order to utilize the pricing flexibility that such a strategy affords; on the other hand, a medium‐quality firm might disclose its quality level, even though this hinders its pricing flexibility, so that customers are confident about it when purchasing the product. Second, we show that the change in the disclosure strategy impacts the optimal pricing decision, which can be non‐monotone in the quality level. Our results suggest that when disclosure is expensive, high‐quality firms are better off educating potential customers through advertising or social media, rather than disclosing their quality levels. They also suggest to policymakers that mandatory quality disclosure may not be socially optimal as more customers obtain quality information through peer learning. Our findings are robust and hold true under quite general customer valuation distributions, in capacitated settings and even when price can be used as a signal of quality level by firms.},

  abstract     = {Human trafficking, the exploitation of humans for monetary gain or benefit, is a widespread humanitarian issue that is typically sub‐classified into labor and sex trafficking. In the last decade, sex traffickers have used online classified advertisements to advertise sexual services. Although these advertisements are visible to the general public and law enforcement, the volume of ads, the frequency with which their posting locale changes, and the use of obfuscation tactics make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to react. Existing products for law enforcement focus on identifying, tracking, and correlating individual activity by performing deep searches for specific information against a database of historical posts. While this deep search capability is useful for investigating specific cases, it overlooks higher‐level patterns that exist in ads. Using a website that has been linked to several sex trafficking‐related arrests, we demonstrate a framework for harvesting, linking, and detecting these patterns in a dataset comprised of more than 10 million advertisements targeting US cities. Our framework combines information systems and operations research concepts to identify groups of posts based on text, phone numbers, and pictures; determine circuits associated with post groups, and predict future movements using four different methods. Our description of the framework and comparison of the grouping and prediction methods provide insights that can assist law enforcement agencies to combat individuals/organizations involved in illicit sexual activities, including sex trafficking, proactively. Also, this demonstration provides researchers interested in developing advanced interdiction models targeting illicit sexual activities with a clear picture regarding available data formats.},

  abstract     = {Aid organizations choose their service providers through reverse auctions to decrease their operational costs, and many of them award the contracts to the lowest bidders, which often leads to aggressive bidding practices and compromised service quality. This is known as the abnormally low bids (ALBs) problem in public procurement. An ALB is defined as an unrealistically low bid submitted to win an auction, an amount at which the auctioned service cannot be provided reliably. The current literature on ALBs in the humanitarian sector is rather sparse. This study presents a data‐driven contract awarding framework that aims at eliminating ALBs so that service levels can be improved significantly. We conducted our analyses in the context of a developing country, where the transportation market data are almost non‐existent. We derived our research questions through an exploratory research performed in African headquarters of an International Humanitarian Organization located in Kenya, and we constructed our quantitative models based on interviews with humanitarian practitioners and representatives of the carriers. We collected historical transport rate data from numerous carriers that serve multiple shippers, and we developed a methodology that can objectively identify ALBs, based on lane and contract specifications that are derived from the market. Furthermore, we estimated the effect of ALBs on service levels and we compared different contract settings under simulated market conditions. The results of the simulation analyses demonstrate that mitigating ALBs would improve the service levels significantly more than the commonly used fuel surcharge clauses in contracts.},

  abstract     = {Global firms often attempt to utilize modular product architectures to ease the distribution of project work among subsidiaries. However, empirical findings on the effectiveness of this approach are mixed. Seeking to clarify this matter, we investigate the conditions under which modular product platform use is associated with cross‐subsidiary distribution of project work. Through an in‐depth case study of a global corporation, we find that a firm’s ability to leverage modular product platforms for distributing project work is positively associated with project interface match (i.e., the extent to which meeting the requirements of a derivative project does not entail modifications of the interfaces embedded in the firm’s modular product platforms). However, this association is attenuated, and eventually muted, by the project technical manager’s related technical experience (i.e., the manager’s personal experience with the technical solution addressing a focal project’s customer requirements). Such attenuation effect originates because lower levels of project interface match do not necessarily imply greater expected project coordination effort. Such expectation is reduced to the extent that the technical project manager has related technical experience. Triangulation of qualitative insights from four embedded cases with a proprietary database of 97 projects supports our contention. These findings contribute to the literatures on product and organizational modularity, distributed work, and project management.},

  abstract     = {E‐procurement platforms facilitate transactions between suppliers and buyers from all over the world. Over time, suppliers and buyers may develop familiarity from prior experience with earlier transactions. The literature has established that prior experience leads to better project performance. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of prior experience between buyers and suppliers in e‐procurement platforms with a focus on the moderating roles of temporal distance and language difference between the buyer and the supplier as well as routine tasks in the project (termed “task routinization”). Using a unique observational data set from a large e‐procurement platform, we first find that buyers’ prior experience with a supplier positively affects project outcomes, and temporal distance and language difference both negatively affect project outcomes. More interestingly, we find that the effectiveness of prior experience is constrained by both temporal distance and language difference, such that if a greater temporal distance separates the buyer and supplier or if the two speak different languages, prior experience is less likely to be helpful. In addition, while task routinization does not directly affect a project’s success, it has a positive interaction effect with prior experience, suggesting that buyers’ prior experience with a supplier is more effective in enhancing project outcomes when a project comprises routine tasks. Our findings on prior experience, temporal distance, language difference, and task routinization contribute to a better understanding of the e‐procurement platform for global outsourcing and procurement.

We posit that dyadic scenarios, that is, those created jointly by a buyer and a supplier, alter the scope of supply chain design in relation to a regulatory disruption. We offer four hypotheses distinguishing dyadic scenario creation from the traditional single‐firm scenario creation and two additional hypotheses related specifically to scenarios of regulatory disruptions. Five of the six hypotheses are supported in a behavioral study of a regulatory context. We integrate these findings to propose a Supply Chain Regulation Preparedness (SRP) framework for assessing the effects of dyadic scenario creation in six regimens of regulatory disruptions. We discuss the implications of this framework for the theory and practice of organizational learning associated with supply chain configurations in the face of emergent public policies and highlight collaborative scenario planning as an emergent strategic‐level mechanism that supply chain partners can deploy jointly to address just‐in‐case uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The growing population in cities and booming e‐commerce activities create huge demand for urban last‐mile delivery, exerting intense pressure on the cities’ well‐being. To keep congestion and pollution under control, a consolidator can operate an urban consolidation center (UCC) to bundle shipments from multiple carriers before the last‐mile delivery. Alternatively, the consolidator can operate a peer‐to‐peer platform for the carriers to share delivery capacity. We provide guidance for the consolidator to choose between these two business models by comparative analysis. We capture the interactions between the consolidator and carriers using a game‐theoretical framework. Under each business model, the consolidator first decides a price of delivery service to maximize her expected profit. Each carrier then observes his task volume, and decides whether to deliver on his own or use the consolidator&#39;s service to minimize his delivery cost. Under the UCC model, the carriers become more dependent on the UCC as their variable delivery cost increases. Under the platform model, the demand and the supply of delivery capacity on the platform are balanced in equilibrium. Between the two business models, the UCC is more profitable than the platform if and only if the carriers’ variable delivery cost is sufficiently large. Moreover, the UCC becomes more dominant as there are more carriers. The UCC is also more efficient than the platform in mitigating the negative social‐environmental impact of urban last‐mile delivery if and only if there are sufficiently many carriers. Otherwise, the platform performs better.},

We study how the organizational structure of the start‐up affects the choice between sequential and concurrent development using a two‐task model, in which both tasks must be completed for the start‐up to earn revenue. We study several organizational structures, which differ in terms of task allocation, including centralized development, joint development, and decentralized development with one or two vendors. In the joint development and decentralized structures, the vendors must determine the amount of effort to exert on each task, where the probability that the task can be completed is increasing in effort. In exchange for effort, each vendor is offered a percentage of the revenue earned by the start‐up upon completion of the project. The start‐up must determine whether the tasks should be performed concurrently or sequentially, as well as the incentive rate to offer the vendors. We find that organizational structure plays a major role in determining the optimal development strategy. In a centralized setting, where both tasks are performed in‐house, the sequential development strategy is preferred. However, in a decentralized setting, where a single vendor performs both tasks, the opposite may occur. This is due, in part, to the inefficiency caused by the vendor&#39;s forward‐looking behavior under sequential development. This same result does not occur in a decentralized setting with two vendors or in the joint development setting.},

  abstract     = {Aid agencies implement food aid programs to alleviate chronic hunger. These agencies can choose direct, in‐kind distribution of food commodities, or they can provide cash or vouchers. To determine which aid modality to use for distributing aid, organizations currently use decision trees or other guidelines. In this study, we present a novel mathematical formulation to determine the optimal approach for allocating modalities and quantities of aid to beneficiaries, while also considering the beneficiaries’ needs and preferences. This also enables aid agencies to estimate the benefits of their programs for all stakeholders (i.e., beneficiaries, local retailers, and the organization) and help them design more tailored programs. The proposed model has three objectives to assess potential solutions: program costs, beneficiaries’ nutrition levels, and economic contributions to the local economy. The beneficiaries’ consumption behavior is incorporated into the model through a bilevel optimization structure to capture and prevent inefficient cash use by beneficiaries. We validate the model using data from the World Food Programme’s operations in Garissa County, Kenya. We analyze how robustly our solution handles possible variations in different cost parameters, including food commodity prices and operational costs. Finally, we demonstrate how to use the model to evaluate policies intended to improve program outcomes, such as educating beneficiaries about nutrition or fortifying grains available locally. Our results show that a modality’s effectiveness depends on the population and market characteristics, and no modality should be presumed superior to another without in‐depth analyses.},

We also find that it is often optimal to hold more reserve capacity downstream than upstream. While in one‐stage supply chains RMI and reserve capacity always behave as substitutes, it turns out that in multi‐stage serial supply chains the interplay between RMI and reserve capacity is more nuanced.

  abstract     = {With supply chains becoming increasingly extended, the uncertainties in the upstream production process can greatly affect the material flows that aim toward meeting the uncertain demands at the downstream. We analyze a two‐location system in which the upstream production facility experiences random capacities and the downstream store faces random demands. Different from the widely used approach that seeks the decomposition of the profit function based on the echelon inventories, our approach builds on the notions of stochastic functions, in particular, the stochastic linearity in midpoint and the directionally concave order. With these notions, we establish the concavity and submodularity of the profit functions in the transformed decision variables. In general, it is optimal to follow a two‐level state‐dependent threshold policy such that an order is issued at a location if and only if the inventory position of that location is below the corresponding threshold. In the special case where the salvage values are linear in the ending inventories, the profit function becomes separable in the inventory positions, and the optimal policy reduces to the echelon base‐stock policy. The effect of the uncertain capacity and demand depends critically on whether the production capacity is limited or ample in relation to the demand. Only when the capacity and the demand do not differ much, the upstream facility carries positive inventory; otherwise, all units produced are shipped immediately toward the downstream. We further extend our analysis to systems with general stochastic production functions and with multiple locations.},

  abstract     = {Buyers are increasingly pressured to ensure sustainability of their suppliers, but they are also under pressure for low‐cost procurement. To make a more informed procurement decision, a buyer can choose to invest in sustainability assessments, and select a supplier based on their price bids and cost markup terms informed by the sustainability assessments. However, sustainability assessments are costly, and whether to use them is at the discretion of the buyer. Hence, the buyer can instead choose to forgo the assessments and select a supplier based on price only. In this study, we explore this trade‐off. We find that the value of assessments depends on the buyer’s business environment in some surprising ways. For example, although sustainability assessments are used to identify the suppliers’ sustainability levels, greater ex ante variability and a decrease in suppliers’ average sustainability levels (e.g., facing a supplier base in a country with looser sustainability regulations) can decrease the value of sustainability assessments. We find that the presence of an outside option (e.g., internal production) alters the assessment policy significantly. We also explore when the buyer may prefer to assess only a subset of her suppliers. Although motivated by the use of sustainability assessments, our results are generalizable to settings where the buyer has the option to invest in total‐cost assessments on her potential suppliers’ unknown, non‐biddable, differentiator‐type attributes.},

The focus of this study is on the setting that relates to deceptive counterfeits. Our paper is one of the first that examines the effectiveness of blockchain as a solution to a supply chain challenge. Specifically, the unique feature of blockchain that we model, which none of the traditional strategies studied in the literature is capable of, is that blockchain adoption changes the analysis from a deceptive counterfeit setting to a non‐deceptive counterfeit setting. We also consider government being a decision maker and customers&#39; privacy concern from blockchain adoption, two features that are not examined in the existing literature. We consider a market with a manufacturer and a deceptive counterfeiter. The manufacturer can signal product authenticity either with blockchain technology or through pricing. The government can provide subsidy to encourage blockchain adoption. Blockchain should be used when the counterfeit quality is intermediate or when customers have intermediate distrust about products in the market. If government provides subsidy, blockchain can be more effective than differential pricing strategy in eliminating post‐purchase regret. Our results advocate for government providing subsidy because it benefits both customers and the society and could be a better approach than government enforcement efforts.},

  abstract     = {This study explores whether and how lower variations in clinical practice relate to hospital operational performance. This relation is critical to the overall search for pathways that will allow the healthcare industry to bend the cost curve, implying significant implications for practice and regulators. We define practice variation as all variation not resulting from patient mix and construct a novel measure using inpatient discharge data for each patient cohort having an identical medical condition. Hospitals in our dataset show a broad practice variation spectrum. Using statistical process control (SPC) as a theoretical lens, we hypothesize the negative impacts of practice variation on operational performance. We also consider intervening impacts of hospital quality evaluations on the relationship. Analyzing data of six years from hospitals in NY and FL states using a dynamic panel system Generalized Method of Moments estimator, we find that higher practice variation relates to longer average patient length‐of‐stay and higher total cost per capita. This phenomenon is even stronger when a hospital provides services with higher quality in patient experience because such a hospital tends to provide more responsive care to patients, which is often resource‐intensive. By delving into granular dimensions of practice variation based on detailed charge data, we find that higher care‐delivery practice variation (i.e., the provision of healthcare) is directly associated with poor operational performance. We also find that pursuing higher quality measures may be harmful to some hospital operational performance measures as they have combined effects with the test‐ordering practice variation (i.e., detecting disease and monitoring its status). Taken together, these findings imply that careful attention to the two dimensions of practice variation and the nuanced joint relationship with quality measures may address the trade‐off between high quality and low cost, and provide room for improvement in practice, ultimately reducing waste in the healthcare industry. Our measure of practice variation also contributes since it enables researchers and managers to rigorously measure and visualize the status of hospitals’ practice variation linked to hospital operational performance.},

But, unlike other engineering and management disciplines, it lacks a clear foundation in a descriptive science. Exceptional results like the famous “bullwhip effect” paper by Lee et al. (1997) hint at the powerful potential for a descriptive science of operations. But the very fact that such works are exceptional suggests that they are held to a high bar in the publishing process. This may be symptomatic of the cultural norms that have prevented our field from producing a rigorous scientific foundation. In this study, we make a case for why developing a unified science of operations is essential for IE/OM education, practice and research. We provide examples and a tentative framework to illustrate what such a science might look like and use this framework to generate a testable hypothesis about a powerful relationship between variability buffers in and operations system. We conclude with suggestions of measures we can take collectively to promote development of the science of operations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we honor Stanford University Professor Hau Lee, who is a great inspiration and thought leader in the supply chain and operations management (SC&amp;OM) field. Our discussion centers around one of the most challenging SC&amp;OM problems—food production, distribution, and consumption from dirt to table. We advocate and link our notions of emergent regenerative, organic food value chains (ROFVC) with quadruple‐aim performance (QAP) that connects financial outcomes with ecological, human, and socioeconomic well‐being. To do so, we first overview the systemic problems underlying the conventional food supply chains (CFSC) that render them unsustainable in the long run. In contrast, we introduce salient distinctions between CFSC and the new paradigm of ROFVC that uphold QAP. We believe the ideas generated in this paper can move the food systems’ SC&amp;OM design, implementation, and performance measurement from an efficiency‐oriented industrial paradigm of large‐scale, factory farming toward a more encompassing view of eco‐responsible practices. In CFSC, the many hidden costs are cumulative and have broad deleterious consequences; however, in ROFVC, pollution is shunned and “taxed,” and sustainability, as a public good, is rewarded by sequestering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintaining biodiversity, living soil, as well as clean air and water. We conclude with research, teaching, and policy agendas. We believe that the underlying principles here cut across sectors by fostering the introduction of regenerative business models that take a system&#39;s view in capturing QAP in their value chain strategy and execution.},

  abstract     = {This paper empirically investigates using the e‐mail channel to target customers with a delayed incentive promotion—specifically, gift card promotion—and derives data‐driven e‐mail targeting policies. Gift card promotions are popular across retailers because they incentivize customers to spend more than a fixed expenditure level on regularly priced products by rewarding customers with a gift card to be redeemed against a future purchase. The e‐mail channel provides retailers with new sources of customer‐level data, which enables better prediction of customers&#39; responsiveness to e‐mails (e.g., clicking) and the sales promotion that comes with it (e.g., participation in the promotion). We formulate the retailer&#39;s promotion e‐mail targeting problem by maximizing two objectives—the promotion&#39;s profitability (i.e., profit‐based targeting) and e‐mail click‐through rate (i.e., CTR‐based targeting). We also take into account the retailer&#39;s promotion budget and exclusivity concerns in targeting e‐mails. We use a comprehensive dataset from a Fortune 500 luxury fashion retailer&#39;s online channel and utilize both parametric and non‐parametric methods to predict customers&#39; response to promotion e‐mails. Our data‐driven targeting policies improve the promotion&#39;s profitability by 5.57% and e‐mail CTR by 472.57%, on average, compared to our partner retailer&#39;s current e‐mail policy. We also find that the CTR‐based targeting policy lowers the promotion profitability by, on average, 9.09% compared to the profit‐based one. However, the CTR‐based policy recuperates the short‐term losses in the long‐term and increases the long‐term profitability by 3.94%, on average, compared to the profit‐based targeting policy.},

  abstract     = {We study a multi‐period inventory allocation problem in a one‐warehouse multiple‐retailer setting with lost sales. At the start of a finite selling season, a fixed amount of inventory is available at the warehouse. Inventory can be allocated to the retailers over the course of the selling horizon (transshipment is not allowed). The objective is to minimize the total expected lost sales and holding costs. In each period, the decision maker can use the realized and possibly censored demand observations to dynamically update demand forecast and consequently make allocation decisions. Our model allows a general demand updating framework, which includes ARMA models or Bayesian methods as special cases. We propose a computationally tractable algorithm to solve the inventory allocation problem under demand learning using a Lagrangian relaxation technique, and show that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal. We further use this technique to investigate how demand learning would affect inventory allocation decisions in a two‐period setting. Using a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that demand learning provides an incentive for the decision maker to withhold inventory at the warehouse rather than allocating it in early periods.},

  abstract     = {Financial hedging of raw material prices and exchange rates has become an integral part of many manufacturers&#39; operating practices. Previous empirical research suggests that a desire to avoid financial distress and the affiliated curtailment in operations is one of the strongest hedge motivations. Taking the hedging motivation as given, we examine the effectiveness of two data‐driven hedging policies at mitigating financial distress in the car manufacturing industry. The first policy is the “cost hedging” policy, under which the carmaker hedges raw material and production input purchases. This policy appears to be in wide use in practice. The car manufacturer needs to trade in aluminum, steel, zinc, and plastic to achieve the cost hedge. The second policy is a “cash hedging” policy under which the firm hedges its net cash flow. To determine a cash hedging policy, the firm solves a stochastic program that minimizes its hedge cost subject to cash flow constraints. The program solution suggests that the firm needs to trade S&amp;P500, aluminum, and zinc to implement the hedge. Our results reveal that the most critical drivers of hedging decisions appear to be demand shifts, especially demand elasticity shifts. The least important drivers are car design updates, which change the car&#39;s raw material requirements. This finding sheds light on why cost hedging, which focuses on hedging raw materials, is less effective than the cash hedging technique, which hedges both costs and demand.},

This study considers how a multi‐product firm can use its product mix, resource capacity allocation, and pricing decisions to manage challenges such as structural economic shifts or changes in consumers&#39; willingness‐to‐pay. Firms that seek to develop and use such a product line face a fundamental trade‐off. On the one hand, multiple products compete for the demand externally (i.e., cannibalization effects), as well as for the limited resource capacity internally. On the other hand, a multi‐product firm does have the ability to change the product mix and to adjust the production quantity and pricing of each product in order to manipulate supply and demand as conditions change. In this study, we demonstrate that a multi‐product firm can become more agile and adaptable under consumer purchasing behavior uncertainty by employing postponement in product mix, quantity, and pricing decisions, and by allocating capacities appropriately. In particular, we show that a firm can use its product line flexibility to make strategic adjustments after understanding the realized economic conditions, and to decide whether to follow a focus or segmentation strategy. We also extend the model to look at the value of resource flexibility and find that it has little or no benefit above and beyond the product line flexibility studied here.},

We study how to utilize information about different ocean carriers’ liner service schedules so that shippers can optimize their sourcing decisions over the selection of carriers to transport container cargoes around the world through multiple shipping lanes. We first introduce a deterministic optimization problem, where cargo demands are given in advance and in which inventory holding costs are included to capture the impacts of liner service schedules on the total operating cost. We formulate the deterministic optimization problem as a mixed integer linear program, which can be simplified by exploiting a totally unimodular property, and can thus be solved directly by a general optimization solver. To further capture the impact of liner service schedules on shippers’ resilience to the uncertainties in cargo demands, we then introduce a two‐stage robust optimization counterpart of the deterministic problem based on a probability‐free demand uncertainty set. As the two‐stage robust optimization problem is challenging to solve, we derive some novel reformulations that can enable us to develop an effective solution method. By exploiting the information about liner service schedules, we show how our proposed models and solution method can help shippers to optimize their liner service procurement decisions.},

Unlike conventional stockouts that can be corrected by inventory replenishment, a phantom stockout persists and requires human inspection. In this study, we formulate such a problem as an infinite‐horizon Bayesian dynamic program with joint inventory inspection and replenishment decisions. This problem is challenging to solve due to non‐convexity and high dimensionality. However, we find that under the Bernoulli shrinkage process, the optimal inventory inspection policy has a simple threshold structure that depends on the number of consecutive zero‐sales periods since the last inspection, while the optimal inventory replenishment policy is the same as the optimal policy without inventory shrinkage. Our numerical studies further demonstrate that this simple and intuitive policy can be an effective heuristic for more general shrinkage processes.},

In addition, we describe some emerging research opportunities for further consideration.},

  abstract     = {The Triple‐A supply chain (Lee 2004) has become one of the most influential concepts for practitioners and researchers in supply chain management. It stipulates that supply chains should strive to improve along the dimensions of agility, adaptability, and alignment, as opposed to focusing exclusively on cost and efficiency improvements. While various strategies have since been adopted across different industries to foster the Triple‐A, the digitalization movement poses both new challenges and opportunities for developing Triple‐A supply chains. In this article, we shall discuss an emerging mode of supply chain innovation, known as the consumer‐to‐manufacturer (C2M) model, and how it enables new possibilities for achieving Triple‐A “digital” supply chains. C2M establishes digital links between end consumers and upstream manufacturers and product designers, and provides a variety of tactics to shorten the information flow process of the supply chain. Our discussion focuses on the implementation of C2M at JD.com, a leading online retailer in China.},

  abstract     = {In his 2004 article, Professor Hau Lee argues that the best supply chains are not only fast and cost‐effective but also agile , adaptable , and aligned . The concept of triple‐A supply chains has been extensively studied in academic and trade publications and integrated into numerous operations and supply chain management curricula. It has also influenced the management approach of leaders around the world. Yet since the triple‐A concept was first developed, supply chains have become increasingly global, connected, and interdependent. The increased complexity of global supply chains has reduced much‐needed visibility, further complicating their management, while the growing connectivity and interdependence among different stakeholders have led to many unforeseen environmental and social issues. As a result, Professor Lee’s emphasis on triple‐A supply chains is even more relevant today. In light of these new challenges and demands, we revisit the original triple‐A definitions of agile, adaptable, and aligned, expanding these concepts for a more socially and environmentally conscientious world. We also discuss potential enablers of and barriers to sustainable triple‐A supply chains.},

  abstract     = {What are the attributes of the best‐performing supply chains? According to Lee (2004), the best supply chains are agile, adaptable, and ensure the interests of all participating companies stay aligned, that is, The Triple‐A framework. Fifteen years later, we find global supply chains exposed, with an increasing frequency and alarming severity, to low probability disruptive shocks. We revisit the question of the current attributes of best‐performing supply chains in a highly uncertain and risk fraught world. Using the lessons of the last 20 years, we propose a new framework, the “Triple A &amp; R” framework, as the foundational concept for defining excellence capabilities in global supply chains. Supply chains have to enhance agility with robustness, for real‐time excellent performance across a wide‐range of risk scenarios. Adaptability has to go beyond adjustment to trends and requires the building of resilience to recover from current shocks and proactively mitigate future shocks. We need to rethink and pursue re‐alignment of incentives for a “new normal” with changing consumer preferences, new value propositions and innovative business models. We review relevant literature that supported the implementation of Triple‐A practices in the best chains, and highlight the challenges faced by them in the last 20 years. We offer an array of interesting research directions to flesh out “Triple A &amp; R” concepts and develop practices for its effective implementation.},

The seller sells multiple goods via a sequence of first‐price auctions. While bidders are ex‐ante symmetric, the first‐period winner has a valuation advantage as a result of such synergy in the second‐period bidding game and becomes a strong bidder. This endogenous synergy creation leads to overbidding in the first‐period auction relative to a static bidding game. We characterize the equilibrium in terms of the observed bid distribution and suggest a two‐step estimation procedure. We apply our method to data on OCS oil‐tract auctions. We find that the federal government recovers 52% of the “strong” buyers’ willingness to pay in the second period. Bidders perceive the value of synergy to be about 5% of their first period’s informational rent. Counterfactual experiments show that government revenue could have increased by about 27% under alternative selling mechanisms.},

Timely sharing of patient information is expected to decrease the fragmentation of care and improve decision‐making, diagnoses, and care plans, yet previous studies that examine the benefits of HIE use do not focus on these issues and are not unanimous in their findings in general about the benefits of HIEs. Further, prior studies generally focus on average effects with binary HIE measures, either using HIE adoption at the hospital level or whether HIE is accessed at the visit level. We argue that the benefits of HIE stem from the information contained within and are not equal across cases. We utilize a rich dataset of medical records from an HIE provider in New York. Our results show that the depth of information available for the patient in HIE use decreases the overall number of future visits, specifically, HIE use effectively reduces visits that are not preventative in nature while increases adherence to preventative care visits, aiding in the shift from treatment‐based care to preventative‐based care, that public health organizations have urged for. Further, HIE use lowers the number of procedures done at the focal visit. We have several other findings that have important implications for policymakers, healthcare providers, and patients.},

This study tries to fill this gap by proposing and testing an outcome/process integrated approach for the evaluation of disaster operations management. The output analysis and the process analysis of disaster operations management are performed jointly by means of a questionnaire and a modeling tool, respectively. The integrated framework proposed has been applied to the emergency response of a small non‐profit organization to a flood. It has been shown that the two methods applied separately could give a distorted or partial picture of the operations under study, while the integrated framework proposed has proved to be effective, since it has brought to a deeper understanding of the processes. The approach can be used by practitioners to evaluate disaster operations management, and accurately and efficiently identify the key elements, strengths, and main weaknesses of relief operations.},

  abstract     = {We study recycling technology choice, a critical factor that has received little attention in the context of extended producer responsibility, and its interaction with product design‐for‐recycling in driving the environmental benefits of recycling systems. Collective recycling systems have long been criticized for restricting the environmental benefits of extended producer responsibility because of free riding issues among producers, which can undermine incentives for product design‐for‐recycling. We revisit and refine this assertion by analyzing the interaction between recycling technology and product design‐for‐recycling choices. We develop game‐theoretic models where producers and processors decide on product design‐for‐recycling and recycling technology choices, respectively. We then compare the equilibrium benefits of recycling in collective and individual systems. The key result in this study is that when recycling technology choice is taken into account, collective recycling systems can lead to higher environmental and economic benefits than individual recycling systems. This is because collective recycling systems provide stronger incentives for recycling technology improvements. In turn, these improvements can help overcome the drawbacks associated with inferior product design‐for‐recycling outcomes caused by free riding concerns among producers in collective recycling systems. In light of these results, we posit that an exclusive focus on product design‐for‐recycling to assess the environmental benefits of extended producer responsibility‐based recycling systems may need scrutiny. Producers and policy makers may need to evaluate recycling systems with respect to the incentives they provide for both product design‐for‐recycling and recycling technology improvements.},

  abstract     = {Dual channel distribution benefits upstream manufacturers but may irritate downstream retailers. The channel conflict only seems to aggravate when retailers are put at information disadvantage. We show this need not be the case. (i) We demonstrate upstream private information can improve channel efficiency and consumer surplus. The main mechanism is the offsetting interplay of signaling distortion and double marginalization: with private selling cost, the manufacturer may signal her cost by cutting the wholesale price; the price cut encourages the retailer to buy more, thereby reducing double marginalization and improving channel efficiency. (ii) We qualify the received wisdom. The general insight that cost information asymmetry reduces efficiency does not work in dual‐channel settings. We show incorporating cost information asymmetry can change dual‐channel equilibrium substantially—it can turn the retailer and channel from the victims of manufacturer encroachment to its beneficiaries. Also, we rationalize why the retailer can benefit from his information disadvantage, and when he can gain from the manufacturer’s selling cost improvement, despite retail competition. (iii) We demonstrate our results are robust for other prevailing arrangements, for example, two‐part tariffs, price competition, imperfect substitution, and simultaneous moves. Our results suggest a more nuanced view of manufacturer encroachment: as private cost information can ease channel conflict and improve consumer surplus, previous studies may have overestimated the harm of encroachment. By highlighting the critical role of cost information asymmetry, this study sharpens our understanding of dual‐channel theory and practice.},

  abstract     = {Material Requirements Planning (MRP), a core component of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, is widely used by manufacturers to determine the production lot sizes of components. These lot sizes are typically computed based on deterministic and dynamic demand assumptions, while safety stocks, which hedge against demand uncertainty, are determined independently based on different assumptions. As the lot sizes and safety stocks are not determined simultaneously, sub‐optimal decisions are often used in practice. The critical impact of inventories and service levels in manufacturing motivates the study of stochastic optimization methods for MRP. In this study, we investigate stochastic optimization methods for MRP systems under demand uncertainty. A two‐stage and a multi‐stage model are proposed to deal with the static‐static and static‐dynamic decision frameworks, respectively. We first derive structural properties of the two‐stage and multi‐stage models to provide insights on the differences between the plans created with these two models. As multi‐stage stochastic programs are not convenient in real‐world applications, several practical enhancements are proposed. First, to address scalability issues, we employ heuristics in combination with advanced sampling methods. Second, to allow real‐time static‐dynamic decisions, we derive a policy from the solution of the multi‐stage model. Third, to deal with the dynamic‐dynamic decision framework, we employ a rolling horizon implementation. The effectiveness and performance of stochastic optimization for MRP are validated by numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the stochastic optimization approaches have the potential to generate significant cost savings compared to traditional methods for production planning and safety stocks determination.},

  abstract     = {Initial deployment decisions are critical to humanitarian organizations as they pre‐position resources and prepare for predictable disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Deploying too few resources results in unmet demand, bad publicity, and unhappy donors. However, deploying a large number of resources can also result in bad publicity and unhappy donors due to high costs and wasted resources when disasters do not occur as expected and deployed items are not managed efficiently. We use a stochastic optimization model to investigate the initial deployment decision and resulting costs. The stochastic model forces the initial deployment decision to be made after the disaster warning, but before the disaster occurs and true demand is realized. We find that a full optimization model (incorporating returns and disposal into the model) will increase the initial deployment level from the level obtained without incorporating returns and disposal (referred to as a partial optimization model ). This allows more beneficiaries to be served when using a full optimization model. We also find that fixed return costs do not have a large impact on initial deployment levels, but can result in a more consolidated pre‐positioning strategy. Using the results of our models, we present several other interesting managerial insights that may be useful for humanitarian organizations in pre‐positioning inventory for predictable disasters.},

We further examine how the interactions among the service dimensions may differ for local and global telephone providers. We used an archival dataset from a survey of more than 3200 cellphone customers across 34 providers in seven South Asian countries that include India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Srilanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and Maldives to test our conjectures. We find that satisfaction with VAS negatively moderates the relationship between core connection satisfaction and overall satisfaction, and satisfaction with CCS positively moderates the relationship between core connection satisfaction and overall satisfaction. Furthermore, the positive and negative interaction effects are stronger for global vs. local providers. We discuss contributions and managerial implications of the findings.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing can be viewed as an e‐business in which the cloud provider sells a range of information technology services and operations over the Internet to firms. Security is a major concern for firms that move to the cloud. The security of a cloud is the joint responsibility of the cloud provider and cloud users. However, the extent to which the provider and users can affect cloud security through their efforts depends on the cloud service model. In this study, we develop a game‐theoretical model to study the impact of the cloud service model on provider and user incentives to exert security effort. Our results show that for a given service model, an increase in the user loss from a security breach induces users to exert more security effort. However, if the provider’s service cost is low, the provider profitably free rides on the enhanced user incentives to exert security effort by diminishing his effort. Analogously, the cloud provider is able to profitably free ride on users’ enhanced incentives to exert security effort when the user population is more homogeneous in terms of either cloud valuation or loss from a security breach, depending on the service cost. Our results also have implications for how a cloud provider could possibly target a particular cloud service model to specific user groups based on their characteristics and likelihood of security loss.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the effects of international taxation on multinational firms’ production outsourcing strategies, which has attracted recent attention from both practitioners and legislators. We formulate a stylized economic model with information asymmetry and find that under the territorial tax system, the presence of global tax disparity may result in subtle changes of a firm&#39;s production outsourcing strategy. In particular, the tax consideration can make a multinational firm more inclined to procure materials by its overseas subsidiary and then resell the materials to the contract manufacturer to retain profit in the low tax jurisdiction. Such an effect can not only cause the firm to choose a more expensive material supplier but also overproduce the products. Therefore, besides the general concern of income shifting, tax considerations can further lead to operational distortions. We show that to reduce tax disparity while preventing tax exemption for shifted foreign profit may lead to a win‐win outcome for the firm and the home country stakeholders. The firm will make more efficient operational decisions to obtain a higher after‐tax profit at a certain reduced tax rate, while the home country stakeholders can receive more tax income. Interestingly, the foreign contract manufacturer may also benefit from such a change.},

  abstract     = {A firm’s product‐cost information is increasingly transparent to consumers as the firm itself or third parties publish such information, which reduces consumers’ uncertainty for the product’s cost. Using a dynamic model of firm pricing with forward‐looking consumer choices, this study assesses how cost transparency affects the firm’s intertemporal price discrimination and profit, as well as the consumers’ strategic waiting decisions and surplus. Ceteris paribus , if consumers believe a durable product has a lower cost, they will expect a larger future price drop and tend to delay purchases, impeding the firm’s ability to engage in intertemporal price discrimination. Without cost transparency, consumers may infer products with higher prices to have higher costs, giving a low‐cost firm incentives to mimic a high‐cost firm’s high price to encourage consumers to buy early. In contrast, a high‐cost firm may choose to distort its price to avoid a low‐cost firm’s price mimicry. Cost transparency reveals the product’s true cost to consumers, limiting the low‐cost firm’s ability to mimic prices. Thus, cost transparency will benefit (harm) a firm with a high (low) cost. In equilibrium, cost transparency will increase the firm’s sales volume and induce more consumers to buy the product earlier instead of later, attenuating strategic waiting by consumers. We also find that cost transparency can lead to higher prices and hurt consumers if the firm has a high cost. In expectation, cost transparency leads to higher firm profits and consumer surplus, facilitating a firm’s new product innovation.},

This has implications for research organizations, diagnostic test manufacturers, and hospital managers among others. To bridge this gap, we develop a Markov decision process (MDP) from which we create “adoption regions” that specify the combination of test characteristics medical research must achieve for the test to be feasible for adoption in practice. To address the curse of dimensionality from patient risk stratification, we develop a decomposition algorithm along with structural properties that shed light on which patients and when a new diagnostic test should be used. In a case study of a partner Emergency Department, we show that the conventional myopic medical criterion can lead to poor decision making in both research development and clinical practice. In particular, we find that specificity—long a secondary consideration and often overlooked in the research process—is, in fact, the key to effective implementation of new tests into clinical environments. This myopic approach can lead to overvaluing or undervaluing new medical research. This mismatch is accentuated when a simple (current) policy is used to integrate research into the clinical environment compared with our MDP’s policy—poor implementation of a new test can also lead to unnecessary rejection. Our framework provides easily interpretable guidelines for medical research development and clinical adoption decisions that can guide medical research as to which test characteristics to focus on to improve the chances of adoption.},

  abstract     = {We empirically investigate the effects of a borrower’s choice of auction‐based pricing mechanisms and her social characteristics on listing outcomes and loan performance in online lending. Analyzing data from a leading online lending platform, we find that the borrower’s choice of borrower pricing mechanism and being affiliated with a group are both associated with higher funding probability; thus, the lenders may interpret them as positive signals of creditworthiness of the borrower. However, these signals are misleading to the lenders as they are actually both associated with higher default risk and greater credit loss (in case of default). In addition, we find that the positive effect of the borrower’s social characteristics on funding probability is smaller when she chooses the borrower pricing mechanism. Moreover, we find that although exerting a positive (negative) effect on loan performance, the number of friends (group affiliation) of the borrower aggravates (reduces) the effect of the group affiliation (number of friends) on loan default risk. Another interesting finding is that, despite having an adverse effect on loan performance, a borrower’s group affiliation, can mitigate the negative effects of the borrower’s requested amount on listing outcomes and loan performance. Our analysis also shows that, in the context of online microloan lending, a borrower’s choice of auction‐based pricing mechanisms is a better predictor of loan performance than some other traditional credit‐related information.},

  abstract     = {The price‐setting newsvendor problem is well studied in the literature. However, it is commonly assumed that retailers have complete demand information modeled as a function of price and random noise. In reality, a retailer may have very limited information on a demand model because a retailer who has exercised only a few prices does not have sufficient information to accurately estimate a demand model. This creates a gap between academic research and practical applications. In this study, we consider the price‐setting newsvendor problem in which the retailer knows the expected demand on a few exercised price points and the distribution of the random noise. Both additive and multiplicative demand models are studied. The retailer makes price and inventory decisions to minimize the maximum regret, which is defined as the difference between the expected profit based on limited demand information and that based on complete demand information. We show that this robust optimization problem can be reduced to a one‐dimensional optimization problem, and we derive the optimal price and inventory decisions. We also provide a demand learning policy that can reduce the minmax regret to any δ within O ( 1 δ ) steps. We also study the problem in which the retailer maximizes the worst‐case profit, and we obtain similar results. Extensive numerical studies show that our method has a great performance that dominates that of the regression method.},

Specifically, while a more innovative product may deliver better product performance, without sufficient development time, the product may not be as reliable given that innovations require a time buffer to conduct many iterations of product testing and improvement. We further examine the impact of a government‐imposed minimum product reliability standard on the firm, the product, and on social welfare. We find that contrary to common belief, a minimum product reliability standard set by the government may induce more unreliable products or hurt consumer surplus and social welfare. We also find that regulation, besides being a cost burden to the firm, can serve as a credible commitment for product reliability typically not observable to the customers when they are making purchasing decisions. Correspondingly, the regulation may have the surprising effect of increasing firm profit or prompting product innovation. Our work is useful in informing regulators in different industries of how decisions concerning government regulation could impact product reliability.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the newest contract offered by Amazon.com, called the Advantage Program, we study a supply chain where a retailer offers a vendor‐managed inventory with consignment contract to n suppliers for selling their products. A key parameter in the contract is the product list price that the retailer allows each supplier to choose for its own product. The retailer then sets the retail price of each product at or below its list price for selling it to the market and remits its supplier an amount equal to a prespecified percentage of its list price on each unit sold. Two alternative consignment contracts are also considered with only one deviation where the retailer chooses the retail price of each product freely, or the retailer sets the retail price of each product at or above its list price. We show that the supplier’s list price plays a major role in determining firms’ decisions and performance in equilibrium. In particular, we find that by committing the retail price of each product to not exceeding the list price set by its supplier, the retailer can improve its own performance and the channel performance without hurting each supplier.},

The service‐dominant (S‐D) logic argues that value to consumers is always co‐created by service providers and consumers jointly and reciprocally. While prior research has addressed the indirect impact of structural, infrastructural, and technology service design attributes on a customer’s perceived value via the realized service delivery system, an important question remains unanswered: Do these strategic service design attributes directly affect co‐created service choice? In this study, we explicitly consider the extent to which service delivery design characteristics—structural, infrastructural, and technology attributes— directly affect this co‐created choice. Using detailed patient‐level data from Florida hospitals on elective hip and knee surgeries, we find evidence of structural, infrastructural, and technological influences on patient–surgeon co‐created choice of hospitals. We also find that the characteristics of the service encounter—in this case, the interpersonal care experience—interact in essential ways with these design attributes to influence co‐created service choice. Specifically, structural and technological attributes may serve as a substitute for interpersonal care experience in determining co‐created choice of a hospital. These results inform our understanding of how patients choose hospitals for elective surgeries under conditions of information asymmetry. An extended analysis of data for elective heart surgery patients generally supports our framework. Theoretical and practical implications of our results are discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we examine whether it is optimal to use electric vehicles (EVs) in the car sharing market and investigate the environmental impact of pulling the EVs from the market. We develop a model consisting of a profit‐maximizing car sharing company (CSC) and a population of utility‐maximizing customers. The CSC sets the number of EVs, the number of fuel vehicles (FVs), and the rental price jointly to maximize its profit. Customers decide whether to use EVs, FVs, or public transportation to complete their trips considering the rental price. We show that it is optimal to use EVs only if the charging speed, the number of charging stations, and the range of EVs are high enough. Among these three conditions, the recharging speed is the most important and the number of charging stations is more important than the range of EVs. We also find that including EVs in the car sharing market may lead to a higher total emission when ignoring customers’ other transportation choices (due to a lower rental price that results in a higher usage rate). Moreover, we consider the problem with the objective of maximizing the social welfare and find that when considering the environmental impact, governments should tax the CSC to induce a higher rental price and when ignoring this impact, they should subsidize the CSC to reduce the rental price. We demonstrate our results with the case study of Car2go. These results are in line with that the slow recharging speed may have been one of the contributing factors to that Car2go replaced EVs with FVs in San Diego.},

The proposed approach allows a flexible structure for stochastic processes with fat tail distributions, such as jump diffusion, regime switch or mean reversion and provides a more accurate estimate of the extreme downside risk by allowing negative values for the underlying project values. Our illustrative example shows that the value of a real option estimated by the proposed approach is more accurate and stable than the alternative lattice‐based approaches in the literature under a wide variety of underlying commodity process, which makes this a more robust approach for valuing complex real options under multiple sources of uncertainty in the volatile real world.},

  abstract     = {The sharing economy has developed rapidly in recent years using both business‐to‐customer (B2C) and customer‐to‐customer (C2C) models. This has exerted a profound impact on incumbent firms that follow a traditional sales model. Although the effects of B2C or C2C sharing in certain scenarios have been studied by prior literature, the effect of external B2C sharing has not been considered. Furthermore, the possible distinction between the two sharing effects as well as incumbent firms’ decisions on the sales and sharing models under the internal and external environments have not been addressed. This study compares the effects of B2C and C2C sharing in an internal sharing scenario where an incumbent firm can extend into the sharing business. Due to the difference in sharing agents, we also consider an external sharing scenario where an independent entrant firm can provide B2C or C2C sharing and strategically set price. From the perspectives of product cost and sharing transaction cost, we present several new managerial insights to expand on existing literature. First, under the internal sharing scenario, interestingly, the incumbent firm benefits from extending into the B2C or C2C sharing business only when the product cost is above a threshold, and it prefers to extend into the C2C sharing business unless the per‐period transaction cost of C2C sharing is much higher than that of B2C sharing. In addition, it is shown that the incumbent firm may need to produce more products for sales, or maintain lower sharing supply when it extends into the B2C sharing business than those when it extends C2C sharing, which is somewhat counter‐intuitive. Under the external sharing scenario, we observe that the B2C sharing business benefits the incumbent firm merely when the product cost is high, similar to the impact of C2C sharing. Meanwhile, if the per‐period transaction cost of C2C sharing is much higher than that of B2C sharing, then the positive impact of external B2C sharing on the incumbent firm’s profitability should be stronger than that of external C2C sharing. Moreover, external B2C sharing actually increases the sales demand of the incumbent firm under the conditions of low product cost and high sharing transaction cost, while external C2C sharing might increase it as well in the condition of high product cost. Both external B2C and C2C sharing may lead to a higher rental price than internal sharing in the presence of high product cost. Furthermore, even though the product cost is low, there should be higher customer surplus and total social welfare in the external B2C or C2C sharing scenarios. For constructing a comprehensive framework of sharing scenarios, we also extend our model to a setting where the incumbent firm could extend both B2C and C2C sharing in the internal and external environments. It is shown that the incumbent firm always extends into the sharing business to compete against the entrant firm in the external sharing scenario.},

However, when no ground truth information is available on experts’ decisions, the evaluation of expert workers typically requires enlisting peer‐experts, and this form of evaluation is prohibitively costly in many important settings. In this work, we develop a data‐driven approach for producing effective rankings based on the decision quality of expert workers; our approach leverages historical data on past decisions, which are commonly available in organizational information systems. Specifically, we first formulate a new business data science problem: Ranking Expert decision makers’ unobserved decision Quality (REQ) using only historical decision data and excluding evaluation by peer experts. The REQ problem is challenging because the correct decisions in our settings are unknown (unobserved) and because some of the information used by decision makers might not be available for retrospective evaluation. To address the REQ problem, we develop a machine‐learning–based approach and analytically and empirically explore conditions under which our approach is advantageous. Our empirical results over diverse settings and datasets show that our method yields robust performance: Its rankings of expert workers are consistently either superior or at least comparable to those obtained by the best alternative approach. Accordingly, our method constitutes a de facto benchmark for future research on the REQ problem.},

Building on a framework of creativity capability, rooted in behavioral literature, and intrinsic (vs. extrinsic) motivation, derived from personnel economics and social psychology literature, this study predicts the influence of feedback on ideation performance. Specifically, the effectiveness of feedback on ideation performance in firm‐sponsored, non–financially incentivized, idea‐crowdsourcing communities may depend on its valence (positive vs. negative), source (peers vs. firm), and ideators’ ideation experience. Field data, obtained using text‐mining techniques from an idea‐crowdsourcing community, reveal that the effects of positive (negative) peer feedback for increasing (decreasing) subsequent idea quality strengthen (weaken) as ideators gain experience. However, the effects of positive (negative) firm feedback for increasing (decreasing) subsequent idea quality weaken with ideation experience. Experienced ideators are more motivated (less demotivated) to improve subsequent ideation performance when they receive positive peer (negative firm) feedback; inexperienced ideators are less motivated by negative peer feedback but more motivated by positive firm feedback. The results are robust to tests with alternative field data and model specifications, as validated by a controlled laboratory experiment. They also suggest feedback strategies that managers can use to boost customer ideation performance in crowdsourcing contexts.},

  abstract     = {We study a stylized dynamic assortment planning problem during a selling season of finite length T . At each time period, the seller offers an arriving customer an assortment of substitutable products and the customer makes the purchase among offered products according to a discrete choice model. The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or equivalently, to minimize the worst‐case expected regret. One key challenge is that utilities of products are unknown to the seller and need to be learned. Although the dynamic assortment planning problem has received increasing attention in revenue management, most existing work is based on the multinomial logit choice models (MNL). In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic assortment planning under a more general choice model—the nested logit model, which models hierarchical choice behavior and is “the most widely used member of the GEV (generalized extreme value) family” (Train 2009). By leveraging the revenue‐ordered structure of the optimal assortment within each nest, we develop a novel upper confidence bound (UCB) policy with an aggregated estimation scheme. Our policy simultaneously learns customers’ choice behavior and makes dynamic decisions on assortments based on the current knowledge. It achieves the accumulated regret at the order of O ∼ ( MNT ) , where M is the number of nests and N is the number of products in each nest. We further provide a lower bound result of Ω ( MT ) , which shows the near optimality of the upper bound when T is much larger than M and N . When the number of items per nest N is large, we further provide a discretization heuristic for better performance of our algorithm. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms.},

We discuss this alternative modeling strategy, focusing on Lévy processes. As an illustration, we show that it substantially increases the optimal policy value in a simplified merchant natural gas storage setting. Further, we highlight potential implications of using this approach to formulate realistic energy and commodity operations models. Our work has broader relevance for modeling the dynamics of both other market variables and operational quantities, such as exchange rates and demand forecasts.

  abstract     = {Warehouse club (WC) retailers have typically expanded to new markets using stand‐alone stores, rather than pursuing dense store networks as other (non‐WC) retailers have in the past. While this strategy generates operating efficiencies, it also imposes high travel costs on households to shop, which calls into question WC stores&#39; resilience to spatial competition from stores operating other formats. We examine this phenomenon by using data on households&#39; shopping activity across markets served by Costco Wholesale stores. Specifically, we evaluate these stores&#39; resilience to spatial competition by estimating the share of households&#39; expenditures relative to travel costs to shop at the stores and comparing this estimate with that for non‐WC stores. Controlling for households&#39; travel costs across Costco and non‐WC stores, we find that households&#39; share of expenditures at Costco stores exceeds the share at non‐WC stores by 61%. This suggests that Costco stores have an advantage over non‐WC stores when serving market areas with sparse store networks. Nevertheless, we also find that this advantage diminishes with the distance between Costco stores and households and that there is a finite distance beyond which this advantage disappears. We show that this distance (approximately 21 miles) is an important reference point for the evaluation of spatial competition between Costco stores and other stores and the examination of demand saturation at Costco stores.},

The motivation to study this problem was because a firm faced availability constraints for one of its slow‐moving high‐margin products, but the available quantities still exceeded the current demand. To identify customers to nudge, we develop a support vector machine (SVM) approach to rank order the customers based on their propensity to purchase the product. The underlying notion in our approach is that Type I errors, to be defined in the paper, in our classifier are not necessarily problematic but are potential nudging targets. Also, as a consequence, traditional ways of evaluating classifiers (with Type I and Type II errors) are not appropriate. Therefore, we conduct a field experiment to evaluate how well the identified customers are nudged through information and/or couponing. We find that in terms of the successful nudges, our SVM‐based approach performed better than other approaches. The experiment also generated insights about when couponing as opposed to information is more effective when nudging.},
