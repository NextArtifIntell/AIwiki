  abstract     = {Graphene, a relatively new two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial, possesses unique structure (e.g. lighter, harder, and more flexible than steel) and tunable physicochemical (e.g. electronical, optical) properties with potentially wide eco-friendly and cost-effective usage in biosensing. Furthermore, graphene-related nanomaterials (e.g. graphene oxide, doped graphene, carbon nanotubes) have inculcated tremendous interest among scientists and industrials for the development of innovative biosensing platforms, such as arrays, sequencers and other nanooptical/biophotonic sensing systems (e.g. FET, FRET, CRET, GERS). Indeed, combinatorial functionalization approaches are constantly improving the overall properties of graphene, such as its sensitivity, stability, specificity, selectivity, and response for potential bioanalytical applications. These include real-time multiplex detection, tracking, qualitative, and quantitative characterization of molecules (i.e. analytes [H 2 O 2 , urea, nitrite, ATP or NADH]; ions [Hg 2+ , Pb 2+ , or Cu 2+ ]; biomolecules (DNA, iRNA, peptides, proteins, vitamins or glucose; disease biomarkers such as genetic alterations in BRCA1, p53) and cells (cancer cells, stem cells, bacteria, or viruses). However, there is still a paucity of comparative reports that critically evaluate the relative toxicity of carbon nanoallotropes in humans. This manuscript comprehensively reviews the biosensing applications of graphene and its derivatives (i.e. GO and rGO). Prospects and challenges are also introduced.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing number of molecular biology techniques, large numbers of oligonucleotides are frequently involved in individual research projects. Thus, a dedicated electronic oligonucleotide management system is expected to provide several benefits such as increased oligonucleotide traceability, facilitated sharing of oligonucleotides between laboratories, and simplified (bulk) ordering of oligonucleotides. Herein, we describe OligoPrime, an information system for oligonucleotide management, which presents a computational support for all steps in an oligonucleotide lifecycle, namely, from its ordering and storage to its application, and disposal. OligoPrime is easy to use since it is accessible via a web browser and does not require any installation from the end user’s perspective. It allows filtering and search of oligonucleotides by various parameters, which include the exact location of an oligonucleotide, its sequence, and availability. The oligonucleotide database behind the system is shared among the researchers working in the same laboratory or research group. Users might have different roles which define the access permissions and range from students to researchers and primary investigators. Furthermore, OligoPrime is easy to manage and install and is based on open-source software solutions. Its code is freely available at https://github.com/OligoPrime . Moreover, an implementation of OligoPrime, which can be used for testing is available at http://oligoprime.xyz/ . To our knowledge, OligoPrime is the only software solution dedicated specifically to oligonucleotide management. We strongly believe that it has a large potential to enhance the transparency of use and to simplify the management of oligonucleotides in academic laboratories and research groups.},
