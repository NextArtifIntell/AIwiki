  abstract     = {Due to complex background and volatile object shape-appearance in image, the stability and accuracy of tracking algorithm is often disturbed and reduced. So how to accurately and robustly track object in object tracking application is a challenge topic at home and abroad. Built upon the methodologies of compressive tracking and spatio-temporal context, a simple yet robust object tracking method is proposed for solving the drift and occlusion problems in paper. It combines two existing classical ideas into a single framework: adaptive weighted idea and occlusion detection mechanism. In order to weaken interference problems of object background, object area is firstly partitioned into equal-sized sub-patches and the different weight related with location information is assigned for each patch; Then, for improving its robustness, Bhattacharyya distance is adopted to find out these samples with maximum discrimination; In addition, our proposed occlusion detection mechanism is for recapturing the tracked object when occlusion occurs. Many simulation experiments show that our proposed algorithm achieves more favorable performance than these existing state-of-the-art algorithms in handing various challenging infrared videos, especially occlusion and shape deformation.},

In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract the 3 D mesh of a flag from a single image and drive the flag model to flutter with virtual wind. A deep convolutional neural fields model is first used to generate a depth map of a single image. Based on the Alpha Shape, a coarse 2 D mesh of flag is reconstructed by sampling at different depth regions. Then, we optimize the mesh to generate a mesh with depth based on Restricted Frontal-Delaunay. We transform the Delaunay mesh with depth into a simple spring model and use a velocity-based solver to calculate the moving position of the virtual flag model. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can construct a realistic fluttering flag video from a single image.},

SSC induces the sparsity through minimizing the l 1 -norm of the data matrix while LRR promotes a low-rank structure through minimizing the nuclear norm. In this paper, considering the problem of fitting a union of subspace to a collection of data points drawn from one more subspaces and corrupted by noise, we pose this problem as a non-convex optimization problem, where the goal is to decompose the corrupted data matrix as the sum of a clean and self-expressive dictionary plus a matrix of noise. We propose a new algorithm, named Low-Rank and Sparse Subspace Clustering with a Clean dictionary (LRS2C2), by combining SSC and LRR, as the representation is often both sparse and low-rank. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through experiments on motion segmentation and image clustering.},

The problem was represented as a binary integer programming model and solved exactly. However, the exact method was not able to return results for large instances. We therefore considered a heuristic approach. A number of heuristics were implemented and compared on static and dynamic reshuffle problems including four new heuristics introduced here. Since heuristics are known to be instance dependent, we proposed a compatibility test to evaluate how well they work when combined to solve a reshuffle problem. Computational results of our methods on realistic instances are reported to be competitive and satisfactory.},

Precisely we will focus on possible choices of loss functions and compare their efficiency in solving differential equations through a series of numerical experiments. In particular, a comparative investigation is performed between the natural neural networks and Ritz neural networks, with and without penalty for the boundary conditions. The sensitivity on the accuracy of the neural networks with respect to the size of training set, the number of nodes, and the penalty parameter is also studied. In order to better understand the training behavior of the proposed neural networks, we further investigate the approximation properties of the neural networks in function fitting.

However, we were able to obtain accurate results when some degree of time discretisation is inbuilt into the process. While this means that the advantage of using the Laplace transform to obtain solutions for any time t is not fully exploited, the method does allow for considerably larger time steps than is otherwise possible for finite-difference methods.},

In this paper, a convolutional neural network is trained to determine optimal values for these parameters for the specific case of the matrix exponential. The matrix exponential e A is estimated by numerically inverting the corresponding resolvent matrix ( s I − A ) − 1 via the Weeks method at ( σ , b ) pairs provided by the network. For illustration, classes of square real matrices of size three to six are studied. For these small matrices, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and rational approximations can be utilized to obtain values to compare with the results from the network derived estimates. The network learned by minimizing the error of the matrix exponentials from the Weeks method over a large data set spanning ( σ , b ) pairs. Network training using the Jacobi identity as a metric was found to yield a self-contained approach that does not require a truth matrix exponential for comparison.},

This paper proposes an automatic and selective segmentation model that can segment a feature that has two distinct intensities by a single click. A patch like idea is employed to design our two stage model, given only one geometric marker to indicate the location of the inside region. The difficult case where the inside region is leaning towards the boundary of the interested feature is investigated with recommendations given and reliability tested.

When there is relative motion between the imaging system and the target, sizable deviations between the measurement values and the real values can occur and result in poor image quality of the reconstructed target. To solve this problem, a novel dynamic compressive imaging system is proposed. In this system, a single-column digital micro-mirror device is used to modulate the target image, and the compressive measurement values are obtained for each column of the image. Based on analysis of the measurement values, a new recovery model of dynamic compressive imaging is given. Differing from traditional reconstruction results, the measurement values of any column of vectors in the target image can be used to reconstruct the vectors of two adjacent columns at the same time. Contingent upon characteristics of the results, a method of image quality enhancement based on an overlapping average algorithm is proposed. Simulation experiments and analysis show that the proposed dynamic compressive imaging can effectively reconstruct the target image; and that when the moving speed of the system changes within a certain range, the system reconstructs a better original image. The system overcomes the impact of dynamically changing speeds, and affords significantly better performance than traditional compressive imaging.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the numerical solution for the time fractional differential equations (TFDEs). We propose a parallel in time method, combined with a spectral collocation scheme and the finite difference scheme for the TFDEs. The parallel in time method follows the same sprit as the domain decomposition that consists in breaking the domain of computation into subdomains and solving iteratively the sub-problems over each subdomain in a parallel way. Concretely, the iterative scheme falls in the category of the predictor-corrector scheme, where the predictor is solved by finite difference method in a sequential way, while the corrector is solved by computing the difference between spectral collocation and finite difference method in a parallel way. The solution of the iterative method converges to the solution of the spectral method with high accuracy. Some numerical tests are performed to confirm the efficiency of the method in three areas: (i) convergence behaviors with respect to the discretization parameters are tested; (ii) the overall CPU time in parallel machine is compared with that for solving the original problem by spectral method in a single processor; (iii) for the fixed precision, while the parallel elements grow larger, the iteration number of the parallel method always keep constant, which plays the key role in the efficiency of the time parallel method.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the convergence speed and optimization accuracy of the bat algorithm, a bat optimization algorithm with moderate optimal orientation and random perturbation of trend is proposed. The algorithm introduces the nonlinear variation factor into the velocity update formula of the global search stage to maintain a high diversity of bat populations, thereby enhanced the global exploration ability of the algorithm. At the same time, in the local search stage, the position update equation is changed, and a strategy that towards optimal value modestly is used to improve the ability of the algorithm to local search for deep mining. Finally, the adaptive decreasing random perturbation is performed on each bat individual that have been updated in position at each generation, which can improve the ability of the algorithm to jump out of the local extremum, and to balance the early global search extensiveness and the later local search accuracy. The simulating results show that the improved algorithm has a faster optimization speed and higher optimization accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces the second-hand market into the famous ski-rental model, presents an online rental problem of durable equipment with a transaction cost, and designs an optimal deterministic competitive strategy. The traditional competitive analysis is based on the worst-case scenario; hence, its results are too conservative. Even though investors want to manage and control their risks in reality, in some cases, they are willing to undertake higher risk to obtain greater benefits. Considering this situation, this study designs a risk strategy combining the decision makers’ risk tolerance with certain and probabilistic forecasts. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed risk strategy can improve the competitive ratio. This study introduces the idea of risk compensation into traditional competitive analysis and designs strategies for online rental of durable equipment based on forecast. The decision maker selects a strategy according to risk tolerance and forecast. If the forecast is correct, then a reward is obtained; otherwise, the risk is guaranteed to be within the decision maker’s risk tolerance. The optimal restricted ratio, that is, the competitive ratio of a risk strategy, is less than the optimal competitive ratio of a deterministic strategy. Therefore, the performance of the proposed risk strategy is better than a deterministic strategy. At the same time, the risk strategy based on the probabilistic forecast represents an extension of the strategy based on a certain forecast. In other words, the risk strategy based on a certain forecast is a special case of the risk strategy based on the probabilistic forecast.},

Numerical results on non-trivial MOLP problems show that EMSA and BOA are at par and superior in terms of the quality of a most preferred nondominated point to ASIMOLP.

However, in the existing semi-supervised learning problem based on the LRR method, graph construction and semi-supervised learning are two separate steps. Therefore, the existing label information in the data set is not well used to guide the construction of the affinity graph. Therefore, these methods do not guarantee that the final result is a global optimal solution. This paper proposes a graph regularized low-rank representation for semi-supervised learning, called GLR2S2. This method combines the construction of affinity graph with semi supervised learning and unifies them into an optimization framework. By solving the joint optimization problem, the global optimal solution can be obtained. Experimental results on several standard data sets show that the GLR2S2 method proposed in this paper is effective.},

The method proposed in this paper learns the latent space representation of multi view data samples, and performs the data reconstruction on the latent space. The algorithm can cluster data in the latent representation space and use the relationship of different views. However, the traditional representation-based method does not consider the non-linear geometry inside the data, and may lose the local and similar information between the data in the learning process. By using the graph regularization method, we can not only capture the global low dimensional structural features of data, but also fully capture the nonlinear geometric structure information of data. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and its performance is better than most of the existing alternatives.},

However, if targets are closely spaced and performing maneuvers, the performance of a Gaussian inverse Wishart probability hypothesis density filter will decline. The reason for this is that the measurement partitioning approaches fail to provide accurate partitions, which influences the component updating process directly. This paper presents a modified prediction partitioning algorithm for the Gaussian inverse Wishart probability hypothesis density filter in order to solve the partitioning problem of closely spaced targets. The inaccuracy of the target prediction information occurred by target maneuvers leads to the above problem, thus a modified prediction partitioning algorithm will label the components and corresponding measurements to improve the prediction accuracy.

We study 994 breast cancer mutation samples, including 15,015 mutation genes, and use social network algorithm to screen key genes. In order to analyze the relationship between electron–ion interaction pseudopotential and mutation of key genes, this paper proposes the E difference formula. It not only analyses gene mutation at the physical level, but also explains the mutation rule of single base. Simultaneously, we use the Kaplan–Meier to analyze the overall survival rate of breast cancer samples and use Tarone-Ware to test. The results showed that mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA, and TP53 are significant difference in overall survival rate of breast cancer ( CI = 95 % , P &lt; 0.05 ). Proteins often interact to form protein complexes, and driving protein function. Therefore, by constructing protein–protein interaction network and finding modular proteins of key genes, we can find genes closely related to key genes. Finally, the results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and gene ontology function enrichment analysis show that key genes played an important role in metabolic pathways and biological functions.

Based on the analysis of whale optimization algorithm, we point out the disadvantages of whale optimization algorithm, and propose a modified whale optimization algorithm algorithm from four aspects: choice regarding the dimension, exploration control, encircling prey modified, and candidate solution selection. The experimental results based on 34 benchmark functions demonstrate that the proposed modified whale optimization algorithm has better accuracy. The modified whale optimization algorithm is used to predict software reliability by predicting the faults during the software testing process using software faults’ historical data. The proposed modified whale optimization algorithm shows significant advantages in handling a variety of modeling problems such as the exponential model, power model, delayed s-shaped model, and modified sigmoid model. Experimental results show that the fitting accuracy of the modified sigmoid model model is minimal on three data sets.

To address this problem, we introduce a decorrelation regularizer into the formulation of non-negative representation based classifier and propose a discriminative non-negative representation based classifier for pattern classification. The decorrelation regularizer is able to reduce the correlation of representation results of different classes, thus promoting the competition among them.

The constraint takes the form of an energetic penalty for a suitable geodesic distance between all pairs of points in the domain. The main application of our method presented here is a discrete steepest descent of a phase-field version of a bending energy with spontaneous curvature and additional surface area penalty. This leads to disconnected surfaces without our topological constraint but connected surfaces with the constraint. Numerically, our constraint is treated by first transforming the double integral over all pairs of points in the domain to a weighted graph structure and then using Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the distance between discrete connected components.},

  abstract     = {The mean curvature-based image deblurring model is widely used to enhance the quality of the deblurred images. However, the discretization of the associated Euler–Lagrange equations produces a nonlinear ill-conditioned system which affects the convergence of the numerical algorithms such as Krylov subspace methods (generalized minimal residual etc.) To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we present three new circulant preconditioners. An efficient algorithm is presented for the mean curvature-based image deblurring problem, which combines a fixed point iteration with new preconditioned matrices to handle the nonlinearity and ill-conditioned nature of the large system. The eigenvalues analysis is also presented in the paper. Fast convergence has shown in the numerical results by using the proposed new circulant preconditioners.},

The Laguerre function collocation method (based on the Lagrange interpolation) in space and the Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto collocation method in time are used. A Newton iterative algorithm is provided.

  abstract     = {Greenhouse gas emissions have brought serious negative impacts on human beings and organisms, so energy saving and emission reduction have been recognized by more and more people. Traditional Milk-run model seldom considers the factors of energy saving and emission reduction, and its routing optimization cannot meet the current needs of low-carbon economic development. On the basis of traditional Vehicle Routing Problem research, considering the fixed cost, time penalty cost, energy consumption cost and carbon emission cost of vehicles, the Milk-run model of distribution routing considering carbon emissions under time window constraints is studied. Then the improved ant colony algorithm is used to solve the constructed model. Finally, the order and related data of a company are used to verify the validity and practicality of the model and algorithm. Compared to the scanning method, the results show that not only the total journey distance has been shortened but also the total cost and cost of carbon emissions have been reduced. The optimization of distribution routing considering carbon emissions can reduce the distribution cost of logistics enterprises, respond to the call of low-carbon development in China and help to achieve a win-win situation of social and economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {Image stitching can be employed to stitch images taken from different times, perspectives, or devices into a panorama with a wider view. However, the imaging specification of images to be stitched is strict. If the imaging specification is not satisfied, artefacts caused by inaccurate alignment and unnatural distortion will occur. Semantic segmentation can solve the classification problem at the pixel level; however, image stitching significantly depends on the accuracy of feature points. Therefore, this paper proposes an image stitching algorithm based on semantic segmentation to guide feature point classification and seam fusion. First, the images are recognized by a cascade semantic segmentation network, and the image feature points are classified. Thereafter, the corresponding homography transformations are calculated using different class feature points, and the best homography mapping for the entire target image is selected. Finally, a seam-cutting algorithm based on semantic segmentation is used to compute the seam, and a feathering Poisson fusion with distance transformation is used to eliminate artefacts and light differences. Experiments show that the algorithm can generate transitional natural and perceptual stitching results even under the influence of perspective and light differences.},
