  abstract     = {This study aimed to examine the effects of age and the task difficulty on postural sway, variability and complexity. The participants were 90 able-bodied individuals including children ( n = 39; age: 5.89 ± 0.94 years), young adults ( n = 30; age: 23.23 ± 1.61 years) and older adults ( n = 21; age: 64.59 ± 5.24 years) who took part in different balance tasks that had different levels of cognitive and physical challenges. The main dependent variables were postural sway area, postural variability and postural complexity. The participants stood on a standard force plate for 10 s in each task condition, and the centre of pressure displacement was collected at 100-Hz sampling frequency. The results of this study showed that children and older adults, in the more difficult tasks, had greater sway area and complexity and less postural variability. In addition, there was a linear trend in the stability measures as the difficulty of the task was increased. In conclusion, special populations, such as children and older adults, were more sensitive to the balance changes and used active control mechanisms to minimise the risk of losing balance in more challenging conditions.},

  abstract     = {Boundaries are prominent ingredients of reality, including—most importantly—the boundaries of organisms and the perceived boundaries of things (their surfaces). It is also customary to think of minds as kinds of bounded loci for thoughts, representations, and other internal entities, targeting the borderline between the internal domain and the external world as a genuine barrier. Therefore, not surprisingly, boundaries and surfaces have become targets of disciplined formal-ontological investigations. However, to have a boundary (or surface) is not only a purely geometrical or topological feature, for boundaries play certain roles. For that reason, this article unpacks boundaries in general, and surfaces in particular, in terms of interactions between structured entities, most importantly—living creatures capable of (minimal) cognition. It is argued that boundaries should be thought of as products of and at the same time as critical constraints imposed on structural coupling between complex beings, including the interactions between the (minimally) cognitive subjects and their surroundings.},

  abstract     = {Today aging of society is becoming increasingly important. Many people want to live at home as long as possible. Very often this leads to accidents at home, which are unnoticed for a long time and therefore cause severe complications. We propose a cyber-physical system consisting of sensors for motion, light, temperature, and so on, which monitors the behavior of elderly people but is non-invasive in the sense that the persons are not observed by a camera and must not wear certain sensors on their body. Unusual behavior or accidents are registered in-time by a change point detection algorithm based on Markov chains, which does not store any data with the exception of the last datum, so that also the integrity of the elderly people is preserved. For verification of this algorithm, a cyber-physical test environment has been programmed which allows to simulate human common and uncommon behavior in house during day and night. This simulation environment is based on behavior trees and decision theory. The verification results suggest that the implemented cyber-physical system for change point and anomaly detection could be successfully used in the real environment of elderly people to give them help in-time when an accident occurs.},

  abstract     = {Spatial information can be valuable, but new environments may be perceived as risky and thus often evoke fear responses and risk-averse exploration strategies such as thigmotaxis or wall-following behavior. Individual differences in risk-taking (boldness) and thigmotaxis have been reported in natural taxa, which may benefit their survival. In neurorobotic, the common approach is to reproduce cognitive phenomena with multiple levels of bio-inspiration into robotic scenarios. Since autonomous robots may benefit from these different behaviors in exploration tasks, this study aims at simulating two exploration strategies in a virtual robot controlled by a spiking neural network. The experimental context consists in a visual learning task solved through an operant conditioning procedure. Results suggest that the proposed neural architecture sustains both behaviors, switching from one to the other by external cues. This original bio-inspired model could be used as a first step toward further investigations of neurorobotic personality modulated by learning and complex exploration contexts.},

A combination of deep neural networks for offline unsupervised learning of low-dimensional features from images and of online learning of shallow neural networks representing the inverse and forward kinematics of the system have been used. The artificial curiosity system assigns interest values to a set of pre-defined goals and drives the exploration towards those that are expected to maximise the learning progress. We propose the integration of an episodic memory in intrinsic motivation systems to face catastrophic forgetting issues, typically experienced when performing online updates of artificial neural networks. Our results show that adopting an episodic memory system not only prevents the computational models from quickly forgetting knowledge that has been previously acquired but also provides new avenues for modulating the balance between plasticity and stability of the models.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the learning walks of the ant Ocymyrmex robustior , the original multi-snapshot model was introduced, which—in contrast to the classical “single snapshot at the goal” model—collects multiple snapshots in the vicinity of the goal location that subsequently can be used for homing, that is, for guiding the return to the goal. In this study, we show that the multi-snapshot model can be generalized to homing in three dimensions. In addition to capturing snapshots at positions shifted in all three dimensions, we suggest to decouple the home direction from the orientation of snapshots and to associate a home vector with each snapshot. We then propose a modification of the multi-snapshot model for three-dimensional route following and evaluate its performance in an accurate reconstruction of a real environment. As an illumination-invariant alternative to grayscale images, we also examine sky-segmented images. We use spherical harmonics as efficient representation of panoramic images enabling low memory usage and fast similarity estimation of rotated images. The results show that our approach can steer an agent reliably along a route, making it also suitable for robotic applications using on-board computers with limited resources.},

In this article, I examine the implications of the theories of autopoiesis and natural drift for an organism-centered view of evolution.

It is also a tribute to John Stewart who accompanied the first stages of this research. Having already examined the difficulties surrounding questions of the perception of exteriority within the framework of enactive approaches, we will proceed in two stages. The first stage will consist of an attempt to explain distal perception in terms of individual sensorimotor invariants. This poses the problem but fails to solve it. The second stage will propose a new pathway to account for spatial perception; a pathway that does not deny the initial intuitions of the autopoietic enactive approaches, but one which radically changes the conception of cognition by considering, from the perceptual stage, the need to take into account interindividual interactions. The protocol of an original experimental study will characterize this new approach considering the perceptual experience of objects at a distance, in exteriority, in a space of possibilities without parting from the domain of interaction. To do this, we have to work at the limits of the perceptual crossing, that is, at the moment when the perceptual reciprocity between different subjects begins to disappear.},

Once it is deprived of its representational tinsels, intentionality appears to us again as a property of object-directedness. Nevertheless, is the autopoietic model of intentionality as object-directedness coherent and convincing?

  abstract     = {This article tries to offer a different perspective on the issue of what it means for some physical structure to be a representation. In the first sections, it will be shown how and why this issue is still far from settled. This will be done by emphasizing the—what I will call—metaphysically promiscuous character of representation. For although representations are typically assumed to be some sort of physical objects or structures, on closer inspection, the notion of representation is used in such a variety of ways that its fundamental metaphysical status is far from obvious. Proceeding from these observations, it will be argued that, even though “representation” pre-theoretically indeed often picks out objects, their representational status is best not understood in terms of their physical properties or their causal-functional profile. It will be argued that, what it means for some physical structure to be—as a matter of fact—a representation, only first becomes intelligible in relation to certain socio-normative practices in which the cognitive capacity to relate to something as something it is not is prescriptively called upon. Moreover, an answer to the oft-heard question of what makes something (i.e., some physical object or structure) a representation is readily available, provided we take into account certain cognitive abilities, as well as a socio-normative context in which these abilities are normatively regulated. It will be concluded that at the fundamental metaphysical level, the phenomenon of representation is best understood as a triadic relation which involves , but does not reduce to, certain physical objects or structures. Finally, this socio-normative account of representation will be compared with two dominant notions of representation within cognitive science: symbolic representation and S-representation.},

Inspired by the effective use of pheromones in social insects, pheromonal communication has been adopted to swarm robotics domain using diverse approaches such as alcohol, RFID tags and light. COSΦ is one of the light-based artificial pheromone systems which can emulate realistic pheromones and environment properties through the system. This article provides a significant improvement to the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel artificial pheromone system that simulates pheromones with environmental effects by adopting a model of spatio-temporal development of pheromone derived from a flow of fluid in nature. Using the proposed system, we investigated the collective behaviour of a robot swarm in a bio-inspired aggregation scenario, where robots aggregated on a circular pheromone cue with different environmental factors, that is, diffusion and pheromone shift. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed pheromone system for use in swarm robotic applications.},

Benefit 1: The model can explain a phenomenon that the posterior moves little behind the head. Our model showed such movement causes efficient movement. Benefit 2: The model can explain inching as crawling. The rod model cannot explain inching because the model cannot change the body length. Our balloon model can change the body length drastically and can locomote faster. Benefit 3: The model does not use the stiff organ. Benefit 4: The model can explain the phenomenon called “environmental skeleton,” which causes the body to contract during the locomotion. The balloon model can change body length and create power between the head and posterior. This model not only simulates the behavior closer to the actual caterpillar but also can explain the caterpillar with a soft element.},

Therefore, to realize a robot with adaptable behavior, it should be enabled to adjust its morphology accordingly in response to environmental changes. From this perspective, this study introduces the development of a bipedal robot with adaptive morphology. By implementing an actuator network system (ANS), the robot is able to manipulate the physical characteristics of its legs and the way they interact with each other. Two experiments have been conducted: main and supplementary experiments. The main experiment examined how effective is adjusting the robot’s morphology on changing the robot’s behavior. The experiment was conducted on different ground materials and under different connection patterns between the robot’s legs. During the experiment, the robot’s behavior was evaluated in reference to four aspects: walking style, stability, speed, and moving direction. The supplementary experiment took the results of the main experiment and used it to improve the robot’s behavior during locomotion. The robot was enabled to automatically switch between the different connection patterns of the ANS, which in turn changed the interaction between the robot’s legs and generated a more suitable dynamics for the surrounding environment.},

  abstract     = {Distance perception for mobile agents is of great importance for safe navigation in unknown environments. Traditional methods make use of analytical solutions. Yet, according to some research hypothesis, distance perception is not the result of mathematical calculations, but an emergent consequence of an association process, where visual and tactile information acquire a central role. Designing models closer to natural cognition poses paramount challenges to artificial intelligence (AI), which call for a review of some of the foundations of current methods. Our work is framed in the embodied cognition paradigm, which highlights the importance of the body for the development of cognitive processes. We provide theoretical grounds and empirical evidence for an artificial account of distance perception through a multimodal association process. By learning multimodal sensorimotor schemes, an agent is capable of perceiving affordances related to distance perception without any non-body-based geometric knowledge. We let an agent interact with an environment cluttered with objects, while learning multimodal sensorimotor associations. The learned spatial relations are thoroughly characterized to show how the model depends on the agent’s specific sensorimotor capabilities. The system is tested in a passability experiment and a navigation task, showing the agent anticipates undesired situations using the learned model predictions.},

For this purpose, coalition benefit criteria and three opinion formation models which extend the 2-state majority rule model on lattices are introduced. The proposed models focus on the coalition profit of its constituent coalition opinions and cover the possible final scenarios from coalition alliance perspective: either minor opinion or major opinion is favored, or dynamics do not favor to any coalition opinion. Opinion exchanges take place on a torus embedded lattice network of a 3-state system having in consideration tie configurations and two rules to break them: either by random choice or leaving ties unaltered. Models were analyzed in the statistical mechanics spirit through Monte Carlo simulations without node replacement. Estimations for coalition benefits, the growth of coalition ties, and consensus probabilities are reported. The loss of coalition strengths due to coalition ties and its indecision is indicated. In particular, the logistic decay of consensus probability is due to the logistic adaptive growth of coalition ties. Scaling behaviors for consensus time and coalition ties in terms of network size are suggested. The results of numerical simulations are discussed in the context of social influence and social dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The free energy principle (FEP) is an information-theoretic approach to living systems. FEP characterizes life by living systems’ resistance to the second law of thermodynamics: living systems do not randomly visit the possible states, but actively work to remain within a set of viable states. In FEP, this is modelled mathematically. Yet, the status of these models is typically unclear: are these models employed by organisms or strictly scientific tools of understanding? In this article, I argue for an instrumentalist take on models in FEP. I shall argue that models used as instruments for knowledge by scientists and models as implemented by organisms to navigate the world are being conflated, which leads to erroneous conclusions. I further argue that a realist position is unwarranted. First, it overgenerates models and thus trivializes the notion of modelling. Second, even when the mathematical mechanisms described by FEP are implemented in an organism, they do not constitute a model. They are covariational, not representational in nature, and precede the social practices that have shaped our scientific modelling practice. I finally argue that the above arguments do not affect the instrumentalist position. An instrumentalist approach can further add to conceptual clarity in the FEP literature.},

Especially in otherwise inaccessible environments, decentralized robotic swarms can be advantageous due to their high spatial resolution of measurements and resilience to failure of individuals in the swarm. However, such robotic swarms might need to be able to compensate misplacement during deployment or adapt to dynamical changes in the environment. Reaching a collective decision in a swarm with limited communication abilities without a central entity serving as decision-maker can be a challenging task. Here, we present the CIMAX algorithm for collective decision-making for maximizing the information gathered by the swarm as a whole. Agents negotiate based on their individual sensor readings and ultimately make a decision for collectively moving in a particular direction so that the swarm as a whole increases the amount of relevant measurements and thus accessible information. We use both simulation and real robotic experiments for presenting, testing, and validating our algorithm.

Thus, to ensure the safety of tourists is a tough task in such crowded area. The study of pedestrian’s characteristics in crowd movement is essential for safety management. In this article, both uni- and bidirectional observational experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the movement properties of pedestrians in a zigzag corridor which is located in a tourism area named Yuyuan business district in Shanghai. Several phenomena have been found during the tourists’ movement process: congestion at boundary, competing and bypassing behavior, and flow gap. As indicated by the transit time of pedestrians in both uni- and bidirectional scenarios, pedestrians in bidirectional pattern (&gt;10 s) spend more time on going through the corridor than that in unidirectional one (&lt;10 s). Besides, the fundamental diagrams in both uni- and bidirectional scenarios are significantly different from data in a controlled experiment, and obvious differences are observed within the density regime from 1.5 to 2.5 ped/m 2 between the uni- and bidirectional scenarios. In addition, spatial distributions of density and velocity demonstrate that pedestrians would like to cluster at the boundary of straight corridors in both uni- and bidirectional scenarios. The results could enrich the database of fundamental diagrams, and then be used for model calibration by taking the actual situation into consideration in similar scenarios.},

Specifically, we are interested in learning for artificial agents that act in the world, and operationalize “dreaming” as a mechanism by which such an agent can use its own model of the learning environment to generate new hypotheses and training data. We first show that it is not necessarily a given that such a data-hallucination process is useful, since it can easily lead to a training set dominated by spurious imagined data until an ill-defined convergence point is reached. We then analyse a notably successful implementation of a machine learning-based dreaming mechanism by Ha and Schmidhuber (Ha, D., &amp; Schmidhuber, J. (2018). World models. arXiv e-prints , arXiv:1803.10122). On that basis, we then develop a general framework by which an agent can generate simulated data to learn from in a manner that is beneficial to the agent. This, we argue, then forms a general method for an operationalized dream-like mechanism. We finish by demonstrating the general conditions under which such mechanisms can be useful in machine learning, wherein the implicit simulator inference and extrapolation involved in dreaming act without reinforcing inference error even when inference is incomplete .},

  abstract     = {Learning to make decisions in partially observable environments is a notorious problem that requires a complex representation of controllers. In most work, the controllers are designed as a non-linear mapping from a sequence of temporal observations to actions. These problems can, in principle, be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process whose policy can be parameterised through the use of recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we will propose an alternative framework that (a) uses the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder framework to learn an internal state representation for historical observations and then (b) integrates it into existing recurrent policy models to improve the task performance. The LSTM Encoder encodes a history of observations as input into a representation of internal states. The LSTM Decoder can perform two alternative decoding tasks: predicting the same input observation sequence or predicting future observation sequences. The first proposed decoder acts like an auto-encoder that will guide and constrain the learning of a useful internal state for the policy optimisation task. The second proposed decoder decodes the learnt internal state by the encoder to predict future observation sequences. This idea makes the network act like a non-linear predictive state representation model. Both these decoding parts, which introduce constraints to policy representation, will help guide both the policy optimisation problem and latent state representation learning. The integration of representation learning and policy optimisation aims to help learn more complex policies and improve the performance of policy learning tasks.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a robust adaptive intelligent fault-tolerant controller with prescribed performance is proposed for an uncertain quadruped robot with actuator fault. The control system comprised of three terms: (1) a full-state feedback controller which includes the prescribed performance function, (2) an adaptive intelligent wavelet-based Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy network (TSFN), and (3) a robust control term. The proposed controller does not utilize the robot dynamic model. A wavelet-based TSFN is utilized to approximate adaptively the lumped nonlinear terms, parameter uncertainties, and defective torque signal. The wavelet block acts as a feature extractor, reduces the number of fuzzy rules, and also acts as a normalization function. The parameters of TSFN are tuned online by an adaptive law based on Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed controller guarantees the desired specification such as minimum speed of convergence, maximum steady-state error, overshoot concerning the position tracking error, and also bounded closed-loop signals. Numerical simulations on MATLAB/SimMechanics environment demonstrate the stable walking of the quadruped robot in the presence of the actuator faults and parameter uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this article is to review the evolution and function of the cerebellum, particularly in regard to its role in creativity and expert stone knapping. First, the article reviews the history of the cerebellum, its evolution and phylogenetics, and its concerted evolution with various brain regions. It also notes the critical role of the cerebellum and the cerebro-cerebellar network in its traditionally recognized control of gross and fine motor movements and in its exaptation for basic and higher level cognitive processes, particularly in regard to increasingly more sophisticated stone knapping. Also, reviewed are various theories, advanced over the past three decades, of how the cerebellum tweaks and refines thoughts, images, and ideas just as it refines and smooths motor movements. Baddeley’s working memory model is also prominently featured, as are the works of Ito, Vandervert, and others on the cerebellum’s role in novel problem-solving, insight, and creativity. Finally, this article reviews two “Cognitive Rubicons” in stone tool knapping, Theory of Mind and stone knapping, and Malafouris’ Material Engagement Theory. The article concludes with a novel hypothesis that the automaticity provided by the cerebellum derived from extensive practice in stone knapping may have freed Baddeley’s central executive from its attentional demands and allows the mind to “wander and wonder.”},

  abstract     = {This article considers the adaptive setting and probable origins of human aesthetic capabilities, using evidence of the Acheulean tradition in the last million years, and highlighting the importance of the preceding and enveloping social and technological contexts. Acheulean bifaces, made from about 1.75 to 0.1 Ma, often with an appearance of symmetry, give windows on crucial interlocking aspects of human intellectual evolution. These have been seen as the domains of technology, sociality and aesthetics, following Leroi-Gourhan, or in near-equivalence the ‘technological’, ‘sociological’ and ‘ideological/philosophical’ of L.A. White. These domains can be analysed to have a reality, in the sense that social worlds of the apes far antedate technology, which in turn is generally taken to be far older than a sense of aesthetic appreciation. The bifaces are helpful in illustrating early developments because they can be made only through bringing together a set of concepts linking form, function and technology of manufacture, in a recurring ‘deep structure’. As there are at least 6 to 12 necessary concepts, perhaps significantly more, the artefacts are essentially multivariable or multivariate. They thus impose high cognitive requirements in manufacture, pressing towards effective sequencing of steps so that not too many variables will be involved simultaneously. Support of such a knowledge base has social requirements of shared or collective intention. Biomechanical and functional necessities also exert pressures on concepts: rules maintained by all these requirements entail a notion of ‘appropriateness’ or ‘rightness’ that may have been a prime factor in driving evolution of a sense of aesthetics and even the shaping of moral feelings. As the rules are variably expressed through time and space in the Acheulean, some of the best information comes from seeing how far particular variables are ‘locked’ in relationships which recur to give the impression of deep structure.},

  abstract     = {Traditional typological, technical, and cognitive approaches to early stone tools have taken an implicit Cartesian stance concerning the nature of mind. In many cases, this has led to interpretations of early technology that overemphasize its human-like features. By eschewing an epistemic mediator, 4E approaches to cognition (embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended) are in a better position to make appropriate evaluations of early hominin technical cognition that emphasize its continuity with non-human primates and ground a description of the evolution of hominin technology. This essay takes some initial steps in that direction by shifting focus away from tool types and knapping patterns toward a description based on ergonomics and Gibsonian affordances. The analysis points to the evolutionary importance of two hitherto underappreciated aspects of hominin technical systems—the emergence of ergonomic clusters instantiated in artifact form and the development of displaced affordances.},

  abstract     = {Tool use can be considered in terms of purposeful behaviour. This emphasis on ‘purpose’ hides a host of assumptions about the nature of cognition and its relationship with physical activity. In particular, a notion of ‘purpose’ might assume that this is teleological which, in turn, requires a model of a desired end state of an action that can be projected onto the environment. Such a model is fundamental to traditional descriptions of cognition and a version of this can be found in the ‘template’ theory of stone-tool production (i.e. where the maker of the tool has a model in mind and attempts to reproduce this model in stone). Against this cognitive perspective, a number of approaches have been proposed that share their roots in the work of Gibson (i.e. ecological psychology) or Bernstein (i.e. dynamic systems). From these perspectives, ‘purpose’ is not a matter of a projection but opportunity; put simply, an action is performed until it need not be performed further. Trivial though this might sound, it has implications for how we define purpose and how this might apply to our understanding of tool use. We argue from a dynamic systems perspective and demonstrate the use of tools to crack bones for marrow extraction.},

As a result, primate models for technical and cognitive evolution, rooted in the teleological functionalism of the Neo-Darwinist approach, reduce tool use to the unit of the individual, conflating technology with technique and physical cognition with problem-solving computations of energetic efficiency. This article attempts, through the application of material engagement theory, to explore non-human primate technology as a non-individualistic phenomenon in which technique is co-constructed through the ontogenetic development of skill within a dynamic system of structured action affordances and material interactions which constitute an emergent, species-specific mode of technical cognition.},

Informed by Material Engagement Theory (MET) and its understanding of material agency, it is argued that the SBH has an inherently cognitivist understanding of mind and matter at its core. This Cartesian basis has not been fully resolved by archaeological attempts to integrate the SBH with relational models of cognition. At the heart of the issue has been a lack of meaningful consideration of the cognitive agency of things and the evolutionary efficacy of material engagement. This article proposes MET as a useful starting point for rethinking future approaches to human social cognitive becoming in a way that appreciates the co-constitution of brains, bodies and worlds. It also suggests how MET may bridge archaeological and 4E approaches to reconsider concepts such as the ‘mental template’ and Theory of Mind.},

These purposes are exemplified by writing, a relatively recent tool that has become highly adept at eliciting specific psychological and behavioral responses in its users, capability it achieved by changing in ways that facilitated, accumulated, and distributed incremental behavioral and psychological change between individuals and generations. Writing is described here as a self-organizing system whose design features reflect points of maximal usefulness that emerged under sustained collective use of the tool. Such self-organization may hold insights applicable to human cognitive evolution and tool use more generally. Accordingly, this article examines the emergence of the ability to leverage material forms for cognitive purposes, using the tool-using behaviors and lithic technologies of ancestral species and contemporary non-human primates as proxies for matters like collective use, generational sustainment, and the non-teleological emergence of design features.},

The study of hominin technical thinking, as in the case of stone tool making, is a good way to bring that question to the fore. This article argues that archaeologists who study lithic artefacts and their transformations over the course of human evolution are uniquely well positioned to contribute to the ongoing debate about the marks of the mental. Adopting the material engagement approach, I propose to replace the internalist vision of mentality, that is, the vision of a brain-bound mind that is using the body to execute and externalise preconceived mental plan through the stone, with an ecological-enactive vision of participatory mentality where bodily acts and materials act together to generate rather than merely execute thought processes. I argue that the latter participatory view changes the geography of the cognitive and offers a better description for the continuity of mind and matter that we see in the lithic record.},

These have assumed that all representations and computations take place only inside the head, which implies that the archaeological record can only be an “external” product or the behavioral trace of “internal” representational and computational processes. In comparison, the 4E approach helps us to overcome this dualist representational logic, allowing us to engage directly with the archaeological record as an integral part of the thinking process, and thus ground a more parsimonious cognitive archaeology. It also treats stone tools, the primary vestiges of hominin thinking, as active participants in mental life. The 4E approach offers a better grounding for understanding hominin technical expertise, a crucially important component of hominin cognitive evolution.},

I review (section 2) a range of embodied cognition theories and highlight the principles and criteria on which they rely or draw from. I focus (section 3) on three crucial empirical domains in which an embodied perspective has driven novel insights about the relationship between mind and cognition. I argue that embodiment is not just a philosophical mantra empty of empirical content. I draw attention (section 4) to some of the recent ways in which principles underlying embodied cognition have begun to be applied in different fields (contemporary psychology). I review some of these interventions and suggest that discussing these applications not only provides additional evidence against any poverty claim but can also help moving the field forward in important ways. Contra Goldinger et al., I therefore conclude (section 5) that embodied cognition is a very fruitful research programme for the empirical sciences and that can adequately explain many aspects of human cognitive behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Biological agents need to complete perception-action cycles to perform various cognitive and biological tasks such as maximizing their wellbeing and their chances of genetic continuation. However, the processes performed in these cycles come at a cost. Such costs force the agent to evaluate a tradeoff between the optimality of the decision making and the time and computational effort required to make it. Several cognitive mechanisms that play critical roles in managing this tradeoff have been identified. These mechanisms include adaptation, learning, memory, attention, and planning. One of the often overlooked outcomes of these cognitive mechanisms, in spite of the critical effect that they may have on the perception-action cycle of organisms, is “emotion.” In this study, we hold that emotion can be considered as an emergent phenomenon of a plausible neurocomputational energy regulation mechanism, which generates an internal reward signal to minimize the neural energy consumption of a sequence of actions (decisions), where each action triggers a visual memory recall process. To realize an optimal action selection over a sequence of actions in a visual recalling task, we adopted a model-free reinforcement learning framework, in which the reward signal—that is, the cost—was based on the iteration steps of the convergence state of an associative memory network. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in simulation and on a robotic platform: the iCub humanoid robot. The results show that the computational energy regulation mechanism enables the agent to modulate its behavior to minimize the required neurocomputational energy in performing the visual recalling task.},

  abstract     = {Navigating, directing, and controlling autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are demanding and considered complicated compared to the autonomous surface-level performance. In such vehicles, the motion can be controlled depending on the estimation of indefinite hydrodynamic forces and the disturbances that occurs in this vehicle in the underwater background. In this article, Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) is performed along with the second-order sliding mode control (GW-SoSMC) approach for controlling the yaw angle in AUV. The main purpose of the article is to reduce the error that occurs in the system between the controlled signal and desired signal corresponding to yaw angle. Using this proposed model, both the occurrence of chattering and the controlling performance of AUV system can be diminished. Moreover, the proposed model is compared with the existing approaches like, FireFly-SoSMC (FF-SoSMC), Genetic Algorithm-SoSMC (GA-SoSMC), Gray Wolf-SMC (GW-SMC), Group search optimization-SoSMC (GSO-SoSMC) and Artificial Bee Colony-SoSMC (ABC-SoSMC). From the simulation results, it shows that the performance of the implemented technique in terms of steady-state response, error analysis, yaw angle analysis, and controller response is enhanced while comparing with the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can shift neuronal membrane excitability by applying a weak slow electric current to the brain through the scalp. Attendant electroencephalography (EEG) can provide valuable information about the tDCS mechanisms. This study investigated the effects of anodal tDCS on parietal cortex and cerebellum activity to reveal possible modulation of spontaneous oscillatory brain activity. Timing of the tDCS priming protocol in relation to the intervention especially with respect to bimanual coordination task was also studied. EEG activity was measured in 120 healthy participants before and after sessions of anodal stimulation of the parietal cortex and cerebellum to detect the tDCS-induced alterations. Variations of the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) power bands were analyzed using a MATLAB program. The results showed that anodal parietal and cerebellar tDCS cause changes in brain wave frequencies. They also showed an increase in alpha, beta, and SMR power bands during stimulation sessions for during stimulation parietal group ( p ≤ .01). Also, theta, alpha, beta, and SMR power bands were increased in during stimulation cerebellum group in stimulation sessions and 48 h later ( p ≤ .01). Moreover, the results revealed that the tDCS intervention led to a variety of activations in some areas of the brain. Altogether, the cerebellar tDCS during motor task had a significant improvement in off-line learning.},

  abstract     = {Biological vision incorporates intelligent cooperation between the sensory and the motor systems, which is facilitated by the development of motor skills that help to shape visual information that is relevant to a specific vision task. In this article, we seek to explore an approach to active vision inspired by biological systems, which uses limited constraints for motor strategies through progressive adaptation via an evolutionary method. This type of approach gives freedom to artificial systems in the discovery of eye-movement strategies that may be useful to solve a given vision task but are not known to us. In the experiment sections of this article, we use this type of evolutionary active vision system for more complex natural images in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments. To further improve the results, we experiment with the use of pre-processing the visual input with both the uniform local binary patterns (ULBP) and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) for classification tasks in the 2D and 3D environments. The 3D experiments include application of the active vision system to object categorisation and indoor versus outdoor environment classification. Our experiments are conducted on the iCub humanoid robot simulator platform.},
