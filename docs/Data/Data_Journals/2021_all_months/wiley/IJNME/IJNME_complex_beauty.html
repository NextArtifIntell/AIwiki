  abstract     = {A novel method is proposed, which aims to solve rare-event hybrid reliability problems with random and interval variables, where the performance function has various failure zones. It combines the active learning Kriging (ALK) model with importance sampling (IS) and evolutionary multimodal-based multiobjective optimization (EMO-MMO). The surrogate limit state surfaces (LSS) for the upper and lower failure probability bounds are respectively defined considering the Kriging variance. Failure candidate solutions located in different failure regions are generated by the EMO-MMO method. Subsequently, all the most probable failure points (MPPs) are identified from those candidate solutions. The IS samples are simulated around the MPPs using the MPP-based IS method. The IS samples located in unimportant regions are removed in order to improve the efficiency of approximating the surrogate LSSs. The optimal training points are selected from the truncated IS samples to update the Kriging model. After several training iterations, the surrogate LSSs are convergent. Ultimately, a reliable and unbiased estimation of the upper and lower failure probability bounds is provided. The performance of the ALK-EMO-IS-HRA approach is verified through five application examples.},

The elements that intersect the boundary of the physical domain require special treatment in order to minimize their effect on the performance of the algorithm. We considered the exact representation of the geometry for the boundary of the domain avoiding any nonphysical artifacts. We also define a stabilization procedure that eliminates the step size restriction of the time marching scheme due to extreme cut patterns. The unstable degrees of freedom are eliminated and the supporting regions of their shape functions are reassigned to neighboring elements. A subdomain matching algorithm and an a posterior enrichment strategy are presented. Combining these techniques we obtain a final spatial discretization that preserves stability and accuracy of the standard body-fitted discretization. The method is validated through a series of numerical tests and it is successfully applied to the solution of problems of interest in the context of electromagnetic scattering with increasing complexity.},

  abstract     = {The dual formulation for linear elasticity, in contrast to the primal formulation, is not affected by locking, as it is based on the stresses as main unknowns. Thus it is quite attractive for nearly incompressible and incompressible materials. Discretization with mixed finite elements will lead to‚Äîpossibly large‚Äîlinear saddle point systems. Whereas efficient multigrid methods exist for solving problems in mixed plane elasticity for nearly incompressible materials, we propose a multigrid method that is also stable in the incompressible limit. There are two main challenges in constructing a multigrid method for the dual formulation for linear elasticity. First, in the incompressible limit, the matrix block related to the stress is positive semidefinite. Second, the stress belongs to H div and standard smoothers, working for H 1 regular problems, cannot be applied. We present a novel patch-based smoother for the dual formulation for linear elasticity. We discuss different types of local boundary conditions for the patch subproblems. Based on our patch-smoother, we build a multigrid method for the solution of the resulting saddle point problem and investigate its efficiency and robustness. Numerical experiments show that Dirichlet and Robin conditions work best and eventually lead to textbook multigrid performance.},

The convolution quadrature method transforms the time-domain wave problem into a series of Helmholtz problems with complex-valued wavenumbers, in which the boundary data and solutions are connected to those of the original problem through the ùíµ -transform. The hybrid method terminology refers specifically to the use of different approximations of these Helmholtz problems, depending on the frequency. For lower frequencies, we employ the boundary element method, while for more oscillatory problems, we develop two alternative high frequency approximations based on plane wave decompositions of the acoustic field on the boundary. In the first approach, we apply dynamical energy analysis to numerically approximate the plane wave amplitudes. The phases will then be reconstructed using a novel approach based on matching the boundary element solution to the plane wave ansatz in the frequency region where we switch between the low and high frequency methods. The second high frequency method is based on applying the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map for plane waves to the given boundary data. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of both hybrid approaches across a range of numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Multiscale thermal analysis is motivated by efficient modeling of complex microstructural response (nonlinear conduction, transient conduction, coupled thermomechanics, etc.) without resorting to fully resolved simulations, direct numerical simulation (DNS). It is typically conducted with an FE 2 method that couples two levels of finite element simulations in a nested manner. This article presents a Direct FE 2 method for modeling heat transfer problems in heterogeneous solids. The proposed method is developed based on the same theoretical framework as the FE 2 method, namely downscaling and upscaling rules. However, the scale transitions are achieved through temperature/nodal thermal force in Direct FE rather than temperature gradient/heat flux in common FE implementations. The two-level simulations can be solved in a monolithic scheme where the macroscopic and microscopic DOFs are coupled through multi-point constraints. This feature allows an easy implementation in standard FE packages without resorting to repeated transfer of data between two scales. For transient thermal problems, the implementation provides an option to either incorporate or exclude thermal inertial effects and heat generation at the microscale. The performance of the Direct FE is demonstrated by several numerical examples including coupled thermal-mechanical analysis and transient heat conduction, and the results are compared with DNSs.},

In this article, we present an AEB strategy for design parameterization in topology optimization (TO) problems. We seek the density design field as a linear combination of eigenfunctions, computed for an elliptic operator defined over the structural domain, and solve for the associated eigenfunction coefficients. Restriction to this truncated eigenspace drastically reduces the design dimension and imposes implicit regularization upon the solution, removing the need for auxiliary filtering operations and design-variable bound constraints. We furthermore develop the basis adaptation scheme inherent in the AEB, which iteratively recomputes the eigenfunction basis to conform to the evolving density field, enabling further dimension reduction and acceleration of the optimization process. The known aptitude of the adapted eigenfunctions to approximate piecewise constant fields is especially useful for TO as relevant design subspaces can be given low-dimensional representations. We propose criteria for the selection of the basis dimension and demonstrate the use of basis function selection as means for length scale control. We compare performance of the AEB against conventional TO implementations in problems for static linear-elasticity, showing comparable structural solutions, computational cost benefits, and consistent design dimension reduction.},

The solution within the parameter domain is determined by a linear combination of reduced basis vectors. This basis is generated iteratively and given by the responses of the structural acoustic system at certain parameter samples. A greedy approach is followed by evaluating the next basis vector at the parameter sample which is currently approximated worst. The algorithm runs on a small training set which bounds the memory requirements and allows applications to large-scale problems with high-dimensional parameter domains.

It is known that the XFEM may lead to ill-conditioned stiffness matrices and oscillations in the interface traction field, the severity of which depends on the underlying basis functions, as well as on the orientation of the interface. The jumps at the discontinuity are shown to contain quadratic bubble residuals that can introduce oscillatory behavior. Those residuals are worsened by the ill-conditioning of the system with very stiff interfaces. A variationally consistent method is proposed to overcome the oscillatory behavior and ill-conditioning, in which the assumed strain method is developed to directly eliminate bubble residuals and deploy Legendre polynomials and explore their orthogonality properties to improve the conditioning of the stiffness matrices. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency and generality of the proposed approach at both element and structural levels. The new approach is shown to be robust for imposing Dirichlet type boundary conditions at the crack interface, such as crack closure and initially rigid cohesive laws. The effects of numerical oscillations on the prediction of effective properties of composites in XFEM-based computational homogenization procedures are also discussed.},

The second advantage of using the proposed approach is that because the property matrices of a four-node rectangular element are precisely calculated in a purely mathematical way, the overall accuracy of numerical solutions can be ensured. After the proposed approach is verified by a benchmark problem, it has been applied for solving reactive mass transport problems involving chemical dissolution in fluid-saturated porous media with three different kinds of initial porosity distributions. It has been demonstrated that: (1) the proposed approach can produce highly-accurate numerical solutions for solving reactive mass transport problems involving chemical dissolution in fluid-saturated porous media with arbitrarily initial porosity distributions; (2) the initial porosity distribution in a porous medium can have remarkable effects on the reactive mass transport process in the porous medium; (3) the porosity and dimensionless concentration fronts propagate from the entrance to the exit of the problem domain, which is identical to the pore-fluid flow direction.},

  abstract     = {Superposition-based concurrent multiscale approaches for poromechanical problems aimed at resolving localized fluid flow and deformation of a solid skeleton including its possible fracture are developed. The main departure of the proposed formulation is that the primary unknowns in the coupling zone, the solid displacement u and pore pressure p , are discretized by possibly different numerical models. Two discretization schemes are studied: (i) superposition of two or more finite element (FE) discretizations of the Biot&#39;s u -p model of a porous medium, and (ii) superposition of the peridynamics (PD) discretization of the fractured solid phase on the FE discretization of the Biot&#39;s u -p model of a porous medium. In the latter case, the total stress of the fluid‚Äìsolid mixture in the coupling domain is derived from the effective stress obtained from the combined PD and finite element method solutions while the pore pressure is obtained from the FE solution. The accuracy of the superposition-based concurrent multiscale method is studied on several benchmark problems including the classical Terzaghi&#39;s one-dimensional consolidation problem, the two-dimensional strip footing problem, and the pressure- and fluid-driven fracture propagation problem in saturated porous media. The main hydraulic fracture characteristics, including complex crack paths and fluid flow patterns, have been found to be reasonably well reproduced by the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-order models are essential tools to deal with parametric problems in the context of optimization, uncertainty quantification, or control and inverse problems. The set of parametric solutions lies in a low-dimensional manifold (with dimension equal to the number of independent parameters) embedded in a large-dimensional space (dimension equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the full-order discrete model). A posteriori model reduction is based on constructing a basis from a family of snapshots (solutions of the full-order model computed offline), and then use this new basis to solve the subsequent instances online. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reduces the problem into a linear subspace of lower dimension, eliminating redundancies in the family of snapshots. The strategy proposed here is to use a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, namely, the kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), in order to find a nonlinear manifold, with an expected much lower dimension, and to solve the problem in this low-dimensional manifold. Guided by this paradigm, the methodology devised here introduces different novel ideas, namely, 1) characterizing the nonlinear manifold using local tangent spaces, where the reduced-order problem is linear and based on the neighboring snapshots, 2) the approximation space is enriched with the cross-products of the snapshots, introducing a quadratic description, 3) the kernel for kPCA is defined ad hoc, based on physical considerations, and 4) the iterations in the reduced-dimensional space are performed using an algorithm based on a Delaunay tessellation of the cloud of snapshots in the reduced space. The resulting computational strategy is performing outstandingly in the numerical tests, alleviating many of the problems associated with POD and improving the numerical accuracy.},

We show how to implement PMUBC efficiently in an FFT-based code using discrete sine and cosine transforms. Compared with the domain mirroring approach, we reduce the runtime by a factor of 2 to 3, and the memory requirements by a factor of 8. We show that the use of periodic boundary conditions for nonperiodic geometries yields vastly different results than with PMUBC. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the discretization method by comparing the staggered grid discretization with a finite element discretization.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an adaptive multi-surrogate constrained optimization method (AMSCOM) that can automatically determine the appropriate metamodel for each black-box function in the constrained optimization problem (COP) and concurrently find the optimum. In AMSCOM, each black-box function is approximated initially by several different types of candidate surrogates. Then, as optimization progresses, the poorly performing candidate surrogates of each black-box function are gradually eliminated until the appropriate surrogate is found. Meanwhile, as more than one candidate surrogate exists for each unknown function in the optimization process, multiple approximate optimization problems (AOPs) can be constructed, and new samples can be obtained by solving these AOPs. Additionally, we employ the genetic operator and the local-linear approximation‚ÄìVoronoi method to generate new samples. To verify the effectiveness and investigate several properties of AMSCOM, the proposed method is tested on 12 benchmark COPs and compared with several single surrogate-based methods. Furthermore, AMSCOM is compared with several published surrogate-based constrained optimization methods, and the results further prove the superior performance of AMSCOM. The proposed method is then employed to optimize the shaft-clinching process of wheel-hub-bearing units, and a desirable result is achieved.},

We have considered different types of materials: linear elasticity, hyperelasticity (neo-Hookean) with large deformation, and von Mises plasticity with isotropic and kinematic hardening. The performance of this deep collocation method (DCM) depends on the architecture of the neural network and the corresponding hyperparameters. The presented DCM is meshfree and avoids any spatial discretization, which is usually needed for the finite element method (FEM). We show that the DCM can capture the response qualitatively and quantitatively, without the need for any data generation using other numerical methods such as the FEM. Data generation usually is the main bottleneck in most data-driven models. The DL model is trained to learn the model&#39;s parameters yielding accurate approximate solutions. Once the model is properly trained, solutions can be obtained almost instantly at any point in the domain, given its spatial coordinates. Therefore, the DCM is potentially a promising standalone technique to solve PDEs involved in the deformation of materials and structural systems as well as other physical phenomena.},

Widespread adoption of non-Gaussian data assimilation requires easy-to-implement schemes. We develop, implement, and apply an efficient nonlinear non-Gaussian data assimilation scheme using non-intrusive stochastic collocation-based polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) priors fit to the state&#39;s uncertainty. First, we represent the uncertainty in a dynamical system using PCE and propagate it using the stochastic collocation method until an assimilation time. Then, we convert the polynomial basis prior to its equivalent Karhunen‚ÄìLoeve (KL) form, fit a GMM in the subspace and perform a Bayesian filtering step. Thereafter, the posterior polynomial basis is recovered from the posterior GMM in the KL form, and uncertainty propagation is continued using the stochastic collocation method. The derivation and new equations required for the above conversions are presented. We apply the new scheme to an illustrative population growth dynamics application and a complex fluid flow problem for demonstrating its capabilities. In both cases, our filter accurately captures the non-Gaussian statistics compared to the polynomial chaos-ensemble Kalman filter and the polynomial chaos-error subspace statistical estimation filter.},

We develop a diagonal variant of hyper-dual numbers and their arithmetic to obtain the exact derivatives of tensor-valued functions of a vector argument, which comprise the main contributions of this work. As this differentiation scheme represents a general black-box tool, we supply the computer implementation of the hyper-dual formulation in Fortran. By focusing on the diagonal terms, the proposed sensitivity scheme is significantly lighter in terms of computational costs, facilitating the application in engineering problems. As an additional strategy to improve efficiency, we highlight that we perform the derivative calculation at the element-level. This work can contribute to many studies since the sensitivity scheme can adapt itself to numerous finite element formulations or problem settings. The proposed method promotes the usage of second-order optimization algorithms, which may allow better convergence rates to solve intricate problems in engineering applications.},

We avoid this step by utilizing an easily invertible weight-adjusted approximation. The resulting semi-discrete weight-adjusted DG scheme is provably energy stable up to a term that (for a fixed time interval) converges to zero with the same rate as the optimal error estimate.

In this article, we discuss the mathematical formulation as well as construction of the nonlocal discrete differential operators. Based on a least-square minimization procedure and the associated Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse, we have found a general form of the shape tensor and a unified expression for the first type nonlocal differential operators. We then conduct a convergence study, which provides the interpolation error estimate for the first type discrete nonlocal different operators. We have shown that as the radius of the horizon approaches to zero, the first type nonlocal differential operators will converge to the local differential operators. Moreover, we have demonstrated the computational performance of the first type nonlocal differential operators in several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {We present a minimally invasive method for forward propagation of material property uncertainty to full-field quantities of interest in solid dynamics. Full-field uncertainty quantification enables the design of complex systems where quantities of interest, such as failure points, are not known a priori . The method, motivated by the well-known probability density function (PDF) propagation method of turbulence modeling, uses an ensemble of solutions to provide the joint PDF of desired quantities at every point in the domain. A small subset of the ensemble is computed exactly, and the remainder of the samples are computed with approximation of the evolution equations based on those exact solutions. Although the proposed method has commonalities with traditional interpolatory stochastic collocation methods applied directly to quantities of interest, it is distinct and exploits the parameter dependence and smoothness of the driving term of the evolution equations. The implementation is model independent, storage and communication efficient, and straightforward. We demonstrate its efficiency, accuracy, scaling with dimension of the parameter space, and convergence in distribution with two problems: a quasi-one-dimensional bar impact, and a two material notched plate impact. For the bar impact problem, we provide an analytical solution to PDF of the solution fields for method validation. With the notched plate problem, we also demonstrate good parallel efficiency and scaling of the method.},

  abstract     = {One of the most successful mixed finite element methods in solid mechanics is the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method developed by Simo and Rifai in 1990. However, one major drawback of EAS elements is the highly mesh dependent accuracy. In fact, it can be shown that not only EAS elements, but every finite element with a symmetric stiffness matrix must either fail the patch test or be sensitive to mesh distortion in bending problems (higher order displacement modes) if the shape of the element is arbitrary. This theorem was established by MacNeal in 1992. In the present work we propose a novel Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin approach for the EAS method, which is equivalent to the standard EAS method in case of regular meshes. However, in case of distorted meshes, it allows to overcome the mesh-distortion sensitivity without loosing other advantages of the EAS method. Three design conditions established in this work facilitate the construction of the element which does not only fulfill the patch test but is also exact in many bending problems regardless of mesh distortion and has an exceptionally high coarse mesh accuracy. Consequently, high quality demands on mesh topology might be relaxed.},

The flexibility of FEM is used to model the complex, heterogeneous, and nonlinear part‚Äî such as the dynamic rupture along a fault with near fault plasticity‚Äîand the high accuracy and computational efficiency of SBIM is used to simulate the exterior half spaces perfectly truncating all incident waves. The exact truncation allows us to greatly reduce the domain of spatial discretization compared to a traditional FEM approach, leading to considerable savings in computational time and memory requirements. The coupling of FEM and SBIM is achieved by the exchange of traction and displacement boundary conditions at the computationally defined boundary. The method is suited to implementation on massively parallel computers. We validate the developed method by means of a benchmark problem. Three more complex examples with a low velocity fault zone, low velocity off-fault inclusion, and interaction of multiple faults, respectively, demonstrate the capability of the hybrid scheme in solving problems of very large sizes. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the hybrid method for problems in geophysics and engineering.},

Herein, we discuss the applicability of various approaches developed to date for the weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions in analyses which employ Powell‚ÄìSabin B-splines. We take elasticity and fracture propagation using phase-field modeling as a benchmark problem. We first succinctly recapitulate the phase-field model for propagation of brittle fracture, which encapsulates linear elasticity, and its discretization using Powell‚ÄìSabin B-splines. As baseline solution we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions in a strong sense, and use this to benchmark the Lagrange multiplier, penalty, and Nitsche&#39;s methods, as well as methods based on the Hellinger-Reissner principle, and the linked Lagrange multiplier method and its modified version.},

The resulting topologically optimal initial design will be the input for subsequent structural optimizations such as shape, size and layout optimizations. However, iterative solvers used in conventional topology optimization schemes are known to be computationally expensive, thus act as a bottleneck in the manufacturing process. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based accelerated topology optimization technique with the ability to predict ductile material failure is presented. A Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) coupled with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict the optimal topology of a given structure subject to a set of input variables. Subsequently, the same cGAN is trained to predict the Von-Mises stress contours on the optimal structure by means of color transformed image-to-image translations. The ductile failure criterion is evaluated by comparing the cGAN predicted maximum Von-Mises stress with the yield strength of the material. The proposed novel numerical method is proven to arrive at the topologically optimal design, accompanying the material failure decision within a negligible amount of time but also maintaining a higher prediction accuracy.},

The equivalent elastic properties of the representative volume element (RVE) are computed by the numerical homogenization method with the periodic boundary conditions on the control points (CPs) of the B-spline mesh. The multi-objective optimization problems including the material bulk modulus maximization, negative Poisson&#39;s ratio, and concurrent topology optimization of the composite structures are formulated by using the B√©zier elements based isogeometric analysis. The distance-based density distribution on the CPs of the B-spline mesh is proposed as the initialization for designing the RVE, which is more robust than the uniform density distribution towards the optimal results. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and a variety of isotropic and anisotropic RVEs and composite structures are obtained. Meanwhile, various influences on the optimal design of the RVE and macrostructure are also discussed.},

To reduce the number of training samples and improve the regression accuracy, an active learning strategy is implemented by successively supplying effective samples along with the suboptimal process. After proper training of neural networks, a quasi-global search strategy can be applied by implementing a large number of initial designs as starting points in the optimization. In this article, a mathematical example is first presented to show the superiority of the active learning strategy. Then a benchmark design example of a CFRP plate is scrutinized to compare the proposed ML-based with the conventional FEA-based discrete material optimization (DMO) method. Finally, topology optimization of fiber orientations is performed for design of a CFRP engine hood, in which the structural performance generated from the proposed ML-based approach achieves 12.62% improvement compared with that obtained from the conventional single-initial design method.

It also gives discrete element governing equations in a canonical form. Similar elements are developed based on the potential energy formulation. The elements can be readily specialized to the Kirchhoff plate theory. The discrete shear strains are transformed back to normal-fiber rotations for enforcing general boundary conditions. The discretization procedure uses one-dimensional polynomials instead of two-dimensional shape functions. The discretization satisfies continuity for w , and continuity for the transverse shear strains. The Mindlin elements are tested with soft and hard boundary conditions. They are naturally free of shear-locking. They are also capable of reproducing the boundary layer that occurs with some soft boundary conditions. Mindlin elements results tend to those of the Kirchhoff theory as the thickness decreases. Extensive numerical results are obtained for square plates some of which are compared with exact results or results obtained by other methods.},

The original interface conditions are then modified on the surrogate fracture geometry, by way of Taylor expansions. The shifted fracture method does not require cut cell computations or complex data structures, since the behavior of the true fracture is mimicked with standard integrals on the approximate fracture surface. Furthermore, the energetics of the true fracture are represented within the accuracy of the underlying polynomial finite element approximation and independently of the grid topology.

  abstract     = {A new strategy for constructing parametric Galerkin reduced order models is presented in this article. This strategy is achieved thanks to the Riemannian manifold, quotient of the set of full-rank matrices by the orthogonal group. Starting from a set of training parametrized subspaces of the same dimension, namely obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition, the projection subspace for a new untrained parameter value is sought as the Karcher barycenter of the data points. The principal advantage of this strategy is that it leads to parametric reduced order models that are naturally flexible with respect to parameter variations. This property is a result of the simple expressions of the geodesic exponential and logarithmic mappings involved in the calculations of the approximated projection subspace. Confrontation with the usual interpolation in the tangent space to the Grassmann manifold is carried out for the flow problem past a circular cylinder and the flow in a lid-driven cavity. Comparable results in terms of accuracy are obtained, while the proposed approach is shown to be computationally cheaper by allowing real-time update of Galerkin projections.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a proper generalized decomposition (PGD) based Pad√© approximant for efficient analysis of the stochastic frequency response. Due to the high nonlinearity of the stochastic response with respect to the input uncertainties, the classical stochastic Galerkin (SG) method utilizing polynomial chaos exhibits slow convergence near the resonance. Furthermore, the dimension of the SG method is the product of deterministic and stochastic approximation spaces, and hence resolution over a banded frequency range is computationally expensive or even prohibitive. In this study, to tackle these problems, the PGD first generates the solution of stochastic frequency equations as a separated representation of deterministic and stochastic components. For the banded frequency range computations, the deterministic vectors are exploited as a reduced basis in conjunction with singular value decomposition. Subsequently, the Pad√© approximant is applied based on the PGD solution, and the stochastic frequency response is represented by a rational function. Through various numerical studies, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework improves not only the accuracy in the vicinity of resonance but also the computational efficiency, compared with the SG method.},

  abstract     = {The use of modern discretization technologies such as hybrid high-order (HHO) methods, coupled with appropriate linear solvers, allow for the robust and fast solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Although efficient linear solvers have recently been made available for simpler cases, complex geometries remain a challenge for large scale problems. To address this problem, we propose in this work a geometric multigrid algorithm for unstructured non-nested meshes. The non-nestedness is handled in the prolongation operator through the use of the -orthogonal projection from the coarse elements onto the fine ones. However, as the exact evaluation of this projection can be computationally expensive, we develop a cheaper approximate implementation that globally preserves the approximation properties of the -orthogonal projection. Additionally, as the multigrid method requires not only the coarsening of the elements, but also that of the faces, we leverage the geometric flexibility of polytopal elements to define an abstract non-nested coarsening strategy based on element agglomeration and face collapsing. Finally, the multigrid method is tested on homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion problems in two and three space dimensions. The solver exhibits near-perfect asymptotic optimality for moderate degrees of approximation.},

The homogenization formulation is built on a priori discretized microstructure, and algorithms for computing the matrix representations of the homogenized stresses and tangent moduli are consistently derived. The homogenization results lose their validity at the onset of first bifurcation, which can be computed from multiscale stability analysis. The multiscale instabilities include: (a) microscale structural instability calculated by Bloch wave analysis; and (b) macroscale material instability calculated by rank-1 convexity checks on the homogenized tangent moduli. Implementation details of the Bloch wave analysis are provided, including the selection of wave vector space and the retrieval of real-valued buckling mode from complex-valued Bloch wave. Three methods are detailed for solving the resulted constrained eigenvalue problem‚Äîtwo condensation methods and a null-space projection method. Both the homogenization and stability analyses are verified using numerical examples including hyperelastic and elastoplastic periodic materials. Various microscale buckling phenomena are demonstrated. Aligned with theoretical results, the numerical results show that the microscopic long wavelength buckling can be equivalently detected by the loss of rank-1 convexity of the homogenized tangent moduli.},

This overlap is based on the concept of the Minkowski difference of two shapes, and particularly on the equivalence between the contact state of the two shapes and the location of the origin relative to their Minkowski difference. The Minkowski contact features of a contact, including the overlap, normal direction, and contact points, are also defined for convex shapes. In particular, an important property of the Minkowski overlap is introduced which lays the solid theoretical foundation for proposing a Minkowski overlap based energy-conserving contact model in the current work. The energy-conserving property for cases where the contact normal direction and point may be subject to discrete changes is also rigorously proved. For convex particles, the computational procedures combining both GJK and EPA algorithms are outlined, and uniqueness and ambiguity issues associated with some special cases are clarified and resolved. The elastic energy conservation of the proposed contact model for convex shapes in elastic impact is further verified using two numerical examples, and two more examples involving more convex particles with different sizes and shapes are also conducted to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the proposed Minkowski overlap contact model and the computational procedures.},

The presence of the chemical potential and the concentration as primary global fields represents a mixed formulation, which has definite advantages. Nonstandard diffusion, governed by a Cahn‚ÄìHilliard type of gradient model, is considered under the restriction of miscibility. Weakly periodic boundary conditions on the pertinent fields provide the general variational setting for the uniquely solvable RVE-problem(s). These boundary conditions are introduced with a novel approach in order to control the stability of the boundary discretization, thereby circumventing the need to satisfy the LBB-condition: the penalty stabilized Lagrange multiplier formulation, which enforces stability at the cost of an additional Lagrange multiplier for each weakly periodic field (three fields for the current problem). In particular, a neat result is that the classical Neumann boundary condition is obtained when the penalty becomes very large. In the numerical examples, we investigate the following characteristics: the mesh convergence for different boundary approximations, the sensitivity for the choice of penalty parameter, and the influence of RVE-size on the macroscopic response.},

In this article, under the framework of DEM, the contact discontinuity between adjacent elements is analyzed with the Godunov method, and a connection model derived from the physical process is established. Firstly, the numerical solution of the Riemann problem, which is equivalent to the plane wave collision operator, is solved by an iterative method, and an explicit time-marching integral format for the dynamic impact problem in elastic-viscoplastic materials is derived. Then, the numerical model is validated by comparing the calculation results with theoretical results, using a wave propagation example in plate. In addition, the capacity of simulating material property discontinuity and multiple cracks are validated by cases of stress wave transmission and reflection at the materials interface and the cracks capture in Kalthoff dynamic shear test, respectively.},

Both scales may be discretized with different element sizes and the microdomain may exhibit a heterogeneous structure. A surface coupling is described, which imposes the macrovelocities at the interfaces on the microscale. Using an averaged stress state of several elements on the microscale within a bounded volume, forces are derived which transfer the micromaterial response back to the macroscale. Whereas established surface couplings based on Lagrange multipliers achieve an exact solution of the interface problem, the proposed coupling is based on a weak staggered scheme. The advantage is that no common global system of equations has to be solved and the approach preserves the efficiency of direct solution schemes almost completely. It is therefore well applicable to the simulation of wave propagation phenomena in heterogeneous materials with complex constitutive models and suitable for massive parallelization. Example simulations demonstrate the capabilities and current limitations.},

The Newmark time integration scheme is introduced for discretization of the stress fields in the time domain and dynamic analysis of both the compressible solid and quasi-incompressible ones.

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with computing the effective crack energy of periodic and random media which arises in mathematical homogenization results for the Francfort‚ÄìMarigo model of brittle fracture. A previous solver based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) led to solution fields with ringing or checkerboard artifacts and was limited in terms of the achievable accuracy. As computing the effective crack energy may be recast as a continuous maximum flow problem, we suggest using the combinatorial continuous maximum flow discretization introduced by Couprie et al. The latter is devoid of artifacts, but lacks an efficient large-scale solution method. We fill this gap and introduce a novel solver which relies upon the FFT and a doubling of the local degrees of freedom which is resolved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Last but not least we provide an adaptive strategy for choosing the ADMM penalty parameter, further speeding up the solution procedure. We demonstrate the salient features of the proposed approach on problems of industrial scale.},

  abstract     = {A novel methodology for multiple flaw detection is presented in this study. It combines the dynamic extended finite element method (XFEM) with machine learning for the first time. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is chosen as a learning rule for modeling and prediction. The XFEM is employed to overcome the issues associated with the large quantity of input data required for ELM network training, whereas the ELM itself is used to bypass the time-consuming repeated analyses ordinarily required for the detection of multiple flaws. A large amount of potential flaw data for a structure is quasi-randomly generated by a Sobol sequence. For each effective flaw datum, the dynamic XFEM with circular/elliptical void enrichment is used to compute the structural dynamic characteristics (i.e., frequencies and displacement mode shapes), which is possible because re-meshing is not required for each flaw. The available data generated from the results of XFEM analyses are used for ELM network training. According to the measured dynamic characteristics, the trained ELM is then utilized to predict the size and location of flaws. The results show that the proposed novel methodology can identify accurately the location and size of circular or elliptical structural flaws. The method also is more efficient than previously proposed approaches, as it can avoid time-consuming iterative analyses, and it is robust against noise.},

  abstract     = {Under compressive creep, viscoplastic solids experiencing internal mass transfer processes can accommodate singular cnoidal wave solutions as material instabilities at the stationary wave limit. These instabilities appear when the loading rate is significantly faster than the material&#39;s capacity to diffusive internal perturbations, leading to localized failure features (e.g., cracks and compaction bands). These cnoidal waves, generally found in fluids, have strong nonlinearities that produce periodic patterns. Due to the singular nature of the solutions, the applicability of the theory is currently limited. Additionally, practical simulation tools require proper regularization to overcome the challenges that singularity induces. We focus on the numerical treatment of the governing equation using a nonlinear approach building on a recent adaptive stabilized finite element method. This automatic refinement method provides an error estimate that drives mesh adaptivity, a crucial feature for the problem at hand. We compare the performance of this adaptive strategy against analytical and standard finite element solutions. We then investigate the sensitivity of the diffusivity ratio, the parameter controlling the process, and identify multiple possible solutions with several stress peaks. Finally, we show the evolution of the spacing between peaks for all solutions as a function of that parameter.},

  abstract     = {Considering structural strength and castability in topology optimization is very attractive from the perspective of theory and application. This article introduces stress considerations into casting-oriented topology optimization to explore structural optimization methods that simultaneously consider the above two vital design indicators. Two stress-related topology optimization formulations for castable design are proposed and assessed systematically, namely, a compliance minimization with stress and casting constraints and a stress minimization with casting constraint. An effective optimization algorithm is developed to overcome various numerical difficulties caused by stress and castability issues in the solution. Particularly, a nonuniform threshold scheme along with the corresponding implementation algorithm is proposed to improve the casting constraint on irregular structures without appreciably increased computational effort. Benchmark examples are presented to discuss the numerical characteristics of the achieved designs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced algorithms. This research illustrates the necessity and feasibility of stress considerations in casting-oriented topology optimization. The results show that it is more appropriate to treat stress as a constraint rather than an optimization objective in the casting-constrained topology optimization. The proposed formulations and algorithms allow designers to effectively achieve high-performance castable designs with required structural strength requirements.},

To overcome the volumetric locking caused by the incompressibility of soft materials, a weak-form equation for hydrostatic pressure is implemented into a mixed MPM framework. To deal with the massive deformation caused by growth, the total-Lagrangian formulation is further introduced into the mixed MPM. The TLMPM discretized via the B-spline basis functions is then developed in the proposed solution procedure. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by several representative two- and three-dimensional numerical examples with large deformation such as the free growth of blocks and constrained growth of rings. The challenging problems including the volumetric growth of bilayers with complex geometry and the strain-driven growth of skin are further investigated using the proposed TLMPM to illustrate its ability for evaluating the growth phenomena and behaviors as observed in nature and engineering.},

In this regard, the proposed approach has following merits: a) the use of weak material, which is often adopted to mimic voids can be completely avoided; b) exact and explicit description of voids in MMV allows the capture of tiny structural features in a robust and effective way; c) numerical instabilities stemming from the use of fixed meshes can be naturally avoided.

Compared with traditional stress-constrained topology optimization, the number of stress constraints involved in concurrent topology optimization is much larger and the sensitivity analysis for stress constraints is computationally more expensive. To address these challenges, a novel hierarchical aggregation strategy is proposed to handle the large number of stress constraints and an adjoint method is developed for efficient sensitivity analysis. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is also found that the structures obtained by traditional topology optimization usually perform better than the two-scale structures obtained by concurrent topology optimization when only concentrated loads are considered, while the latter may exhibit better performance in the case that distributed loads are involved.},

Isogeometric analysis facilitates the accurate parametrization of the geometry in general, particularly the exact geometric parametrization of the conic curves and quadratic surfaces using NURBS. On the other hand, the local maximum entropy leads to an improved estimate for the enhanced part due to its infinite continuity. Moreover, local maximum entropy paves the way to a nonelementwise crack propagation owing to its meshfree characteristic. To enforce compatibility, the shifting technique is amended for the meshfree enhanced part to localize the effect of the Heaviside function to a narrow region around the crack. Next, a blending technique is exploited to remove the effect of the discontinuity in front of the crack tip. The viability of the approach is illustrated at the hand of several examples comprising straight and curved crack propagation.},

Extensive parametric studies are carried out on the L-shaped design problem to identify the most promising parameters for each solution strategy. It is found that (1) the local strategies are less sensitive to the continuation procedure employed in standard density-based topology optimization, allowing achievement of better quality results using less iterations when compared with the global strategies; (2) the global strategies become competitive when P values larger than 100 are employed, but for this to be possible a very slow continuation procedure should be used; (3) the local strategies based on the augmented Lagrangian method provide the best compromise between computational cost and performance, being able to achieve optimized topologies at the level of a pure P -continuation global strategy with , but using less iterations.},

We apply the proposed SGTHB-TO method to two-dimensional and three-dimensional TO problems of compliance and compliant mechanism. According to the numerical results, SGTHB-TOs with or without admissible restriction share similar optimization processes, except that numerical artifact, such as edge blurring and islanding gray regions occurring in SGTHB-TO without admissible restriction, can be eliminated by SGTHB-TO with admissible parameter equaling to 2. Besides, the convergence rate can be largely accelerated by imposing an admissible constraint on SGTHB-TO for TO problems with geometric nonlinearity existing in the design domain, which is attributed to the improved numerical accuracy by the admissible adaptive discretization scheme of isogeometric analysis (IGA). Therefore, the SGTHB-TO method with the admissible parameter equaling to 2 is a more effective adaptive TO method than SGTHB-TO without considering admissible restriction, in terms of both numerical stability and convergence rate.},

Our approach avoids the complex treatment of cut elements, by resorting to an approximate boundary representation and a special (shifted) treatment of the boundary conditions to maintain optimal accuracy. Natural applications of the proposed approach are problems in biomechanics and geomechanics, in which the geometry to be simulated is obtained from imaging techniques. Similarly, our computational framework can easily treat geometries that are the result of topology optimization methods and are realized with additive manufacturing technologies.

  abstract     = {An optimal version of spline dimensional decomposition (SDD) is unveiled for general high-dimensional uncertainty quantification analysis of complex systems subject to independent but otherwise arbitrary probability measures of input random variables. The resulting method involves optimally derived knot vectors of basis splines (B-splines) in some or all coordinate directions, whitening transformation producing measure-consistent orthonormalized B-splines equipped with optimal knots, and Fourier-spline expansion of a general high-dimensional output function of interest. In contrast to standard SDD, there is no need to select the knot vectors uniformly or intuitively. The generation of optimal knot vectors can be viewed as an inexpensive preprocessing step toward creating the optimal SDD. Analytical formulas are proposed to calculate the second-moment properties by the optimal SDD method for a general output random variable in terms of the expansion coefficients involved. It has been shown that the computational complexity of the optimal SDD method is polynomial, as opposed to exponential, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality by a discernible magnitude. Numerical results affirm that the optimal SDD method developed is more precise than polynomial chaos expansion, sparse-grid quadrature, and the standard SDD method in calculating not only the second-moment statistics, but also the cumulative distribution function of an output random variable. More importantly, the optimal SDD outperforms standard SDD by sustaining nearly identical computational cost.},

  abstract     = {The boundary element method (BEM) is an efficient numerical method for simulating harmonic wave propagation. It uses boundary integral formulations of the Helmholtz equation at the interfaces of piecewise homogeneous domains. The discretization of its weak formulation leads to a dense system of linear equations, which is typically solved with an iterative linear method such as GMRES. The application of BEM to simulating wave propagation through large-scale geometries is only feasible when compression and preconditioning techniques reduce the computational footprint. Furthermore, many different boundary integral equations exist that solve the same boundary value problem. The choice of preconditioner and boundary integral formulation is often optimized for a specific configuration, depending on the geometry, material characteristics, and driving frequency. On the one hand, the design flexibility for the BEM can lead to fast and accurate schemes. On the other hand, efficient and robust algorithms are difficult to achieve without expert knowledge of the BEM intricacies. This study surveys the design of boundary integral formulations for acoustics and their acceleration with operator preconditioners. Extensive benchmarks provide valuable information on the computational characteristics of several hundred different models for multiple reflection and transmission of acoustic waves.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a discrete variable topology optimization method to solve the simplified convective heat transfer (SCHT) design optimization modeled by Newton&#39;s law of cooling. The discrete variable topology optimization is based on the proposed sequential approximate integer programming with trust-region. Due to the discrete variables, identifying the convective boundary, and implementing this design-dependent convective boundary condition can be precisely undertaken. As a result, the consistent precise temperature field compared with the commercial software is captured. Besides, the interpolation scheme of the convective coefficient is unnecessary to analyze this SCHT problem. Furthermore, an analytical sensitivity formulation that can simultaneously incorporate the conductive and convective effect is also deduced. Finally, several 2D and 3D valid thermal designs are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. Based on the optimized designs, we find that favorable configurations for a simplified convective problem may be hollowed structure or the dense needle-like structure. Further, the checkerboard pattern should be interpreted as a convection oscillatory feature but not the discretization error because it cannot be eliminated by using higher-order elements.},

However, the nonlocal nature of this theory is the cause of two main problems near the boundary of the body: an undesired stiffness fluctuation, the so-called surface effect , and the difficulty of defining a rational method to properly impose the boundary conditions. The surface effect is analyzed analytically and numerically in the present paper in a state-based peridynamic model. The authors propose a modified fictitious node method based on an extrapolation with a truncated Taylor series expansion. Furthermore, a rational procedure to impose the boundary conditions is defined with the aid of the fictitious nodes. In particular, Neumann boundary conditions are implemented via the peridynamic concept of force flux. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed by means of several numerical examples for a state-based peridynamic model: with respect to the peridynamic model adopting no corrections, the results are significantly improved even if low values of the truncation order for the Taylor expansion are chosen.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel direct Jacobian total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (DJ-TLED) finite element algorithm for real-time nonlinear mechanics simulation. The nodal force contributions are expressed using only the Jacobian operator, instead of the deformation gradient tensor and finite deformation tensor, for fewer computational operations at run-time. Owing to this proposed Jacobian formulation, novel expressions are developed for strain invariants and constant components, which are also based on the Jacobian operator. Results show that the proposed DJ-TLED consumed between 0.70√ó and 0.88√ó CPU solution times compared to state-of-the-art TLED and achieved up to 121.72√ó and 94.26√ó speed improvements in tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes, respectively, using GPU acceleration. Compared to TLED, the most notable difference is that the notions of stress and strain are not explicitly visible in the proposed DJ-TLED but embedded implicitly in the formulation of nodal forces. Such a force formulation can be beneficial for fast deformation computation and can be particularly useful if the displacement field is of primary interest, which is demonstrated using a neurosurgical simulation of brain deformations for image-guided neurosurgery. The present work contributes towards a comprehensive DJ-TLED algorithm concerning isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive models and GPU implementation.},

Stochastic reduced order models (SROMs) are leveraged for the modeling and propagation of uncertainties within a robust topology optimization (RTO) formulation. The SROM approach provides an alternative to existing uncertainty quantification methods and yields a substantial improvement in efficiency over a classical Monte Carlo based approach while retaining similar accuracy when representing the uncertainty in system parameters. In particular, random input parameters can be discrete or continuous and specified either analytically (standard distributions) or numerically (dataset samples). Furthermore, multiple random quantities need not be treated as uncorrelated; an SROM can seamlessly model random vectors with arbitrary correlation structure. The nonintrusive nature of the SROM method yields an implementation that can be seen as a drop-in replacement for a simple RTO approach that leverages Monte Carlo simulation and is therefore straightforward to implement in existing topology optimization software. The proposed approach is demonstrated in the context of structural topology optimization with uncertainty in applied loads. Several numerical results are presented, covering a range of uncertainty distributions that illustrate the flexibility afforded by the general SROM method, while highlighting the efficiency and accuracy achieved in uncertainty propagation.},

Based on arbitrary star-convex polyhedral elements using piecewise linear shape function, the present method can have the advantage of being applicable to complicated structures. Nevertheless, the proposed interpolation technique gives higher-order continuity, greater accuracy with the same number of DOFs. The reliability and efficiency of the CIPFEM are proved by comparing the present results with those obtained by the consecutive-interpolation for tetrahedral element (CT4), conventional linear FEM using polyhedral elements (PFEM), and tetrahedral elements (T4) through numerical examples.

The viscoplastic Johnson-Cook constitutive model serves as prototype for the effective material. The continuum damage evolution of Lemaitre type is focusing the degradation of the shear response, eventually leading to ductile shear failure. A novel feature is the damage-driving dissipation rate, allowing for elastic and plastic components separated by a global damage threshold for accumulation of inelastic damage-driving energy. In the application to a dynamic split-Hopkinson test and two quasi-static tensile tests, the gradient damage model is compared with the corresponding local model. For isothermal conditions, the examples show that both damage models exhibit mesh convergent behavior when using the global damage threshold.},

Damage variables are calculated by a continuum damage mechanics model based on accurate energy reduction and then regularized by the phase field model. Since the continuum damage mechanics model is combined with phase field method, tensile strength of material is employed for calculating the damage field and phase field.

In the authors&#39; opinion, the use of the Voigt rules leads to a cumbersome formulation where the physical sense of the operations is obscured since the well-known algebra rules are lost.

In this work, we develop the boundary element method of peridynamics (PD-BEM). The numerical examples demonstrate that the PD-BEM exhibits several features. First, for nondestructive cases, the PD-BEM can be one to two orders of magnitude faster than the meshless particle method of peridynamics (PD-MPM) that directly discretizes the computational domains; second, it eliminates the time accumulation error, and thus conserves the total energy much better than the PD-MPM; third, it does not exhibit spurious boundary softening phenomena. For destructive cases where new boundaries emerge during the loading process, we propose a coupling scheme where the PD-MPM is applied to the cracked region and the PD-BEM is applied to the uncracked region such that the time of computation can be significantly reduced.},

The stable coupled nonlocal poromechanics model is solved for dynamic analysis by an implicit time integration scheme. As a new contribution, we validate the coupled stabilization formulation by comparing numerical results with analytical and finite element solutions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional dynamic problems in saturated porous media. Numerical examples of dynamic strain localization in saturated porous media are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the stable coupled poromechanics framework for localized failure under dynamic loads.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address discrete linear systems in the frequency domain, where both frequency and random parameters are considered. Sampling such a system many times is computationally challenging if the size is too large, which is often the case for a finite element discretization of partial differential equations. We propose an adaptive method, steered by dual error indicators, which combines rational Arnoldi model order reduction and sparse grid interpolation with hierarchical Leja nodes. At each Leja node, a reduced order model (ROM) is constructed such that the ROM-error in the frequency domain is balanced with the sparse grid error in the random parameter domain. Both the ROM basis and the sparse grid set are enlarged in a hierarchical manner to achieve a prescribed accuracy in statistical moments. Moreover, parameter sensitivities over the frequency range can be easily extracted from the combined reduced order-surrogate model. In the numerical tests considered in the paper, the method employs sampling sets, which are reduced by at least an order of magnitude, compared to Monte Carlo simulation. Additionally, for an example from vibroacoustics, building a ROM reduces the system size by roughly a factor of 100, while still providing an acceptable accuracy.},

The framework is fully developed for MDAO problems with linearized fluid-structure interaction constraints.

In the numerical solution, the optimization problem is solved with a gradient-based solution algorithm. The nonlinear subproblems of the FSI forward problem are solved with a Newton method including line search.

In each of them, interaction between an individual cable and the surrounding fluid is inevitable. Such a fluid-structure interaction has received little attention in the literature, possibly due to the inherent complexity associated with fluid and structural semidiscretizations of disparate spatial dimensions. This article proposes an embedded boundary approach for filling this gap, where the dynamics of the cable are captured by a standard finite element representation of its centerline, while its geometry is represented by a discrete surface ‚àë h that is embedded in the fluid mesh. The proposed approach is built on master-slave kinematics between and ‚àë h , a simple algorithm for computing the motion/deformation of ‚àë h based on the dynamic state of , and an energy-conserving method for transferring to the loads computed on ‚àë h . Its effectiveness is demonstrated for two highly nonlinear applications featuring large deformations and/or motions of a cable subsystem and turbulent flows: an aerial refueling model problem, and a challenging supersonic parachute inflation problem. The proposed approach is verified using numerical data and validated using real flight data.},

  abstract     = {Embedded boundary methods (EBMs) are robust solution methods for highly nonlinear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. They suffer, however, some disadvantages because they perform their computations on embedding, nonbody-fitted fluid meshes. In particular, they tend to generate discrete events that introduce discontinuities in the semi-discretization process and lead to numerical solutions that are insufficiently smooth for differentiation with respect to the evolution of a discrete, fluid/structure interface Œì h F / S . This hinders their application to the gradient-based solution of fluid-structure optimization problems. Discrete events also promote spurious oscillations in the post-processing of time-dependent results computed at Œì h F / S .z This paper addresses these issues in the context of Finite Volume method with Exact two-material Riemann problems (FIVER), a comprehensive framework for developing EBMs for highly nonlinear, compressible, FSI problems. It revisits the concept of the status of a node of an embedding fluid mesh and introduces that of a smoothness indicator nodal function, to eliminate discrete events and achieve smoothness in the semi-discretization process. It also introduces a moving least squares approach in the loads evaluation algorithm, to suppress spurious oscillations from integral quantities computed on . Equipped with these enhancements, FIVER is shown to deliver, for three different FSI applications, smooth results that are differentiable with respect to evolutions of .},

The objective is to detail the formulation and to quantify the role played by the elasticity in the neighborhood of the triple contact line between the free surface of the compressible liquid and the elastic structure in presence of sloshing and capillarity effects. Most of the works consider that the structure is totally not deformable (rigid tank). Nevertheless, for taking into account the elasticity of the tank, some works have introduced an approximation, which consists in considering a locally undeformable structure in the neighborhood of the triple contact line. The theory presented requires the use of quadratic finite elements for discretizing a new introduced boundary condition. An application has specifically been constructed and presented for quantifying the role played by the elasticity of the structure in the neighborhood of the triple contact line.},

  abstract     = {We present a consistent approach that allows to solve challenging general nonlinear fluid-structure-contact interaction (FSCI) problems. The underlying formulation includes both ‚Äúno-slip‚Äù fluid-structure interaction as well as frictionless contact between multiple elastic bodies. The respective interface conditions in normal and tangential orientation and especially the role of the fluid stress within the region of closed contact are discussed for the general problem of FSCI. A continuous transition of tangential constraints from no-slip to frictionless contact is enabled by using the general Navier condition with varying slip length. Moreover, the fluid stress in the contact zone is obtained by an extension approach as it plays a crucial role for the lift-off behavior of contacting bodies. With the given continuity of the formulation, continuity of the discrete system of equations for any variation of the coupled system state (which is essential for the convergence of Newton&#39;s method) is reached naturally. As topological changes of the fluid domain are an inherent challenge in FSCI configurations, a noninterface fitted cut finite element method (CutFEM) is applied to discretize the fluid domain. All interface conditions, that is the ‚Äúno-slip‚Äù FSI, the general Navier condition, and frictionless contact are incorporated using Nitsche based methods, thus retaining the consistency of the model. To account for the strong interaction between the fluid and solid discretization, the overall coupled discrete system is solved monolithically. Numerical examples of varying complexity are presented to corroborate the developments. In a first example, the fundamental properties of the presented formulation such as the contacting and lift-off behavior, the mass conservation, and the influence of the slip length for the general Navier interface condition are analyzed. Beyond that, two more general examples demonstrate challenging aspects such as topological changes of the fluid domain, large contacting areas, and underline the general applicability of the presented method.},

A number of strategies have been proposed to address this challenge. However, these strategies are often complicated or restricted to certain problem classes and generally require intrusive modifications of existing software. In this work, the well-known Dirichlet-Neumann coupling is revisited and a new combined two-field relaxation strategy is proposed. A family of efficient staggered schemes based crucially on a force predictor is formulated alongside the classical iterative approach. Both methodologies are rigorously analyzed on the basis of a linear model problem derived from a simplified fluid-conveying elastic tube. The investigation suggests that both the robustness and the efficiency of a partitioned Dirichlet-Neumann coupling scheme can be improved by a relatively small nonintrusive modification of a standard implementation. The relevance of the model problem analysis for finite element-based computational fluid-structure interaction is demonstrated in detail for a submerged cylinder subject to an external force.},

We present an algorithm to implement the Robin interface condition in an embedded boundary method for coupling a projection-based incompressible viscous flow solver with a nonlinear finite element structural solver. We demonstrate the numerical effects of the spatially varying Robin interface condition using two example problems: a simplified model problem featuring a nonuniform Euler-Bernoulli beam interacting with an inviscid flow and a generalized Turek-Hron problem featuring a nonuniform, highly flexible beam interacting with a viscous laminar flow. Both cases show that a spatially varying Robin interface condition can clearly improve numerical accuracy (by up to two orders of magnitude in one instance) for the same computational cost. Using the second example problem, we also demonstrate and compare two models for determining the local value of the combination function in the Robin interface condition.},

  abstract     = {Modeling of roll forming process of sheet metal requires efficient treatment of plastic deformations of thin shells and plates. We suggest a new general approach toward constructing the governing equations of bending of an elastic-plastic Kirchhoff plate on the structural mechanics level. The generic function of the isotropic hardening law is formulated in terms of variables, which are meaningful for a material surface, namely resultant bending moments and dissipative work. This function is then identified by comparison of the exact solutions for a uni-axial or isotropic bending experiment within the structural model and with the continuum model of a through-the-thickness element. We validate the approach against both the fully three-dimensional simulations as well as the results of the traditional elastic-plastic plate analysis, the latter one featuring the continuum laws of plasticity treated in the integration points along the thickness direction. We considered benchmark problems from the literature as well as a prototype for the roll forming problem. Besides good agreement regarding the shape of plastic zones and force-deflection characteristics, experiments also demonstrate higher computational efficiency of the new stress resultant model.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of determining probabilistic entropy fluctuations, which are important for understanding uncertainty propagation in mechanical systems in the elasto-plastic regime. Probabilistic entropy is conceptualized based on an initial definition by Shannon, which demands discrete representation of the uncertainty source. Numerical analysis is performed using the Response Function Method with polynomial bases. Coefficients are found and order optimization is completed using polynomial interpolations or the Least Squares Method. Approximations are based on the Finite Element Method. Local polynomial bases enable nonlinear increment analysis, and allow for a given degree of freedom in the FEM model to be described as a function of a random input parameter. Academic FEM software and the ABAQUS system were used for numerical experiments. Polynomial approximations, probabilistic moment computations, and statistical entropy estimations were programmed in the symbolic algebra package MAPLE. Transformation of the input probability density into the output function was performed using the Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm for statistically optimized polynomial bases of extreme displacement functions. Two computational examples are given to demonstrate probabilistic entropy fluctuations for a small statically indeterminate aluminum truss structure and also for practical engineering case study of the steel round bar under uniform tensile stress. In these examples, some material and geometrical uncertainties distributed according to Gaussian, triangular, uniform as well as lognormal distributions were analyzed. The presented approach could be used for constitutive models of solids, computational fluid dynamics, and in other discrete numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainties associated with spatially varying parameters are modeled through random fields discretized into a finite number of random variables. Standard discretization methods, such as the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve expansion, use series representations for which the truncation order is specified a priori. However, when data is used to update random fields through Bayesian inference, a different truncation order might be necessary to adequately represent the posterior random field. This is an inference problem that not only requires the determination of the often high-dimensional set of coefficients, but also their dimension. In this article, we develop a sequential algorithm to handle such inference settings and propose a penalizing prior distribution for the dimension parameter. The method is a variable-dimensional extension of BUS (Bayesian Updating with Structural reliability methods), combined with subset simulation (SuS). The key idea is to replace the standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm within SuS by a trans-dimensional MCMC sampler that is able to populate the discrete-continuous parameter space. To address this task, we consider two types of MCMC algorithms that operate in a fixed-dimensional saturated space. The performance of the proposed method with both MCMC variants is assessed numerically for two examples: a 1D cantilever beam with spatially varying flexibility and a 2D groundwater flow problem with uncertain permeability field.},

Experimental-numerical analysis was conducted over the full range of loading (until failure phenomenon). Regarding the experimental tests, postbuckling equilibrium paths as well as acoustic emission signals were registered, which directly allowed for comprehensive analysis of failure phenomenon of composite material. In case of numerical simulations, two independent numerical damage models were used. The first one constitutes the progressive failure analysis, considering the damage initiation criteria using Hashin&#39;s theory and damage evolution based on the energy criterion. The second one constitutes the cohesive zone model, which was used to simulate failure of composite material caused by delamination phenomenon.

A first simple example demonstrates the effects of including frictional impacts into the transient design problem.

This article presents a novel topology optimization approach to PC that determines the ideal number of parts, their geometry, and optimal joining pattern, without bias towards the original assembly. Multiple layered design domains are created, and a joining domain that determines the connections between parts is introduced. A multiobjective problem statement optimizes the complex trade-off between compliance, support structure volume, surface area, and number of joints, to minimize the total cost of the final assembly. Design variable initialization and boundary condition placement are discussed for problems with multiple domains. Three test cases are presented and solved for a range of cost trade-offs to demonstrate optimized solutions as design objectives are varied.},

In the proposed method, a nonlinear structural system with uncertain interval parameters is described as a series of interval nonlinear equations. With Taylor series expansion, an interval iteration scheme is established to successively approximate the upper and lower bounds of the response based on the Newton method. The structural response bounds in every iteration step are updated by solving linear interval increment determination equations via the Lagrangian multiplier method. Thereout, an uncertain nonlinear problem is simplified to a series of uncertain linear issues. The convergence of the proposed method is further discussed in this article. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method by contrast with several existing methods. Moreover, the compatibility between numerical results of the perturbation-based probabilistic method and the proposed method is then studied and verified.},

  abstract     = {Based on the local frame approach, a new geometrically exact shell with drilling rotations is proposed in the SE (3) framework when dealing with the finite deformation and rotation issues. To eliminate the geometric nonlinearity of rigid-body motion, a drilling rotation formulation is applied to the 5-DoF shell presented in advance. As expected, the shell with drilling rotations completely eliminates the geometric nonlinearity of rigid-body motion, which results in the invariance of the Jacobian matrices of inertial and internal forces under any rigid-body motion, while the shell without drilling rotations does not. Therefore, the updates times of Jacobian matrices decreases sharply and the computational costs can be significantly reduced during dynamic analysis. By removing the rigid-body motion of the reference point, the objectivity of the discretized strain measures is guaranteed by interpolating the relative motion. To maintain second-order convergence, the expressions of the inertial and internal forces are strictly derived by linearizing the discrete weak form of the equilibrium equations. Furthermore, locking alleviation techniques are employed to alleviate shear and membrane locking. For dynamic analysis, the generalized-Œ± method on Lie group is used to solve dynamic equilibrium equations. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the versatility and robustness of the present formulation.},

  abstract     = {The peridynamic bond-associated material correspondence model is a reformulation of the conventional correspondence model, in which the concept of bond-associated states were introduced to inherently remove the material instability. Numerical studies, in terms of deformation analysis, have shown the effectiveness of the bond-associated model in removing the material instability. In this study, the bond-associated model is further examined concerning its wave dispersion property. Detailed procedure to derive the wave dispersion relation in this model is outlined. Different combinations of the peridynamic material point horizon and the bond-associated horizon are studied for all three geometric dimensions. Potential effects of weight function on the wave dispersion property are also investigated. It is found that the bond-associated material correspondence model can effectively remove the material instability for practical applications. However, for all one-dimensional cases studied, except the conventional model, the initial slopes of all the wave dispersion curves are slightly larger than that predicted by the classical continuum mechanics model. For two-dimensional analysis, material instability still exists for the combination of the peridynamic material point horizon being twice of the mesh spacing and the bond-associated horizon being three times of mesh spacing. But compared to the conventional model, the material instability for this case was slightly improved as the intersections of the wave dispersion curve with the wavenumber axis were reduced from two to one. For the three representative weight functions studied, it is found that the weight function does not significantly change the wave dispersion relation in the bond-associated material correspondence model, except for the one-dimensional cases.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a methodology aiming at easing considerably the generation of high-quality meshes for complex three-dimensional (3D) domains. To this end, a mesh size field h ( x ) is computed, taking surface curvatures and geometric features into account. The size field is tuned by five intuitive parameters and yields quality meshes for arbitrary geometries. Mesh size is initialized on a surface triangulation of the domain based on discrete curvatures and medial axis transform computations. It is then propagated into the volume while ensuring the size gradient ‚àá h is controlled so as to obtain a smoothly graded mesh. As the size field is stored in an independent octree data structure, it can be computed separately, then plugged into any mesh generator able to respect a prescribed size field. The procedure is automatic, in the sense that minimal interaction with the user is required. Applications of our methodology on CAD models taken from the very large ABC dataset are presented. In particular, all presented meshes were obtained with the same generic set of parameters, demonstrating the universality of the technique.},

Using the BFEM, the linear elastic model and large elastic deformation model of the plane truss element are derived, and the large elastic deformation model is expanded into a three-dimensional setting in this study. The rotating part of the element should be considered when deriving the large elastic deformation model. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether base force can be used as a fundamental unknown variable. Nonlinear numerical calculation is performed in combination with large elastic deformations of the truss beam and frame. The calculated results conform with the theoretical results of a solid beam with equivalent deflection. In this study, the U.L and T.L formats are used to solve the governing equations iteratively. The calculated results in the T.L format are compared with those of the T2D2 and LINK1 elements in the finite element software. Only a single loading of the T.L format is necessary, rendering it a simple and convenient approach that can improve calculation efficiency. Moreover, the arc-length method is first applied to the BFEM to solve the snap-through problem.},

  abstract     = {Model order reduction (MOR) has become one of the most widely used tools to create efficient surrogate models for time-critical applications. For nonlinear models, however, linear MOR approaches are only practicable to a limited extent. Nonlinear approaches, on the contrary, often require intrusive manipulations of the used simulation code. Hence, nonintrusive MOR approaches using classic model order reduction along with machine learning (ML) algorithms can provide remedy. Such approaches have drawn a lot of attention in the recent years. They rely on the idea to learn the dynamics not in a high dimensional but in a reduced space, that is, they predict the discrete sequence of reduced basis&#39; coefficients. Open questions are the suitability of such methods in the field of structural dynamics and the best choice of the used ML algorithm. Both are addressed in this article in addition to the integration of the methodology into a modular and flexible framework that can effortless be adapted to various requirements. By applying the methodology to a dynamic mechanical system, accurate surrogate models are received, which can speed up the simulation time significantly, while still providing high-quality state approximations.},

  abstract     = {For effective bone healing, the stiffness of the bone plate should be adjusted to different bone-healing processes. Thus, the design of stiffness-changeable structures that take into account the time effect is of importance. To this end, this study introduces a novel topological optimization approach for the composite structural layout design considering material degradation to realize structures with changeable stiffness over time. In this approach, two sets of variables are used: a density field that defines the material layout, and a time field that determines the effect of material degradation on mechanical performance. The continuous degradation update formula is proposed by integrating the Heaviside projected function and Kreisselmeier‚ÄìSteinhauser function to guarantee its derivability. The objective is to minimize the summed compliance in some specified time steps subject to the constraints of volume fraction. The sensitivity of the aforementioned objective with respect to the design variable is deduced by considering the material degradation over time. The proposed design formulation is general and is demonstrated with several design analyses, considering different fix and degradable interface boundary conditions. Moreover, the results are compared with the results of not considering material degradation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {When modeling fluid flow in fractured reservoirs, it is common to represent the fractures as lower-dimensional inclusions embedded in the host medium. Existing discretizations of flow in porous media with thin inclusions assume that the principal directions of the inclusion permeability tensor are aligned with the inclusion orientation. While this modeling assumption works well with tensile fractures, it may fail in the context of faults, where the damage zone surrounding the main slip surface may introduce anisotropy that is not aligned with the main fault orientation. In this article, we introduce a generalized dimensional reduced model which preserves full-tensor permeability effects also in the out-of-plane direction of the inclusion. The governing equations of flow for the lower-dimensional objects are obtained through vertical averaging. We present a framework for discretization of the resulting mixed-dimensional problem, aimed at easy adaptation of existing simulation tools. We give numerical examples that show the failure of existing formulations when applied to anisotropic faulted porous media, and go on to show the convergence of our method in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional.},

This allows us to employ a fully conforming FE discretization for any elastic solid using classical FE subspaces of H ( div ) and H 1 . Hence, the resulting FE approximation yields both continuous stresses and displacements. To ensure stability of the method, we employ the philosophy of the discontinuous Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin method of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan and use optimal test spaces. Thus, the resulting FE discretization is stable even as the Poisson&#39;s ratio , and the system of linear algebraic equations is symmetric and positive definite. Our method also comes with a built-in a posteriori error estimator as well as indicators which are used to drive mesh adaptive refinements. We present several numerical verifications of our method including comparisons to existing FE technologies.},

The DEM formulation used in this paper provides a way to model solid materials and eliminate residual stress created in any particle packing algorithm. The R 2 Fill method was tested over ranges of particle sizes. At large size ranges the method generated a higher coordinate number and denser particle packing, with 79.718% fill at the maximum tested size range. The geometric isotropy was improved at higher size ranges yielding less than a 1% isotropic error. The method also had fewer particles than the similar and more complex algorithm by Yongjun Li. Lastly we tested mechanical isotropy by using our DEM formulation to measure the stress‚Äìstrain response under a tensile load at different orientations. The R 2 Fill method produced mechanical isotropy within 2% error for the elastic moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson ratio.},

Considering the effect of strain gradients in different process zone elements, the corresponding higher order stress are used to model crystal plasticity of single crystal -Ta. Different from face-centered cubic crystals, BCC crystals are strongly influenced by temperature. It is shown in this article that the developed finite temperature atomistic-informed crystal plasticity finite element method is able to capture the temperature-dependent dislocation substructure and hence crystal plastic deformation. The main contributions and novelties of the present work are highlighted by following findings: (1) A THCB rule and an atomistic-informed strain gradient theory have been developed, and the corresponding temperature-related higher-order stress and elastic tensor formulations are derived; (2) The finite temperature MCDD provides an atomistic-informed crystal plasticity finite element method that can simulate anisotropic crystal plasticity in any orientation within stereographic triangle at micron scale and above; (3) The developed MCDD is able to capture the non-Schmid effects of BCC single crystal tantalum ( -Ta); (4) The developed MCDD is able to capture the size effect of single crystal plasticity; and (5) The finite temperature MCDD can simulate the temperature dependent dislocation substructure, and it captures cross-slip in single crystal tantalum at low temperature (‚àº20‚ÄâK) and captures dislocation cell structure at high temperature (‚àº500‚ÄâK).},

The proposed solution process combines four different existent techniques. First, the contact constraints are modeled by a bipenalty contact-impact formulation that incorporates stiffness and mass penalties preserving the stability limit of contact-free problems for efficient explicit time integration. Second, a method of localized Lagrange multipliers is employed, which facilitates the partitioned governing equations for each substructure along with the completely localized contact penalty forces pertaining to each free substructure. Third, a method for the direct construction of sparse inverse mass matrices of the free bodies in contact is combined with the localized Lagrange multipliers approach. Finally, an element-by-element mass matrix scaling technique that allows the extension of the time integration step is adopted to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. A judicious synthesis of the four numerical techniques has resulted in an increased stable explicit step-size that boosts the performance of the bipenalty method for contact problems. Classical contact-impact numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

The element is isostatic, namely the stress interpolation is ruled by the minimum number of parameters. Displacement and rotation fields are only assumed along the contour of the element. As such, all the operators are efficiently obtained through analytical contour integration. The geometrical nonlinearity is introduced by means of a corotational formulation. The proposed finite element, named MISS-4c, proves to be locking free and shows no rank defectiveness. A multimodal Koiter&#39;s algorithm is used to obtain the initial postbuckling response.

  abstract     = {In the present work, we consider the industrial problem of estimating in real-time the mold-steel heat flux in continuous casting mold. We approach this problem by first considering the mold modeling problem (direct problem). Then, we plant the heat flux estimation problem as the inverse problem of estimating a Neumann boundary condition having as data pointwise temperature measurements in the interior of the mold domain. We also consider the case of having a total heat flux measurement together with the temperature measurements. We develop two methodologies for solving this inverse problem. The first one is the traditional Alifanov&#39;s regularization, the second one exploits the parameterization of the heat flux. We develop the latter method to have an offline‚Äìonline decomposition with a computationally efficient online part to be performed in real-time. In the last part of this work, we test these methods on academic and industrial benchmarks. The results show that the parameterization method outclasses Alifanov&#39;s regularization both in performance and computational cost. Moreover, it proves to be robust with respect to the measurements noise. Finally, the tests confirm that the computational cost is suitable for real-time estimation of the heat flux.},

  abstract     = {The time-discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (TDGFEM) has advantages in reducing spurious numerical oscillations and capturing discontinuities of solutions in space for high-frequency dynamical problems. This article extends TDGFEM into Cosserat media to focus on impulse wave propagations, involving rotational wave and effects of microstructures. The Cosserat continuum theory contains additional rotational degrees of freedom, leading to Cosserat compressive (P), shear (S), and rotational (R) waves. Therefore, three Cosserat wave propagations are simulated by TDGFEM under impulse loads in this article. Different orders (P1‚ÄìP3) of temporal shape functions are presented for Cosserat nodal unknown vectors, leading to different matrix equations for TDGFEM. One-dimensional numerical results show capacity and efficiency of TDGFEM simulating Cosserat impulse wave propagations. Analyses about time step, mesh density and accuracy of TDGFEM are given in one-dimensional examples. Results simulated by three methods with artificial damping are compared with those by TDGFEM, which shows a higher efficiency for TDGFEM. Two-dimensional results present the propagation characteristics of Cosserat impulse P, S, and R waves, and velocities of Cosserat P, S, and R waves are simulated by TDGFEM. The characteristic length and Cosserat shear modulus have a major influence on impulse S and R wave propagations.},

To obtain a structure that can minimize deformations due to dynamic loading for the isotropic hyperelastic model, the square norm of dynamic compliance is set as the objective function. A sensitivity analysis method of the equation of motion, based on Newmark&#39;s Œ≤ method for unknown displacements, is presented in the current study. The analysis is carried out by developing a general design sensitivity equation that can accurately account for the response of the structure to dynamic loading and simultaneously display a high affinity for the general constitutive law by using the adjoint variable method. The accuracy of the obtained sensitivity is verified by using the finite difference method as a benchmark. Numerical examples are then used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is able to derive optimization results according to the magnitude of the applied load.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the authors propose an efficient numerical homogenization method, the so-called cluster based nonuniform transformation field analysis (NTFA), for inelastic heterogeneous material. The method enables to predict the effective properties directly from the local constitutive relations for microstructural phases of heterogeneous material, thus no requiring preliminary assumptions and any derivations for the effective constitutive relation as in the conventional NTFA. Evolution of plastic strain field is expressed by combination of nonuniform plastic strain modes evaluated from the nonlinear finite element analysis for training directions previously given and snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition. Eventually, microscopic stress and strain field are represented by scalar reduced variables and plastic strain modes. A simple maximization of minimum distance is proposed in order to choose uniformly distributed training directions on a unit sphere in the load space. Also, scalar reduced variables are directly determined from the integration of local constitutive relation, where material points are compressed into a number of clusters by clustering scheme. Thus, evolution of reduced variables is evaluated by the integration of local constitutive relation only in clusters. Numerical examples that consider material models followed J 2 plasticity and pressure-dependent non-associated flow rule show that the current approach may predict the effective properties of inelastic heterogeneous material accurately and efficiently. It should be noted that the current approach can be available for material followed not only associated flow rule but also non-associated flow one.},

To open up the full potential of RTO under a variety of random sources, this article presents a momentum-based accelerated mirror descent stochastic approximation (AC-MDSA) approach to efficiently solve RTO problems involving various types of load uncertainties. The proposed framework performs high-quality design updates with highly noisy and biased stochastic gradients. The sample size is reduced to two (minimum for unbiased variance estimation) and is shown to be sufficient for evaluating stochastic gradients to obtain robust designs, thus drastically reducing the computational cost. The AC-MDSA update formula based on entropic ‚Ñì 1 -norm is derived, which mimics the feasible space geometry. A momentum-based acceleration scheme is integrated to accelerate the convergence, stabilize the design evolution, and alleviate step size sensitivity. Several 2D and 3D examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AC-MDSA to handle RTO involving various loading uncertainties. Comparison with other methods shows that the proposed AC-MDSA is superior in computational cost, stability, and convergence speed.},

The ideal gas law and Dalton&#39;s law are employed to consider vapor and dry air as miscible gases. To take into account the phase change, latent heat and specific vapor enthalpy are incorporated into the physical model. The set of governing equations consists of linear momentum for the solid-phase, energy balance equation and mass conservation equations of water species (liquid and vapor) and dry air, which are derived within the framework of the generalized Biot&#39;s theory. The weak forms are presented in terms of the displacement, water pressure, capillary pressure, and temperature as the primary variables. The spatial and temporal discretizations are carried out applying the extended finite element method and the generalized Newmark scheme, respectively, resulting in the final system of fully coupled nonlinear equations. Finally, several numerical examples are solved to demonstrate not only the robustness of the proposed computational model but also the effect of the crack orientation, intrinsic permeability, and elastic modulus on the fluid flow patterns, relative humidity, and temperature distribution. Moreover, an edge-crack propagation is investigated under mode I fracture due to drying conditions.},

Aggregation of the specific plastic work combined with an adaptive normalization scheme efficiently constrains the maximum specific plastic work. The optimization problem is regularized using an augmented partial differential equation filter, and is solved by the method of moving asymptotes where path-dependent sensitivities are derived using the adjoint method. The numerical examples show a clear dependence on the optimized maximum stiffness structures for different levels of constrained specific plastic work.

The developed contact forces not only mitigate the effect of stress concentration at crack tip but also contribute significantly to the transfer of shear and normal stresses. In this article, we present a numerical framework to study the simultaneous process of fracture and self-contact between fracturing surfaces. The widely used approach, where contact constraints are enforced with the cohesive element traction separation law , is demonstrated to fail for relative displacements greater than the characteristic mesh length. A hybrid approach is proposed, which couples a node-to-segment contact algorithm with extrinsic cohesive elements. Thus, the fracture process is modeled with cohesive elements, whereas the contact and the friction constraints are enforced through a penalty-based method. This hybrid cohesive-contact approach is shown to alleviate any mesh topology limitations, making it a reliable and physically based numerical model for studying crack propagation along rough surfaces.},

In this study, a computationally efficient axisymmetric-formulation of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation is presented to eliminate the requirement of a priori assumed velocity profile function. Present formulation in terms of axial velocity ( u ), pressure ( p ), and domain radius ( R ) leads to the evolution of velocity profile as flow progresses with the time and space. We propose a multi-layered structural model of the arterial wall with each layer idealized using four-element Maxwell viscoelastic material model. Partial differential equations, mathematically representing the physical phenomena of blood flow in the complaint blood vessels, are discretized in the spatial domain by finite element method and in time domain by Galerkin time integration technique. A velocity boundary condition is prescribed at inlet and outlet boundary condition is prescribed in terms of three-parameter based Windkessel model.

The main goal of this work is to develop a computational framework for the solution of unconstrained parametric structural problems with IR and the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) method. First, the IR method is formulated in a parametric setting for both material and geometric parameters. A reduced order model using the encapsulated PGD suite is then developed to solve the parametric IR problem, circumventing the so-called curse of dimensionality . With just one offline computation, the proposed PGD-IR scheme provides a computational vademecum that contains all the possible solutions for a predefined range of the parameters. The proposed approach is nonintrusive and it is therefore possible to be integrated with commercial finite element (FE) packages. The applicability and potential of the developed technique is shown using a three-dimensional test case and a more complex industrial test case. The first example is used to highlight the numerical properties of the scheme, whereas the second example demonstrates the potential in a more complex setting and it shows the possibility to integrate the proposed framework within a commercial FE package. In addition, the last example shows the possibility to use the generalized solution in a multi-objective optimization setting.},

The subspace is obtained by applying a spectral projector and is computed by contour integration, whereas the contour is also used to subsequently solve the projected EVP by rational approximation. The computation of the projection matrices is addressed by two approaches. In the case of heavy fluid loading, we solve the underlying coupled linear systems by an iterative block Krylov method. In the case of light fluid loading, we exploit the fact that the coupled system admits accurate model order reduction solely based on the structural subsystem. Applications to a spherical shell and to a musical bell indicate that only a few contour points are required for an accurate solution without inducing spurious eigenvalues. The results are compared with those of a contour integral method and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed eigensolver.},

The proposed method can simultaneously optimize overall structural topology, partitioning to multiple components and functionally graded lattices within each component. The functionally graded lattice infill with guaranteed connectivity is realized by applying the Helmholtz PDE filter with a variable radius on the density field in the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method. The partitioning of an overall structure into multiple components is realized by applying the discrete material optimization (DMO) method, in which each material is interpreted as each component, and the size limit for each component imposed by a chosen additive manufacturing machine. A gradient-free coating filter realizes bulk solid boundaries for each component, which provide continuous mating surfaces between adjacent components to enable the subsequent joining. The structural interfaces between the bulk solid boundaries are extracted and assigned a distinct material property, which model the joints between the adjacent components.

  abstract     = {A high-performance shape-free arbitrary polygonal hybrid stress/displacement-function flat shell finite element method is proposed for linear and geometrically nonlinear analyses of shells. First, an arbitrary polygonal Mindlin‚ÄìReissner plate element and an arbitrary polygonal membrane element with drilling degrees of freedom are constructed based on hybrid displacement-function and hybrid stress-function methods, respectively. Both elements have only two corner nodes along each edge. Second, by assembling the plate and the membrane elements, an arbitrary polygonal flat shell element is constructed. Third, based on the corotational method, a proper best-fit corotated frame for geometrically nonlinear polygonal elements is designed. By updating the analytical trial functions of shell element in each increment step, the original linear flat shell element is generalized to a geometrically nonlinear model. Numerical examples show that the new element possesses excellent performance for both linear and geometrically nonlinear analyses, and possesses outstanding flexibility in dealing with complex loading distributions and mesh shapes.},

  abstract     = {To identify the superconvergent areas of gradient solutions is a worthwhile part of gradient recovery in finite element method. Compared with triangular and quadrilateral elements, the position determination for the superconvergent gradient of polygonal element is much more difficult because of the non-polynomial form of interpolation functions. In this article, the gradient superconvergence points in C 0 polygonal element is discovered, and its existence is proved theoretically. By dividing the canonical polygonal element into sub-triangles, a set of provisional triangular elements is generated to replace the existing polygon element. The superconvergent results of gradient solutions are obtained at the centroids of sub-triangles. Based on that, the gradient recovery method using superconvergent patch recovery (SPR) is developed for general polygonal mesh. Numerical examples for the Poisson equation are solved and the simulated results compare with polynomial preserving recovery (PPR) to demonstrate the accuracy and convergence properties of the proposed method. The extend application of the superconvergence recovery method for adaptive analysis is also presented at the end.},

Due to the high anisotropy and nonlinear couplings in the system, how to develop an accurate and efficient, especially a fully decoupled scheme, has always been a challenging problem. To solve the challenge, in this article, we construct a novel fully decoupled numerical scheme which is also linear, energy stable, and second-order time accurate. The key idea to realize the full decoupling structure is to introduce an ordinary differential equation to deal with the nonlinear coupling terms satisfying the so-called ‚Äúzero-energy-contribution‚Äù property. This scheme is very effective and easy to implement since only a few fully decoupled elliptic equations with constant coefficients need to be solved at each time step. We rigorously prove the solvability of each step and the unconditional energy stability, and perform a large number of numerical simulations in 2D and 3D to demonstrate its stability and accuracy numerically.},

We propose a novel phase-field approach to study such problems. The method uses two phase-fields to describe the three domains (solid, liquid, ambient fluid) by the ternary Navier‚ÄìStokes Cahn‚ÄìHilliard equations. We use a recent phase-field approach for fluid-structure interaction to equip one phase with elastic properties. The resulting method is significantly simpler than all previous approaches for soft wetting, since no grids are used to represent the geometries. Accordingly, the method avoids grid-based computation of interface curvature, mappings between different grids, complicated mesh generation, and retriangulation, while the elastic object can move freely through the computational domain. As a special feature, the elastic structure is for the first time represented as a neo-Hookean Kelvin‚ÄìVoigt‚ÄìMaxwell material which makes it very versatile. The accuracy of the method is shown in a benchmark simulation of a droplet on an elastic substrate. The geometrical flexibility is illustrated by simulating a rotating solid object within a fluidic interface. Finally, we provide the first 3D simulations of soft wetting including solid surface tensions.},

We ground our algorithm on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), an efficient and robust optimization method that draws on few computational primitives. In order to improve computational performance, we reformulated the original ADMM scheme in order to exploit the sparsity of constraint jacobians and we added optimizations such as warm starting and adaptive step scaling. The proposed method can be used in scenarios that pose major difficulties to other methods available in literature for complementarity in contact dynamics, namely when using very stiff finite elements and when simulating articulated mechanisms with odd mass ratios. The method can have applications in the fields of robotics, vehicle dynamics, virtual reality, and multiphysics simulation in general.},

This is a follow-up of the previous study on the original FPM based on a symmetric Galerkin weak-form. The trial function is piecewise-continuous, written as local Taylor expansions at the fragile points. A modified radial basis function-based differential quadrature (RBF-DQ) method is employed for establishing the local approximation. The Dirac delta function, Heaviside step function, and the local fundamental solution of the governing equation are alternatively used as test functions. Vanishing or pure contour integral formulation in subdomains or on local boundaries can be obtained. Extensive numerical examples in 2D and 3D are provided as validations. The collocation method (PG-FPM-1) is superior in transient analysis with arbitrary point distribution and domain partition. The finite volume method (PG-FPM-2) shows the best efficiency, saving 25% to 50% computational time comparing with the Galerkin FPM. The singular solution method (PG-FPM-3) is highly efficient in steady-state analysis. The anisotropy and nonhomogeneity give rise to no difficulties in all the methods. The proposed PG-FPM approaches represent an improvement to the original Galerkin FPM, as well as to other meshless methods in earlier literature.},

This coupling scheme takes the mutual advantages of peridynamics and the FEM to solve fracture problems without the imposition of additional criteria, yielding enhanced computational efficiency. In addition, the coupling model brings the reduction of the boundary effect using the boundary imposition method. To combine the peridynamics and FEM, the model is partitioned into the peridynamic subregion and finite element subregion. Subsequently, the two subregions are bridged by interface elements, where peridynamic nodes are embedded. Two types of coupling schemes are developed and the boundary effect of the peridynamic subregion is analyzed in each coupling approach. Moreover, stabilization of the coupling method is implemented to control the zero-energy mode inherent in NOSB-PD to simulate fracture problems. The proposed methodology is verified by solving several quasi-static problems in the one- and two-dimensional domains, and fracture problems are solved. The crack paths predicted by the proposed coupling method are in good agreement with the results of the exact solution and the experiments.},

Latent variable (LV) GP models, which have been recently developed to map each qualitative variable to some underlying numerical LVs, have strong physics-based justification and have achieved promising performance. Two versions use LVs in Cartesian (LV-Car) space and hyperspherical (LV-sph) space, respectively. Despite their success, the effects of these different LV structures are still poorly understood. This article illuminates this issue with two contributions. First, we develop a theorem on the effect of the ranks of the qualitative factor correlation matrices of mixed-variable GP models, from which we conclude that the LV-sph model restricts the interactions between the input variables and thus restricts the types of response surface data with which the model can be consistent. Second, following a rank-based perspective like in the theorem, we propose a new alternative model named LV-mix that combines the LV-based correlation structures from both LV-Car and LV-sph models to achieve better model flexibility than them. Through extensive case studies, we show that LV-mix achieves higher average accuracy compared with the existing two.},

The elastic‚Äìplastic states are classified as the initial-elastic, plastic-deforming, and residual-elastic states. The finite element model of a civil structure is automatically partitioned into linear and nonlinear substructures according to the time-varying spatial distribution of the plastic deformation zone, and the Craig‚ÄìBampton method was employed to construct the reduced governing equations in each elastic‚Äìplastic state. An elastic‚Äìplastic-triggered reanalysis method was proposed to conduct a seamless transformation of the reduced governing equations between different elastic‚Äìplastic states. In the back-off step, the reduced response vectors are projected back to the physical coordinate space. In the reanalysis step, the response vectors are initialized, partitioned, and transformed onto the hybrid coordinate space spanned by reduced-order bases. Compared with a conventional time step integration method, the AMOR method yields comparative results with a higher computational efficiency.},

To achieve this, there is considerable potential to use the fields applied and measured by a metal detector to discriminate between different shapes and different metals since, hidden within the field perturbation, is object characterisation information. The magnetic polarizability tensor (MPT) offers an economical characterisation of metallic objects that can be computed for different threat and non-threat objects and has an established theoretical background, which shows that the induced voltage is a function of the hidden object&#39;s MPT coefficients. In this article, we describe the additional characterisation information that measurements of the induced voltage over a range of frequencies offer compared with measurements at a single frequency. We call such object characterisations its MPT spectral signature. Then, we present a series of alternative rotational invariants for the purpose of classifying hidden objects using MPT spectral signatures. Finally, we include examples of computed MPT spectral signature characterisations of realistic threat and non-threat objects that can be used to train machine learning algorithms for classification purposes.},

This technique allows computing the post-peak response of solids loaded by external forces and snap-backs in the softening stage. By controlling the dissipated energy during loading, the solid is prevented from unloading elastically, and an equilibrium branch with a continuous increase of dissipated energy is followed. Because solids can dissipate in both tension and compression, a discontinuous equilibrium path can be obtained. To avoid this occurrence, two novel techniques are presented, which ensure a continuous equilibrium path for which the solid is either in tension or compression. In addition, the thermodynamic constraints present in the phase-field model are rigorously solved using an interior-point method. In order to allow for simultaneous dissipation due to both plastic and damage mechanisms, the governing equations are solved monolithically. The presented method is tested on four benchmark problems, and it is observed that by tracing snap-backs, time-discontinuous evolutions are avoided, which restores energy balance and enhances the convergence of the monolithic scheme.},

Such heterogeneous structure is extremely expensive to simulate using classical finite element methods, as the level of discretization required to capture the microstructural effects, is too fine. Based on the asymptotic homogenization theory, the multiscale technique explores the micro‚Äìmacro behavior for thermoelasticity. Considering each integration point of the macrostructure consists of an underlying locally periodic microstructure, the overall problem is basically separated into a homogeneous problem defined over the macrostructure and a heterogeneous problem defined over each microstructure. Even though the usage of multiscale strategy helps in the reduction of numerical expense, it still deals with a full-order finite element solution for the macroproblem and each microproblem. Using a twofold reduced-order modeling further accentuates the cost reduction and provides a robust solution in a reduced space: (i) as an offline precomputation stage for the microstructural problem, and (ii) as an online process that can embed adaptivity for the macroscopic problem.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method is a relative newcomer to the world of solid mechanics modelling. Its key advantage is the ability to model problems having large deformations while being relatively close to standard finite element methods, however its use for realistic engineering applications will happen only if the material point can be shown to be both efficient and accurate (compared to standard finite element methods), when modelling complex geometries with a range of material models. In this paper we present developments of the standard material point method aimed at realizing these goals. The key contribution provided here is the development of a material point method that avoids volumetric locking (arising from elastic or elasto-plastic material behavior) while using low-order tetrahedral finite elements for the background computational mesh, hence allowing unstructured background grids to be used for complex geometries. We also show that these developments can be effectively parallelized to improve computational efficiency.},

Optimal integration weights are constructed to increase the accuracy of Gaussian quadrature. We preserve the variational structure of the formulation through a new five-field functional with additional, independent fields for the Jacobian and the pressure. This approach not only obviates volumetric locking but also yields symmetry. A deleterious soft mode, common to both the quadratic and composite tetrahedral element with constant pressure formulations is effectively stabilized through a novel convex energy penalty function. Numerous numerical examples spanning a patch test to the impact of a Taylor bar demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and convergence of the extended composite tetrahedral element for application to structural metals.},

  abstract     = {Immersed interface methods are becoming increasingly necessary to solve problems of practical importance. To be considered as replacement for conventional, interface-fitted, finite element method (FEM), an immersed-interface finite element method (IIFEM) has to exhibit equivalent accuracy and robustness. The paper develops such an IIFEM based on nonconformal Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin (ncPG) formulation for two-dimensional linear elasticity. First, a bimaterial patch test (BPT) is developed which, when satisfied, guarantees consistency of an FEM formulation for problems with two materials in a single element. Then, nodal trial functions that satisfy the BPT are derived for triangular elements with immersed interface. These trial functions satisfy the Hadamard interface conditions for elements with immersed interface but are nonconformal on element edges with an immersed interface. Conventional conformal test functions are used in the Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin formulation. The proposed ncPG-IIFEM is applied to a benchmark multimaterial problem. The solution using ncPG-IIFEM converges optimally and the error in displacement as well as stress are similar to interface-fitted FEM. The ncPG-IIFEM also leads to a well-conditioned linear system with the condition number of the global stiffness matrix similar to interface-fitted FEM. Overall, the proposed ncPG-IIFEM is shown to be straightforward in application, optimal in convergence, and robust.},

However, the method was validated only on single point contact cases. The present study proposes a generalization of the wear submodeling procedure that can be used to speed up FE wear simulations with multipoint contacts. The modified global‚Äìlocal procedure is applied and evaluated on a double contact pin on plate wear test using three-dimensional models developed in Ansys¬Æ mechanical APDL. Three different model geometries with different curvature radii at the contact regions were considered in order to replicate possible critical scenarios. Results suggest that an additional wear simulation step where the global model is used to simulate the first wear cycles is needed to correctly transfer the boundary conditions to the local models. The new proposed strategy demonstrates the possibility to extend the method to more general FE wear simulations by significantly reducing their computational cost.},

While the idea of extending multigrid methods to saddle point systems can already be found, for example, in the context of Stokes and Oseen equations in literature, the main contributions of this work are (i) the development and open-source implementation of an interface aggregation strategy specifically suited for generating Lagrange multiplier aggregates that are required for coupling structural equilibrium equations with contact constraints and (ii) a review of saddle point smoothers in the context of constrained interface problems. The new interface aggregation strategy perfectly fits into an aggregation-based multigrid framework and can easily be combined with segregated transfer operators, which allow to preserve the saddle point structure on the coarse levels. Further analysis provides insight into saddle point smoothers applied to contact problems, while numerical experiments illustrate the robustness of the new method. We have implemented the proposed algorithm within the MueLu package of the open-source Trilinos project. Numerical examples demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in complex dynamic contact problems as well as its scalability up to 23.9 million unknowns on 480 MPI ranks.},

These reduced-order modeling techniques are aimed at exploiting pointwise (vector) measurements to obtain the unknown field reconstruction and they are preferred to other, more efficient, techniques as the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) because of their intrinsic capability to identify measurement positions and to perform field reconstruction. The ‚ÄúEIM-roto‚Äù method implements rotation matrix coefficients and should be intended as a composition of rotations and dilatations of the vector basis functions. The ‚ÄúEIM-orto‚Äù implements diagonal matrices coefficients and can be intended as the interpolation, component by component, of the unknown vector field, projected on a fixed reference system. The two techniques are tested over the lid-driven cavity benchmark, in laminar conditions. The results obtained on this study case highlight how the ‚ÄúEIM-orto‚Äù interpolation does not allow a reliable reconstructions, while the ‚ÄúEIM-roto‚Äù interpolation allows reconstruction performances close to the POD ones (here used as reference method). In particular, the worst reconstruction error, that is, the maximum L 2 ‚àí norm of the residuals, decreases exponentially, reaching 5% with 25 basis functions. This result can be consider satisfactory, considering the nature of the problem.},

The development of schemes in automatic defeaturing, gaps repairing, and intersection removal usually requires a discrete representation of the geometry. However, existing surface meshing methods could not effectively handle sliver surfaces and assemblies with complex contact conditions, including multiple misaligned curves/surfaces and degenerated or free-form-shaped interface of contact. A surface meshing method based on a meshing-and-synchronizing strategy is proposed, which tackles the mesh generation of sliver surfaces and the cleanup of misaligned assemblies by means of mesh alignment. The mesh generation is performed in a hierarchical manner with curves and surfaces being meshed in sequence. By incorporating the synchronization strategy into the curve/surface meshing process, curve/surface mesh alignment is achieved automatically without compromising the mesh quality. Thanks to the alignment, the curve mesh generated by aligned curve meshing (ACM) is free of intersections, which enhances the meshing of sliver surfaces. By enforcing mesh alignment, aligned surface meshing (ASM) can handle misaligned assemblies with complex contact conditions. ASM is parallelized by using OpenMP. Various assemblies characterized with difficult misaligned features and touches are well processed by parallel ASM.},

In the studied setting, light interacts with a penetrable scatterer with dimension comparable to the wavelength of an incoming planar wave. The design objective is to maximize the scattering efficiency inside a target angle window. For this, a Helmholtz problem with a piecewise constant refractive index medium models the wave propagation, and an accurate Dirichlet-to-Neumann map models an exterior domain. The strategy consists of using a high-order finite element (FE) discretization combined with gradient-based numerical optimization. The latter consists of a quasi-Newton (BFGS) with backtracking line search. A discrete adjoint method is used to compute the sensitivities with respect to the design variables. Particularly, for the FE representation of the curved shape, we use a bilinear transfinite interpolation formula, which admits explicit differentiation with respect to the design variables. We exploit this fact and show in detail how sensitivities are obtained in the discrete setting. We test our strategy for a variety of target angles, different wave frequencies, and refractive indexes. In all cases, we efficiently reach designs featuring high scattering efficiencies that satisfy the required criteria.},

In order to alleviate the difficulty caused by melting nodes to some extent, the force density method is applied to an auxiliary truss model for geometry optimization of the frame, and the closely spaced nodes are merged. A method is presented for generating correlated imperfections for the nodal locations along each member, and a penalization approach is proposed for geometrical stiffness matrix to exclude superficial local buckling.

Initial efforts on coupling of edge element BEM with edge element FEM have lost momentum and somehow disappeared from recent literature, possibly because of mathematical and other issues. This article, however, presents correct coupling of edge element BEM with edge element FEM. Such coupling is convenient because edge basis functions are used for modeling both the surface and the interior of the problem. We show that singularity extraction is simpler when compared with singularity extraction in MoM/FEM. Because BEM part of edge element BEM/FEM formulation uses simpler Green&#39;s function, the method is easier to implement than MoM/FEM which uses Dyadic Green&#39;s functions. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparison with Mie series and with MoM/FEM and MoM/VSIE methods. Convergence of the method with respect to number of surface and interior edges was investigated by comparing 20 computational models with Mie series. Computational results suggest that edge-element BEM/FEM performs well for scattering problems involving objects with sharp corners. Finally, the ability of the method to cope with relatively large number of elements was demonstrated on the example of human head illuminated by 3.5¬†GHz EM plane wave.},

To obtain the same high-order accuracy in space and time, we propose using high-order temporal schemes that allow using large time steps. Therefore, we require unconditionally stable temporal schemes for any combination of element size, polynomial degree, and time step. Specifically, we use the Radau IIA and Gauss-Legendre schemes, which are unconditionally stable, achieve high-order accuracy with few stages, and do not suffer order reduction in this problem. To reduce the memory footprint of coupling these spatial and temporal high-order schemes, we rewrite the nonlinear system. In this way, we achieve a better sparsity pattern of the Jacobian matrix and less coupling between stages. Furthermore, we propose a fix-point iterative method to further reduce the memory consumption. The saturation solution may present sharp fronts. Thus, the high-order approximation may contain spurious oscillations. To reduce them, we introduce artificial viscosity. We detect the elements with high-oscillations using a computationally efficient shock sensor obtained from the saturation solution and the post-processed saturation of HDG. Finally, we present several examples to assess the capabilities of our formulation.},

  abstract     = {The general formulation of the dynamics of an elastic body undergoing arbitrary motion is revisited with emphasis on the orthogonality between rigid body motion and elastic deformation on the one hand, and on the appropriate definition of the relative velocities induced by elastic deformation on the other hand. A mixed displacement‚Äìvelocity approach is adopted, thus allowing a local frame definition of velocities which results in simplification of the discretization and solution steps. The proposed formulation is applied to model reduction starting from a set of free-free elastic modes and attachment modes. The Herting‚ÄìMartinez component mode synthesis method is used to replace the modal intensities by a body-frame nodal set of elastic degrees of freedom. A body-to-global frame transformation is then applied to the system equations in incremental form to avoid the use of Lagrange multipliers for expressing node-to-node connections. Examples are presented to assess the methodology proposed and its numerical implementation.},

  abstract     = {We propose a Lagrangian solid mechanics framework for the simulation of salt tectonics and other large-deformation geomechanics problems at the basin scale. Our approach relies on general elastic-viscoplastic constitutive models to characterize the deformation of geologic strata, in contrast with the majority of published works on the subject, which utilize nonlinear Stokes flow models. By means of multiscale asymptotics, we also show that the inertia term in the momentum balance equation can be safely neglected, if the goal is to track the Earth&#39;s crust deformation over long periods of time. Our time integration strategy is a blended transient/quasistatic approach, in that it consists of a constitutive stress update, subject to the constraint that the stresses must satisfy static equilibrium. In addition, we use stabilized finite element methods specifically built for triangular and tetrahedral grids, which can also perform well under incompressibility constraints. Our approach offers computational geologists the following advantages: (1) improved flexibility in the choice of subsurface constitutive models with respect to the nonlinear Stokes flow; (2) improved efficiency over transient dynamics algorithms used in this context in the past, which are forced to resolve seismic events over geologic time scales; and (3) improved robustness in large strain computations over quadrilateral/hexahedral finite elements. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach with simulations of passive diapirism.},

  abstract     = {Large-strain thermo-viscoelasticity is described in the framework of GENERIC. To this end, a new material representation of the inelastic part of the dissipative bracket is proposed. The bracket form of GENERIC generates the governing equations for large-strain thermo-viscoelasticity including the nonlinear evolution law for the internal variables associated with inelastic deformations. The GENERIC formalism facilitates the free choice of the thermodynamic variable. In particular, one may choose (i) the internal energy density, (ii) the entropy density, or (iii) the absolute temperature as the thermodynamic variable. A mixed finite element method is proposed for the discretization in space which preserves the GENERIC form of the resulting semi-discrete evolution equations. The GENERIC-consistent space discretization makes possible the design of structure-preserving time-stepping schemes. The mid-point type discretization in time yields three alternative schemes. Depending on the specific choice of the thermodynamic variable, these schemes are shown to be partially structure-preserving. In addition to that, it is shown that a slight modification of the mid-point type schemes yields fully structure-preserving schemes. In particular, three alternative energy-momentum-entropy consistent schemes are devised associated with the specific choice of the thermodynamic variable. Numerical investigations are presented which confirm the theoretical findings and shed light on the numerical stability of the newly developed schemes.},

  abstract     = {The development of advanced numerical techniques such as eXtended/Generalized Finite Elements Methods (XFEM/GFEM) has provided means for accurate prediction of material failure. However, the present theories mostly rely on a global formulation, where the system of equations is subject to progressive dimension increase with crack evolution. In this regard, an independent multilayered enrichment is proposed for the XFEM/GFEM family of methods where a few elements in close proximity are assigned to an enrichment layer independent of the remaining ones. The enhanced degrees of freedom can be condensed out at the layer level, which leads to system dimensions, sparsity, and bandness identical to those of the underlying finite elements. Nodal and elemental enrichment methods are shown to be particular limit cases of present approach. The robustness of the proposed approach is first demonstrated in element-level examples. The use of only few adjacent elements in a group enrichment is shown to suffice for acceptable results while the order of the condition number of the final stiffness matrix resembles the underlying uncracked finite element counterpart. Finally, using several structural examples, the accuracy and robustness of the method is shown in terms of force‚Äìdisplacement response, stress fields, and traction continuity in nonlinear problems.},

The quadrature points act as MPM particles embedded in a lower-resolution grid and enable a subcell multidensity resolution of intricate structures with a reduced computational cost. A quadrature-level connectivity graph-based method is adopted to avoid the artificial checkerboard issues commonly existing in multiresolution topology optimization methods.

  abstract     = {Model-reduction techniques aim to reduce the computational complexity of simulating dynamical systems by applying a (Petrov‚Äì)Galerkin projection process that enforces the dynamics to evolve in a low-dimensional subspace of the original state space. Frequently, the resulting reduced-order model (ROM) violates intrinsic physical properties of the original full-order model (e.g., global conservation, Lagrangian structure, state-variable bounds) because the projection process does not generally ensure preservation of these properties. However, in many applications, ensuring the ROM preserves such intrinsic properties can enable the ROM to retain physical meaning and lead to improved accuracy and stability properties. In this work, we present a general constrained-optimization formulation for projection-based model reduction that can be used as a template to enforce the ROM to satisfy specific properties on the kinematics and dynamics. We introduce constrained-optimization formulations at both the time-continuous (i.e., ODE) level, which leads to a constrained Galerkin projection, and at the time-discrete level, which leads to a least-squares Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin projection, in the context of linear multistep schemes. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed formulations to equip ROMs with desired properties such as global energy conservation and bounds on the total variation.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a 3D extension of the deformable discrete element method (DDEM) developed previously for 2D problems. The 3D formulation employs spherical particles. The particle deformation is made up of a global and local deformation mode. The global mode is assumed to be produced by uniform stress due to the contact forces. Particle deformability yields a nonlocal contact model, in which one contact between particles is influenced by contacts with other particles. It also leads to the formation of new contacts in the particle assembly. The DDEM affects the behavior of the granular material at the macroscopic level and gives new possibilities in material modeling by the discrete element method (DEM). The new algorithm is verified on a unconfined uniaxial compression test of a cuboid specimen discretized with equal-size bonded particles aligned in a simple cubic pattern using an analytical solution. Enhanced modeling capabilities are presented by simulating cylindrical specimens discretized with a nonuniform size of bonded particles. The micro‚Äìmacro relationships for elastic parameters are obtained. It is shown that the DDEM extends the range of the Poisson&#39;s ratio achievable with the DEM. Additional simulations are performed to determine the stability limits of the DDEM.},

An improved SMD method with two kinds of high-order shape functions is proposed. A parameter indicating the smoothing degree in SMD method is also presented to assess the mapping process. The efficiency and the accuracy of the improved method are discussed in detail, and the proposed method is validated with several examples. The results demonstrate obvious improvement in accuracy, and more high-frequency atomic motions can be captured.

The approximation of integral expressions is conducted by an appropriate quadrature, and by introducing Lagrange multipliers, the Lagrangian of the minimization program is formed and solutions are sought based on the satisfaction of necessary optimality conditions. In addition to displacement degrees of freedom at the two element edge nodes, strain measures of the centroid act as unknown variables at the quadrature points, while only the curvature field is interpolated, to enforce compatibility throughout the element. Inelastic calculations are carried out by numerical integration of the material stress-strain law at the cross-section level. The locking-free behavior of the element is presented and discussed, and its overall performance is demonstrated on a set of well-known numerical examples. Results are compared with analytical solutions, where available, and outcomes based on flexibility-based beam elements and quadrilateral elements, verifying the efficiency of the formulation.},

Using a multigrid-preconditioned Krylov solver for the state and adjoint problems, the number of Krylov iterations is reduced significantly by enforcing early termination of the iterative solves. The criterion for early termination is based on the convergence of the design sensitivities with respect to Krylov iterations. Consequently, the progress of optimization is not affected by the inexact resolution of the state and adjoint problems. The proposed approach is demonstrated on several design problems that possess different characteristics of the maximum stress. Optimization results obtained with early termination show very good agreement with those obtained with an accurate direct solver‚Äîin terms of objective value, constrained maximum stress and overall number of design cycles. Savings of 80% in the number of Krylov iterations are achieved, compared to the number of iterations required to satisfy the force residual convergence criterion to a common tolerance. The approach is directly applicable to high-resolution problems that are solved on parallel computational environments.

The integration makes use of a backward-Euler method for the flow law complemented by the solution of a yield constraint.

  abstract     = {A polynomial-based model in conjunction with dimensional reduction method are presented to perform cross-sectional analysis and to determine strain distribution in composite tubes under bending loading. For beam structures with tubular cross-section, the Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) has been employed to decompose a three-dimensional (3D) elasticity problem into a two-dimensional cross-sectional analysis and a one-dimensional analysis along the length. This greatly reduces computational time as compared to 3D Finite Element Method (FEM). There also exists publically available Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS), a FEM cross-sectional analysis tool based on VAM. For VABS, FEM mesh for the beam section needs to be generated. For the case of composite tubes with many layers, the mesh generation consumes efforts and is unnecessary. We introduce a new meshless dimensional reduction method for the analysis of composite tubes. This method utilizes Pascal polynomials in polar coordinates to model the warping functions. Using this, one can obtain stiffness constants and 3D strains of the composite tube. This method is straightforward, meshless, with similar computation time as VABS, and is much more efficient than conventional 3D FEM. The accuracy of the proposed method is examined by comparing the obtained results with 3D FE (ANSYS), VABS, literature, and experiment.},

The present IF-CMS method does not increase the number of substructural modes during the hierarchical iteration process. In particular, to alleviate ill-conditioning during the iteration steps, the proposed IF-CMS method adopts the so-called ( q d , u b )-formulation by condensing Lagrange multipliers from the original F-CMS method.

We overcome this issue by introducing Lagrange multiplier fields defined at the interfaces in order to treat the discontinuities in the gradients of the pressure field. The method does not depend on any kind of adjustable parameter. We show by a numerical study of the applicable inf-sup conditions that the resulting mixed formulation leads to well-posed problems.

  abstract     = {Differing from the finite element method, most of mesh-free methods are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) problems owing to the difficulty in constructing three-dimensional (3D) grids. But, for 3D elastic structures, this limitation could be effectively overcome when hierarchical models are employed. In the hierarchical models of elastic structures, only the in-plane displacement field is needed to be approximated because the thickness-wise displacement field is assumed by polynomials. In this context, this paper is concerned with the reliable numerical implementation of hierarchical models for plate-like structures using 2D natural element method (NEM). However, one critical problem in implementing the hierarchical model is to secure the continuity in strain and stress fields. To resolve this problem, this paper presents a level-wise strain recovery method. In addition, a recovery-based error estimation is introduced to predict the modeling error and the numerical approximation error. The proposed methods are illustrated and validated through the numerical experiments. It is confirmed that the level-wise strain recovery successfully and CPU-time effectively provides the continuous stress resultants and the proposed error estimator accurately predicts the modeling and approximation errors.},

However, the continuous and discontinuous deformation simulation of rock masses directly based on digital images is still challenging. Based on the Numerical Manifold Method (NMM), a simple and efficient image-based simulation method is developed for rock masses containing complex fracture networks. A new crack model, named as ‚Äúvoxel crack model,‚Äù is generated based on pixel values of the digital image and a user-defined resolution. With the voxel crack model, physical cover and manifold elements in NMM are then efficiently generated for complex fracture networks. After this, the continuous and discontinuous displacement fields of rock masses are simulated straightforwardly. In the present work, conventionally burdensome tasks, like boundary detections to transform digital images into computer aided design (CAD) models, generating conforming meshes, and explicitly tracking of fracture surfaces, are avoided. Several benchmarks validate the developed method. The calculated continuous and discontinuous deformation field of the San Leo rock slope containing a complex fracture network demonstrates the capability of the proposed method for practical engineering application.},

The NMMD, where the meso-scale damage is determined according to the deformation of material bond and then the macroscopic topologic damage is endowed with the weighted averaging over the meso-scale damage in the influence domain of the material point, is then elaborated and incorporated into the framework. Specifically, the criterion of meso-scale damage is renormalized. The numerical algorithms including the spatial discretization by the finite element methods and the time integration methods by an explicit scheme are outlined. Several examples are studied in detail, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, due to the nonlocal property, there is no spatial mesh size sensitivity. Owing to the scale renormalization of the meso-scale damage, the results are insensitive to the influence radius in some examples. The dynamic cracking, including the crack propagation velocity, the damage dissipation rate, and the connection to the dynamic crack branching, is discussed in detail based on the computed results.},

In this paper, The eXtended Material Point Method (XMPM) is proposed to simulate the three-dimensional (3D) crack propagation. The XMPM modifies the particle displacement approximation by introducing the local enrichment functions based on the partition of unity into the MPM framework. To accurately trace the evolution of the crack surface, the XMPM employs both the level set method and an extra set of crack surface mesh, which is independent of the background grid. Only locally enriching the nodes near the crack makes the XMPM efficient and able to multiple cracks without extra tricks. Besides, a series of adaptive crack front processing methods, including crack front splitting, merging and locking with its meeting the material boundary, are developed in the XMPM framework to ensure the continuity and smoothness of the crack surface. Numerical examples demonstrate the capability of XMPM to simulate the discontinuity, calculate the fracture parameters and handle the evolution of the crack surface growth in 3D dynamic crack propagation.},

One of the critical challenges in this field is finding optimal material microstructure for a desired macroscopic response. This work presents a computational method for the mesoscale-level design of particulate composites for an optimal macroscale-level response. The method relies on a custom shape optimization scheme to find the extrema of a nonlinear cost function subject to a set of constraints. Three key ‚Äúmodules‚Äù constitute the method: multiscale modeling, sensitivity analysis, and optimization. Multiscale modeling relies on a classical homogenization method and a nonlinear NURBS-based generalized finite element scheme to efficiently and accurately compute the structural response of particulate composites using a nonconformal discretization. A three-parameter isotropic damage law is used to model microstructure-level failure. An analytical sensitivity method is developed to compute the derivatives of the cost/constraint functions with respect to the design variables that control the microstructure&#39;s geometry. The derivation uncovers subtle but essential new terms contributing to the sensitivity of finite element shape functions and their spatial derivatives. Several structural problems are solved to demonstrate the applicability, performance, and accuracy of the method for the design of particulate composites with a desired macroscopic nonlinear stress-strain response.},

  abstract     = {We present a 2D high-order and easily accessible immersed-boundary adaptive harmonic polynomial cell (IB-AHPC) method to solve fully nonlinear wave-structure interaction problems in marine hydrodynamics using potential-flow theory. To reduce the total number of cells without losing accuracy, adaptive quad-tree cell refinements are employed close to the free-surface and structure boundaries. The present method is simpler to implement than the existing IB-HPC alternatives, in that it uses standard square cells both in the fluid domain and at the boundaries, thus without having to use the more complex and expensive overlapping grids or irregular cells. The spurious force oscillations on moving structures, which is a known issue for immersed boundary methods (IBMs), are eliminated in this study by solving a separate boundary value problem (BVP) for a Lagrangian acceleration potential. We also demonstrate that solving a similar BVP for the corresponding Eulerian acceleration potential is far less satisfactory due to the involved second derivatives of the velocity potential in the body-boundary condition, which are very difficult to calculate accurately in an IBM-based approach. In addition, we present, perhaps for the first time since the HPC method was developed, a linear matrix-based stability analysis for the time-domain IB-AHPC method. The stability analysis is also used in this study as a general guide to design robust and stable numerical algorithms, in particular related to the treatment of boundary conditions close to the intersection between a Dirichlet and a Neumann boundary, which is essential in time-domain wave-structure interaction analyses using IBMs. We confirm theoretically through the stability analysis that square cells have the best stability properties. The present method has been verified and validated satisfactorily by various cases in marine hydrodynamics, including a moving structure in an infinite fluid, fully nonlinear wave generation and propagation, and fully nonlinear diffraction and radiation of a ship cross section.},

The adjoint method is applied to achieve the sensitivity of multiphysics field and the density function is updated utilizing the method of moving asymptotes (MMA). Representative examples are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of the proposed method.

The numerical examples show that the optimal tuning parameter indeed can change during the simulation, which highlights the importance of the dynamic search provided by the optimization algorithm.

The topology optimization design of compliant mechanisms, which can solve output coupling and input coupling problems, hinge and gray region problems, and the multiple-objective optimal problem, is an important topic of researches for achieving fully decoupled motion. It is also a challenge area of research due to serious conflicts of between the four of output and input uncoupling constraints, volume constraint, the hinge-free requirement, and the good black/white solution requirement. In order to comprehensively solve these problems, a simple optimization model overcoming these serious conflicts is posed, which includes small change rate constraints of structural compliances corresponding to the driving input loads and output point virtual loads. Then, the multiple output displacement functions of the model are equivalently converted into non-negative functions. The multiple-objective model is converted into a single-objective optimization model by using a bound variable. The method of moving asymptotes (MMA) algorithm is adopted to solve it. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A topology optimization schema employing a condensation method for nonlinear frame structures with supplemental mass subjected to time-varying excitation is presented. In the context of the design of structural frames, in certain applications, the supplemental mass can be order(s) of magnitude larger than the mass of the system itself. Thus, condensing the system of governing equations to only those associated with the supplemental mass, reduces the complexity and computational cost of the dynamic analysis and thus the optimization process. In addition to considering material nonlinearity, distributed plasticity, and multiaxial interactions, the hysteretic beam finite element (FE) model employed in this study has constant elastic stiffness and hysteretic matrices facilitating a Guyan-type condensation of the nonlinear dynamic equations. Furthermore, the nonlinear dynamic equations and element evolution equations of hysteretic FE modeling are concisely presented as a system of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved using general ODE solvers. The schema is demonstrated on various design problems considering different arrangements of supplemental mass, where the objective is to minimize the volume of the structure subject to maximum displacement constraint using a single p-norm.},

  abstract     = {A hybrid level set method is proposed for devising structures with embedded components, where the supporting structure as well as the positions and orientations of the components are optimized simultaneously. Two different types of level sets, namely the explicit and implicit level set are introduced to respectively represent the components and supporting structure. In this fashion, smooth geometries and clear interfaces for both the components and their underpinning structure can be obtained, which can facilitate the following analysis or manufacture of the optimized design. The positions and orientation of the components are described by a set of explicit level sets. To facilitate the solution of these multiconstraint optimization problems, a parametric mechanism is formulated by approximating the implicit level sets with the Gaussian radial basis function. Distinguished from the existing approaches, we use two different sets of design variables in a uniform optimization loop, that is, the geometric parameters for the positions and orientations of the components, and the expansion coefficients of the level set interpolation for the supporting structure. In this way, the overall design variables for the optimization problem can be greatly reduced. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

In classical plasticity shakedown analysis is an essential and challenging problem. Most existing methods are based on the solution of super large-scale mathematical programming, basis reduction or mechanics insight method which have their own limitations in practical engineering problem. In the present study, the proposed method explores the Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker (KKT) conditions and the physical reinterpretation of its primal-dual variables of the Melan&#39;s lower bound theorem, and establishes the relation of the primal-dual variables in finite element formulation. Based on the primal-dual theory, the primal-dual eigenstress-driven method is proposed which is a two-level nested algorithm: the inner level is the eigenstress-driven incremental algorithm for constructing the beneficial residual stress field and calculating the safe multiplier and the outer level is the load multiplier descent algorithm for searching the shakedown multiplier. For the purpose of algorithm&#39;s universality, the proposed algorithm is fully integrated with the commercial finite element software ANSYS APDL without special optimization solvers, which is well suited for large-scale practical engineering structures. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Moreover, in practical buckling analysis of structures, bases for the nullspace of K and the common nullspace of K and K G are available. There are two open issues for developing an industrial strength shift-invert Lanczos method: (1) the shift-invert operator ( K ‚àí œÉ ‚Å¢ K G ) ‚àí 1 does not exist or is extremely ill-conditioned, and (2) the use of the semi-inner product induced by K drives the Lanczos vectors rapidly toward the nullspace of K , which leads to a rapid growth of the Lanczos vectors in norms and causes permanent loss of information and the failure of the method. In this paper, we address these two issues by proposing a generalized buckling spectral transformation of the singular pencil and a regularization of the inner product via a low-rank updating of the semi-positive definiteness of K .

Crucially, the method also incorporates a certain ‚Äúopen-arc elastic Calder√≥n relation‚Äù introduced in this article, whose validity is demonstrated on the basis of numerical experiments, but whose rigorous mathematical proof is left for future work. (In fact, the aforementioned open-arc elastic Calder√≥n relation generalizes a corresponding elastic Calder√≥n relation for closed surfaces, which is also introduced in this article, and for which a rigorous proof is included.) Using the open-surface Calder√≥n relation in conjunction with spectrally accurate quadrature rules and the Krylov-subspace linear algebra solver GMRES, the proposed overall open-arc elastic solver produces results of high accuracy in small number of iterations, for both low and high frequencies.

Adaptive structures are able to adapt to different loading and environmental conditions or to changing requirements by either small or large shape changes. In the latter case, also the mechanics and properties of the deformation process play a role for the structure&#39;s energy efficiency. The method of variational motion design, previously developed in the group of the authors, allows to identify deformation paths between two given geometrical configurations that are optimal with respect to a defined quality function. In a preliminary, academic setting this method assumes that every single degree of freedom is accessible to arbitrary external actuation forces that realize the optimized motion. These (nodal) forces can be recovered a posteriori. The present contribution deals with an extension of the method of motion design by the constraint that the motion is to be realized by a predefined set of actuation forces. These can be either external forces or prescribed length chances of discrete, internal actuator elements. As an additional constraint, static stability of each intermediate configuration during the motion is taken into account. It can be accomplished by enforcing a positive determinant of the stiffness matrix.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel robust topology optimization for designing acoustic devices that are effective for broadband sound waves. Here, we define the objective function as the weighted sum of the acoustic response to an incident wave consisting of a single frequency and its standard deviation (SD) against the frequency perturbation. By approximating the SD, under the assumption that the incident frequency follows the normal distribution, with the high-order Taylor expansion of the (conventional) objective function, we deal with significant frequency variations. To calculate such an approximation, we need to calculate the high-order frequency derivatives of the state variable. Here, we define them by integral representations, which enables us to characterize them even when the state variable is defined in an unbounded domain as is often the case with wave scattering problems. We further show that, based on this definition, the high-order derivatives can efficiently be computed by a combination of the boundary element method and automatic differentiation. We also present a derivation and calculation of the topological derivative for the newly defined objective function. We install all the proposed techniques into a topology optimization method based on the level-set method to design wideband acoustic devices. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed topology optimization are confirmed through several numerical examples.},

Optimal order a priori error estimates are established for the flux and the primal variables in suitable norms. The least-squares method offers an efficient a posteriori error estimator without extra effort. Moreover, the hanging nodes are naturally treated in the virtual element method, which provides the high flexibility in mesh refinement because the local mesh postprocessing is never required. Both attractive features motivate us to develop the a posteriori error estimate of the method. Numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the adaptive mesh refinement driven by the proposed estimator can efficiently capture the boundary and the interior layers.},

The numerical solution of displacement driven problems involving this model can be adapted to the context of membranes by a variant of the Klinkel‚ÄìGovindjee method 1 originally proposed for using finite strain, three-dimensional material models in beam and shell elements. This approach relies on numerical enforcement of the plane stress constraint and is enabled by the principle of frame invariance. Computational tractability is achieved by introducing a regression-based surrogate model informed by a physics-inspired training regimen in which FE 2 is utilized to simulate a variety of numerical experiments including uniaxial, biaxial and shear straining of a material coupon. Several alternative surrogate models are evaluated including an artificial neural network.

  abstract     = {In this article, we present the behavior of two-mode phase field crystal (2MPFC) method under a concentration dependent deformation. A mixed finite element formulation is proposed for the 2MPFC method that solves a 10th-order parabolic equation. Lithium concentration diffusion in the electrode particle is captured by the Cahn‚ÄìHilliard (CH) equation and the host electrode material, Li x Mn 2 O 4 (LMO), which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice structure, is modeled using 2MPFC. The coupling between 2MPFC and CH models brings about the concentration dependent deformation in the polycrystalline LMO electrode particle. The atomistic dynamics is assumed to operate on a faster time-scale compared to the diffusion of lithium, thereby both the 2MPFC and CH models evolve on two different time-scales. The coupled 2MPFC‚ÄìCH system models the diffusion induced grain boundary migration in LMO capturing the charging and discharging state of the battery.},

  abstract     = {We present an intuitive geometrical framework for non-intrusive model reduction. Based on simple low-dimensional geometry that is easy to visualize and interpret, the approach enables one to predict model features a priori and explain them a posteriori. Two simple a priori methods for analyzing the suitability of non-intrusive model reduction are consequently presented and discussed. As a natural consequence of the interpretation proposed a method extension is proposed, namely, higher-order temporal discretization. It is also demonstrated that some generic properties of the physical system modeled such as periodicity or convergence towards a steady state are easily represented in the framework proposed. The approaches are illustrated using a number of representative test problems including a three-dimensional case of the Saffman‚ÄìTaylor instability and an example exhibiting a propagating discontinuity. It is shown that this property makes the underlying non-intrusive reduced order modeling nonsmooth meaning it will provide a poor representation of the system dynamics.},

We explain how a prior probability distribution on the model parameters is transformed into a posterior probability distribution, by incorporating a physical model and real field noisy observations. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality. In order to reduce the dimension, Sobol&#39; indices approach for global sensitivity analysis, in the context of wind turbine modeling, is presented. A major issue arising for such inverse problems is identifiability, that is, whether the observations are sufficient to unambiguously determine the input parameters that generated the observations. Global sensitivity analysis is also used in the context of identifiability.},

Since the method was originally proposed to accelerate atomistic lattice simulations, its refinement criteria‚Äîthat drive refining coarse-grained regions and/or increasing fully-resolved regions‚Äîare generally associated with quantities relevant to the atomistic scale. In this contribution, a new refinement indicator is presented, based on the energies of dedicated cells at coarse-grained domain surfaces. This indicator is incorporated in an adaptive scheme of a generalization of the QC method able to consider periodic representative volume elements, like the ones employed in most computational homogenization approaches. However, this indicator can also be used for conventional QC frameworks. Illustrative numerical examples of elastic indentation and scratch of different lattices demonstrate the capabilities of the refinement indicator and its impact on adaptive QC simulations.},

The proposed TaySMO computes the updated position of the swarm using the local leader phase and the global leader phase.

The SaS formulation is based on the choice of an arbitrary number of SaS within layers parallel to the middle surface and located at Chebyshev polynomial nodes in order to introduce the temperatures, displacements and electric potentials of these surfaces as basic shell unknowns. Due to the variational formulation, the outer surfaces and interfaces are also included into a set of SaS. Such choice of unknowns with the use of Lagrange polynomials in the through-thickness approximations of temperatures, temperature gradient, displacements, strains, electric potential, and electric field leads to a very compact higher-order thermopiezoelectric shell formulation. To implement efficient analytical integration throughout the solid-shell element, the extended assumed natural strain method is employed for all components of the temperature gradient, strain tensor, and electric field vector. The developed hybrid-mixed four-node thermopiezoelectric solid-shell element is based on the Hu‚ÄìWashizu variational principle and shows a superior performance in the case of coarse meshes. It can be useful for the three-dimensional thermoelectroelastic analysis of thick and thin doubly curved laminated piezoelectric shells under thermal loading, since the SaS formulation allows one to obtain the numerical solutions with a prescribed accuracy, which asymptotically approach exact solutions of the theory of thermopiezoelectricity as a number of SaS tends to infinity.},

Thus, ROMs in a broad category of fluid dynamics applications require stabilization and closure methods to compensate for the key contributions missed through the model order reduction. A new stabilization method for nonlinear ROMs is proposed in this study that learns a linear control law to drive the nonlinear ROM toward maximum agreement with the full-order model, where a total power constraint guarantees the stability of the nonlinear ROM. This new method achieves both stability and accuracy for nonlinear proper orthogonal decomposition-Galerkin ROMs in two chosen applications with strong shock-wake interactions and unsteady oscillations, which trigger strong instabilities in the original ROMs before stabilization. A multistage layout is designed to further enhance the proposed stabilization method for more efficient and robust stabilization of nonlinear ROMs with a large number of unstable modes.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a free vibration analysis of laminated sandwich plates under various boundary conditions by using an efficient C 0 eight-node quadrilateral element. This new element is formulated based on the recently proposed layerwise model. The present model assumes an improved first-order shear deformation theory for the face sheets while a higher-order theory is assumed for the core maintaining an interlaminar displacement continuity. The advantage of this model relies on its number of variables is fixed, does not increase when increasing the number of lamina layers. This is a very important feature compared to the conventional layerwise models and facilitates significantly the engineering analysis. Indeed, the developed finite element is free of the shear locking phenomenon without requiring any shear correction factors. The governing equations of motion of the sandwich plate are derived via the classical Hamilton&#39;s principle. Several examples covering the various features such as the effect of modular ratio, aspect ratios, core-to-face thickness ratio, boundary conditions, skew angle, number of layers, geometry and ply orientations are solved for laminated composites and sandwich plates. The obtained results are compared with 3D, quasi-3D, 2D analytical solutions, and those predicted by other advanced finite element models. The comparison studies indicate that the developed finite element model is of fast convergence to the reference and valid for both thick and thin laminated sandwich plates. Finally, it can be concluded that the present model is not only simple and accurate than the conventional ones, but also comparable with refined analytical solutions found in the literature.},

The accuracy analysis for the LTS methods in structural dynamics is presented based on the first-order model, which enables the algorithms in first-order transient systems to be extended to structural dynamics under the umbrella of a consistent framework. It is indicated that the approximation of the loads plays an essential role in the equivalence between the LTS methods and some single-step methods. An algorithmic equivalence feature, which is stricter than the spectral equivalence, is revealed between the two-leg generalized-Œ± methods in first-order systems and the A-stable LTS methods. The measures of the error constant in the LTS methods and the ultimate spectral radius are extended to optimize a class of single-step methods of a given convergence order. The spectral consistent starting procedure for the A-stable LTS methods is developed by utilizing the algorithmic equivalence of the single-step methods, which results in an optimal A-stable LTS (OALTS) method possessing a consistent spectral radius with controllable numerical dissipation in the starting step and the steps thereafter. Comparing with the equivalent single-step methods, the present OALTS method does not need the auxiliary variables, and its displacement, velocity and acceleration can achieve second-order accuracy simultaneously. The performance of the present OALTS method is verified by numerical examples including physical damping, external loads, and/or nonlinearity.},

To coupling the micro‚Äìmacro scale, the equivalent elastic property of the cell microstructure is evaluated by the numerical homogenization method and then endowed to the macroelement for finite element analysis. Uncertainty factors existed in optimization parameters are evaluated by the interval convex set model. By utilizing the interval parameter vertex method and the feature distance theory, the reliability of displacement constraint in the optimization model is evaluated and constrained. In terms of length scale control, the microdensity design variables are projected by a threshold function to obtain a clear microstructure that satisfies the preset minimum length scale constraint.

  abstract     = {The hierarchical multiscale analysis normally utilizes a microscopic representative volume element (RVE) model to capture path/history-dependent macroscopic responses instead of using phenomenological constitutive models. However, for problems involving large deformation, the current RVE model used in geomechanics may lose representative properties due to the progressive distortion of the RVE box, unless a proper reinitialization is applied. This work develops an adaptive RVE model in conjunction with an evolutionary periodic boundary (EPB) algorithm for hierarchical multiscale analysis of granular materials undergoing large deformation based on a recent RVE model proposed for coupling molecular dynamics and the material point method. The proposed adaptive RVE model avoids the reinitialization of the RVE box that even undergoes extremely large shear deformation; meanwhile, it accounts for the deformation history of the RVE model and treats the interaction between boundary particles and other image particles in a more efficient way. Numerical examples with extremely large deformation are used to illustrate the adaptive granular RVE model enhanced by the proposed EPB algorithm. Furthermore, some key features of this new methodology are further discussed for clarification.},

  abstract     = {An immersed boundary method (IBM) has been developed to handle the solid body embedded flowfield simulation for compressible reactive flows, paving the way of application for a wide range of fluid‚Äìsolid interaction problems. Previously, the Brinkman penalization method (BPM), originated from porous media flows, has been successfully used for incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations by adding penalization terms to momentum equations. However, it is nontrivial to solve the compressible form due to the penalized continuity equation that usually poses severe numerical stiffness. In order to circumvent this issue, an extending procedure for relevant variables from the fluid to solid domain is considered, by analyzing the ordinary differential equations remained after operator splitting. Density can be then determined with the help of an equation of state (EoS). Meanwhile, efforts of enforcing the Neumann boundary condition, for example, the adiabatic wall condition, on the fluid‚Äìsolid interface can be minimized by extending temperature across the interface directly. One more advantage of the extending step lies in that it can quickly reach a steady state when performed within a narrow band around the interface. Implemented into an adaptive Cartesian grid-based flow solver for compressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations with chemical reaction source terms, the present variable-extended IBM is validated by numerical examples ranging from single-species nonreactive to multispecies detonative flows in one- and two-dimensional domains. Numerical results show (1) the successful specification of slip or nonslip, adiabatic or isothermal wall condition on the fluid‚Äìsolid interface and (2) loss of total energy in the original BPM being avoided and the numerical accuracy being improved especially for energy-sensitive reactive flows.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a density-based topology optimization method for designing three-dimensional (3D) compliant mechanisms (CMs) and loadbearing structures with design-dependent pressure loading. Instead of interface-tracking techniques, the Darcy law in conjunction with a drainage term is employed to obtain pressure field as a function of the design vector. To ensure continuous transition of pressure loads as the design evolves, the flow coefficient of a finite element (FE) is defined using a smooth Heaviside function. The obtained pressure field is converted into consistent nodal loads using a transformation matrix. The presented approach employs the standard FE formulation and also, allows consistent and computationally inexpensive calculation of load sensitivities using the adjoint-variable method. For CM designs, a multicriteria objective is minimized, whereas minimization of compliance is performed for designing loadbearing structures. Efficacy and robustness of the presented approach is demonstrated by designing various pressure-actuated 3D CMs and structures.},

The setup cost of IMC-1 surrogate in FastUQ requires just the adjoint solution at the input mean whose computational cost is independent of the number of input uncertainties making it suitable for solving problems with a large number of uncertain parameters. We demonstrate the robustness of the method to quantify uncertainties in aerodynamic parameters due to surface variations caused by the manufacturing processes for a highly loaded turbine cascade. A stochastic model for surface variations on the cascade is proposed and optimal dimensionality reduction of model parameters is realised using goal-based principal component analysis using adjoint sensitivities of multiple quantities of interest. The proposed method achieves a 70% reduction in computational cost in predicting the mean quantities such as total-pressure loss and mass flow rate compared to the state-of-art MLMC method.},

For the integration of stress, the backward difference scheme is employed. In the conventional return mapping algorithm, the algorithmic tangent moduli are derived analytically so that it is consistent with local iterative calculation to determine internal variables. On the other hand, in the proposed block Newton method, the tangent moduli can be obtained algebraically by eliminating the internal variables, and the internal variables are also updated algebraically without local iterative calculation. The residual of the yield condition is incorporated into the linearized equilibrium equation. The proposed approach enables the errors of the equilibrium equation and the yield condition to decrease simultaneously.

  abstract     = {This article presents an enhanced version of our previous work, hybrid nonuniform subdivision (HNUS) surfaces, to achieve optimal convergence rates in isogeometric analysis (IGA). We introduce a parameter Œª ( 1 4 &lt; Œª &lt; 1 ) to control the rate of shrinkage of irregular regions, so the method is called tuned hybrid nonuniform subdivision (tHNUS). Thus, HUNS is a special case of tHNUS when Œª = 1 2 . While introducing Œª in hybrid subdivision significantly complicates the theoretical proof of G 1 continuity around extraordinary vertices, reducing Œª can recover optimal convergence rates when tHNUS functions are used as a basis in IGA. From the geometric point of view, tHNUS retains comparable shape quality as HNUS under nonuniform parameterization. Its basis functions are refinable and the geometric mapping stays invariant during refinement. Moreover, we prove that a tHNUS surface is globally G 1 -continuous. From the analysis point of view, tHNUS basis functions form a nonnegative partition of unity, are globally linearly independent, and their spline spaces are nested. In the end, we numerically demonstrate that tHNUS basis functions can achieve optimal convergence rates for the Poisson&#39;s problem with nonuniform parameterization around extraordinary vertices.},

First, based on the probabilistic and fuzzy methodologies, the hybrid RTO model is formulated with nested double optimization loops using Monte Carlo simulations. Second, an efficient iterative method is proposed based on the perturbation method to accelerate the rate of convergence of the proposed hybrid RTO model. The derivatives of the hybrid robust compliance objective function with respect to the deterministic design variables, random parameters, and fuzzy parameters are then derived using the adjoint variable method. Finally, a T-shaped beam design, an L-shaped beam design, and a three-dimensional cantilever beam design are tested to validate the proposed hybrid RTO method.},

  abstract     = {Due to simplicity in implementation and data structure, elements with equal-order interpolation of velocity and pressure are very popular in finite-element-based flow simulations. Although such pairs are inf-sup unstable, various stabilization techniques exist to circumvent that and yield accurate approximations. The most popular one is the pressure-stabilized Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin (PSPG) method, which consists of relaxing the incompressibility constraint with a weighted residual of the momentum equation. Yet, PSPG can perform poorly for low-order elements in diffusion-dominated flows, since first-order polynomial spaces are unable to approximate the second-order derivatives required for evaluating the viscous part of the stabilization term. Alternative techniques normally require additional projections or unconventional data structures. In this context, we present a novel technique that rewrites the second-order viscous term as a first-order boundary term, thereby allowing the complete computation of the residual even for lowest-order elements. Our method has a similar structure to standard residual-based formulations, but the stabilization term is computed globally instead of only in element interiors. This results in a scheme that does not relax incompressibility, thereby leading to improved approximations. The new method is simple to implement and accurate for a wide range of stabilization parameters, which is confirmed by various numerical examples.},

The level set method is used for corrosion front tracking and also enables the domain to be split into a solid and a pit domain. In the pit the diffusion of atoms originating from the dissolution process occurring at the pit front is simulated. The model is capable of automatically capturing lacy cover formation due to the inclusion of activation control, diffusion control, and passivation. In the solid static equilibrium is solved to obtain strains and stresses. A parameter, dependent on the signs of the plastic strain increment and the back stress, is introduced to define the influence of plasticity on the corrosion rate. The model is used to study pit growth under electrochemical and mechanical loading. Under activation control combined with an elastic material response, pits propagate faster under constant loading than under cyclic loading. When plastic deformation occurs, cyclic loading can significantly increase the pit growth rate. Increasing the cyclic load frequency results in faster propagation due to kinematic hardening. Under diffusion control, mechanical loading does not influence the pit growth rate, given that the salt layer leading to diffusion control remains intact.},

Recently, TO has been tailored more toward AM with the inclusion of the minimum allowable overhang angle as a design constraint: resulting designs can be built without any support structures. This work is an extension thereof, by allowing support structures only if they are accessible, such that they can be removed after manufacturing. This is achieved by applying a conventional overhang filter twice, combined with basic operations such as geometry inversion, union, and intersection. The result is an accessibility-aware overhang filter that can be incorporated in TO. Compared with conventional overhang filtered designs, the accessibility filter results in increased part performance and better convergence behavior. Furthermore, a modular filter structure is presented to easily construct the accessibility filter, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on several numerical cases.},

Two distinct existing models that describe the electro-mechanical coupling, are demonstrated and implemented, moreover, a numerical link between both models for three-dimensional continua in terms of tensor calculus, is identified. We propose the extended-tube model for the elastic response with some of its parameters evolving in response to the electric field, in order to fit electro-viscoelastic experiments. Regarding the finite element implementation, in addition to the deformation field and the electric potential, two pairs of field variables are introduced on the element level, to enforce quasi-incompressibility and quasi-inextensibility. It is shown that using the mixed finite element improves the convergence behavior for the simulation of soft EAP with relatively stiff fibers. Moreover, the choice of the model that expresses the nature of the underlying coupling is shown to noticeably affect the degree of simulated actuation in fiber reinforced actuators.},

Firstly, a single-loop procedure is proposed by performing probabilistic analysis and interval analysis simultaneously in each most probable point search process. Then an improved conjugate sensitivity factor method based on hybrid conjugate gradient direction and adaptive finite step length is developed for probabilistic analysis. Meanwhile, the hybrid conjugate gradient direction together with active set is introduced into the projected gradient method for interval analysis.

Like the conventional RBF, RBFPH has the advantages of simple form, isotropy and high accuracy, and is suitable for numerical calculation. Moreover, all particles in RBFPH can move with the fluid, so RBFPH may conveniently compute complex flows with the moving boundary. A series of numerical examples are conducted to test the accuracy of RBFPH, and the results show the RBFPH has second-order convergence, which shows its great advantage in terms of accuracy. The RBFPH is validated by its application to the simulations of Taylor‚ÄìGreen flow, lid driven shear cavity flows, stretching of a free-surface circular fluid patch and flows around a cylinder. Excellent agreements with analytical solutions and reference results indicate that the proposed method has a promising application in simulating viscous flows with the moving boundary, large deformation, and free surface.},

  abstract     = {The identification of hidden conducting permeable objects from measurements of the perturbed magnetic field taken over a range of low frequencies is important in metal detection. Applications include identifying threat items in security screening at transport hubs, location of unexploded ordnance, and antipersonnel landmines in areas of former conflict, searching for items of archeological significance and recycling of valuable metals. The solution of the inverse problem, or more generally locating and classifying objects, has attracted considerable attention recently using polarizability tensors. The magnetic polarizability tensor (MPT) provides a characterization of a conducting permeable object using a small number of coefficients, has an explicit formula for the calculation of their coefficients, and a well understood frequency behavior, which we call its spectral signature. However, to compute such signatures, and build a library of them for object classification, requires the repeated solution of a transmission problem, which is typically accomplished approximately using a finite element discretization. To reduce the computational cost, we propose an efficient reduced order model (ROM) that further reduces the problem using a proper orthogonal decomposition for the rapid computation of MPT spectral signatures. Our ROM benefits from a posteriori error estimates of the accuracy of the predicted MPT coefficients with respect to those obtained with finite element solutions. These estimates can be computed cheaply during the online stage of the ROM allowing the ROM prediction to be certified. To further increase the efficiency of the computation of the MPT spectral signature, we provide scaling results, which enable an immediate calculation of the signature under changes in the object size or conductivity. We illustrate our approach by application to a range of homogenous and inhomogeneous conducting permeable objects.},

  abstract     = {The enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method is one of the most frequently used methods to avoid locking in solid and structural finite elements. One issue of EAS elements in the context of geometrically nonlinear analyses is their lack of robustness in the Newton‚ÄìRaphson scheme, which is characterized by the necessity of small load increments and large number of iterations. In the present work we extend the recently proposed mixed integration point (MIP) method to EAS elements in order to overcome this drawback in numerous applications. Furthermore, the MIP method is generalized to generic material models, which makes this simple method easily applicable for a broad class of problems. In the numerical simulations in this work, we compare standard strain-based EAS elements and their MIP improved versions to elements based on the assumed stress method in order to explain when and why the MIP method allows to improve robustness. A further novelty in the present work is an inverse stress-strain relation for a Neo-Hookean material model.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a computational design framework for obtaining three-dimensional (3D) periodic elastoplastic architected materials with enhanced performance, subject to uniaxial or shear strain. A nonlinear finite element model accounting for plastic deformation is developed, where a Lagrange multiplier approach is utilized to impose periodicity constraints. The analysis assumes that the material obeys a von Mises plasticity model with linear isotropic hardening. The finite element model is combined with a corresponding path-dependent adjoint sensitivity formulation, which is derived analytically. The optimization problem is parametrized using the solid isotropic material penalization method. Designs are optimized for either end compliance or toughness for a given prescribed displacement. Such a framework results in producing materials with enhanced performance through much better utilization of an elastoplastic material. Several 3D examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mathematical framework.},

  abstract     = {The energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method is a hyper-reduction method originally developed for accelerating the performance of Galerkin projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs) associated with large-scale finite element models, when the underlying projected operators need to be frequently recomputed as in parametric and/or nonlinear problems. In this paper, this hyper-reduction method is extended to Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin PROMs where the underlying high-dimensional models can be associated with arbitrary finite element, finite volume, and finite difference semi-discretization methods. Its scope is also extended to cover local PROMs based on piecewise-affine approximation subspaces, such as those designed for mitigating the Kolmogorov n -width barrier issue associated with convection-dominated flow problems. The resulting ECSW method is shown in this paper to be robust and accurate. In particular, its offline phase is shown to be fast and parallelizable, and the potential of its online phase for large-scale applications of industrial relevance is demonstrated for turbulent flow problems with O (10 7 ) and O (10 8 ) degrees of freedom. For such problems, the online part of the ECSW method proposed in this paper for Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin PROMs is shown to enable wall-clock time and CPU time speedup factors of several orders of magnitude while delivering exceptional accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A time-discontinuous peridynamic method (TDPD) for modeling transient problems of wave and crack propagation in solids is presented in this article. The main features of the TDPD are that the displacement field and the velocity field are independently interpolated in the temporal domain by using cubic and linear functions, respectively. Jump terms representing discontinuities of the variables are introduced between the adjacent time steps. The weak form and a new time integration scheme are derived by combining the peridynamic governing equations with the time-discontinuous method. The displacement field is continuous while discontinuous jumps are introduced into the velocity field. Those characteristics enable the TDPD to accurately capture the sharp gradient in stress and effectively control the spurious numerical oscillation. The effectiveness of the TDPD is first demonstrated through two representative numerical examples of wave propagation. Three additional examples are presented to show the advantages of the TDPD in the simulation of dynamic crack propagation problems. It is shown that TDPD provides more accurate and satisfactory results when compared with the traditional time integration scheme.},

This formulation of the boundary problem can extend the range of applications of the adjoint method to a host of new possibilities. The methodology is applied to internal and external laminar steady flows and the results are compared to those obtained with a finite-difference approach.

The boundary of voids in the design domain is described by RBF (radial basis function) function controlled by RBF knots in polar coordinate, where the voids are projected onto a fixed grid using Heaviside function. For merging overlapped multiple voids, the p-norm function is introduced to describe composite density field. The differentiability of the projection-based boundary description algorithm allows for the sensitivity analysis via the chain rule, and therefore, it enables an efficient gradient-based optimization method. The goal of this paper is to optimize the initial design to generate buckling-induced mechanism under large deformation, and without loss of generality, the hyperelastic material model is chosen to describe the material behavior. Notably, this method possesses the merit of level set method, where the intermediate density only exists at the boundary of topology shape. At the same time, the proposed method is still in the density-based optimization framework and standard sensitivity analysis of density-based methods can be directly derived based on the chain rule. Several numerical examples are presented and discussed in detail to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed density-based boundary evolving method.},

The basis consisting of EBS plays a central role to avoid both stress oscillation arising from inaccurate numerical integration and ill-conditioning of their resulting tangent matrices, both of which are caused by the boundary cells containing smaller number of material points than interior ones. Besides the standard material points for the interior region, boundary points are introduced to explicitly represent the boundary geometries and their movements, and to weakly impose an arbitrary boundary condition with the Nitsche&#39;s method. The Nitsche&#39;s terms in the linearized weak form are decomposed into normal and tangential directions to deal with both slip and nonslip boundary conditions. Four case studies are made to demonstrate the performance and capability of the proposed method, named EBS-MPM, in stably solving the quasi-static equilibrium problems for hyperelastic bodies and properly applying arbitrary boundary conditions.},

This procedure determines the load applied to a part of the boundary based on the captured crack propagation path. The aim of this work, which is the first time to be presented, is important from the perspective of failure analysis, especially in the cases where it is not possible to directly measure the applied loading conditions. The inverse analysis requires the direct fracture mechanics problem to be solved for various boundary loading conditions. For each of the forward problems the meshfree radial point interpolation method, which is augmented with the background decomposition method for evaluation of domain integrals is employed. Using meshfree methods makes it possible to deal with the numerous direct problems, which appear in the formulation of the inverse problem, easily, accurately, and efficiently. The inverse problem of identification of the load distribution is formulated as an optimization problem. For solving the global minimization problem, a stochastic optimization method is used, in which the damped Gauss‚ÄìNewton method is utilized as the local search algorithm. Through two example problems it is shown that the presented approach can be used effectively for the load identification of a component which has fractured along a specific path.},

  abstract     = {The natural fracture system plays an important role in the development of naturally fractured reservoirs. Traditionally, those reservoirs are simulated using dual-porosity and dual-permeability models. Conventional dual-porosity models adopt over-simplifications in terms of characterization of the fractured system. Generally, they focus on the hydraulic problem and do not consider the rock and fracture deformability. Besides, those models assume equally sized block matrix and orthogonal fracture sets with uniform properties. This work proposes a new hydromechanical formulation to represent a fractured porous formation more realistically using the finite element method. The enhanced dual-porosity and dual-permeability (EDPDP) model allows incorporating multiblock domains formed by several multiscale fracture sets with arbitrary orientations, permeabilities, and sizes. The fully coupled hydromechanical formulation includes fracture orientations and stress-induced aperture changes to update stiffness and permeability tensors. The EDPDP model is implemented in an in-house framework to study the effects of fractures with multiple scales on a hydrocarbon reservoir&#39;s hydromechanical behavior. We compare the proposed model against the discrete fracture method to assess its accuracy. The comparative results show excellent agreement and validated the fully coupled hydromechanical formulations. Finally, we present a case study of a reservoir that contains multiple sets of fractures with different scales and arbitrary orientation to demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) is a numerical method that approximates functions. Recently, its use has become attractive for the simulation and inversion of multiple problems in computational mechanics, including the inversion of borehole logging measurements for oil and gas applications. In this context, DL methods exhibit two key attractive features: (a) once trained, they enable to solve an inverse problem in a fraction of a second, which is convenient for borehole geosteering operations as well as in other real-time inversion applications. (b) DL methods exhibit a superior capability for approximating highly complex functions across different areas of knowledge. Nevertheless, as it occurs with most numerical methods, DL also relies on expert design decisions that are problem specific to achieve reliable and robust results. Herein, we investigate two key aspects of deep neural networks (DNNs) when applied to the inversion of borehole resistivity measurements: error control and adequate selection of the loss function. As we illustrate via theoretical considerations and extensive numerical experiments, these interrelated aspects are critical to recover accurate inversion results.},

  abstract     = {Through enrichment of the elastic potential by the second-order gradient of deformation, gradient elasticity formulations are capable of taking nonlocal effects into account. Moreover, geometry-induced singularities, which may appear when using classical elasticity formulations, disappear due to the higher regularity of the solution. In this contribution, a mixed finite element discretization for finite strain gradient elasticity is investigated, in which instead of the displacements, the first-order gradient of the displacements is the solution variable. Thus, the C 1 continuity condition of displacement-based finite elements for gradient elasticity is relaxed to C 0 . Contrary to existing mixed approaches, the proposed approach incorporates a rot-free constraint, through which the displacements are decoupled from the problem. This has the advantage of a reduction of the number of solution variables. Furthermore, the fulfillment of mathematical stability conditions is shown for the corresponding small strain setting. Numerical examples verify convergence in two and three dimensions and reveal a reduced computing cost compared to competitive formulations. Additionally, the gradient elasticity features of avoiding singularities and modeling size effects are demonstrated.},

The transient problem formulation allows to optimize for a broadband frequency content and the possibility to investigate transient phenomena such as pulse shaping. Throughout the work, the geometry is defined with the help of a nodal-based design field, for which its zero-level contour describes the interface between acoustic and structural domains. The approach utilizes a fixed background mesh to represent the geometry and a cut element immersed boundary method for the physical modeling. This modeling approach provides accurate solutions to the strongly coupled governing equations based on a special integration scheme. The optimization problem is solved using a gradient-based optimizer and employs a fully discrete adjoint approach for calculating the sensitivity information. A numerical examination on the accuracy of the sensitivity analysis compares the fully discrete gradients to the commonly used semidiscrete adjoint approach for transient optimization revealing the importance of consistent sensitivities. The transient design formulation is validated on a 2D benchmark problem concerning the design of a time-harmonic acoustic partitioner. The developed framework is then applied for the design of vibroacoustic pulse shaping devices to demonstrate control of a transient phenomena.},

The reason is that these realistic models use microplane stress‚Äìstrain boundaries defined by inequalities. Here, we show how the conversion can be easily achieved on the microplane level and then transferred to a tangent stiffness tensor or an inelastic stiffness tensor to be used in Newton‚ÄìRaphson iterations within a loading step. To ensure convergence, a minor adjustment in the M7 algorithm is introduced to achieve continuity. Power-law convergence, almost quadratic in most cases, is also demonstrated. Seven examples of crack-band finite element simulations of challenging laboratory tests document nearly identical implicit and explicit results, as well as good match of test data. Three of them, including the vertex effect in compression-torsion tests, pure Mode II shear fracture, and the ‚Äúgap test‚Äù of the crack-parallel compression effect on Mode I load-deflection curve, have not been reproduced by other models before.

The data-driven computing framework is essentially a multiobjective optimization procedure matching the material operation points as closely as possible to given material data while obeying Maxwell&#39;s equations. Here, the framework is extended with heterogeneous (local) weighting factors‚Äîone per finite element‚Äîequilibrating the goal function locally according to the material behavior. This modification allows the data-driven solver to cope with unbalanced measurement data sets, that is, data sets suffering from unbalanced space filling. This occurs particularly in the case of strongly nonlinear materials, which constitute problematic cases that hinder the efficiency and accuracy of standard data-driven solvers with a homogeneous (global) weighting factor. The local weighting factors are embedded in the distance-minimizing data-driven algorithm used for noiseless data, likewise for the maximum entropy data-driven algorithm used for noisy data. Numerical experiments based on a quadrupole magnet model with a soft magnetic material show that the proposed modification results in major improvements in terms of solution accuracy and solver efficiency. For the case of noiseless data, local weighting factors improve the convergence of the data-driven solver by orders of magnitude. When noisy data are considered, the convergence rate of the data-driven solver is doubled.},

A unique drawback of the MPM is the cell crossing error whereby material points crossing grid cells suddenly produce spurious stress oscillations leading to significant errors. After distilling the necessary conditions required for the cell crossing error, a novel quadrature-based C 0 enhancement scheme is proposed. The partitioned quadrature material point method (PQMPM) effectively mitigates the cell crossing error while retaining the linear Lagrangian basis and Dirac density function of the original MPM, rendering it easily integrable into existing MPM codebases. One and two-dimensional examples illustrate the elimination of the cell crossing error, improvement of solution accuracy (particularly reliable stress prediction), local application of the scheme across dynamically varying arbitrary spatial and temporal regions and the reasonable additional computational costs against increased accuracy. Contrasting existing enhanced MPM schemes, the PQMPM only incurs additional computational cost exactly when and where cell crossing errors would otherwise occur and minimally diffuses local effects.},

Adaptively refined TH meshes are created by cutting octree background meshes with the boundary of an analysis domain. A multithreshold criterion for mesh refinement is proposed to accurately capture the evolution of the damage phase field. Shape functions for transition TH elements are developed to satisfy the compatibility across the interelement boundaries between TH elements with different refinement levels.

However, no literature has been reported on analytical or numerical solutions for composites containing multiple three-dimensional nano-inclusions with S-O interfaces. In order to overcome this difficulty, a new type of computational grain (CG) is developed with an embedded spherical inclusion and S-O matrix/inclusion interface. The stiffness matrix of each CG is computed by a new boundary-type multifield variational principle together with Papkovich‚ÄìNeuber potentials. By evaluating and assembling stiffness matrices of CGs along with parallel computations, very efficient direct numerical simulations of complex nano-composites with a large number of inclusions in a Representative Volume Element of the nanocomposite are essentially realized. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity and the power of the currently developed CGs. Especially, material models with 10,000 nano-inclusions are simulated in around 50‚Äâmin on the 16-core workstation. The influence of interface elastic bending parameters and spatial distributions of the nano-inclusions on the overall properties of nano-composites is also investigated in this study.},

To ensure its accuracy, a complete analytical formulation is derived, and the performance and limitation of the proposed method are deeply discussed. The performance of the proposed method is verified and its numerical examples emphasize the importance of considering geometrical nonlinearity to obtain robust structures with respect to uncertainties of loading conditions.

This article presents a formulation for variationally scaled reciprocal mass matrices and an efficient estimator for the feasible time step for finite elements with Allman&#39;s rotations. These developments take special care of two core features of such elements: existence of spurious zero-energy rotation modes implying the incompleteness of the ansatz spaces, and the presence of mixed-dimensional degrees of freedom. The former feature excludes construction of dual bases used in the standard variational derivation of reciprocal mass matrices. The latter feature destroys the efficiency of the existing nodal-based time step estimators stemming from the Gershgorin&#39;s eigenvalue bound.

Since the compression and tension resulted from the combustion and exhaust strokes are nonconcurrent loads, the importance of this approach arises up. RSL depends on combining the optimum-design layouts obtained from different individual nonconcurrent load cases into one resultant design. This final design efficiently sustains all different loads applied to it. RSL presents a simple, less computational effort in the dynamic environment, and less time-consuming method. RSL has been compared with a multiload optimization method called bound formulation (BF) for obtaining the optimum design of some simple models before dealing with the CR model afterward. Two distinctive optimum topological designs of CR produced by RSL have proved their feasibility and achieved considerable improvements against both the conventional CR design being used nowadays in the automotive industry and the BF method designs, as well. A comparative study between them was accomplished based on both structural and modal analyses in ANSYS. As a result, the proposed RSL design shows a significant reduction of compliance, displacement/deflection and mass moment of inertia by 57.2%, 68.7%, and 5.9%, respectively, compared with conventional one.},

  abstract     = {Materials accumulate energy around voids and defects under external loading, causing the formation of microcracks. With increasing or repeated loads, those microcracks eventually coalesce to form macrocracks, which in a brittle material can cause catastrophic failure without apparent permanent deformation. At the continuum level, a stochastic phase-field model is employed to simulate failure through introducing damage and fatigue variables. The damage phase-field is introduced as a continuous dynamical variable representing the volumetric portion of fractured material and fatigue is treated as a continuous internal field variable to model the effects of microcracks arising from energy accumulation. We formulate a computational-mathematical framework for quantifying the corresponding model uncertainties and sensitivities in order to unfold and mitigate the salient sources of unpredictability in the model, hence, leading to new possible modeling paradigms. Considering an isothermal isotropic linear elastic material with viscous dissipation under the hypothesis of small deformations, we employed Monte Carlo and probabilistic collocation methods to perform the forward uncertainty propagation, in addition to local-to-global sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate that the model parameters associated with free-energy potentials contribute significantly more to the total model output uncertainties, motivating further investigations for obtaining more predictable model forms, representing the damage diffusion.},

In this work, topology optimization of heterogeneous structures consisting of inseparable unit cells is studied. The cell morphology is given first and remains unchanged during the optimization process. A nonlocal numerical homogenization method is used to construct a mesoscopic constitutive relationship between the material and the structural scales. Topology optimization is performed on heterostructures at the higher mesoscale, and only based on a coarse grid for computational savings. Numerical studies show that the structural stiffness has been significantly improved compared to classical multiscale topology optimization using separation assumptions. However, there is still a size dependence of the optimal mesostructure related to the characteristic effect of the unit lattice.},

  abstract     = {Thermomechanical couplings are present in many materials and should therefore be considered in multiscale approaches. Specific cases of thermomechanical behavior are the isothermal and the adiabatic regime, in which the behavior of real materials differs. Based on the consistent asymptotic homogenization framework for thermomechanically coupled generalized standard materials, the present work is devoted to computing the effective thermomechanical behavior of composite materials in the context of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based micromechanics. Exploiting the homogeneity of the temperature on the microscale, we develop a fast implicit staggered solution scheme for the coupled problem, which is compatible to existing strain-based micromechanics solvers. Due to its implicit formulation, the algorithm permits large time steps for computations involving strong thermomechanical coupling. We investigate the performance of modern FFT-based algorithms combined with the proposed thermomechanical solution strategy. In this context, the Barzilai‚ÄìBorwein method is identified as particularly efficient, inducing only a small overhead compared with the traditional isothermal setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach for short-fiber reinforced composites with viscoelastic matrix behavior.},

To solve this challenge, we construct a novel effective fully decoupled scheme that is linear, unconditional energy stable, and second-order time accurate. The key idea of decoupling is to introduce a nonlocal variable and a related ordinary differential equation to deal with the nonlinear coupling terms that satisfy the so-called ‚Äúzero-energy-contribution‚Äù property. Thus, in actual calculations, this scheme only needs to solve several independent linear equations at each time step to obtain a numerical solution with the second-order time accuracy. We strictly prove the solvability and unconditional energy stability and perform numerical simulations in 2D and 3D to verify the accuracy and stability of the scheme numerically.},

Furthermore, the theory assumes the existence of an effective yield function in terms of stress resultants, that is, force and moment in the cross-section and cross-section averaged hardening parameters. Accordingly, one does not have to resort to the three-dimensional theory of elastoplasticity during any step of the finite element formulation. A return map algorithm is presented in order to update the plastic variables, stress resultants and also to obtain the consistent elastoplastic moduli of the rod. The presented FE formulation is used to study snap-through buckling in a semicircular arch subjected to an in-plane transverse load at its midsection.

The PML is a popular nonreflecting technique that combines accuracy, computational efficiency, and geometric flexibility. Unfortunately, the effective implementation of the PML for convex domains of general shape is tricky because of the geometric parameters that are required to define the PML medium. In this work, a comprehensive implementation strategy is proposed. This approach, which we call the automatically matched layer (AML) implementation, is versatile and fully automatic for the end-user. With the AML approach, the mesh of the layer is extruded, the required geometric parameters are automatically obtained during the extrusion step, and the practical implementation relies on a simple modification of the Jacobian matrix in the elementwise integrals. The AML implementation is validated and compared with other implementation strategies using numerical benchmarks in two and three dimensions, considering computational domains with regular and nonregular boundaries. A three-dimensional application with a generally shaped domain generated using a convex hull is proposed to illustrate the interest of the AML approach for realistic industrial cases.},

The shell model is described by partial differential equations on manifolds and the resulting FDM may typically be called Trace FEM. The three standard key aspects of FDMs have to be addressed in the Trace FEM as well to allow for a higher-order accurate method: (i) numerical integration in the cut background elements, (ii) stabilization of awkward cut situations and elimination of linear dependencies, and (iii) enforcement of boundary conditions using Nitsche&#39;s method.

  abstract     = {Enriched finite element methods have gained traction in recent years for modeling problems with material interfaces and cracks. By means of enrichment functions that incorporate a priori behavior about the solution, these methods decouple the finite element (FE) discretization from the geometric configuration of such discontinuities. Taking advantage of this greater flexibility, recent studies have proposed the adoption of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to preserve the interfaces&#39; exact geometries throughout the analysis. In this article, we investigate NURBS-based geometries in the context of the Discontinuity-Enriched Finite Element Method (DE-FEM) based on linear field approximations. While optimal convergence is retained for problems with weak discontinuities without singularities, representing exact geometry via NURBS does not yield noticeable improvements when extracting stress intensity factors of cracked specimens. For low-order elements, we conclude that the benefits of exact geometry representation do not outweigh the increased complexity in formulation and implementation. The choice of linear FEs hinders the accuracy of the proposed formulation, suggesting that its full potential may only be unleashed by increasing the field representation order.},

To predict this coupling effect between crystal plasticity and deformation twinning, we introduce a mathematical model and the corresponding monolithic and operator splitting solvers that couple the crystal plasticity material model with a phase field twining model such that the twinning nucleation and propagation can be captured via an implicit function. While a phase field order parameter is introduced to quantify the twinning induced shear strain and corresponding crystal reorientation, the evolution of the order parameter is driven by the resolved shear stress on the twinning system. To avoid introducing an additional set of slip systems for dislocation slip within the twinning region, we introduce a Lie algebra averaging technique to determine the Schmid tensor throughout the twinning transformation. Three different numerical schemes are proposed to solve the coupled problem, including a monolithic scheme, an alternating minimization scheme, and an operator splitting scheme. Three numerical examples are utilized to demonstrate the capability of the proposed model, as well as the accuracy and computational cost of the solvers.},

The generalized Maxwell model (GMM) is employed for resin&#39; material behavior, while its orthotropic version is assumed for FRP. The evolution of DOC is reflected in the evaluation of the nonmechanical deformation by cure shrinkage in addition to thermal expansion/contraction. The key ingredient of this study is the novel strategy for identifying the macroscopic coefficients of these nonmechanical deformations, both of which must be separately defined in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium elements of the orthotropic GMM. In addition, a modification is originally made on the evolution equations of the nonequilibrium stresses in the GMM. The verification analyses are carried out to confirm the adequateness of the proposed identification methods and followed by numerical examples of two-scale analysis to demonstrate the capability of simulating the macro- and microscopic thermomechanical responses of FRP subjected to curing.},

  abstract     = {A domain decomposition approach for high-dimensional random partial differential equations exploiting the localization of random parameters is presented. To obtain high efficiency, surrogate models in multielement representations in the parameter space are constructed locally when possible. The method makes use of a stochastic Galerkin finite element tearing interconnecting dual-primal formulation of the underlying problem with localized representations of involved input random fields. Each local parameter space associated to a subdomain is explored by a subdivision into regions where either the parametric surrogate accuracy can be trusted or where instead one has to resort to Monte Carlo. A heuristic adaptive algorithm carries out a problem-dependent hp-refinement in a stochastic multielement sense, anisotropically enlarging the trusted surrogate region as far as possible. This results in an efficient global parameter to solution sampling scheme making use of local parametric smoothness exploration for the surrogate construction. Adequately structured problems for this scheme occur naturally when uncertainties are defined on subdomains, for example, in a multiphysics setting, or when the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve expansion of a random field can be localized. The efficiency of the proposed hybrid technique is assessed with numerical benchmark problems illustrating the identification of trusted (possibly higher order) surrogate regions and nontrusted sampling regions.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive structures are characterized by their ability to adjust their geometrical and other properties to changing loads or requirements during service. This contribution deals with a method for the design of quasi-static motions of structures between two prescribed geometrical configurations that are optimal with regard to a specified quality function while taking large deformations into account. It is based on a variational formulation and the solution by two finite element discretizations, the spatial discretization (the standard finite element mesh) and an additional discretization of the deformation path or trajectory. For the investigations, an exemplary objective function, the minimization of the internal energy, integrated along the deformation path, is used. The method for motion design presented herein uses the Newton-Raphson method as a second-order optimization algorithm and allows for analytical sensitivity analysis. The proposed method is verified and its properties are investigated by benchmark examples including rigid body motions, instability phenomena, and determination of inextensible deformations of shells.},

  abstract     = {A time step must be selected for any explicit discrete element method (DEM) simulation. This time step must be small enough to ensure a stable simulation but should not be overly conservative for computational efficiency. There are established methods to estimate critical time steps for simulations of spherical particles. However, there is a comparable lack of guidance on choosing time steps for DEM simulations involving nonspherical particles: a fact which is increasingly problematic as simulations of nonspherical particles become more commonplace. In this article, the eigenvalues of the amplification matrix are used to develop an explicit formula for the critical time step for a range of shapes including ellipsoids, convex superquadrics and convex, central symmetric polyhedra. This derivation is based on a linear analysis and applies to both underdamped and overdamped systems. The dependence on the particle mass and contact stiffness expected for a system of spheres is recovered. For a fixed particle mass, as particle shape becomes increasingly nonspherical, the critical time step decreases nonlinearly. Thus, estimating a critical time step by assuming a sphere of equivalent volume may not always be conservative.},

Also, solid viscosity is included which offers the opportunity to simulate the surfing behavior of droplets on viscoelastic substrates for the first time.

In effect, the learning procedure consists in constructing an explicit function that approximates f in some sense. In this article is introduced a Fourier-based machine learning method which could be an alternative or a complement to neural networks for applications in engineering. The basic idea is to extend f into a periodic function so as to use partial sums of the Fourier series as approximations. For this approach to be effective in high dimension, it proved necessary to use several ideas and concepts such as regularization, Sobol sequences and hyperbolic crosses. An attractive feature of the proposed method is that the training stage reduces to a quadratic programming problem. The presented method is first applied to some examples of high-dimensional analytical functions, which allows some comparisons with neural networks to be made. An application to a homogenization problem in nonlinear conduction is discussed in detail. Various examples related to global sensitivity analysis, assessing effective energies of microstructures, and solving boundary value problems are presented.},

The other one is hybrid, with an interpolation of stress tractions along the contact surface, which coexists with the standard displacement interpolations of the continuum surfaces in contact. The hybrid formulation shares some features with mortar formulations found in the literature of contact-friction, and turns out fully equivalent to the displacement-based in the particular case of matched nodes and uniform, linear elastic behavior.

This can be aggravated when other nonlinear, dissipative mechanisms are introduced, for instance the propagation of cracks. This is demonstrated rigorously, as well as the regularizing effect of adding viscosity or employing a Cosserat continuum. In both cases the regularization is independent of the value of the internal length scale for a fairly wide range of parameters. The spatial discretization has been done using T-splines, and the fracture is modeled using interface elements and propagated using mesh line insertions. The time integration has been done by an implicit Newmark scheme. The use of proper regularization techniques makes an implicit scheme feasible, resulting in a reduction in the number of time steps by an order of magnitude.},

In order to account for such refined description in large-scale structural problems, a novel enhanced implicit finite element formulation is presented. The standard displacement approximation is improved by means of a kinematic enrichment aimed at reproducing the local interaction between the matrix and the inclusion. The microscale interface behavior can then be directly evaluated from the stress jump arising in the bulk. From a computational point of view, this translates in solving an additional local equilibrium equation. The static boundary conditions at the inclusion ends are thus exactly verified and a good precision is achieved with minimal meshing effort and code modifications.

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel mesh-free, moving Kriging (MK) based collocation scheme for the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is introduced. In contrast to methods that are based on a Galerkin weak form of the governing PDEs, the MK collocation (MKC) approach, which is strong form based, is truly mesh-free in the sense that no background mesh is required for numerical integration. In fact, the presented approach does not require the evaluation of any integrals. Since the approximation function in the MK framework can be conditioned on point value- as well as derivative-information, the pointwise exact imposition of essential as well as natural boundary conditions is rendered straightforward. By incorporating an explicit linear basis into the MK framework, the first-order consistency condition is fulfilled, and thus rigid body motions are captured accurately. Moreover, Kriging functions may be conceived that comply with constraints on higher order derivatives such as the PDE at hand at certain locations. This possibility proves useful in improving the solution accuracy in the vicinity of Dirichlet boundaries. This article provides a study of the method&#39;s characteristics by means of 2D linear elasticity examples. It concludes with a suggestion on how to apply MKC to nonlinear PDEs.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the temporal accuracy of two generalized- Œ± schemes for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In a widely-adopted approach, the pressure is collocated at the time step t n +‚Äâ1 while the remainder of the Navier-Stokes equations is discretized following the generalized- Œ± scheme. That scheme has been claimed to be second-order accurate in time . We developed a suite of numerical code using inf-sup stable higher-order non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) elements for spatial discretization. In doing so, we are able to achieve high spatial accuracy and to investigate asymptotic temporal convergence behavior. Numerical evidence suggests that only first-order accuracy is achieved, at least for the pressure, in this aforesaid temporal discretization approach. On the other hand, evaluating the pressure at the intermediate time step recovers second-order accuracy, and the numerical implementation is simplified. We recommend this second approach as the generalized- scheme of choice when integrating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.},

  abstract     = {A condensed algorithm for adaptive component mode synthesis is proposed to compute the dynamics of viscoelastic flexible multibody systems efficiently and accurately. As studied, the continuous use of modes derived from the initial configuration will lead to poor convergence when dealing with geometric nonlinearity caused by large deformations and overall rotations. The modal reduction at a series of quasi-static equilibrium configurations should be updated accordingly. According to the loss rate of system energy in the updating process of modal bases, an adaptive mode selection is proposed to reserve the optimal modal bases with their modal number automatically so as to achieve a high-accuracy simulation. In the proposed condensed iteration algorithm, the order of reduced dynamic equations in the Newton-Raphson is far less than the number of the unknowns to be discrete in generalized- Œ± scheme. Using an analytical mapping between the two parts of unknowns, the new algorithm solves a small part of the unknowns iteratively and solves the others noniteratively. Therefore, the saving of time cost comes not only from the proposed adaptive component mode synthesis, but also from the proposed condensed iteration algorithm. The modal bases of subsystems are updated by a series of frame-like quasi-static equilibrium configurations independently, in conjunction with the Craig-Bampton method. Thus, the challenges in the model reduced of extensive ranges of stiffness and damping are removed via the successively updated modal bases. Finally, three numerical tests are made to illuminate the high accuracy and efficiency of the new algorithm proposed.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel, scalable parallel computing framework for large-scale and multiscale simulations of granular media. Key to the new framework is an innovative thread-block-wise representative volume element (RVE) parallelism, inspired by the resemblance between a typical multiscale computational hierarchy and the hierarchical thread structure of graphics processing units (GPUs). To solve a hierarchical multiscale problem, all computation in an RVE is assigned a single block of threads so that the RVE runs entirely on a GPU to avoid frequent data exchange with the host CPU. The thread blocks can meanwhile run in an asynchronization mode, which implicitly guarantees the independence of inter-RVE computation as featured by the hierarchical multiscale structure. The parallel computing algorithms are formulated and implemented in an in-house code, GoDEM , involving the GPU-specific techniques such as coalesced access, shared memory utilization, and unified memory implementation. Benchmark and performance tests are conducted against an open-source CPU-based DEM code under three typical loading conditions. The performance of GoDEM is examined with varying thread-block size and register pressure of the GPU, and RVE number. It reveals that increasing GPU occupancy by decreasing register pressure results in a significant degradation rather than improvement in performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed GPU parallelism framework may achieve a saturated speedup of approximately 350 compared with the single-CPU-core code. As a demonstration on its application for multiscale modeling of granular media, the material point method is coupled with the new framework powered DEM to simulate a typical engineering-scale problem involving tens of millions of total particles having to be handled. It demonstrates that a speedup of approximately 91 can be achieved by using the proposed framework, compared with the performance of a similar CPU program running on a cluster node of 44 parallel threads. The study offers a viable future solution to large-scale and multiscale modeling of granular media.},

This article presents a three-dimensional design methodology that alleviates this shortcoming using both deterministic and robust problem formulations. The robust formulation, based on the three-field density projection approach, is extended and proved necessary to handle manufacturing uncertainty in three-dimensional stress-constrained problems. Several numerical examples are solved and further postprocessed with body-fitted meshes using commercial software. The numerical investigations demonstrate that: (1) the employed solution approach based on the augmented Lagrangian method is able to handle very large problems, with hundreds of millions of stress constraints; (2) three-dimensional stress-based results are extremely sensitive to slight manufacturing variations; (3) if appropriate interpolation parameters are adopted, voxel-based (fixed grid) models can be used to compute von Mises stresses with excellent accuracy; and (4) in order to ensure manufacturing tolerance in three-dimensional stress-constrained topology optimization, a combination of double filtering and more than three density field realizations may be required.},

The linear momentum and energy conservation equations are formulated in the Lagrangian configuration and solved simultaneously in a monolithic way by the HOTM method to predict the deformation, temperature, contact mechanisms, and fluid-structure interactions in the powder bed. The numerical results are validated against single track experiments. Various powder bed configurations, laser powers, and speed are investigated to understand the influence of dynamic contact and inelastic material behavior on the deformation, heat transfer, and phase transition of the powder bed.

However, MMTO has drawn some industry skepticism as it assumes different material elements to be perfectly fused together. To address this concern, in this article, a novel pseudo-cost domain (PCD) method is proposed which mathematically determines individual material interfaces in MMTO solutions. The proposed methodology employs a user defined joint cost model to weigh the distinct material interfaces relative to each other. An innovative approach to tailor the MMTO design considering the relative cost of each material interface is presented. The proposed methodology can consider any number of materials and their respective interfaces, and it is defined in such a way that increasing the number of materials has minimal effect on computational time. The methodology is formulated in a smooth and differentiable manner and the sensitivity expressions required by gradient-based optimization solvers are presented. A series of example problems are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.},

The computational domain is divided into several subdomains and the enriched nodes are individually introduced to construct the approximation of the displacement field. This method provides a flexible way to describe the multiple-body contact with nonconforming mesh in the extended finite element method (XFEM). An independent virtual interface is employed to replace the XFEM discontinuous interface. The connect condition between the virtual interface and discontinuous interface is imposed using the dual Lagrange multiplier method. Due to the bi-orthogonality condition, the Lagrange multipliers can be locally eliminated at a very low computational cost. The resulting system matrix is symmetric positive definite and well-conditioned. Furthermore, the contact and natural boundary conditions can be directly imposed on the virtual interface. Several numerical experiments are performed and the results show that the proposed method provides an effective, robust, and fast way to simulate three-dimensional contact behaviors of nonconforming interfaces.},

The underlying coupling equations allow for connecting dissimilar meshes and avoid the need for remeshing when joint locations change. The presented method models the force transfer at a joint location not only by using single spring elements but accounts for the size and type of the joints. When considering riveted or bolted joints, the local part geometry at the joint location consists of holes that are surrounded by material. For spot welds, the joint locations are filled with material and may be smaller than for bolts. The presented method incorporates these material and clearance zones into the simultaneously running topology optimization of the parts.

  abstract     = {Interior-point methods (IPMs) are well suited for solving convex nonsmooth optimization problems which arise for instance in problems involving plasticity or contact conditions. This work attempts at extending their field of application to optimization problems involving either smooth but nonconvex or nonsmooth but convex objectives or constraints. A typical application for such kind of problems is finite-strain elastoplasticity which we address using a total Lagrangian formulation based on logarithmic strain measures. The proposed interior-point algorithm is implemented and tested on 3D examples involving plastic collapse and geometrical changes. Comparison with classical, Newton-Raphson/return mapping methods show that the IPM exhibits good computational performance, especially in terms of convergence robustness. Similar to what is observed for convex small-strain plasticity, the IPM is able to converge for much larger load steps than classical methods.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of this study is threefold: (1) to present a general higher-order shell theory to analyze large deformations of thin or thick shell structures made of general compressible hyperelastic materials; (2) to formulate an efficient shell theory using the orthonormal moving frame, and (3) to develop and apply the nonlinear weak-form Galerkin finite element model for the proposed shell theory. The displacement field of the line normal to the shell reference surface is approximated by the Taylor series/Legendre polynomials in the thickness coordinate of the shell. The use of an orthonormal moving frame makes it possible to represent kinematic quantities (e.g., the determinant of the deformation gradient) in a far more efficient manner compared with the nonorthogonal covariant bases. Kinematic quantities for the shell deformation are obtained in a novel way in the surface coordinate described in the appendix of this study with the help of exterior calculus. Furthermore, the governing equation of the shell deformation has been derived in the general surface coordinates. To obtain the nonlinear solution in the quasi-static cases, we develop the weak-form finite element model in which the reference surface of the shell is modeled exactly. The general invariant based compressible hyperelastic material model is considered. The formulation presented herein can be specialized for various other nonlinear compressible hyperelastic constitutive models, for example, in biomechanics and other soft-material problems (e.g., compressible neo-Hookean material, compressible Mooney‚ÄìRivlin material, Saint Venant‚ÄìKirchhoff model, and others). A number of numerical examples are presented to verify and validate the formulation presented in this study. The scope of potential extensions are outlined in the final section of this study.},

The developed integration scheme is achieved by a combination of the implicit backward Euler difference approximation and the implicit asymptotic integration. For the uniaxial loading case, the developed integration scheme produces accurate results irrespective of time steps. For the multiaxial loading case, the accuracy and computational efficiency of the developed integration scheme are better than those of either the implicit backward Euler difference approximation or the implicit asymptotic integration. The simplicity of the developed integration scheme is equivalent to that of the implicit backward Euler difference approximation since it also reduces the solution of integrated constitutive equations to the solution of a single nonlinear equation. The algorithm tangent constitutive matrix derived for the developed integration scheme is consistent with the integration algorithm and preserves the quadratic convergence of the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method for global iterations.},

The proposed formulation is based on the hybrid equilibrium element (HEE) model, with stress fields which strongly verify the homogeneous equilibrium equations and interelement equilibrium equations. The HEE can easily model high-order stress fields and can implicitly model the initially rigid behavior of an extrinsic interface at the element sides. The interface model is defined as a function of the same degrees of freedom of the HEE (generalized stresses) and the pre- and post-failure behavior of the interface can be modeled without any additional degree of freedom. The proposed formulation is developed for a nine-node triangular HEE with quadratic stress fields. This article also proposes an extrinsic cohesive model, rigorously developed in the damage mechanics framework.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present an algorithm to construct high-order fully symmetric cubature rules for tetrahedral and pyramidal elements, with positive weights and integration points that are in the interior of the domain. Cubature rules are fully symmetric if they are invariant to affine transformations of the domain. We divide the integration points into symmetry orbits where each orbit contains all the points generated by the permutation stars. These relations are represented by equality constraints. The construction of symmetric cubature rules require the solution of nonlinear polynomial equations with both inequality and equality constraints. For higher orders, we use an algorithm that consists of five sequential phases to produce the cubature rules. In the literature, symmetric numerical integration rules are available for the tetrahedron for orders p =‚Äâ1 ‚Äì 10,‚Äâ14 , and for the pyramid up to p =‚Äâ10 . We have obtained fully symmetric cubature rules for both of these elements up to order p =‚Äâ20 . Numerical tests are presented that verify the polynomial-precision of the cubature rules. Convergence studies are performed for the integration of exponential, weakly singular, and trigonometric test functions over both elements with flat and curved faces. With increase in p , improvements in accuracy is realized, though nonmonotonic convergence is observed.},

This formulation is applicable for solving the material failure problems involved in discontinuous displacement fields. The governing equations of the state-based peridynamic shell theory are derived based on the nonlocal balance laws by adopting the kinematic assumption of the Reissner and Mindlin plate and shell theories. In the numerical calculations, the stress points are employed to ensure the numerical stability.

The element is obtained from the Hellinger‚ÄìReissner variational principle and it is based on an elastic solution of the generalized stress field, which is ruled by the minimum number of variables. As such, the new FE is isostatic because the number of stress parameters is equal to the number of kinematical parameters minus the number of rigid body motions. We name this new FE MISS-8. MISS-8 has generalized displacements and rotations interpolated along its contour and drilling rotation is also considered as degree of freedom. The element is integrated exactly on its contour, it does not suffer from rank defectiveness and it is locking-free. Furthermore, it is efficient for recovering both stress and displacement fields when coarse meshes are used. The numerical investigation on its performance confirms the suitability, accuracy, and efficiency to recover elastic solutions of thick- and thin-walled beam-like structures. Numerical results obtained with the proposed FE are also compared with those obtained with isogeometric high-performance solutions. Finally, numerical results show a rate of convergence between h 2 and h 4 .},

The solid two-field fsi coupling formulation is benchmarked statically and dynamically. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition ( pod ) is applied to all three fsi formulations to obtain reduced basis and asses their performance in a reduced space. Numerical tests are shown comparing all three formulations. By correctly resolving the Cauchy stress tensor, the three-field fsi coupling proves to provide more accurate results in both Full Order Model ( fom ) and Reduced Order Model ( rom ) spaces than its counterparts for a similar number of degrees of freedom, making it a reliable formulation. f2f pairing appears to be beneficial, providing more accurate results in all cases shown; mixed pairing with a three-field formulation in the solid appears to produce very precise results as well.},

  abstract     = {Numerical analysis of the hyperelastic behavior of polymer materials has drawn significant interest from within the field of mechanical engineering. Currently, hyperelastic models based on the energy density function, such as the Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Ogden models, are used to investigate the hyperelastic responses of materials. Conventionally, constants relating to materials were determined from experimental data by using global least-squares fitting. However, formulating a constitutive equation to capture the complex behavior of hyperelastic materials was difficult owing to the limitations of the analytical model and experimental data. This study addresses these limitations by using a system of neural networks (NNs) to design a data-driven surrogate model without a specific function formula, and employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to calculate the massive amount of combined loading data of hyperelastic materials. Thus, MD simulations were used to propose an NN constitutive model for hyperelasticity to derive the constitutive equation to model the complex hyperelastic response. In addition, the probability distributions of the numerical solutions of hyperelasticity are used to characterize the uncertainty of the MD models. These statistical finite element results not only present numerical results with reliability ranges but also scattered distributions of the solution obtained from the MD-based probability distributions.},
