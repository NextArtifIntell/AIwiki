  abstract     = {Pixel value differencing (PVD) steganography techniques produce imperceptible stego-images. Most PVD-based techniques have a fall-off boundary problem (FOBP). To avoid FOBP, a steganographic scheme is presented that combines the quotient value difference (QVD) with pixel value correlation (PVC). It performs data embedding in two stages on 3 × 3 size pixel blocks. The first stage of the embedding procedure performs QVD and remainder substitution on five pixels. These five pixels are central pixel and it&#39;s neighbours on the left, right, upper, and lower sides. Based on the new values of these five pixels, the PVC embedding procedure is applied on the remaining four corner pixels of the block. The experimental results are found to be improved. The hiding capacity is high that is 3.92 bits per byte with an acceptable peak signal-to-noise ratio value. A security check was performed using two tests: (i) a regular-singular (RS) test, (ii) a pixel difference histogram (PDH) test. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that PDH curves of the stego-images do not have a zigzag shape, that means the PDH test could not detect this steganography technique. Furthermore, the RS curves show that the RS test could not detect this steganography technique.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning has achieved some remarkable results in self-driving. There is quite a lot of work to do in the area of autonomous driving with high real-time requirements because of the inefficiency of reinforcement learning in exploring large continuous motion spaces. A deep imitation reinforcement learning (DIRL) framework is presented to learn control policies of self-driving vehicles, which is based on a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) by vision. The DIRL framework comprises two components, the perception module and the control module, using imitation learning (IL) and DDPG, respectively. The perception module employs the IL network as an encoder which processes an image into a low-dimensional feature vector. This vector is then delivered to the control module which outputs control commands. Meanwhile, the actor network of the DDPG is initialized with the trained IL network to improve exploration efficiency. In addition, a reward function for reinforcement learning is defined to improve the stability of self-driving vehicles, especially on curves. DIRL is verified by the open racing car simulator (TORCS), and the results show that the correct control strategy is learned successfully and has less training time.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, collaborative filtering (CF) techniques have become one of the most popularly used techniques for providing personalized services to users. CF techniques collect users’ previous information about items such as books, music, movies, ideas, and so on. Memory-based models are generally referred to as similarity-based CF models, which are one of the most widely agreeable approaches for providing service recommendations. The memory-based approach includes user-based CF (UCF) and item-based CF (ICF) algorithms. The UCF model recommends items by finding similar users, while the ICF model recommends items by finding similar items based on the user-item rating matrix. However, consequent to the ingrained sparsity of the user-item rating matrix, a large number of ratings are missing. This results in the availability of only a few ratings to make predictions for the unknown ratings. The result is the poor prediction quality of the CF model. A model to find the best algorithm is provided here, which gives the most accurate recommendation based on different similarity metrics. Here a hybrid recommendation model, namely ΓUICF, is proposed. The ΓUICF model integrates the UCF and ICF models with the Γ linear regression model to model the sparsity and scalability issue of the user-item rating matrix. Detailed experimentation on two different real-world datasets shows that the proposed model demonstrates substantial performance when compared with the existing methods.},

A new supervised feature learning method for multi-view data, called low-rank constrained weighted discriminative regression (LWDR), is proposed. Different from previous methods handling each view separately, LWDR learns a discriminative projection matrix by fully exploiting the complementary information among all views from a unified perspective. Based on least squares regression model, the high-dimensional multi-view data is mapped into a common subspace, in which different views have different weights in projection. The weights are adaptively updated to estimate the roles of all views. To improve the intra-class similarity of learned features, a low-rank constraint is designed and imposed on the multi-view features of each class, which improves the feature discrimination. An iterative optimization algorithm is designed to solve the LWDR model efficiently. Experiments on four popular datasets, including Handwritten, Caltech101, PIE and AwA, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Safe operation of the power grid requires a complete and robust control network to ensure full observability. However, redundancy measurements can create problems in expense, management, and control. The optimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) positioning problem (OPPP) is proposed to limit the number of PMUs deployed in the power grid and ensure the whole grid&#39;s observability in the meantime. A modified branch-and-bound algorithm (MBBA) to unravel the OPPP is presented. Original BBA, which uses a single search order to create a binary tree, gives only one solution to the OPPP, although more than one optimal solution exists. The proposed MBBA method consists of two different stages: the vertexes in the search tree are investigated by depth-first search (DFS) in stage 1, and the search route continues as the breadth-first search. In stage 1, the LP relaxing problems are solved by dual simplex, and in stage 2, the basic viable solution from stage 1 is used to configure the primary simplex until the optimum solution is found. OPPP is formulated as a binary decision variable MBBA model, minimizing linear objective function subject to linear matrix observability constraints. The MBBA model is unravelled using a linear integer-based external approximation scheme. IEEE test systems are used to check the feasibility of the proposed approach. Matlab software performs simulation based on a number of graph theory-based methods such as DFS, graph-theoretical method, simulated annealing, and recursive N-algorithms. These algorithms are compared to the algorithmic perspective of the proposed MBBA method. IEEE test network results confirm the validity of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis of breast cancer, the most common disease among women around the world, increases the chance of treatment and is highly important. Nuclear atypia grading in histopathological images plays an important role in the final diagnosis and grading of breast cancer. Grading images by pathologists is a time consuming and subjective task. Therefore, the existence of a computer-aided system for nuclear atypia grading is very useful and necessary. In this study, two automatic systems for grading nuclear atypia in breast cancer histopathological images based on deep learning methods are proposed. A patch-based approach is introduced due to the large size of the histopathological images and restriction of the training data. In the proposed system I, the most important patches in the image are detected first and then a three-hidden-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed and trained for feature extraction and to classify the patches individually. The proposed system II is based on a combination of the CNN for feature extraction and a two-layer Long short-term memory (LSTM) network for classification. The LSTM network is utilised to consider all patches of an image simultaneously for image grading. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed systems for automatic nuclear atypia grading and outperform the current related studies in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In the era of automatic task processing or designing complex algorithms, to analyse data, it is always pertinent to find real-life solutions using cutting-edge tools and techniques to generate insights into the data. The data-driven machine learning models are now offering more or less worthy results when they are certainly balanced in the input data sets. Imbalanced data occurs when an unequal distribution of classes occurs in the input datasets. Building a predictive model on the imbalanced data set would cause a model that appears to yield high accuracy but does not generalize well to the new data in the minority class. Now the time has come to look into the datasets which are not so-called ‘balanced’ in nature but such datasets are generally encountered frequently in a workspace. To prevent creating models with false levels of accuracy, the imbalanced data should be rearranged before creating a predictive model. Those data are, sometimes, voluminous, heterogeneous and complex in nature and generate from different autonomous sources with distributed and decentralized control. The driving force is to efficiently handle these data sets using latest tools and techniques for research and commercial insights. The present article provides different such tools and techniques, in different computing frameworks, to handle such Internet of Things and other related datasets to review common techniques for handling imbalanced data in data ecosystems and offers a comparative data modelling framework in Keras for balanced and imbalanced datasets.},

  abstract     = {Modern smart environments pose several challenges, among which the design of intelligent algorithms aimed to assist the users. When a variety of points of interest are available, for instance, trajectory recommendations are needed to suggest users the most suitable itineraries based on their interests and contextual constraints. Unfortunately, in many cases, these interests must be explicitly requested and their lack causes the so-called cold-start problem. Moreover, lengthy travelling distances and excessive crowdedness of specific points of interest make itinerary planning more difficult. To address these aspects, a multi-agent itinerary suggestion system that aims at assisting the users in an online and collaborative way is proposed. A profiling agent is responsible for the detection of groups of users whose movements are characterised by similar semantic, spatial and temporal features; then, a recommendation agent leverages contextual information and dynamically associates the current user with the trajectory clusters according to a Multi-Armed Bandit policy. Framing the trajectory recommendation as a reinforcement learning problem permits to provide high-quality suggestions while avoiding both cold-start and preference elicitation issues. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by some deployments in real-life scenarios, such as smart campuses and theme parks.},

In the area of physiological signal processing for prosthesis control, scenarios where a signal decomposition analysis are required: the wavelet decomposition (WD) has been seen to be the favoured time-frequency approach for the decomposition of non-stationary signals. From a research perspective, the WD in certain cases has allowed for a more accurate motion intent decoding process following feature extraction and classification. Despite this, there is yet to be a widespread adaptation of the WD in a practical setting due to perceived computational complexity. Here, for neuromuscular (electromyography) and brainwave (electroencephalography) signals acquired from a transhumeral amputee, a computationally efficient time domain signal decomposition method based on a series of heuristics was applied to process the acquired signals before feature extraction. The results showed an improvement in motion intent decoding prowess for the proposed time-domain-based signal decomposition across four different classifiers for both the neuromuscular and brain wave signals when compared to the WD and the raw signal.},

The results obtained are matched with the content of personality questionnaires. The Big Five personality traits provide easy differentiation for dividing personalities into different groups. Until now, the highest accuracy obtained from the results of personality prediction from the analysis of brain structure is about 70%. Although there is still no effective evidence to prove a clear relationship between brain structure and personality, the obtained results could prove helpful in understanding the basic relationship between brain structure and personality characteristics.},

  abstract     = {In a group of images, the recurrent foreground objects are considered as the key objects in the group of images. In co-saliency detection, these are described as common saliency objects. The aim is to be able to naturally guide the user&#39;s gaze to these common salient objects. By guiding the user&#39;s gaze, users can easily find these common saliency objects without interference from other information. Therefore, a method is proposed for reducing user visual attention based on co-saliency detection. Through the co-saliency detection algorithm and matting algorithm for image preprocessing, the exact position of non-common saliency objects (called Region of Interest here, i.e. ROI) in the image group can be obtained. In the attention retargeting algorithm, the internal features of the image to adjust the saliency of the ROI areas are considered. In the HSI colour space, the three components H, S, and I are adjusted separately. First, the hue distribution is constructed by the Dirac kernel function, and then the most similar hue distribution to the surrounding environment is selected as the best hue distribution of ROI areas. The S and I components can be set as the contrast difference between ROI areas and surrounding background areas according to the user&#39;s demands. Experimental results show that this method effectively reduces the ROI areas&#39; attraction to the user&#39;s visual attention. Moreover, comparing this method with other methods, the saliency adjustment effect achieved is much better, and the processed image is more natural.},

Based on the grayscale value of the target image of the infrared image and the corresponding temperature value of 180 infrared images, a G-T (Gray-Temperature ) model was established by linear least squares method, which achieved temperature inversion of each pixel of the target pig. For the different growth stages and different breeds of sows, the R-square of the all established models is greater than 0.95. The average relative error of the model inversion of the body temperature was only 0.076977%. This means that the body temperature of the sows could be detected without relying on the software.

The existing methods usually either ignore the difference from the different sampling frequencies or hardly take notice of the inherent temporal characteristics in mixed frequency data. The authors propose an innovative dual attention-based neural network for mixed frequency data (MID-DualAtt), in order to utilize the inherent temporal characteristics and select the input characteristics reasonably without losing information. According to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to use the attention mechanism to process mixed frequency data. The MID-DualAtt model uses the frequency alignment method to transform the high--frequency variables into observation vectors at low frequency, and more critical input characteristics are selected for the current prediction index by attention mechanism. The temporal characteristics are explored by the encoder-decoder with attention based on long- short-term memory networks (LSTM). The proposed MID-DualAtt has been tested in practical application, and the experimental results show that it has better prediction ability than the compared models.},

To this end, variational autoencoders, consisting of deep encoding–decoding networks, are employed. The encoder encompasses a series of convolutional layers leading to a smooth high-level abstraction of log-Mel spectrograms that characterise bird vocalisations. The decoder operates on this latent representation to generate each respective original observation. Novel species/individual detection is carried out by monitoring and thresholding the expected reconstruction probability. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed method on two different data sets, including the vocalisations of 11 North American bird species and 16 Athene noctua individuals.},

Enabling a complete security measure for such devices is a challenging task, yet necessary. Many lightweight security solutions have surfaced lately for IoT. The lightweight security protocols are unable to provide an optimum protection against prevailing powerful threats in cyber world. It is also hard to deploy any traditional security protocol on resource-constrained IoT devices. Software-defined networking introduces a centralized control in computer networks. SDN has a programmable approach towards networking that decouples control and data planes. An SDN-based intrusion detection system is proposed which uses deep learning classifier for detection of anomalies in IoT.

A majority of the real-world time-series problems have non-stationary characteristics that make the understanding of trend and seasonality difficult. The applicability of the popular deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators for non-stationary TSF is studied. The following DNN models are evaluated: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM-RNN) and RNN with Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU-RNN). These DNN methods have been evaluated over 10 popular Indian financial stocks data. Further, the performance evaluation of these DNNs has been carried out in multiple independent runs for two settings of forecasting: (1) single-step forecasting, and (2) multi-step forecasting. These DNN methods show convincing performance for single-step forecasting (one-day ahead forecast). For the multi-step forecasting (multiple days ahead forecast), the methods for different forecast periods are evaluated. The performance of these methods demonstrates that long forecast periods have an adverse effect on performance.},

Recently, many variants of the convolution neural network (CNN) have been introduced to relation extraction for the extracting of features—the quality of the neural network model directly affects the final quality of relation extraction. However, the traditional convolution network uses a fixed convolution kernel, so it is difficult to choose the size of the convolution kernel dynamically, which results in networks with weak representation ability. To address this, a novel CNN is designed with selective kernel networks and multigranularity. In the process of feature extraction, the model can adaptively select the size of the convolution kernel, that is, give more weight to the appropriate convolution kernel. It is then combined with multigranularity convolution to obtain more abundant semantic information. Finally, a new pooling method is designed to obtain more comprehensive information and improve model performance. Experimental results indicate that this method is effective without excessively deep network layers, and it also outperforms several competitive baseline methods.},

In the testing stage, first the cosine similarities between the CCF and IID of the test signal and templates are calculated in all features and frequency bands. Then, the direction likelihood can be obtained by weighting the similarities. Finally, the direction with maximum likelihood is specified as the direction of the sound source.

  abstract     = {The data from event cameras not only portray contours of moving objects but also contain motion information inherently. Herein, motion information can be used in event-based and frame-based object trackers to ease the challenges of occluded objects and data association, respectively. In the event-based tracker, events within a short interval are accumulated. Within the interval, the histogram of local time measurements (or ‘motion histogram’) is proposed as the feature to describe the target and candidate regions. Then the mean-shift tracking approach is used by shifting the tracker towards similarity maximisation on motion histograms between target and candidate regions. As for the frame-based tracker, given the assumption that a single object moves at a constant velocity on the image plane, the distribution of local timestamps is modelled, followed by which object-level velocities are obtained from parameter estimation. We then build a Kalman-based ensemble, in which object-level velocities are deemed as an additional measurement on top of object detection results. Experiments have been conducted to measure the performance of proposed trackers based on our self-collected data. Thanks to the assistance from motion information, the event-based tracker successfully differentiates partially overlapped objects with distinct motion profiles; The inter-frame tracker avoids data association failure on fast-moving objects and leads to fast convergence on object velocity estimation.},

  abstract     = {Consciousness is one of the unique features of creatures, and is also the root of biological intelligence. Up to now, all machines and robots haven’t had consciousness. Then, will the artificial intelligence (AI) be conscious? Will robots have real intelligence without consciousness? The most primitive consciousness is the perception and expression of self-existence. In order to perceive the existence of the concept of ‘I’, a creature must first have a perceivable boundary such as skin to separate ‘I’ from ‘non-I’. For robots, to have the self-awareness, they also need to be wrapped by a similar sensory membrane. Nowadays, as intelligent tools, AI systems should also be regarded as the external extension of human intelligence. These tools are unconscious. The development of AI shows that intelligence can exist without consciousness. When human beings enter into the era of life intelligence from AI, it is not the AI became conscious, but that conscious lives will have strong AI. Therefore, it becomes more necessary to be careful on applying AI to living creatures, even to those lower-level animals with only consciousness. The subversive revolution of such application may produce more careful thinking.},

It is a very tedious task for clinicians to monitor the entire sleep durations of the subjects and analyse the sleep staging in traditional and manual laboratory environmental methods. For the purpose of accurate diagnosis of different sleep disorders, we have considered the automated analysis of sleep epochs, which were collected from the subjects during sleep time. The complete process of an automated approach of sleep stages’ classification is majorly executed through four steps: pre-processing the raw signals, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In this study, we have extracted 12 statistical properties from input signals. The proposed models are tested in three different combinations of features sets. In the first experiment, the feature set contained all the 12 features. The second and third experiments were conducted with the nine and five best features. The patient records come from the ISRUC-Sleep database. The highest classification accuracy was achieved for sleep staging through combinations with the five feature set. From the categories of the subjects, the reported accuracy results were found to exceed above 90%. As per the outcome from the proposed system the random forest classification techniques achieved best accuracy incomparable to that of the other two classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Many organizations around the world use cloud computing Testing as Service (Taas) for their services. Cloud computing is principally based on the idea of on-demand delivery of computation, storage, applications, and additional resources. It depends on delivering user services through Internet connectivity. In addition, it uses a pay-as-you-go business design to deliver user services. It offers some essential characteristics including on-demand service, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, virtualization, and measured services. There are various types of virtualization, such as full virtualization, para -virtualization, emulation, OS virtualization, and application virtualization. Resource scheduling in Taas is among the most challenging jobs in resource allocation to mandatory tasks/jobs based on the required quality of applications and projects. Because of the cloud environment, uncertainty, and perhaps heterogeneity, resource allocation cannot be addressed with prevailing policies. This situation remains a significant concern for the majority of cloud providers, as they face challenges in selecting the correct resource scheduling algorithm for a particular workload. The authors use the emergent artificial intelligence algorithms deep RM2, deep reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning for Taas cloud scheduling to resolve the issue of resource scheduling in cloud Taas.},

The proposed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) uses Gaussian–Hermite moments as the low-level features. Later these features are compressed with principal component analysis. The compressed feature set is multiplied with the weight matrix array, which has the same size as the feature vector. Hybrid firefly and grey wolf optimization (FAGWO) is used to prevent the premature convergence of optimization in the firefly algorithm. The retrieval of images in CBIR is carried out in an OpenCV python environment with K-nearest neighbours and random forest algorithm classifiers. The fitness function for FAGWO is the accuracy of the classifier. The FAGWO algorithm derives the optimum weights from a randomly generated initial population. When these optimized weights are applied, the proposed algorithm shows better precision/recall and efficiency than other techniques such as exact legendre moments, Region-based image retrieval, K-means clustering ​and Color descriptor wavelet-based texture descriptor retrieval technique. In terms of optimization, hybrid FAGWO outperformed various optimization techniques (when used alone) like Particle Swarm Optmization, Genetic Algorithm, Grey-Wolf Optimization and FireFly algorithm.},

Some complex operations require assistant surgeon to assist with holding the endoscope. To address the above problems, the authors design a remote centre of motion based nasal robot, and propose a voice-based robot control method. First, through the operation space analysis of nasal surgery, the design scheme of the robot based on RCM mechanism is proposed. On this basis, the design parameters of the robot are analysed to complete the entire design of robot. Then, considering that the surgeon&#39;s hands are occupied by surgical instruments during complex surgical operations, a voice-based robot control method is proposed. This method obtains direction instructions from surgeons by analysing the movement of the endoscopic image. Afterward, a commercial speech recognition interface is used to realise the offline grammar controlwords lib compatible with both Chinese and English, and the overall strategy of robot control is proposed. Finally, an experimental platform for virtual robot control is established, and the voice-based robot control experiment is performed. The results show that the proposed voice-based control method is feasible, and it provides guidance for the subsequent development and control of the actual robot system.},

Based on the internal structure of the set and to find the degree of the discrimination between the pairs of the CHFSs, the generalized distance measures and modified generalized distance measures are defined. Several properties and their relationship between them are derived in detail. Also, several cases of the proposed measures are exposed which reduce them to the existing studies. Furthermore, based on these proposed measures, a decision-making approach is established under the uncertain environment and several numerical examples are given to examine the feasibility and validity of the explored measures.

In recent years, the advantages of combining skeleton data and deep learning have been gradually demonstrated, many impressive methods have been proposed, especially GCN-based methods. In this survey, we first introduce the development process of 3D skeleton-data action recognition and the classification of graph convolutional network, then introduce the commonly used NTU RGB + D and NTU RGB + D 120 datasets. Finally, a detailed review of existing variants of three mainstream technologies is provided based on deep learning and their performance was compared from three dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to integrate the research of GCN-based method and its various evolutionary methods. Comparative investigation of existing variants of research in action-recognition task from different perspectives is made, a generic framework is described, state-of-the-art practices are summarized, and the emerging trends of this topic are explored.},

However, the existing word embedding methods mostly represent each word as a single vector, without considering the homonymy and polysemy of the word; thus, their performances are limited. In order to address this problem, an effective topical word embedding (TWE)-based WSD method, named TWE-WSD, is proposed, which integrates Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and word embedding. Instead of generating a single word vector (WV) for each word, TWE-WSD generates a topical WV for each word under each topic. Effective integrating strategies are designed to obtain high quality contextual vectors. Extensive experiments on SemEval-2013 and SemEval-2015 for English all-words tasks showed that TWE-WSD outperforms other state-of-the-art WSD methods, especially on nouns.},

A two-branch network with pyramid-based local and spatial attention global feature learning (PSA) is proposed for vehicle re-identification to solve this issue. Specifically, one branch learns local features at different scales by building pyramid from coarse to fine and the other branch learns attentive global features by using spatial attention module. Subsequently, pooling operation by using global maximum pooling (GMP) for local features and global average pooling (GAP) for global feature is performed. Finally, local feature vectors and global feature vector extracted from the last pooling layer, respectively, are employed for identity re-identification.

As a consequence, deep learning is being extensively used in most of the recent day-to-day applications. However, efficient deep learning systems can be jeopardised by using crafted adversarial samples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model to misclassify the output. In recent times, different types of adversaries based on their threat model leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise a deep learning system where adversaries have high incentives. Hence, it is extremely important to provide robustness to deep learning algorithms against these adversaries. However, there are only a few strong countermeasures which can be used in all types of attack scenarios to design a robust deep learning system.

In this regard, we propose a machine learning (ML) assisted tool that can be used in the context of a differential fault attack. In particular, finding the exact fault location by analysing the output difference (typically the XOR of the nonfaulty and the faulty ciphertexts) is somewhat nontrivial. During the literature survey, we notice that the Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient dominantly is used for this purpose, and has almost become the defacto standard. While this method can yield good accuracy for certain cases, we argue that an ML-based method is more powerful in all the situations we experiment with. We substantiate our claim by showing the relative performances (we choose the commonly used multilayer perceptron as our ML tool) with two variants of Grain-128a (a stream cipher, and a stream cipher with authentication), the lightweight stream cipher LIZARD and the lightweight block cipher SIMON-32 (where the faults are injected at the fifth last rounds). Our results demonstrate that a common ML tool can outperform the correlation with the same training/testing data. We believe that our work extends the state-of-the-art by showing how traditional cryptographic methods can be replaced by a more powerful ML tool.},

In this survey article, we consider the most relevant attacks to extract the architecture of CNNs. We also categorize SCAs, depending on access with respect to the victim: physical, local, or remote. Attacks targeting the architecture via local SCAs are most common. As of today, physical access seems necessary to retrieve the weights of an NN.
