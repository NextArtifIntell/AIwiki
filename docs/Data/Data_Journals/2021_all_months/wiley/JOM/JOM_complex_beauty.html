  abstract     = {Modern slavery is used to describe forms of coercive labor exploitation that affect more than 40 million persons globally. Such practices are difficult to identify given they exist in the informal economy, and involve vulnerable individuals. Addressing modern slavery by organizations requires awareness of its context and complexities. While corporations have increasingly sought to manage modern slavery risk in their supply chains, their understanding of what modern slavery is and what should be managed remains limited. We argue a key problem with firms’ efforts to manage modern slavery risk is that it is a psychologically distant concept for them. We apply construal level theory to explore how organizations’ psychological distance from modern slavery risk affects their management of risk. We interviewed purchasing executives at 41 global organizations in Australia, Finland, and the U.S and identified four approaches to managing modern slavery risk at different levels of psychological distance. We also identified that conflicts between organizations&#39; approaches to risk and what they identify in their operating environment, precedes important construal shifts that help to improve organizational understanding of labor-related risk. We highlight ways that organizations&#39; understanding of modern slavery risk plays a role in their governance of such risk in supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Research on service center routing has largely assumed either fully codified automated routing, rational routing agents who can optimally route calls, or both. In practice, however, many routing scenarios are not fully codifiable, and human routing agents will likely exhibit biases in their routing decisions. In this paper, we explore the presence of behavioral inertia in service center routing. Inertia in this context is the propensity for routing agents to route issues more frequently to other agents with whom they have experience, rather than optimally routing those issues. We leveraged a unique dataset of more than 70,000 routing decisions in a complex service operations context to examine the presence of inertia and associated performance implications. We find that, overall, inertia hurts performance, but in certain situations can be beneficial. Inertia increases the probability of issue resolution when agents exhibit inertial behavior in routing to other agents with high expertise, and inertia positively impacts (decreases) service time for particularly difficult, complex customer issues. This study contributes to research in service center operations by studying a previously unexplored phenomenon of inertia in routing by human agents and provides valuable insights to practitioners who manage service centers.},

  abstract     = {Precarious work, or employment that is associated with temporary contracts, low earnings and limited or no employee representation, is on the rise. From an operations perspective, these practices should enable flexibility and reduce costs. However, from the perspective of most other social sciences, precarious work harms workers and should harm firm performance. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance implications of precarious work. We collected survey data in the UK from multiple respondents (operations and human resource managers) along with secondary data to explore how the use of precarious work affects a company&#39;s financial, operational and occupational health &amp; safety performance. The results were mixed. Precarious work did not have a significant influence on occupational health &amp; safety performance and had a negative relationship with cost performance. We also established an inverted u-shaped relationship between precarious work and flexibility and financial performance; low levels of precarious work improve flexibility and financial performance and high levels of precarious work harm both. Finally, we explored if high-performance work practices could moderate these relationships, but the results were mostly insignificant. The results suggest that firms only benefit from relatively low levels of adoption of precarious work.},

We build on normal accident theory (NAT), a multilevel theory describing the relationship between a firm&#39;s latent conditions (systemic managerial, technology, and social factors) and human errors. Latent conditions can have the unintended consequence of intensifying the impact of a human error, thus, we hypothesize a moderating effect of latent conditions on the relationship between errors and delivery delays. Hypotheses are tested using archival shipment data provided by a Fortune 500 company and archival carrier violations data. A multilevel design, with 299,399 shipments (level 1) nested within 97 carriers (level 2), was tested using mixed effects regression modeling. The results indicated that both dispatcher and driver errors were related to the probability of a late delivery, and that dispatcher errors were associated with longer delays. The moderating effects of several carrier latent conditions were significant and positive, indicating that both types of errors were more strongly associated with the likelihood of late delivery and that dispatcher errors were associated with longer delays when moderated by carrier latent conditions. The results are discussed from the perspective of NAT and technology management, developing prescriptions, and suggesting opportunities for future research.},

However, our understanding of what happens to these relief goods and services after they are delivered is quite limited. Using a case study of the Za&#39;atari refugee camp in Jordan, we develop a theory of informal supply networks , whereby we uncover how refugee-led, informal supply networks emerge in the camp. We find that these supply networks are an aggregate of predominantly illicit—yet legitimate—channels and social relationships that support the economic exchange of goods and services between distinct actors or actor groups. We not only identify the cultural conventions and behavioral codes that govern ties between refugees—and between refugees and relief-related actors—but also define how these networks are configured. Considering these findings, we contend that the informal economic activities emanating from the refugee camp benefit the host community and enhance the resilience of the informal supply networks. As informal economic activities also improve the quality of life in the camp, camp authorities and host country governments should attend to informal activities as they create rules and policies for refugee resettlement.},

The present study, involving one of the leading electronics distributors in the world, aims to improve prediction accuracy under high demand volatility for procurement managers to make better inventory decisions. In response to requests for an integrated forecasting methodology, we undertook an iterative process based on three guiding principles— data pooling , theory-informed feature engineering , and ensemble-based machine learning . The resulting framework managed to improve forecast accuracy significantly and is applicable to a broad range of situations. We present reflections and insights derived abductively through engagement with managers in this problem situation. This “problem-driven” process corresponds to intervention as a research strategy that can foster theoretical and methodological innovations in OM. Our contribution goes beyond the development of the prediction framework as it elucidates ways OM researchers could leverage theoretical foundations to inform feature derivation and model construction. We posit that this work points to a way forward to the combination of OM principles with the emerging innovations in data science and artificial intelligence.},

Still, large-scale empirical evidence on this complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain transparency in the context of the collective public environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firm&#39;s customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency.},

In this article, we suggest that this stems from an incomplete understanding and specification of how arguments are structured. Most importantly, in addition to empirical data, a generalized conclusion hinges on the application of various rules and principles of reasoning that British philosopher Stephen Toulmin labeled warrants . In this article, we apply Toulmin&#39;s model of argument structure to empirical management research by examining in particular the roles of four types of warrants: theoretical, inferential, procedural, and contextual. Based on our analysis, we suggest that making warrants and their backings explicit paves the way toward a more comprehensive understanding of how arguments are structured and how claims are justified. Importantly, an examination of warrants reveals that the choices researchers make are not limited to matters such as choosing the research topic or a particular research design, but they also extend to how we produce our claims. If we wish to understand argument structure, we must understand these choices.},

Using longitudinal data from 9,765 enterprise resource planning (ERP) system projects executed by a software services organization, we find that managers&#39; breadth of experience has a U-shaped impact on project completion time. We also find that while we can identify an optimal level of breadth of experience that minimizes project completion time on the U-curve, this optimal level becomes lower (the U-curve shifts to the left) as project complexity increases. As project complexity decreases, the U-curve flattens and tends to become monotonically decreasing, signifying that diseconomies from project managers&#39; breadth of experience are less apparent in simpler projects. From a practical standpoint, these findings suggest that project managers&#39; breadth of experience is a critical driver of project performance that should be a key consideration in the selection of managers to lead knowledge work, especially for complex projects.},

Little is known about how this innovation approach compares to firms focusing on same domain NPI, that is, manufacturers launching new goods and service firms introducing new services. This research investigates these innovation approaches at the firm level using a set of archival data for the period 2006–2008, which comprises 16,735 manufacturing and service firms from 11 European countries. Our results show no statistical difference in innovation revenue performance between same and different domain NPIs. Both categories of firms gained about 13–14\% higher performance relative to those firms that reported ongoing innovation activities but did not introduce any innovation. Our findings also show firms that pursued both same and different domain NPIs (a dual innovation approach) achieved a higher innovation revenue performance (about 4\% higher relative to firms pursuing same or different domain NPI). Despite the higher performance, we find that the interaction effect of same and different domain NPIs on firm innovation revenue is substitutive . Our results are largely consistent across multiple robustness checks: (a) a different dataset collected for the period 2008–2010 to replicate the findings, (b) alternative dependent variables, (c) multiple endogeneity checks, and (d) different estimation approaches. Finally, post-hoc analyses show the substitution effect is (i) stronger for small firms, (ii) stronger for firms with internal R&amp;D, and (iii) not significantly different for firms with or without external R&amp;D. Overall, these findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the opportunity and tension firms face in introducing innovations in same and different domain activities.},

  abstract     = {A complex assembled electronic product (CAEP), such as a modern television (TV), can be produced in a variety of design configurations using different combinations of software and hardware components that are arranged together in a hierarchy of technical subsystems within a defined product architecture. We examine the lifecycle of individual components that make up a CAEP to better understand why its dominant design configuration includes specific components from among the (often many) competing alternatives. The emergence of the dominant design configuration of a product has long-term implications on the operational efficiency of a firm&#39;s product assembly line and its component selection strategy. We test hypotheses that explain both the inclusion of a component in the dominant design configuration of a CAEP, and its longevity to remain in the product market over the lifecycle of the CAEP using three key factors: (a) pleiotropy , or the number of functions supported by the component, (b) the nature of standards used by the component ( open vs. closed ), and (c) the source of innovation of the component ( exogenous vs. endogenous to the industry). We empirically test our hypotheses using a longitudinal data set of 2830 TV models spanning 15 years (2002–2016). The results show that components that have higher pleiotropy and that are supported by open standards not only have a higher chance of being selected into the dominant design configuration of TV, but also remain in the TV market for a longer time. Specifically, every additional functionality associated with a component increases its likelihood of entering the dominant design configuration by approximately three times, and its longevity by about 2 years. Similarly, a component supported by an open standard is approximately four times more likely to be part of the dominant design configuration compared with a component supported by a closed standard, and it remains in the TV market for approximately an additional 2 years. In addition, components developed through endogenous innovation efforts were nearly five times more likely to enter the dominant design configuration of TV. Their longevity, however, was not significantly different from that of components sourced exogenously. Building on these results, we discuss the implications for product management of CAEP and for further research to examine innovation in CAEPs.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates follower firms&#39; make–buy sourcing choices and sequences in response to an architectural innovation by an innovator. We argue that the dynamic trade-offs among knowledge acquisition, knowledge transformation, and transaction cost reduction underlie the performance impacts of make–buy sourcing choices and sequences across the architectural innovation life cycle. Using the data gathered from the gear-shifting market of the U.S. bicycle industry, we empirically demonstrate that “buy” is a superior sourcing choice before key market-winner features (i.e., dominant design) have emerged. After that, “make” becomes a superior choice. We then demonstrate that the “buy-to-make” sourcing sequence is associated with superior technological and financial performances in the postdominant design phase of the architectural innovation period, as well as with greater firm survival during the market shakeout in the later period of modular standardization. The theoretical and managerial implications of our findings are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Relying on firms to self-report information is an information-gathering mechanism that often results in biased measures due to the incentives of the reporting firms. What is less commonly understood is that using self-reported information for decision-making results in endogenous selection bias, which creates spurious associations between the measure being reported and factors that influence reporting. Thus, conditioning on self-reported information can lead to inaccurate evaluations of firms and bias predictions of future performance, even when the self-reported measure is not intentionally misrepresented. We examine endogenous selection bias in self-reporting regimes using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We illustrate the problem using data from a policy change by the U.S. Department of Transportation that allowed firms to report not-at-fault for accidents. We find that large for-hire firms are much more likely to report not-at-fault for accidents—over 40 times more likely than independent drivers—even after controlling for time, location, and weather. When comparing independent drivers with large firms, the reporting disparities make large firms appear 25\% safer when using at-fault accidents versus all accidents while providing no improvement in predicting future accidents. This study highlights the consequences of poorly designed information-gathering mechanisms and the usefulness of DAGs for understanding causality in supply chain research.},

  abstract     = {Improving flow is a core Operations Management theme that is set to become even more important following contemporary developments in manufacturing, such as smart products and digital encapsulation that enable new control concepts such as multi-agent holonic control. But, companies often struggle to realize flow improvements in practice, both with and without new technologies. While the literature agrees on the importance of flow, a structured and independent process that supports managers in identifying the root causes of why flow items wait in inventories instead of being processed is missing. Managers often use a single production management concept, such as lean production or the theory of constraints, when they seek to understand the reasons for a flow problem, which may lead to misdirected and unsuccessful interventions. In response, we use design science to develop a comprehensive approach to diagnosing flow problems that is independent from any production management concept. This diagnosis process results from successive iterations with five companies and supports the selection of appropriate analytical models and flow improvement solutions. It enables an organization to widen the focus of its flow improvement actions beyond the scope of a singular production management concept and complements the application of recent advances in technology, allowing smart products to quickly interpret what is happening in a location without first simulating and analyzing the whole system. Furthermore, the study expands buffer theories by showing that buffers have an internal hierarchy and can be absorbed by other buffers, while enhancing other theories related to coordination, material flow control, and lean improvement.},

Using order-level data from an online fashion retailer in Sweden, we investigate the introduction of free returns for customers in Denmark starting November 1, 2017, but not for customers in Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Germany, and the rest of Europe (the control group). Using difference-in-differences, with and without sample matching, the introduction of free returns increased the order bill by 54.95 Swedish Krona (SEK) (9.15\%), product variety per order by 0.057 (8.74\%), gross margin per order by 29.90 SEK (9.71\%), and returns by 0.195 items per order (7.86\%). This likelihood of increased returns was generally similar across different product categories. The findings are robust to parallel trends, event studies, placebo effects, alternative control groups (with Scandinavian countries, Sweden and Norway), country-time trends, and correlations between outcome variables. Based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, the cost of offering free returns is greater than the increase in gross profit driven by free returns. Though our results show that free returns may not be of short-term benefit, retailers must also consider the long-term strategic implications of free returns.},

We used a multi-method research design to study how these drivers uniquely influence supplier responsibility in an emerging-country context. An in-depth case study with Philips Lighting and 10 of its Chinese suppliers reveals causal inferences that link stakeholder and relational drivers with each responsibility dimension (environmental vs. social). Audit and survey data from Philips Lighting&#39;s 134 Chinese suppliers, complemented with four archival databases, bolster these inferences. Overall, the results show that supplier environmental responsibility can be fostered through both stakeholder pressures and relational drivers; whereas, supplier social responsibility is much harder to address. The integrated methods offer a fuller, more comprehensive understanding of the specifics of supplier responsibility in China and also provide recommendations for MNCs that seek to improve it.},

Thus, we investigate what prompts operations managers to commit to practice adoption. We draw on the theory of planned behavior to explore the cognitive foundations of 76 operations managers&#39; commitment to new operational practices. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we identify three belief configurations associated with high levels of commitment—“the Follower,” “the Pragmatist,” and “the Reformer.” We contribute a behavioral operations perspective to the literature on practice adoption by providing an individual-level and configurational view of managerial commitment to change.},

Innovation sourcing managers who sponsor innovation contests seek to maximize crowd size to increase the chance of creative outcomes. One strategy they use is to set an award size. Although many studies have examined the influence of award size on crowd size in innovation contests, the empirical findings are inconsistent and suggest further empirical study is needed. Drawing from expectancy-value theory, we propose that award size and crowd size are related to one another in the form of an inverted U-shape, namely that moderate awards maximize crowd size. Additional propositions cover contingencies around the number of awards and task difficulty of an innovation contest. Based on data representing 5342 programming innovation contests, our empirical analyses confirm the inverted U-shaped relationship and indicate that the number of awards and task difficulty steepen the inverted U-shaped relationship. These results add nuanced, theoretical understanding of how innovation contests work. The findings indicate that innovation sourcing managers should set award sizes at moderate levels, and that they should experiment with slightly larger or smaller awards to see if it impacts crowd size in their context.},

This technical note explores this issue by describing an engagement by the research team with a large consumer packaged-goods company within their cosmetics supply chain during the launch of a new product family. The company was experiencing high supply–demand mismatch costs that they attributed to their supply chain that was designed to emphasize efficiency over responsiveness. We analyzed the appropriateness of the supply-chain design through the lens of theory and concluded that the efficient design was in fact a good match for the product. A simulation model allowed us to organize available data and identify the root cause of the mismatch costs. Results from the simulation showed that the mismatch costs stemmed primarily from a failure to deploy small but important responsiveness opportunities: Because the supply chain was designated as efficient, responsiveness was ignored, and this substantially increased mismatches. Mismatches also occurred because decision makers failed to distinguish between delivery and decision lead time.},

  abstract     = {The study of bargaining power and its role in negotiations has a long history in operations management research. Much of this research has involved buyer–supplier exchanges and has often hinged on the assumption that powerful firms negotiate to wield (fully) their power for favorable outcomes. Yet, it is unclear to what extent firms transform their potential power into realized power. Building on insights grounded in resource dependence theory and literature on competitive dynamics and organization design, we theorize that structural factors (i.e., decentralization, spheres of influence, and mutual dependence) constrain firms from fully realizing their potential power. In doing so, we center on a more nuanced context—multimarket buyer–supplier exchanges, wherein buyers and suppliers handle multiple exchanges across different product markets. We use two controlled negotiation experiments to test our hypotheses. Our results show that in multimarket exchanges, three key factors (and how they sometimes interact) constrain power use. These results offer boundary conditions to extant theory. Most profoundly, our results reveal that centralization (traditionally viewed as a structural lever to enhance power use) alone does not affect power use but has distinct effects conditional on other factors—countering theory and challenging best practices in industry.},

In an effort to help build a business case for SMA, this research explores the effect of SMA disclosures on consumers&#39; attitude toward the firm and purchase intention. In so doing, we also examine how consumer attitude and purchase intention vary as a function of SMA disclosure characteristics. The results of three behavioral studies reveal more positive consumer attitude and higher purchase intention when a firm discloses that its supplier monitoring extends to lower-tier suppliers (SMA depth) and the firm monitors its lower-tier suppliers directly rather than relying on its first-tier suppliers or third parties to do so (lower-tier supplier monitoring mechanism). Greater SMA breadth—monitoring both suppliers&#39; social and environmental activities—in turn, is not associated with more positive consumer attitude and higher purchase intention. Further, attitude toward the firm mediates the relationship between SMA disclosure characteristics and purchase intention. Collectively, these findings underline that consumers value firms&#39; SMA and point toward an economic rationale for a firm&#39;s transparency regarding its supplier monitoring efforts.},

We conducted an exploratory, multiple-case study of western subunits operating in China to investigate whether managers of foreign subunits in a host country perceive political risk; and if so, how they adapt their SC/OM strategic choices to reduce its impact on their subunits. Our empirical findings suggest that variations in political risk perceptions create different political legitimacy goals that subunits attempt to meet by adapting their supplier development strategies. We induct a process model and identify three archetypes of supplier development strategy—self-centered, collaborative, and voluntary—adopted by subunits to shape their legitimacy and mitigate political risk. We contribute to the SC/OM literature by theorizing SC/OM managers&#39; perceived political risk, showing how foreign subunits may use supplier development to influence how the host government views them, and by complementing traditional “corporate” legitimacy-seeking strategies with new “SC/OM” legitimacy-seeking strategies.},

We apply the framework to the context of free-floating carsharing—a novel mobility service that is an example of data-rich smart city services. Through data exploration, we identify a novel preventive user-based relocation policy and provide an ex-ante assessment regarding the feasibility of its implementation. We discuss practical implications of our approach and results for shared-mobility providers as well as the relationship between data science and operations management research.},

  abstract     = {Information leakages—the unauthorized sharing of an organization&#39;s information with another organization—are a growing concern in today&#39;s supply chains, but remain relatively underexplored. Drawing on attribution theory and observational learning, our research investigates inter-organizational information leakages from a network perspective. We assess the spillover effects of opportunistic and inadvertent information leakages between an OFFENDER organization and a VICTIM organization on the relationship between the OFFENDER and a nonpartisan OBSERVER . We consider the roles of integrity- and ability-based trust, as well as operational similarity between the organizations. We conducted scenario-based experiments with 181 sales practitioners recruited via MTurk and supplemented those results with post hoc interviews. Our results show clear spillover effects: The OBSERVER &#39;s willingness to share information with the OFFENDER decreases significantly after any type of information leakage between the OFFENDER and the VICTIM, but more so for opportunistic leakages. Integrity-based trust mediates the relationship between intentionality and information sharing willingness. We also find indications of an unexpected collateral damage effect in that to some extent, both trust dimensions decrease in both forms of information leakage. Further, for opportunistic information leakages, the OBSERVER &#39;s willingness to share information with the OFFENDER decreases more when OBSERVER and VICTIM are operationally similar.},

That article was written as a response to a number of behavioral research submissions to JOM , each dealing with interesting topics but viewed by the editors to possess poor design choices at inception. While the Lonati et al.

Questions have also arisen concerning how to apply these concepts in operations management research.

  abstract     = {Firms’ commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be a crucial factor in supply chain partnerships. This study examines the effect of CSR orientation incongruence on relationship performance. Drawing on the congruence theory literature, we posit that a firm&#39;s relationship performance may suffer when there is incongruence between the levels of CSR orientations of supply chain partners. Furthermore, we adopt a network perspective and argue that certain characteristics of a firm&#39;s egocentric social network (i.e., network centrality and network diversity) may moderate the linkage between CSR orientation incongruence and relationship performance. Our empirical study, which is based on dyadic data, indeed reveals that a firm&#39;s relationship performance is adversely affected when the firm and its major supply partner have incongruent levels of CSR orientations. Such a negative effect is moderated by the firm&#39;s egocentric social network. Specifically, the negative impact of incongruent CSR orientation is heightened if the firm occupies a central position in the egocentric network. Network diversity, however, plays a contrasting role as a firm&#39;s relationship performance may be less susceptible to incongruent CSR orientations when there is access to a diverse social network.},

Adopting an intervention-based research (IBR) framework and based on our actions to overcome challenges in implementation and sustainment of the redesign, we revise the current understanding of organizational learning theory. Follow-up observations after our intervention show that the process improvements at the hospital are sustained. We supplement the IBR with quantitative analyses and provide evidence of improvements in health outcomes and satisfaction levels of patients associated with the redesign. These analyses are based on difference-in-difference estimations using data from transplant patients, including a control group from other transplant units. Overall, our research specifies a methodology for implementing sustainable process improvements, particularly in high interaction service environments such as healthcare delivery, and identifies refinements to organizational learning theory, especially for such environments.},

We reviewed the literature, first ad hoc then systematically, to investigate the extent to which studies have covered the determination of process improvements&#39; economic value in manufacturing companies postimplementation, and how such assessments are conducted. The results suggest that retrospective value determinations at the plant level are exceedingly rare. In fact, only 0.09\% of 35,968 scholarly articles produced on process improvement in the period 1980–2020 have that focus. Since expenditures on process improvement have alternative uses, organizations should have at their disposal benefit determination frameworks so that financially efficient decisions can be made.

Drawing on theory from criminology regarding the concept of offense displacement, we explain why the benefits from increased monitoring may be mitigated if agents subsequently increase other types of illicit acts not subject to greater monitoring. We investigate this possibility by examining how a mandate requiring millions of truck drivers to adopt electronic logging devices to record their working hours affected different safety behaviors and outcomes. Using data from millions of driver inspections and crash counts before and after the mandate and a differences-in-differences identification strategy, we find greater monitoring due to the mandate achieved its first-order effect of reducing the frequency that drivers were in non-compliance with work hour rules (the monitored dimension). However, drivers for small firms that were most affected by the mandate also appear to have increased their frequency of unsafe driving (e.g., speeding). We also find that crash counts for small firms did not fall relative to large firms, and may have increased. These results call into question whether increased electronic monitoring has improved safety in this industry.},

The field problem of the case airline was to improve departure reliability for long-haul aircraft without increasing maintenance resources, and without using backup aircraft. Frontlog scheduling is the purposeful introduction of over-maintenance as a buffer of maintenance tasks that can be opportunistically postponed. A detailed simulation of the solution introduced in the airline&#39;s operations indicates a performance frontier shift, concurrently improving departure reliability, and reducing maintenance cost. We position the novel practice in operations and maintenance management literature, arguing that the frontlog creates a new type of time buffer, available in contexts where capacity serves predictable as well as unpredictable demand. Further theoretical elaboration leads us to reconceptualize buffer management along time and capacity dimensions, reducing inventory to a special case of time buffering.},

In this manuscript, I encourage more replications. However, I also assume that such studies will remain rare. Therefore, it is argued that the replication crisis in OSCM can be partially addressed by conducting theory testing and refining research in a more systematic fashion that acknowledges researchers&#39; and journals&#39; incentives to publish new knowledge, while also efficiently helping to ensure that the foundations of that new knowledge are generalizable and not based on idiosyncratic, spurious, or questionable findings. Hence, I focus on ways to conduct a replication within a larger theory testing or refining study in a manner that makes it possible to explain the results, even if they differ from past research. This is achieved via enhanced transparency, designing research to include tests of nomological validity and account for the possibility that the results will not replicate, and more careful consideration of controls. The payoff from this investment in designing replication logic into theory testing and refining research would be that in the course of conducting normal science, we would be able to make much stronger claims about the veracity of our theories, facts, and predictions.},

While personalizing products leads to benefits for firms, it also requires significant resources, calling into question the financial efficacy of this practice. This situation is especially salient in the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs are personalized to individuals. This type of medicine is expected to account for approximately 50\% of drug spending in the U.S. market by 2022; however, the rising costs of producing and delivering such medications make their viability uncertain. In this study, we present a framework that conceptualizes a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship between product personalization and financial performance. We further investigate the role of supply-chain disintermediation in enhancing the benefits of personalization. Analysis of data from the pharmaceutical industry confirms that product personalization improves financial performance only up to a point, beyond which firms experience negative performance effects. Furthermore, supply-chain disintermediation moderates this relationship such that the inverted U-shape is steeper with increasing disintermediation levels. Together, these findings provide important guidelines for managers formulating their firms’ product personalization strategies.},

Our objective is to complement this by examining contractual challenges in the context of bilateral dependency. Our specific empirical focus is on how Indian Railways, one of the largest railroads in the world, manages warranty claims related to engine failures. Warranty resolution is complex, because failures typically involve the simultaneous failure of several engine subsystems provided by different suppliers, giving rise to supplier performance ambiguity. Through a combination of theoretical reflection rooted in transaction cost economics and an empirical analysis of Indian Railways&#39; supply chain, we argue that in the case of bilateral dependency, “the benign approach” is more efficient than “the muscular approach,” to use Oliver Williamson&#39;s terminology. Specifically, while the latter is founded on unilateral decisions by the comparatively more powerful party, the former is based on voluntary long-term cooperation, and calls for mutual credible commitments and joint problem-solving. Additionally, we highlight that even if dependency is asymmetric at the outset, it can develop bilateral features over time. Theoretically, our research offers an enhanced understanding of trust in buyer–supplier relationships, emphasizing its organizational as opposed to personal basis.},

Using a dataset from a large supermarket chain, we estimate the product level bullwhip effect using various methods, analyze consequences of its different measurements and aggregations, and examine its impact on supply chain performance in terms of inventory ratio and stockouts. We have three major findings. (a) Bullwhip effect estimates exhibit different magnitudes dependent on how they are measured. The material bullwhip effect is greater in magnitude than the information bullwhip effect in our data, where demand correlations are sufficiently low. (b) The aggregated bullwhip effect ratios by store and by time are lower than the disaggregated bullwhip effect ratios, indicating that the aggregated bullwhip effect ratios underestimate the bullwhip effect. The aggregated bullwhip effect ratios by product are lower than the disaggregated bullwhip effect ratios, indicating the bullwhip effect is not as strong as theory predicts due to order pooling. (c) The bullwhip effect is associated with poor supply chain performance, as measured by elevated inventory ratio and stockouts. However, if the bullwhip effect is measured inaccurately, these benefits can be underestimated as much as 75\% for inventory and 25\% for stockouts.},
