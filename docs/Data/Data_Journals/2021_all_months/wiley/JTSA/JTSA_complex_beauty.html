  abstract     = {A CARMA( p , q ) process Y is a strictly stationary solution Y of the p th-order formal stochastic differential equation a ( D ) Y t = b ( D ) DL t , where L is a two-sided Lévy process, a ( z ) and b ( z ) are polynomials of degrees p and q respectively, with p &gt; q , and D denotes differentiation with respect to t . Using a state-space formulation of the defining equation, Brockwell and Lindner (2009, Stochastic Processes and their Applications 119, 2660–2681) gave necessary and sufficient conditions on L , a ( z ) and b ( z ) for the existence and uniqueness of such a stationary solution and specified the kernel g in the representation of the solution as Y t = ∫ − ∞ ∞ g ⁢ ( t − u ) d L u . If the zeros of a ( z ) all have strictly negative real parts, Y is said to be a causal function of L (or simply causal) since then Y t can be expressed in terms of the increments of L s , s ≤ t , and if the zeros of b ( z ) all have strictly negative real parts the process is said to be invertible since then the increments of L s , s ≤ t , can be expressed in terms of Y s , s ≤ t . In this article we are concerned with properties of CARMA processes for which these conditions on a and b do not necessarily hold.},

The developed theory relies on the functional dependence measure and recently developed theory for derivative processes in Dahlhaus etal. (2019, Bernoulli, 25(2), 1013–1044). We prove stationarity and ergodicity of the underlying processes and consistency for the QMLE estimator under mild conditions. Furthermore, under normality of the error term, we also establish asymptotic normality for QMLE, which then becomes MLE, at the usual rate. Finally, in our simulations we show that consistency and asymptotic normality holds for typical sample sizes.},

Semiparametric local Whittle estimation is used, where periodogram is constructed from the approximate first score, which is an inner product of the functional observation and estimated leading eigenfunction. The latter is obtained via classical functional principal component analysis. Under the restrictive condition of constancy of the memory parameter over the function support, and other conditions which include rather unprimitive ones on the first score, the estimate is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance free of any unknown parameter, facilitating inference, as in the scalar time series case. Although the primary interest lies in long-range dependence, our methods and theory are relevant to short-range dependent or negative dependent functional time series.

Motivated by Indirect Inference, we use a Monte Carlo approximation of the characteristic function based on i.i.d. simulated blocks. As a classical variance reduction technique, we propose the use of control variates for reducing the variance of this Monte Carlo approximation. These two approximations yield two new estimators that are applicable to a large class of time series processes. We show consistency and asymptotic normality of the parameter estimators under strong mixing, moment conditions, and smoothness of the simulated blocks with respect to its parameter. In a simulation study we show the good performance of these new simulation based estimators, and the superiority of the control variates based estimator for Poisson driven time series of counts.},

This behavior depends on the regularity (deterministic or non-deterministic) of the process X ( t ). In his seminal article ‘Some purely deterministic processes’ ( J. of Math. and Mech. , 6(6), 801–10, 1957), Rosenblatt has described the asymptotic behavior of the prediction error for deterministic processes in the following two cases: (i) the spectral density f of X ( t ) is continuous and vanishes on an interval, (ii) the spectral density f has a very high order contact with zero. He showed that in the case (i) the prediction error behaves exponentially, while in the case (ii), it behaves like a power as . In this article, using an approach different from the one applied in Rosenblatt&#39;s article, we describe extensions of Rosenblatt&#39;s results to broader classes of spectral densities. Examples illustrate the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {The periodogram is a widely used tool to analyze second order stationary time series. An attractive feature of the periodogram is that the expectation of the periodogram is approximately equal to the underlying spectral density of the time series. However, this is only an approximation, and it is well known that the periodogram has a finite sample bias, which can be severe in small samples. In this article, we show that the bias arises because of the finite boundary of observation in one of the discrete Fourier transforms which is used in the construction of the periodogram. Moreover, we show that by using the best linear predictors of the time series over the boundary of observation we can obtain a ‘complete periodogram’ that is an unbiased estimator of the spectral density. In practice, the ‘complete periodogram’ cannot be evaluated as the best linear predictors are unknown. We propose a method for estimating the best linear predictors and prove that the resulting ‘estimated complete periodogram’ has a smaller bias than the regular periodogram. The estimated complete periodogram and a tapered version of it are used to estimate parameters, which can be represented in terms of the integrated spectral density. We prove that the resulting estimators have a smaller bias than their regular periodogram counterparts. The proposed method is illustrated with simulations and real data.},

This article focuses on high-dimensional time series and on the different regularized estimation procedures proposed for fitting sparse VAR models to such time series. Attention is paid to the different sparsity assumptions imposed on the VAR parameters and how these sparsity assumptions are related to the particular consistency properties of the estimators established. A sparsity scheme for high-dimensional VAR models is proposed which is found to be more appropriate for the time series setting. Furthermore, it is shown that, under this sparsity setting, thresholding extends the consistency properties of regularized estimators to a wide range of matrix norms. Among other things, this enables application of the VAR parameters estimators to different problems, like forecasting or estimating the second-order characteristics of the underlying VAR process. Extensive simulations compare the finite sample behavior of the different regularized estimators proposed using a variety of performance criteria.},

To this end, three complexity-penalized criteria are considered, and a new criterion is derived by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence. The efficacy of the procedure is evaluated by means of Monte Carlo experiments. We illustrate the usefulness of the joint model selection procedure with empirical applications to the modeling of business cycles in the USA and Australia.},

Singular structural VAR models appear, for example, as solutions of rational expectation models where the number of shocks is usually smaller than the number of endogenous variables, and as an essential building block in dynamic factor models. We show that order conditions for identifiability are misleading in the singular case and we provide a rank condition for identifiability of the noise parameters. Since the Yule–Walker equations may have multiple solutions, we analyse the effect of restricting system parameters on over- and underidentification in detail and provide easily verifiable conditions.},

In this article, we extend Hansen&#39;s (2000) constant threshold regression model by allowing for a time-varying threshold which is approximated by a Fourier function. Least-square estimation of regression slopes and the time-varying threshold is proposed, and test statistics for the existence of threshold effect and threshold constancy are constructed. We also develop the asymptotic distribution theory for the time-varying threshold estimator. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed estimation and testing procedures work reasonably well in finite samples, and there is little efficiency loss by the allowance for Fourier approximation in the estimation procedure even when there is no time-varying feature in the threshold. On the contrary, the slope estimates are seriously biased when the threshold is time-varying but being treated as a constant. The model is illustrated with an empirical application to a nonlinear Taylor rule for the United States.},

This class of models includes, for example, the fractionally integrated generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) model. Our algorithm is a variation of the fast fractional difference algorithm of Jensen, A.N. and M.Ø. Nielsen (2014), Journal of Time Series Analysis 35, 428–436. It takes advantage of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in computational speed. The efficiency of the algorithm allows estimation (and simulation/bootstrapping) of ARCH( ∞ ) models, even with very large data sets and without the truncation of the filter commonly applied in the literature. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the elimination of the truncation of the filter reduces the bias of the quasi-maximum-likelihood estimators and improves out-of-sample forecasting. Our results are illustrated in two empirical examples.},

We show that when a bubble emerges early in the monitoring period, the diverging rate of the stopping time based on the CUSUM-type detector is slower than that based on the ADF-type detector, which implies that the former tends to find a bubble earlier than the latter, whereas this advantage disappears for the late emerging bubble.

  abstract     = {Vector autoregressive processes (VARs) with innovations having a singular covariance matrix (in short singular VARs) appear naturally in the context of dynamic factor models. Estimating such a VAR is problematic, because the solution of the corresponding equation systems is numerically unstable. For example, if we overestimate the order of the VAR, then the singularity of the innovations renders the Yule-Walker equation system singular as well. We are going to show that this has a severe impact on accuracy of predictions. While the asymptotic rate of the mean square prediction error is not impacted by this problem, the finite sample behaviour is severely suffering. This effect will be reinforced, if the predictor variables are not coming from the stationary distribution of the process, but contain additional noise. Again, this happens to be the case in context of dynamic factor models. We will explain the reason for this phenomenon and show how to overcome the problem. Our numerical results underline that it is very important to adapt prediction algorithms accordingly.},

Because the asymptotic normality of the quasi maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) requires finite fourth moment for both errors and the sequence itself, self-weighted quasi maximum exponential likelihood estimation (SWQMELE) has been proposed to reduce the moment constraints but requires the errors to have zero median instead of zero mean. Because changing zero mean to zero median destroys the ARMA-GARCH structure and has a serious effect on skewed data, this article proposes an efficient empirical likelihood test for zero mean of errors in the application of SWQMELE to ensure that the model still concerns conditional mean.

  abstract     = {The stochastic volatility model is a popular tool for modeling the volatility of assets. The model is a nonlinear and non-Gaussian state space model and presents some challenges not seen in general. Many approaches have been developed for Bayesian analysis that rely on numerically intensive techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Convergence and mixing problems still plague MCMC algorithms used for the model. We present an approach that ameliorates the slow convergence and mixing problems when fitting stochastic volatility models. The approach accelerates the convergence by exploiting the geometry of one of the targets. We demonstrate the method on various numerical examples.},

As these processes are heavy-tailed, we rely on the notion of long range dependence based on the covariance of indicators of excursion sets. Sufficient conditions for the long and short range dependence of α -stable moving averages are proven in terms of integrability of the corresponding kernel functions. For max-stable processes, the extremal coefficient function is used to state a necessary and sufficient condition for long range dependence.},

Bernoulli 9: 201–227 for showing the consistency of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator. It turns out that this condition applies for a much larger class of observation-driven models, that we call the class of linearly observation-driven models. This class includes standard integer valued observation-driven time series such as the Poisson autoregression model and its numerous extensions. Our results also apply to vector-valued time series such as the bivariate integer valued GARCH model, to nonlinear models such as the threshold Poisson autoregression or to observation-driven models with exogenous covariates such as the PARX model.},

  abstract     = {We study nonlinear infinite order Markov switching integer-valued ARCH models for count time series data. Markov switching models take into account complex dynamics and can deal with several stylistic facts of count data including proper modelling of nonlinearities, overdispersion and outliers. We study structural properties of those models. Under mild conditions, we prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator for the case of finite order autoregression. In addition, we give conditions which imply that the marginal likelihood ratio test, for testing the number of regimes, converges to a Gaussian process. This result enables us to prove that the BIC provides a consistent estimator for selecting the true number of regimes. A real data example illustrates the methodology and compares this approach with alternative methods.},

It is shown that asymptotically the pooled OLS estimator of overlapping blocks filters out any trend component that satisfies some Lipschitz condition. Under both fixed- b and small- b block asymptotics, the limiting distribution of the t -statistic for the unit root hypothesis is derived. Nuisance parameter corrections provide heteroskedasticity-robust tests, and serial correlation is accounted for by pre-whitening. A Monte Carlo study that considers slowly varying trends yields both good size and improved power results for the proposed tests when compared to conventional unit root tests.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new sequential monitoring scheme for changes in the parameters of a multivariate time series. In contrast to procedures proposed in the literature which compare an estimator from the training sample with an estimator calculated from the remaining data, we suggest to divide the sample at each time point after the training sample. Estimators from the sample before and after all separation points are then continuously compared calculating a maximum of norms of their differences. For open-end scenarios our approach yields an asymptotic level α procedure, which is consistent under the alternative of a change in the parameter. By means of a simulation study it is demonstrated that the new method outperforms the commonly used procedures with respect to power and the feasibility of our approach is illustrated by analyzing two data examples.},

We establish the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis for L 1 near epoch dependent processes and show its consistency under the alternative. The Wilcoxon-type testing procedure similarly as the CUSUM-type testing procedure (of Berkes I., Horváth L., Kokoszka P. and Shao Q. 2006. Ann . Statist . 34:1140–1165), requires estimation of the location of a possible change-point, and then using pre- and post-break subsamples to discriminate between short and long-range dependence. A simulation study examines the empirical size and power of the Wilcoxon-type testing procedure in standard cases and with disturbances by outliers. It shows that in standard cases the Wilcoxon-type testing procedure behaves equally well as the CUSUM-type testing procedure but outperforms it in presence of outliers. We also apply both testing procedure to hydrologic data.},

The method, based on a general estimator of the distribution function, can be applied for discrete or continuous random vectors, and for i.i.d. data or dependent time series. We prove the consistency of the approach under general conditions on the estimator of the distribution function and we show that the consistency holds for i.i.d. data and discrete time series with mixing conditions. We also propose an efficient algorithm to approximate the estimator and show the performance of the method on simulated data.
