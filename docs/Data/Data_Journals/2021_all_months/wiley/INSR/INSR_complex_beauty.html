To ensure consistent estimates between both levels, statistical offices often use integrated weights that are equal for all persons within a household and the household itself. However, these integrated weights ignore the individual patterns of the persons, and the heterogeneity within a household is no longer reflected. As an alternative to integrated weighting, we propose a two-level generalised regression estimator that is capable of both ensuring consistent person and household estimates and allowing for different weights for persons within a household. A Monte Carlo simulation supports the superiority of our two-level generalised regression estimator compared with integrated weighting.},

  abstract     = {The scientific rigor and computational methods of causal inference have had great impacts on many disciplines but have only recently begun to take hold in spatial applications. Spatial causal inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate. Code to implement many of the methods using the popular Bayesian software OpenBUGS is provided.},

This is followed by a description of tree-based ensemble algorithms, including bagging with random forest and boosting with gradient boosting machines, as well as feedforward neural networks. We then provide an extensive discussion of hyper-parameter optimisation techniques. Interpretability of ML results is an important topic in banking and other regulated industries, and it is also covered in some depth. The paper concludes with a comparison of the features of different ML algorithms and a discussion of their use in practice. An application from credit risk modelling in banking is used throughout the paper to illustrate the techniques and interpret the results of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRMs) with an ‘unstructured’ (UN) covariance structure are frequently used in primary analyses for group comparisons of incomplete continuous longitudinal data from drug development trials. However, MMRM-UN analysis could lead to convergence problems in numerical optimisation, especially in trials with a small sample size or high dropout rate. Although the so-called sandwich covariance estimator is robust against the misspecification of the covariance structure, its performance deteriorates for small sample sizes. We review eight modified covariance estimators adjusted for small-sample bias and compare their performances in the framework of MMRM analysis through simulations. In terms of the type 1 error rate and coverage probability of confidence intervals for group comparisons, Mancl and DeRouen&#39;s covariance estimator (MD) shows the best performance among the modified covariance estimators, followed by Fay and Graubard&#39;s estimator. The performance of MD is nearly equivalent to that of the Kenward–Roger method with a UN structure. The Kenward–Roger method with first-order autoregressive structure results in substantial inflation of the type 1 error rate in the scenario where the variance of measurements increases across visits. In summary, we recommend the use of MD in MMRM analysis if the convergence problem involving a UN structure occurs in small clinical trials.},

Traditional sampling techniques are accordingly enriched to keep space into account. We consider sequential techniques that use weights for introducing space in the update of population units&#39; inclusion probabilities and propose a new weighting system that includes the spatial entropy of the study variable. Techniques only based on distances between locations perform well in the case of a compact structure. Any non-compact spatial scheme takes advantage of the involvement of spatial entropy in the sequential modification of first-order inclusion probabilities.},

The synergical interplay of approaches from statistics, applied mathematics and engineering endows the methods with important advantages with respect to the available techniques, and makes them able to accurately deal with data structures for which the classical techniques are unfit.

This paper carries out a detailed study on the influence that the initial values of the parameters impose on the results produced by the algorithm. We compare random starts and partitional and model-based strategies for choosing the initial values for the EM algorithm in the case of multivariate Gaussian emission distributions (EDs) and assess the performance of each strategy with different assessment criteria. Several data generation settings are considered with varying number of latent states, of variables as well as of the level of fuzziness in the data, and discussion on how each factor influences the obtained results is provided. Simulation results show that different initialization strategies may lead to different log-likelihood values and, accordingly, to different estimated partitions. A clear indication of which strategies should be preferred is given. We further include two real-data examples, widely analysed in the hidden semi-Markov model literature.},

This loss of power was noted by Whittle in 1952, as well as the necessary assumption that the noise be white. Whittle and subsequent authors suggested remedies for the white noise assumption. This paper proposes simple tests, based on the Fourier coefficients, that is, the Fourier transforms at the Fourier frequencies, that have good power properties at all frequencies.},

  abstract     = {The statistical challenges in using big data for making valid statistical inference in the finite population have been well documented in literature. These challenges are due primarily to statistical bias arising from under-coverage in the big data source to represent the population of interest and measurement errors in the variables available in the data set. By stratifying the population into a big data stratum and a missing data stratum, we can estimate the missing data stratum by using a fully responding probability sample and hence the population as a whole by using a data integration estimator. By expressing the data integration estimator as a regression estimator, we can handle measurement errors in the variables in big data and also in the probability sample. We also propose a fully nonparametric classification method for identifying the overlapping units and develop a bias-corrected data integration estimator under misclassification errors. Finally, we develop a two-step regression data integration estimator to deal with measurement errors in the probability sample. An advantage of the approach advocated in this paper is that we do not have to make unrealistic missing-at-random assumptions for the methods to work. The proposed method is applied to the real data example using 2015–2016 Australian Agricultural Census data.},

  abstract     = {The statistical literature is known to be inconsistent in the use of the terms ‘permutation test’ and ‘randomisation test’. Several authors successfully argue that these terms should be used to refer to two distinct classes of tests and that there are major conceptual differences between these classes. The present paper explains an important difference in mathematical reasoning between these classes: a permutation test fundamentally requires that the set of permutations has a group structure, in the algebraic sense; the reasoning behind a randomisation test is not based on such a group structure, and it is possible to use an experimental design that does not correspond to a group. In particular, we can use a randomisation scheme where the number of possible treatment patterns is larger than in standard experimental designs. This leads to exact p values of improved resolution, providing increased power for very small significance levels, at the cost of decreased power for larger significance levels. We discuss applications in randomised trials and elsewhere. Further, we explain that Fisher&#39;s famous Lady Tasting Tea experiment, which is commonly referred to as the first permutation test, is in fact a randomisation test. This distinction is important to avoid confusion and invalid tests.},

  abstract     = {Rank-based inference methods are applied in various disciplines, typically when procedures relying on standard normal theory are not justifiable. Various specific rank-based methods have been developed for two and more samples and also for general factorial designs (e.g. Kruskal–Wallis test or Akritas–Arnold–Brunner test). It is the aim of the present paper (1) to demonstrate that traditional rank procedures for several samples or general factorial designs may lead to surprising results in case of unequal sample sizes as compared with equal sample sizes, (2) to explain why this is the case and (3) to provide a way to overcome these disadvantages. Theoretical investigations show that the surprising results can be explained by considering the non-centralities of the test statistics, which may be non-zero for the usual rank-based procedures in case of unequal sample sizes, while they may be equal to 0 in case of equal sample sizes. A simple solution is to consider unweighted relative effects instead of weighted relative effects. The former effects are estimated by means of the so-called pseudo-ranks, while the usual ranks naturally lead to the latter effects. A real data example illustrates the practical meaning of the theoretical discussions.},

In analysing such data, it is critical to define a model that can accurately capture the underlying dependence structure between the counts. To this end, this paper develops a multivariate model wherein correlated Poisson margins are generated by a comonotonic shock vector. The proposed model allows for greater flexibility in the dependence structure than that of the classical construction, which relies on the convolution of vectors of common Poisson shock variables. Several probabilistic properties of the multivariate comonotonic shock Poisson model are established, and various estimation strategies are discussed in detail. The model is further studied through simulations, and its utility is highlighted using a real data application.},

  abstract     = {Usually, in spatial generalised linear models, covariates that are spatially smooth are collinear with spatial random effects. This affects the bias and precision of the regression coefficients. This is known in the spatial statistics literature as spatial confounding. We discuss the problem of confounding in the case of multilevel spatial models wherein there are multiple observations within clusters. We show that even under the standard multilevel model, which allows for independent (i.e. not spatially correlated) cluster effects, the cluster-level fixed effects might be biased depending on the structure of the ‘true’ generating mechanism of the processes. We provide simulation studies in order to investigate the effects of confounding in the estimation of fixed effects present in random intercept models under different scenarios of confounding. One remedy to spatial confounding is restricted spatial regression wherein the spatial random effects are constrained to be orthogonal to the fixed effects of the model. We propose one way to fit a restricted spatial regression model for multilevel data and illustrate it with artificial data analyses. We also briefly describe the issue of confounding in random intercept and slope models.},

In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of how to make and evaluate probabilistic forecasts from such simulation output. Based on proper scoring rules, we develop a notion of consistency that allows to assess the adequacy of methods for estimating the stationary distribution underlying the simulation output. We then provide asymptotic results that account for the salient features of Bayesian posterior simulators and derive conditions under which choices from the literature satisfy our notion of consistency. Importantly, these conditions depend on the scoring rule being used, such that the choices of approximation method and scoring rule are intertwined. While the logarithmic rule requires fairly stringent conditions, the continuous ranked probability score yields consistent approximations under minimal assumptions. These results are illustrated in a simulation study and an economic data example. Overall, mixture-of-parameters approximations that exploit the parametric structure of Bayesian models perform particularly well. Under the continuous ranked probability score, the empirical distribution function is a simple and appealing alternative option.},

It not only included fundamentals of statistical inference such as the Cramér–Rao theorem and Rao–Blackwell theorem but also proposed differential geometry of a manifold of probability distributions. It is a Riemannian manifold where Fisher–Rao information plays the role of the metric tensor. It took decades for the importance of the geometrical structure to be recognised. The present article reviews the structure of the manifold of probability distributions and its applications and shows how the original idea of Professor Rao has been developed and popularised in the wide sense of statistical sciences including AI, signal processing, physical sciences and others.},

  abstract     = {There has been considerable and controversial research over the past two decades into how successfully random effects misspecification in mixed models (i.e. assuming normality for the random effects when the true distribution is non-normal) can be diagnosed and what its impacts are on estimation and inference. However, much of this research has focused on fixed effects inference in generalised linear mixed models. In this article, motivated by the increasing number of applications of mixed models where interest is on the variance components, we study the effects of random effects misspecification on random effects inference in linear mixed models, for which there is considerably less literature. Our findings are surprising and contrary to general belief: for point estimation, maximum likelihood estimation of the variance components under misspecification is consistent, although in finite samples, both the bias and mean squared error can be substantial. For inference, we show through theory and simulation that under misspecification, standard likelihood ratio tests of truly non-zero variance components can suffer from severely inflated type I errors, and confidence intervals for the variance components can exhibit considerable under coverage. Furthermore, neither of these problems vanish asymptotically with increasing the number of clusters or cluster size. These results have major implications for random effects inference, especially if the true random effects distribution is heavier tailed than the normal. Fortunately, simple graphical and goodness-of-fit measures of the random effects predictions appear to have reasonable power at detecting misspecification. We apply linear mixed models to a survey of more than 4 000 high school students within 100 schools and analyse how mathematics achievement scores vary with student attributes and across different schools. The application demonstrates the sensitivity of mixed model inference to the true but unknown random effects distribution.},

Four of the most successful approaches are conditional autoregressive Value at Risk, extreme value theory, filtered historical simulation and time-varying higher order conditional moments. In this paper, we compare their performances under both an empirical investigation using 80 assets and a large Monte Carlo simulation. From our analysis, we conclude that most of the methods seem not to imply huge numerical difficulties and, according to usual backtests and performance measurements, extreme value theory presents the best results most of the times, followed by filtered historical simulation.},

These modifications result in benchmarked small area estimators. We consider two benchmarking procedures. One is based on augmenting the unit-level model with a suitable variable. The other one uses the calibrated weights of the direct estimators that are reliable at the higher levels. These weights are used in estimators that are based on the aggregation of the unit-level model for each small area. The mean squared error estimators of the proposed benchmarked estimators are obtained by suitably modifying those associated with the corresponding non benchmarked estimators.

  abstract     = {Social and economic studies are often implemented as complex survey designs. For example, multistage, unequal probability sampling designs utilised by federal statistical agencies are typically constructed to maximise the efficiency of the target domain level estimator (e.g. indexed by geographic area) within cost constraints for survey administration. Such designs may induce dependence between the sampled units; for example, with employment of a sampling step that selects geographically indexed clusters of units. A sampling-weighted pseudo-posterior distribution may be used to estimate the population model on the observed sample. The dependence induced between coclustered units inflates the scale of the resulting pseudo-posterior covariance matrix that has been shown to induce under coverage of the credibility sets. By bridging results across Bayesian model misspecification and survey sampling, we demonstrate that the scale and shape of the asymptotic distributions are different between each of the pseudo-maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), the pseudo-posterior and the MLE under simple random sampling. Through insights from survey-sampling variance estimation and recent advances in computational methods, we devise a correction applied as a simple and fast postprocessing step to Markov chain Monte Carlo draws of the pseudo-posterior distribution. This adjustment projects the pseudo-posterior covariance matrix such that the nominal coverage is approximately achieved. We make an application to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health as a motivating example and we demonstrate the efficacy of our scale and shape projection procedure on synthetic data on several common archetypes of survey designs.},

In this paper, we examine and summarise two existing approaches to statistical analysis based on social media data, which can be discerned in the literature. In the first approach, analysis is applied to the social media data that are organised around the objects directly observed in the data; in the second one, a different analysis is applied to a constructed pseudo survey dataset, aimed to transform the observed social media data to a set of units from the target population. We elaborate systematically the relevant data quality frameworks, exemplify their applications and highlight some typical challenges associated with social media data.},

Powerful hierarchical models that account for both aspects are proposed. To avoid biased estimates, the models separate the neutral category when modelling the effects of explanatory variables on the outcome. The main model that is propagated uses binary response models as building blocks in a hierarchical way. It has the advantage that it can be easily extended to include response style effects and non-linear smooth effects of explanatory variables. By simple transformation of the data, available software for binary response variables can be used to fit the model. The proposed hierarchical model can be used to investigate the effects of covariates on single Likert-type items and also for the analysis of a combination of items. For both cases, estimation tools are provided. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by applying the methodology to a large data set.},
