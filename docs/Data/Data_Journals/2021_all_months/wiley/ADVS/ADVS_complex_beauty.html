Based on such characteristics, vitrimers have been studied and have shown promises as a 3D printing ink material that can be recycled with the purpose of waste reduction. However, despite the brilliant approaches, there still remain limitations regarding requirement of new reagents for recycling the materials or reprintability issues. Here, a new class of a 4D printable vitrimer that is translated from a commercial poly( ε -caprolactone) (PCL) resin is reported to exhibit self-healability, weldability, reprocessability, as well as reprintability. Thus, formed 3D-printed vitrimer products show superior heat resistance in comparison to commercial PCL prints, and can be repeatedly reprocessed or reprinted via filament extrusion and a handheld fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 3D printing method. Furthermore, incorporation of semicrystalline PCL renders capabilities of shape memory for 4D printing applications, and as far as it is known, such demonstration of FDM 3D-printed shape memory vitrimers has not been realized yet. It is envisioned that this work can fuel advancement in 4D printing industries by suggesting a new material candidate with all-rounded capabilities with minimized environmental challenges.},

Here, the discovery of pressure-induced phase transition at ≈2 GPa, and dome-shaped superconducting phase emerged in van der Waals layered NbIrTe 4 is reported. The highest critical temperature ( T c ) is ≈5.8 K at pressure of ≈16 GPa, where the interlayered Te–Te covalent bonds form simultaneously derived from the synchrotron diffraction data, indicating the hosting structure of superconducting evolved from low-pressure two-dimensional (2D) phase to three-dimensional (3D) structure with pressure higher than 30 GPa. Strikingly, the authors have found an anisotropic transport in the vicinity of the superconducting state, suggesting the emergence of a “stripe”-like phase. The dome-shaped superconducting phase and anisotropic transport are possibly due to the spatial modulation of interlayer Josephson coupling .},

Herein, interpenetrated elastomer network with bimodal chain length distribution showing rapid autonomous healing in universal conditions (&lt;7200 s) with high efficiency (up to 97.6 ± 4.8%) is reported. The bimodal elastomer displays strain-induced photoelastic effect and reinforcement which is responsible for its remarkable mechanical robustness (≈5.5 MPa stress at break and toughness ≈30 MJ m −3 ). The entropy-driven elasticity allows an unprecedented shape recovery efficiency (100%) even after fracturing and 100% resiliency up to its stretching limit (≈2000% strain). The elastomers can be mechanically conditioned leading to a state where they recover their shape extremely quickly after removal of stress (nearly order of magnitude faster than pristine elastomers). As a proof of concept, universal self-healing mechanochromic strain sensor is developed capable of operating in various environmental conditions and of changing its photonic band gap under mechanical stress.},

Herein, a colorimetric dermal tattoo biosensor fabricated by a four-area segmented microneedle patch is developed for multiplexed detection of health-related biomarkers. The biosensor exhibits color changes in response to the change of biomarker concentration (i.e., pH, glucose, uric acid, and temperature), which can be directly read by naked eyes or captured by a camera for semi-quantitative measurement. It is demonstrated that the colorimetric dermal tattoo biosensor can simultaneously detect multiple biomarkers in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, and monitor the changes of the biomarker concentration for at least 4 days, showing its great potential for long-term health monitoring.},

In the current work, it is demonstrated that position-scanning peptide libraries themselves can serve as improved immunogens, inducing Ag-specific CD8 + T cells with greater frequency and function than the wild-type epitope. The approach involves displaying the entire position-scanning library onto immunogenic nanoliposomes. Each library contains the MHC-I epitope with a single randomized position. When a recently identified MHC-I epitope in the glycoprotein gp70 envelope protein of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is assessed, only one of the eight positional libraries tested, randomized at amino acid position 5 (Pos5), shows enhanced induction of Ag-specific CD8 + T cells. A second MHC-I epitope from gp70 is assessed in the same manner and shows, in contrast, multiple positional libraries (Pos1, Pos3, Pos5, and Pos8) as well as the library mixture give rise to enhanced CD8 + T cell responses. The library mixture Pos1-3-5-8 induces a more diverse epitope-specific T-cell repertoire with superior antitumor efficacy compared to an established single mutation mimotope (AH1-A5). These data show that positional peptide libraries can serve as immunogens for improving CD8 + T-cell responses against endogenously expressed MHC-I epitopes.},

  abstract     = {The assembly of proteins in a programmable manner provides insight into the creation of novel functional nanomaterials for practical applications. Despite many advances, however, a rational protein assembly with an easy scalability in terms of size and valency remains a challenge. Here, a simple bottom-up approach to the supramolecular protein assembly with a tunable size and valency in a programmable manner is presented. The dendrimer-like protein assembly, simply called a “protein dendrimer,” is constructed through a stepwise and alternate addition of a building block protein. Starting from zeroth-generation protein dendrimer (pG 0 ) of 27 kDa, the protein dendrimer is sequentially grown to pG 1 , pG 2 , pG 3 , to pG 4 with a molecular mass of 94, 216, 483, and 959 kDa, respectively. The valency of the protein dendrimers at the periphery increases by a factor of two after each generation, allowing a tunable valency and easy functionalization. The protein dendrimers functionalizes with a targeting moiety and a cytotoxic protein cargo shows a typical feature of multi-valency in the avidity and a highly enhanced cellular cytotoxicity, exemplifying their utility as a protein delivery platform. The present approach can be effectively used in the creation of protein architectures with new functions for biotechnological and medical applications.},

Here, the authors use an integrated atomic force microscope (AFM) and brightfield/epifluorescent microscope platform to precisely simulate living single cells or groups of cells under physiological conditions, in real time, concomitantly measuring the single-cell autophagic response and its transmission to neighboring cells. Dual-color fluorescence monitoring of the cellular autophagic response reveals the dynamics of autophagosome formation, degradation, and induction in neighboring contacting and noncontacting cells. Autophagosome formation is dependent on both the applied force and contact area of the AFM tip. More importantly, the enhancement of the autophagic responses in neighboring cells via a gap junction-dependent mechanism is observed. This AFM-based nanoacupuncture platform can serve as a tool for elucidating the primary mechanism underlying mechanical stimulation of living systems and other biomechanical therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {One of the major limitations of standard top-down technologies used in today&#39;s neuromorphic engineering is their inability to map the 3D nature of biological brains. Here, it is shown how bipolar electropolymerization can be used to engineer 3D networks of PEDOT:PSS dendritic fibers. By controlling the growth conditions of the electropolymerized material, it is investigated how dendritic fibers can reproduce structural plasticity by creating structures of controllable shape. Gradual topologies evolution is demonstrated in a multielectrode configuration. A detailed electrical characterization of the PEDOT:PSS dendrites is conducted through DC and impedance spectroscopy measurements and it is shown how organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) can be realized with these structures. These measurements reveal that quasi-static and transient response of OECTs can be adjusted by controlling dendrites’ morphologies. The unique properties of organic dendrites are used to demonstrate short-term, long-term, and structural plasticity, which are essential features required for future neuromorphic hardware development.},

  abstract     = {The development of simple, efficient, and biocompatible organic luminescent molecules is of great significance to the clinical transformation of biomaterials. In recent years, purely organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with an extremely small single-triplet energy gap (Δ E ST ) have been considered as the most promising new-generation electroluminescence emitters, which is an enormous breakthrough in organic optoelectronics. By merits of the unique photophysical properties, high structure flexibility, and reduced health risks, such metal-free TADF luminophores have attracted tremendous attention in biomedical fields, including conventional fluorescence imaging, time-resolved imaging and sensing, and photodynamic therapy. However, there is currently no systematic summary of the TADF materials for biomedical applications, which is presented in this review. Besides a brief introduction of the major developments of TADF material, the typical TADF mechanisms and fundamental principles on design strategies of TADF molecules and nanomaterials are subsequently described. Importantly, a specific emphasis is placed on the discussion of TADF materials for various biomedical applications. Finally, the authors make a forecast of the remaining challenges and future developments. This review provides insightful perspectives and clear prospects towards the rapid development of TADF materials in biomedicine, which will be highly valuable to exploit new luminescent materials.},

  abstract     = {Increasing evidence has suggested that chemotherapeutics affect the integrity of the intestinal barrier and alter the intestinal microbiota, thus limiting the therapeutic outcomes of cancer chemotherapy. Docetaxel (DTX) is used for breast cancer treatment and has gastrointestinal side effects, but the influence of DTX formulations on the intestinal barrier and intestinal microbiota remains unknown. Therefore, in this work, the influence of DTX injection (free DTX, commercial formulation) and DTX/methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)- b lock -poly(D,L-lactide) (mPEG-PDLLA) (DTX micelles, nanoformulation) on the integrity of the intestinal barrier and the intestinal microbiota is investigated. It is found that the free DTX causes significantly greater intestinal barrier damage than the DTX micelles. The diversity of the intestinal microbiota, and the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcus gnavus in the DTX micelle-treated group is significantly higher than that in the free DTX-treated group. Moreover, the tumor growth rate is elevated in antibiotic mixture-pretreated mice, demonstrating that the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota may be associated with tumor progression. This work demonstrates that different formulations of chemotherapeutics have different effects on the integrity of the intestinal barrier and the intestinal microbiota.},

However, the low-quality factor (Q-factor), the large size of impedance matching components, and the poor selectivity of the multi-array design remain challenging issues. To solve these issues, a floating coil structure stacked on a loop micro-antenna is suggested. Various floating coil designs are prepared with appropriate matching conditions at specific target frequencies, using an easy fabrication process without the need for additional space. A simple one-loop antenna design shows a higher Q-factor than other, more complicated designs. The micro-sized loop antenna with the 80 µm trace width design exhibits the highest Q-factor, around 31 within 7 GHz. The 8 different floating coil designs result in high-frequency selectivity from 1 to 7 GHz. The highest selectivity contrast and WPT efficiency are above 7 and around 1%, respectively. Considering the size of the antenna, the efficiency is not low, mainly due to the good matching effect with the high Q-factor of the floating coil and the loop antenna. This micro-antenna array concept with high integration density can be applied for advanced wireless neural stimulation or in wireless pixel array concepts in flexible displays.},

These sequential processes eventually lead to the death of contractile cells and affect the integrity of blood vessels, resulting in the formation of scar tissue. A new heart therapy comprised of cardiac implants encapsulated within an injectable extracellular matrix-gold nanoparticle composite hydrogel is reported. The particles on the collagenous fibers within the hydrogel promote fast transfer of electrical signal between cardiac cells, leading to the functional assembly of the cardiac implants. The composite hydrogel is shown to absorb reactive oxygen species in vitro and in vivo in mice ischemia reperfusion model. The reduction in ROS levels preserve cardiac tissue morphology and blood vessel integrity, reduce the scar size and the inflammatory response, and significantly prevent the deterioration of heart function.},

Nevertheless, gate-tunable magnetic order via intrinsic defects has been rarely observed to date. Herein, a gate-tunable magnetic order via resonant Se vacancies in WSe 2 is demonstrated. The Se-vacancy states are probed via photocurrent measurements with gating to convert unoccupied states to partially occupied states associated with photo-excited carrier recombination. The magneto-photoresistance hysteresis is modulated by gating, which is consistent with the density functional calculations. The two energy levels associated with Se vacancies split with increasing laser power, owing to the robust Coulomb interaction and strong spin–orbit coupling. The findings offer a new approach for controlling the magnetic properties of defects in optoelectronic and spintronic devices using vdW-layered semiconductors.},

Among the various developed CO 2 -to-CO reduction electrocatalysts, transition metal/N-doped carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are attractive due to their low cost and high activity. In this work, recent progress on the development of M-N-C catalysts for electrochemical CO 2 -to-CO conversion is reviewed in detail. The regulation of the active sites in M-N-C catalysts and their related adjustable electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance is discussed. A visual performance comparison of M-N-C catalysts for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) reported over the recent years is given, which suggests that Ni and Fe-N-C catalysts are the most promising candidates for large-scale reduction of CO 2 to produce CO.

A broad characterization of biomarkers in swine GF coupled to time-matched serum is conducted . The relationship and kinetics of GF-derived analyte level dynamics is established by correlating these to serum levels in an acute renal failure and an inducible stress model performed in swine. The ability to monitor ketone levels and an inhaled anaesthetic agent (isoflurane) in vivo is demonstrated with novel NG-compatible sensor systems in swine.

However, its limited resolution and ultralow acquisition speed remain major issues for general clinical application. Meanwhile, conventional immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) allows sub-micrometer resolution and rapid identification of the region of interest (ROI), but only operates with low multiplicity. Herein, a series of lanthanide-doped blue-, green-, and red-fluorescent carbon nanodots (namely, B-Cdots(Ln 1 ), G-Cdots(Ln 2 ), and R-Cdots(Ln 3 )) as fluorescence and mass dual-modal tags are developed.

The rapid identification of ROI with IFM using fluorescence signals and subsequent multiplexed detection of in situ ROI with IMC using the same tissue section is demonstrated. Dual-modal probes save up to 90% IMC blind scanning time for a standard 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm overall image. Meanwhile, the IFM provides refined details and topological spatial distributions for the functional proteins at optical resolution, which compensates for the low resolution of the IMC imaging.},

Although breakthroughs in liquid migration on 2D surfaces or 3D tubular devices have been achieved, realizing smooth/on-demand transportation of constrained solids within a 3D cavity environment under harsh pressurized environment still remains a daunting challenge, where strong interface friction force becomes the main obstacle restricting the movement of solids. Inspired by typical feeding mechanism in natural esophagus system which synergistically couples a lubricating mucosa surface with the peristaltic contraction deformation of the cavity, herein, this challenge is addressed by constructing an esophagus-inspired layered tubular actuator with a slippery inner surface and responsive hydrogel matrix to realize spherical solid propulsion by photo(thermo)-induced cavity deformation. The as-constructed tubular actuator containing Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles exhibits local volumetric shrinkage upon NIR-irradiation, which can generate large hydrodynamic pressure and considerable mechanical extrusion force ( F driving force ≈ 0.18 N) to overcome low interface friction force ( f friction force ≈ 0.03 N), enabling on-demand transportation of constrained (pressure: 0.103 MPa) spherical solids over a long distance in an arbitrary direction. This actuator is anticipated to be used as bionic medicine transportation devices or artificial in vitro esophagus simulation systems, for example, to help formula eating-related physiotherapy plans for patients and astronauts.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Radioresistance and stemness are substantial obstacles to TNBC treatment. The THO complex (THOC) is a subunit of the TRanscription–EXport complex that functions in the coupling of transcription to nascent RNA splicing, elongation, and export. However, its role in regulating TNBC therapeutic resistance is not reported yet. In this study, the authors demonstrate that cancer stem cells are enriched in radioresistant TNBC cells and describe the role of the THOC in regulating TNBC radioresistance and stemness. The authors find that THOC2 and THOC5 are upregulated in radioresistant TNBC cells and associated with a poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Further investigation reveals that THOC2 promotes the stem-like properties and radioresistance of TNBC cells in a THOC5-dependent manner by facilitating the release of sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) and homeobox transcription factor (NANOG) transcripts from the nucleus. Silencing THOC2 or THOC5 expression decreases the protein expression of SOX2 and NANOG, depletes the stem-like properties, and causes radiosensitization in these TNBC cells. Moreover, THOC2 or THOC5 depletion blocks the xenograft tumorigenesis and growth of radioresistant TNBC in vivo. These findings uncover the novel correlations of THOC with TNBC stemness and therapeutic resistance, proposing alternative therapeutic strategies against relapsed TNBC.},

  abstract     = {The Hippo pathway effector TAZ promotes cellular growth, survival, and stemness through regulating gene transcription. Recent studies suggest that TAZ liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) compartmentalizes key cofactors to activate transcription. However, how TAZ LLPS is achieved remains unknown. Here, it is shown that the paraspeckle protein NONO is required for TAZ LLPS and activation in the nucleus. NONO is a TAZ-binding protein. Their interaction shows temporal regulation parallel to the interaction between TAZ and TEAD as well as to the expression of TAZ target genes. NONO depletion reduces nuclear TAZ LLPS, while ectopic NONO expression promotes the LLPS. Accordingly, NONO depletion reduces TAZ interactions with TEAD, Rpb1, and enhancers. In glioblastoma, expressions of NONO and TAZ are both upregulated and predict poor prognosis. Silencing NONO expression in an orthotopic glioblastoma mouse model inhibits TAZ-driven tumorigenesis. Together, this study suggests that NONO is a nuclear factor that promotes TAZ LLPS and TAZ-driven oncogenic transcriptional program.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectrics usually exhibit temperature-triggered structural changes, which play crucial roles in controlling their physical properties. However, although light is very striking as a non-contact, non-destructive, and remotely controlled external stimuli, ferroelectric crystals with light-triggered structural changes are very rare, which holds promise for optical control of ferroelectric properties. Here, an organic molecular ferroelectric, N -salicylidene-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroaniline (SA-PFA), which shows light-triggered structural change of reversible photoisomerization between cis -enol and trans -keto configuration is reported. SA-PFA presents clear ferroelectricity with the saturate polarization of 0.84 μ C cm −2 , larger than those of some typical organic ferroelectrics with thermodynamically structural changes. Benefit from the reversible photoisomerization, the dielectric real part of SA-PFA can be reversibly switched by light. More strikingly, the photoisomerization enables SA-PFA to show reversible optically induced ferroelectric polarization switching. Such intriguing behaviors make SPFA a potential candidate for application in next-generation photo-controlled ferroelectric devices. This work sheds light on further exploration of more excellent molecular ferroelectrics with light-triggered structural changes for optical control of ferroelectric properties.},

Herein, an O 2 self-supplying catalytic nanoagent, based on tannic acid (TA)–Fe(III) coordination complexes-coated perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) nanodroplets with lactate oxidases (LOX) loading (PFOB@TA–Fe(III)–LOX, PTFL), is designed for cascade metabolic-chemodynamic therapy (CDT) by dual-depletion of lactate and ATP with hydroxyl • OH radicals generation. Benefiting from the catalytic property of loaded LOX and O 2 self-supplying of PFOB nanodroplets, PTFL nanoparticles (NPs) efficiently deplete tumoral lactate for down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression and supplement the insufficient endogenous H 2 O 2 . Simultaneously, TA–Fe(III) complexes release Fe(III) ions and TA in response to intracellular up-regulated ATP in tumor cells followed by TA-mediated Fe(III)/Fe(II) conversion, leading to the depletion of energy source ATP and the generation of cytotoxic • OH radicals from H 2 O 2 . Moreover, TA–Fe(III) complexes provide photoacoustic contrast as imaging guidance to enhance therapeutic accuracy. As a result, PTFL NPs efficiently accumulate in tumors for suppression of tumor growth and show evidence of anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastasis effects. This multifunctional nanoagent may provide new insight for targeting abnormal tumor metabolism with the combination of CDT to achieve a synergistic therapeutic effect.},

In this work, trRosettaX, an improved version of trRosetta for protein structure prediction is presented. The major improvement over trRosetta consists of two folds. The first is the application of a new multi-scale network, i.e., Res2Net, for improved prediction of inter-residue geometries, including distance and orientations. The second is an attention-based module to exploit multiple homologous templates to increase the accuracy further. Compared with trRosetta, trRosettaX improves the contact precision by 6% and 8% on the free modeling targets of CASP13 and CASP14, respectively. A preliminary version of trRosettaX is ranked as one of the top server groups in CASP14&#39;s blind test. Additional benchmark test on 161 targets from CAMEO (between Jun and Sep 2020) shows that trRosettaX achieves an average TM-score ≈0.8, outperforming the top groups in CAMEO. These data suggest the effectiveness of using the multi-scale network and the benefit of incorporating homologous templates into the network. The trRosettaX algorithm is incorporated into the trRosetta server since Nov 2020. The web server, the training and inference codes are available at: https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/trRosetta/ .},

Here, a living bacterial hydrogel scaffold is reported that accelerates infected wound healing through beneficial bacteria secreting antibacterial substances. Lactobacillus reuteri , a common probiotic, is encapsulated in hydrogel microspheres by emulsion polymerization and further immobilized in a hydrogel network by covalent cross-linking of methacrylate-modified hyaluronic acid. Owing to light-initiated crosslinking, the hydrogel dressing can be generated in situ at the wound site. This hydrogel scaffold not only protects bacteria from immune system attack, but also prevents bacteria from escaping into the local environment, thus avoiding potential threats. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that it has excellent ability against harmful bacteria and anti-inflammatory capabilities, promoting infected wound closure and new tissue regeneration.

However, organizing the formation of artificial organelle architectures in a spatiotemporal manner within complex primitive compartments remains scarcely explored. In this work, thermoresponsive hybrid polypeptide-polymer conjugates are rationally engineered and synthesized, resulting from the conjugation of an intrinsically disordered synthetic protein (IDP), namely elastin-like polypeptide, and synthetic polymers (poly(ethylene glycol) and dextran) that are widely used as macromolecular crowding agents. Cell-like constructs are built using droplet-based microfluidics that are filled with such bioconjugates and an artificial cytoplasm system that is composed of specific polymers conjugated to the IDP. The distinct spatial organizations of two polypeptide-polymer conjugates and the dynamic assembly and disassembly of polypeptide-polymer coacervate droplets in response to temperature are studied in the cytomimetic protocells. Furthermore, a monoblock IDP with longer length is concurrently included with bioconjugates individually inside cytomimetic compartments. Both bioconjugates exhibit an identical surfactant-like property, compartmentalizing the monoblock IDP coacervates via temperature control. These findings lay the foundation for developing hierarchically structured synthetic cells with interior organelle-like structures which could be designed to localize in desired phase-separated subcompartments.},

However, traditional fabrication methods such as electron-beam lithography and stereolithography are usually costly and time-consuming, precluding their production on a large scale. Herein, for the first time the ultrafast laser direct writing is combined with external magnetic field (MF) to massively produce graphene-coated ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles supported on 3D porous carbon using metal–organic framework crystals as precursors (5 × 5 cm 2 with 10 s). The MF-confined picosecond laser scribing not only reduces the metal ions rapidly but also aligns the NPs in ultrafine and evenly distributed order (from 7.82 ± 2.37 to 3.80 ± 0.84 nm). ≈400% increment of N-Q species within N compositionis also found as the result of the special MF-induced laser plasma plume. (). The importance of MF is further exmined by electrochemical water-splitting tests. Significant overpotential improvements of 90 and 150 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction are observed, respectively, owing to the MF-induced alignment of the NPs and controlled elemental compositions.

Thorax trauma (TxT) is strongly associated with trauma-related death, an unbalanced innate immune response, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. It is shown that different in vivo traumata, such as TxT or an in vitro polytrauma cytokine cocktail trigger secretion of small extracellular nanovesicles (sEVs) from endothelial cells with pro-inflammatory cargo. These sEVs transfer transcripts for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and cytokines to systemically activate the endothelium, facilitate neutrophil-endothelium interactions, and destabilize barrier integrity. Inhibition of sEV-release after TxT in mice ameliorates local as well as systemic inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and distant organ damage in kidneys (acute kidney injury, AKI). Vice versa, injection of TxT-plasma-sEVs into healthy animals is sufficient to trigger pulmonary and systemic inflammation as well as AKI. Accordingly, increased sEV concentrations and transfer of similar cargos are observed in polytrauma patients, suggesting a fundamental pathophysiological mechanism.},

Biomimetic morphing materials can be developed by spatially controlling the orientations of molecules or nanofillers that produce anisotropic responses and internal stresses under external stimuli. However, it remains a serious challenge to fabricate materials with sophisticated anisotropic architectures. Here, a facile strategy to fabricate morphing hydrogels with elaborately ordered structures of nanosheets, which are oriented under distributed electric field and immobilized by polymerization to form a poly( N -isopropylacrylamide) matrix, is proposed. Diverse sophisticated anisotropic structures are obtained by engineering the electric field through the patterns and relative locations of the electrodes. Upon heating, the monolithic hydrogels with through-thickness and/or in-plane gradients in orientation of the nanosheets deform into various three-dimensional configurations. After incorporating gold nanoparticles, the hydrogels become photoresponsive and capable of programmable motions, for example, dynamic twisting and flipping under spatiotemporal stimuli. Such a strategy of using patterned electrodes to generate distributed electric field should be applicable to systems of liquid crystals or charged particles/molecules to direct orientation or electrophoresis and form functional structures. The biomimetically architectured hydrogels would be ideal materials to develop artificial muscles, soft actuators/robots, and biomedical devices with versatile applications.},

However, most immune therapeutics such as drugs, vaccines, and cellular therapy suffer from the limitations of poor efficacy and adverse side effects. Fortunately, cell membrane-derived nanoparticles (CMDNs) have superior compatibility with other therapeutics and offer new opportunities to push the limits of current treatments in immune modulation. As the interface between cells and outer surroundings, cell membrane contains components which instruct intercellular communication and the plasticity of cytomembrane has significantly potentiated CMDNs to leverage our immune system. Therefore, cell membranes employed in immunomodulatory CMDNs have gradually shifted from natural to engineered. In this review, unique properties of immunomodulatory CMDNs and engineering strategies of emerging CMDNs for immune modulation, with an emphasis on the design logic are summarized. Further, this review points out some pressing problems to be solved during clinical translation and put forward some suggestions on the prospect of immunoregulatory CMDNs.

  abstract     = {The extraction of uranium from seawater, which is an abundant resource, has attracted considerable attention as a viable form of energy-resource acquisition. The two critical factors for boosting the chemical thermodynamics of uranium extraction from seawater are the availability of sufficient amounts of uranyl ions for supply to adsorbents and increased interaction temperatures. However, current approaches only rely on the free diffusion of uranyl ions from seawater to the functional groups within adsorbents, which largely limits the uranium extraction capacity. Herein, inspired by the mechanism of plant transpiration, a plant-mimetic directional-channel poly(amidoxime) (DC-PAO) hydrogel is designed to enhance the uranium extraction efficiency via the active pumping of uranyl ions into the adsorbent. Compared with the original PAO hydrogel without plant-mimetic transpiration, the uranium extraction capacity of the DC-PAO hydrogel increases by 79.33% in natural seawater and affords the fastest reported uranium extraction average rate of 0.917 mg g −1 d −1 among the most state-of-the-art amidoxime group-based adsorbents, along with a high adsorption capacity of 6.42 mg g −1 within 7 d. The results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the efficiency of solar-transpiration-based uranium extraction from seawater, particularly in terms of reducing costs and saving processing time.},

  abstract     = {Multiferroic materials with flexibility are expected to make great contributions to flexible electronic applications, such as sensors, memories, and wearable devices. In this work, super-flexible freestanding BiMnO 3 membranes with simultaneous ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism are synthesized using water-soluble Sr 3 Al 2 O 6 as the sacrificial buffer layer. The super-flexibility of BiMnO 3 membranes is demonstrated by undergoing an ≈180° folding during an in situ bending test, which is consistent with the results of first-principles calculations. The piezoelectric signal under a bending radius of ≈500 µm confirms the stable existence of electric polarization in freestanding BiMnO 3 membranes. Moreover, the stable ferromagnetism of freestanding BiMnO 3 membranes is demonstrated after 100 times bending cycles with a bending radius of ≈2 mm. 5.1% uniaxial tensile strain is achieved in freestanding BiMnO 3 membranes, and the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) phase retention behaviors confirm that the ferroelectricity of membranes can survive stably up to the strain of 1.7%. These super-flexible membranes with stable ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism pave ways to the realizations of multifunctional flexible electronics.},

Here, new fabrication techniques are developed that turn two conventional construction materials—clay and fiber composites (FRP)—into smart, self-morphing materials, compatible with architectural needs. Controlled experiments verify the quantitative connection between the prescribed small-scale material structure and the global 3D surface, as predicted by the theory of incompatible elastic sheets. Scaling up of desired structures is demonstrated, including a method that copes with self-weight effects. Finally, a method for the construction of FRP surfaces with complex curvature distribution is presented, together with a software interface that allows the computation of the 3D surface for a given fiber pattern (the forward problem), as well as the fiber distribution required for a desired 3D shape (the inverse problem). This work shows the feasibility of large-scale self-morphing surfaces for architecture.},

The ScaffComb framework, which aims to bridge the gaps in the virtual screening of drug combinations in large-scale databases, is proposed here. Inspired by phenotype-based drug design, ScaffComb integrates phenotypic information into molecular scaffolds, which can be used to screen the drug library and identify potent drug combinations. First, ScaffComb is validated using the US food and drug administration dataset and known drug combinations are successfully reidentified. Then, ScaffComb is applied to screen the ZINC and ChEMBL databases, which yield novel drug combinations and reveal an ability to discover new synergistic mechanisms. To our knowledge, ScaffComb is the first method to use phenotype-based virtual screening of drug combinations in large-scale chemical datasets.},

Despite some success in diagnosis and vaccine development, there are still unmet needs to improve diagnostics and therapeutics for viral hepatitis and HCC. The emerging clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas) technology may open up a unique avenue to tackle these two diseases at the genetic level in a precise manner. Especially, liver is a more accessible organ over others from the delivery point of view, and many advanced strategies applied for nanotheranostics can be adapted in CRISPR-mediated diagnostics or liver gene editing. In this review, the focus is on these two aspects of viral hepatitis and HCC applications. An overview on CRISPR editor development and current progress in clinical trials is first given, followed by highlighting the recent advances integrating the merits of gene editing and nanotheranostics. The promising systems that are used in other applications but may hold potentials in liver gene editing are also discussed. This review concludes with the perspectives on rationally designing the next-generation CRISPR approaches and improving the editing performance.},

As for p-dopant, raising the electron affinity of a neutral compound through the dense introduction of electron-withdrawing group has always been the predominant strategy to achieve strong dopant. However, this simple and intuitive strategy faces extendibility, accessibility, and stability issues for further development. Herein, the use of dicationic state of tetraaryl benzidine (TAB 2+ ) in conjunction with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI − ) as a strong and atmospherically stable p-dopant (TAB–2TFSI), for which the concept is hinted from a rapid and spontaneous dimerization of radical cation dopant, is demonstrated. TAB–2TFSI possesses a large redox potential such that it would have deteriorated when in contact with H 2 O. However, no trace of degradation after 1 year of storage under atmospheric conditions is observed. When doping the state-of-the-art semiconducting polymer with TAB–2TFSI, a high doping level together with significantly enhanced crystallinity is achieved which led to an electrical conductivity as high as 656 S cm −1 . The concept of utilizing charged molecule as a dopant is highly versatile and will potentially accelerate the development of a strong yet stable dopant.},

  abstract     = {The absence of tumor antigens leads to a low response rate, which represents a major challenge in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Pyroptosis, which releases tumor antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that induce antitumor immunity and boost ICB efficiency, potentially leads to injury when occurring in normal tissues. Therefore, a strategy and highly efficient agent to induce tumor-specific pyroptosis but reduce pyroptosis in normal tissues is urgently required. Here, a smart tumor microenvironmental reactive oxygen species (ROS)/glutathione (GSH) dual-responsive nano-prodrug (denoted as MCPP) with high paclitaxel (PTX) and photosensitizer purpurin 18 (P18) loading is rationally designed. The ROS/GSH dual-responsive system facilitates the nano-prodrug response to high ROS/GSH in the tumor microenvironment and achieves optimal drug release in tumors. ROS generated by P18 after laser irradiation achieves controlled release and induces tumor cell pyroptosis with PTX by chemo-photodynamic therapy. Pyroptotic tumor cells release DAMPs, thus initiating adaptive immunity, boosting ICB efficiency, achieving tumor regression, generating immunological memory, and preventing tumor recurrence. Mechanistically, chemo-photodynamic therapy and control-release PTX synergistically induce gasdermin E (GSDME)-related pyroptosis. It is speculated that inspired chemo-photodynamic therapy using the presented nano-prodrug strategy can be a smart strategy to trigger pyroptosis and augment ICB efficiency.},

However, current targeting strategies mainly rely on surface modification with bioligands, which not only often fail to provide desired properties but also remain challenging. Here an unprecedented approach is reported, called reverse microemulsion-confined epitope-oriented surface imprinting and cladding (ROSIC), for facile, versatile, and controllable engineering coreless and core/shell nanoparticles with tunable monodispersed size as well as specific targeting capability toward proteins and peptides. Via engineering coreless imprinted and cladded silica nanoparticles, the effectiveness and superiority over conventional imprinting of the proposed approach are first verified. The prepared nanoparticles exhibit both high specificity and high affinity. Using quantum dots, superparamagnetic nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, and upconverting nanoparticles as a representative set of core substrates, a variety of imprinted and cladded single-core/shell nanoparticles are then successfully prepared. Finally, using imprinted and cladded fluorescent nanoparticles as probes, in vitro targeted imaging of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and in vivo targeted imaging of TNBC-bearing mice are achieved. This approach opens a new avenue to engineering of nanoparticles for targeting specific proteins, holding great prospects in biomedical applications.},

According to 3D morphology evolution, unusual mechanism based on synergetic effect of the diffusion of metallic Ti and local field enhancement is achieved utilizing a simulation method based on a finite element method. This approach allows for timely and accurately regulating the electrodeposition process upon in situ monitored parameters. More importantly, the 4D technique upon operando X-ray tomography and numerical simulation can be easily applied to other electrodeposition systems, which will help deeply understand the internal kinetics and the precise optimization of the electrodeposition conditions.},

Herein, a distinct W 1.33 C i -MXene with multiple theranostic functionalities, fast biodegradation, and satisfactory biocompatibility is explored. By designing a parent bulk laminate in-plane ordered (W 2/3 Y 1/3 ) 2 AlC ceramic and optionally etching aluminum (Al) and yttrium (Y) elements, 2D W 1.33 C i -MXene nanosheets with ordered divacancies are efficiently fabricated.

The constructed ultrathin W 1.33 C nanosheets feature excellent photothermal-conversion effectiveness (32.5% at NIR I and 49.3% at NIR II) with desirable biocompatibility and fast degradation in normal tissue rather than in tumor tissue. Importantly, the multimodal-imaging properties and photothermal-ablation performance of W 1.33 C-BSA nanosheets are systematically revealed and demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The underlying mechanism and regulation factors for the W 1.33 C-BSA nanosheets-induced hyperthermia ablation are also revealed by transcriptome and proteome sequencing.

Deletion of NPY in osteocytes generates a high bone mass phenotype, and attenuates aging- and ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone-fat imbalance in mice. Osteocyte NPY production is under the control of autonomic nervous system (ANS) and osteocyte NPY deletion blocks the ANS-induced regulation of BMSC fate and bone-fat balance. γ -Oryzanol, a clinically used ANS regulator, significantly increases bone formation and reverses aging- and OVX-induced osteocyte NPY overproduction and marrow adiposity in control mice, but not in mice lacking osteocyte NPY.

  abstract     = {The synergistic combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy has attracted considerable attention for its enhanced antitumoral effects; however, it remains challenging to successfully delivery photosensitizers and anticancer drugs while minimizing drug leakage at off-target sites. A red-light-activatable metallopolymer, Poly(Ru/PTX), is synthesized for combined chemo-photodynamic therapy. The polymer has a biodegradable backbone that contains a photosensitizer Ru complex and the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) via a singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) cleavable linker. The polymer self-assembles into nanoparticles, which can efficiently accumulate at the tumor sites during blood circulation. The distribution of the therapeutic agents is synchronized because the Ru complex and PTX are covalently conjugate to the polymer, and off-target toxicity during circulation is also mostly avoided. Red light irradiation at the tumor directly cleaves the Ru complex and produces 1 O 2 for photodynamic therapy. Sequentially, the generated 1 O 2 triggers the breakage of the linker to release the PTX for chemotherapy. Therefore, this novel sequential dual-model release strategy creates a synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy while minimizing drug leakage. This study offers a new platform to develop smart delivery systems for the on-demand release of therapeutic agents in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Activation of endothelial cells following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is thought to be the primary driver for the increasingly recognized thrombotic complications in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, potentially due to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Vaccination therapies use the same Spike sequence or protein to boost host immune response as a protective mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a result, cases of thrombotic events are reported following vaccination. Although vaccines are generally considered safe, due to genetic heterogeneity, age, or the presence of comorbidities in the population worldwide, the prediction of severe adverse outcome in patients remains a challenge. To elucidate Spike proteins underlying patient-specific-vascular thrombosis, the human microcirculation environment is recapitulated using a novel microfluidic platform coated with human endothelial cells and exposed to patient specific whole blood. Here, the blood coagulation effect is tested after exposure to Spike protein in nanoparticles and Spike variant D614G in viral vectors and the results are corroborated using live SARS-CoV-2. Of note, two potential strategies are also examined to reduce blood clot formation, by using nanoliposome-hACE2 and anti-Interleukin (IL) 6 antibodies.},

  abstract     = {Magnetically responsive structured surfaces enabling multifunctional droplet manipulation are of significant interest in both scientific and engineering research. To realize magnetic actuation, current strategies generally employ well-designed microarrays of high-aspect-ratio structure components (e.g., microcilia, micropillars, and microplates) with incorporated magnetism to allow reversible bending deformation driven by magnets. However, such magneto-responsive microarray surfaces suffer from highly restricted deformation range and poor control precision under magnetic field, restraining their droplet manipulation capability. Herein, a novel magneto-responsive shutter (MRS) design composed of arrayed microblades connected to a frame is developed for on-demand droplet manipulation. The microblades can perform two dynamical transformation operations, including reversible swing and rotation, and significantly, the transformation can be precisely controlled over a large rotation range with the highest rotation angle up to 3960°. Functionalized MRSs based on the above design, including Janus-MRS, superhydrophobic MRS (SHP-MRS) and lubricant infused slippery MRS (LIS-MRS), can realize a wide range of droplet manipulations, ranging from switchable wettability, directional droplet bounce, droplet distribution, and droplet merging, to continuous droplet transport along either straight or curved paths. MRS provides a new paradigm of using swing/rotation topographic transformation to replace conventional bending deformation for highly efficient and on-demand multimode droplet manipulation under magnetic actuation.},

Melt-extrusion-based processes, such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), which will allow facile manufacturing of large thin-walled components or simple multimaterial printing processes, are so far inaccessible for AM of transparent fused silica glass. Here, melt-extrusion-based AM of transparent fused silica is introduced by FDM and fused feedstock deposition (FFD) using thermoplastic silica nanocomposites that are converted to transparent glass using debinding and sintering. This will enable printing of previously inaccessible glass structures like high-aspect-ratio (&gt;480) vessels with wall thicknesses down to 250 µm, delicate parts including overhanging features using polymer support structures, as well as dual extrusion for multicolored glasses.},

In this work, the authors prepared Sn SACs consisting of atomically dispersed SnN 3 O 1 active sites supported on N-rich carbon matrix (Sn-NOC) for efficient electrochemical CO 2 reduction. Contrary to the classic Sn-N 4 configuration which gives HCOOH and H 2 as the predominant products, Sn-NOC with asymmetric atomic interface of SnN 3 O 1 gives CO as the exclusive product. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that the atomic arrangement of SnN 3 O 1 reduces the activation energy for *COO and *COOH formation, while increasing energy barrier for HCOO* formation significantly, thereby facilitating CO 2 -to-CO conversion and suppressing HCOOH production. This work provides a new way for enhancing the selectivity to a specific product by controlling individually the binding strength of each reactive intermediate on catalyst surface.},

In particular, the subthreshold switching properties are highlighted for low-power, energy-efficient device operations. State-of-the-art low-power SWCNT-based electronics and the key strategies to realize low-voltage and low-power operations are outlined.

This paper presents an efficient new strategy for the processing of wastewater utilizing an accessible redox reaction with MoSe 2 nanoflowers, which shows a strong oxidizing ability and permits the decomposition of dye molecules in dark environments without the need for an external power source. This reaction can treat wastewater at a decomposition rate above 0.077 min −1 , even when interacting with organic pollutants at concentrations up to 1500 ppm. Theoretical calculations by Dmol 3 simulation elucidates that the reactions proceed spontaneously, and the kinetic constant ( k obs ) for this redox reaction with 10 ppm RhB dye is 0.53 min −1 , which is 65 times faster than the titanium dioxide photocatalytic wastewater treatment. More importantly, the residual waste solution can be further utilized as a precursor to reconstruct the MoSe 2 nanoflowers. To demonstrate the effectiveness and reusability, the treated effluent is directly used as the sole source of irrigated water for plants with no adverse effect. This method offers an eco-friendly and more accessible way to treat industrial wastewater with zero-discharge.},

However, conventional trial-and-error strategy significantly slows down the development of SACs in Li–S batteries. Here, the Li 2 S oxidation processes over MN 4 @G catalysts are fully explored and energy barrier of Li 2 S decomposition ( E b ) is identified to correlate strongly with three parameters of energy difference between initial and final states of Li 2 S decomposition, reaction energy of Li 2 S oxidation and Li  S bond strength. These three parameters can serve as efficient descriptors by which two excellent SACs of MoN 4 @G and WN 4 @G are screened which give rise to E b values of 0.58 and 0.55 eV, respectively, outperforming other analogues in adsorbing LiPs and accelerating the redox kinetics of Li 2 S. This method can be extended to a wider range of SACs by coupling MN 4 moiety with heterostructures and heteroatoms beyond N where WN 4 @G/TiS 2 heterointerface is predicted to exhibit enhanced catalytic performance for Li 2 S decomposition with E b of 0.40 eV. This work will help accelerate the process of designing a wider range of efficient catalysts in Li–S batteries and even beyond, e.g. alkali-ion-Chalcogen batteries.},

The previous epidemiological study discovered a negative correlation between maternal exposure to a benzophenone metabolite 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4HBP) and child&#39;s neurodevelopment, yet the causal relationship and detailed mechanism remain to be defined. Here, it is reported that prenatal, but not postnatal, exposure to environmentally relevant level of 4HBP impairs hippocampus development and causes cognitive dysfunction in offspring mice. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that 4HBP induces the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptotic signaling and inflammatory response in hippocampal neural stem cells. Mechanistically, 4HBP exposure activates protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling, which induces CHOP, inhibits I κ B translation, and transactivates p65, thereby promoting inflammation and apoptosis on multiple levels. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PERK pathway significantly attenuates 4HBP-induced NF κ B signaling and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in mice and in a human brain organoid model. The study uncovers the neurodevelopmental toxicity of BP and cautions its exposure during pregnancy.},

Moreover, the metal oxide layer can function as a physical barrier to suppress the pernicious side reactions. Consequently, the proof-of-concept CeO 2 -modified Zn anode delivers ultrastable durability of over 1300 h at 0.5–5 mA cm −2 and improved Coulombic efficiency, the feasibility of which is also evidenced in MoS 2 //Zn full cells. This study enriches the fundamental comprehension of Ohmic contact interfaces on the Zn deposition, which may shed light on the development of other metal battery anodes.},

  abstract     = {Functional membranes generally wear out when applying in harsh conditions such as a strong acidic environment. In this work, high acid-resistance, long-lasting, and low-cost functional membranes are prepared from engineered hydrogen-bonding and pH-responsive supramolecular nanoparticle materials. As a proof of concept, the prepared membranes for dehydration of alcohols are utilized. The synthesized membranes have achieved a separation factor of 3000 when changing the feed solution pH from 7 to 1. No previous reports have demonstrated such unprecedentedly high-record separation performance (pervaporation separation index is around 1.1 × 10 7 g m −2 h −1 ). More importantly, the engineered smart membrane possesses fast self-repairing ability (48 h) that is inherited from the dynamic hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of polyacrylic acid and carbonyl groups of polyvinylpyrrolidone. To this end, the designed supramolecular materials offer the membrane community a new material type for preparing high acid resistance and long-lasting membranes for harsh environmental cleaning applications.},

It shows that mtNGS improves the ratio of microbial reads, facilitates bacterial identification using multiple-strategies, and discovers fungi, viruses, and antibiotic resistance genes, and displaying agreement with clinical findings. Furthermore, longer reads in mtTGS lead to additional improvement in pathogen identification and also accelerate the clinical diagnosis. Additionally, primary tests utilizing direct-RNA sequencing and targeted sequencing of ONT show that ONT displays important potential but must be further developed.

Recently, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens have shown great potential in the development of novel PSs owing to their excellent aggregation-induced ROS generation (AIG-ROS) activity. However, there are still concerns that must be addressed. In this study, two near-infrared (NIR) emitters (PI and PTI) are synthesized with AIG-ROS characteristic. PTI exhibit a valuable redder emission with more effective intersystem crossing (ISC) process than PI. The two AIE-active PSs show excellent lipid droplet (LD)-specific targeting ability. The detailed therapeutic mechanism of PDT in LDs specificity is also investigated. The mechanism of oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in LDs to form toxic lipid peroxides (LPOs) and thereby causing cellular ferroptosis is confirmed first. Homologous targeting is also used to achieve tumor targeting via coating PSs with active cancer cell membranes. Biomimetic aggregates exhibit good targeting ability, and an improved PDT antitumor effect via AIG-ROS activity. These findings offer a clear route to develop advanced PSs with good targeting specificity. A template has also been provided for studying the therapeutic mechanism of AIE-active PSs.},

  abstract     = {Li-CO 2 battery has attracted extensive attention and research due to its super high theoretical energy density and its ability to fix greenhouse gas CO 2 . However, the slow reaction kinetics during discharge/charge seriously limits its development. Hence, a simple cation exchange strategy is developed to introduce Ru atoms onto a Co 3 O 4 nanosheet array grown on carbon cloth (SA Ru-Co 3 O 4 /CC) to prepare a single atom site catalyst (SASC) and successfully used in Li-CO 2 battery. Li-CO 2 batteries based on SA Ru-Co 3 O 4 /CC cathode exhibit enhanced electrochemical performances including low overpotential, ultra high capacity, and long cycle life. Density functional theory calculations reveal that single atom Ru as the driving force center can significantly enhance the intrinsic affinity for key intermediates, thus enhancing the reaction kinetics of CO 2 reduction reaction in Li-CO 2 batteries, and ultimately optimizing the growth pathway of discharge products. In addition, the Bader charge analysis indicates that Ru atoms as electron-deficient centers can enhance the catalytic activity of SA Ru-Co 3 O 4 /CC cathode for the CO 2 evolution reaction. It is believed that this work has important implications for the development of new SASCs and the design of efficient catalyst for Li-CO 2 batteries.},

To obtain a subambient cooling effect during the daytime, chemically engineered structural materials are widely explored to simultaneously reject sunlight and preserve strong thermal emission. However, many previously reported fabrication processes involve hazardous chemicals, which can hinder a material&#39;s ability to be mass produced. In order to eliminate the hazardous chemicals used in the fabrication of previous works, this article reports a white polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sponge fabricated by a sustainable process using microsugar templates. By substituting the chemicals for sugar, the manufacturing procedure produces zero toxic waste and can also be endlessly recycled via methods widely used in the sugar industry. The obtained porous PDMS exhibits strong visible scattering and thermal emission, resulting in an efficient temperature reduction of 4.6 °C and cooling power of 43 W m −2 under direct solar irradiation. In addition, due to the air-filled voids within the PDMS sponge, its thermal conductivity remains low at 0.06 W (m K) −1 . This unique combination of radiative cooling and thermal insulation properties can efficiently suppress the heat exchange with the solar-heated rooftop or the environment, representing a promising future for new energy-efficient building envelope material.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical biosensors hold the exciting potential to integrate molecular detection with signal processing and wireless communication in a miniaturized, low-cost system. However, as electrochemical biosensors are miniaturized to the micrometer scale, their signal-to-noise ratio degrades and reduces their utility for molecular diagnostics. Studies have reported that nanostructured electrodes can improve electrochemical biosensor signals, but since the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, it remains difficult to fully exploit this phenomenon to improve biosensor performance. In this work, electrochemical aptamer biosensors on nanoporous electrode are optimized to achieve improved sensitivity by tuning pore size, probe density, and electrochemical measurement parameters. Further, a novel mechanism in which electron transfer is physically accelerated within nanostructured electrodes due to reduced charge screening, resulting in enhanced sensitivity is proposed and experimentally validated. In concert with the increased surface areas achieved with this platform, this newly identified effect can yield an up to 24-fold increase in signal level and nearly fourfold lower limit of detection relative to planar electrodes with the same footprint. Importantly, this strategy can be generalized to virtually any electrochemical aptamer sensor, enabling sensitive detection in applications where miniaturization is a necessity, and should likewise prove broadly applicable for improving electrochemical biosensor performance in general.},

Hence, fundamental understandings of such water and ion transport behaviors are of great significance for the continuous development of 2D material NF membranes. In this work, the microscopic understandings developed up to date on 2D material NF membranes regarding the abnormal transport phenomena are reviewed, including ultrafast water and ion permeation rates with the magnitude several orders higher than that predicted by conventional diffusion behavior, ion dehydration, ionic Coulomb blockade, ion–ion correlations, etc. The state-of-the-art structural designs for 2D material NF membranes are also reviewed.

Herein, for the first time, flexible all-inorganic yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/In 2 O 3 /graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) (ZIC) gas sensor is designed by employing YSZ nanofibers as substrate, and ultrathin In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures as active sensing layer. The YSZ substrate possesses small nanofiber diameter (310 nm), ultrafine grain size (23.9 nm), and abundant dangling bonds, endowing it with striking mechanical flexibility and strong adhesion with In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 sensing layer. Meanwhile, the ultrathin thickness (≈7 nm) of In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 ensures that the inorganic sensing layer has tiny linear strain along with the deformation of flexible YSZ substrate, thereby enabling unusual bending capacity. To address the operating temperature issue, the gas sensor is operated by using a visible-light-powered strategy. Under visible-light illumination, the flexible ZIC sensor exhibits a perfectly reversible response/recovery dynamic process and ultralow detection limit of 50 ppb to toxic nitrogen dioxide at room temperature. This work not only provides an insight into the mechanical flexibility of inorganic materials, but also offers a valuable reference for developing other flexible inorganic-semiconductor-based room-temperature gas sensors.},

Although both T-DM1 and Enhertu are approved as an HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), the effects of these drugs are still not satisfactory to eradicate diverse tumors expressing HER2. To address this shortfall in HER2-targeted therapeutics, an elaborate cleavable linker is created and a novel HER2-targeting ADC composed with trastuzumab and monomethyl auristatin F, which is being investigated in a phase 1 clinical trial and is referred to as LegoChem Bisciences-ADC (LCB-ADC). LCB-ADC displays a higher cytotoxic potency than T-DM1 and it also has a higher G2/M arrest ratio. In animal studies, LCB-ADC produces noticeable tumor growth inhibition compared with trastuzumab or T-DM1 in an HER2 high-expressing N87 xenograft tumor. Especially, LCB-ADC shows good efficacy in terms of suppressing tumor growth in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of HER2-positive gastric cancer as well as in T-DM1-resistant models such as HER2 low-expressing HER2 low expressing JIMT-1 xenograft tumor and PDX. Collectively, the results demonstrate that LCB-ADC with the elaborate linker has a higher efficacy and greater biostability than its ADC counterparts and may successfully treat cancers that are nonresponsive to previous therapeutics.},

Remarkable progress has been made over the past 10 years by doping ferroelectric ceramics into polymers because the dielectric constant is positively correlated with the energy storage density. However, this method often leads to an increase in dielectric loss and a decrease in energy storage efficiency. Therefore, the way of using a multilayer structure to improve the energy storage density of the dielectric has attracted the attention of researchers. Although research on energy storage properties using multilayer dielectric is just beginning, it shows the excellent effect and huge potential. In this review, the main physical mechanisms of polarization, breakdown and energy storage in multilayer structure dielectric are introduced, the theoretical simulation and experimental results are systematically summarized, and the preparation methods and design ideas of multilayer structure dielectrics are mainly described.

Thus, herein, to simplify the research, the typical Fe–N–C material with the relatively simple constitution and structure, is selected as a model catalyst for TM–H–C to explore and improve the stability of such a kind of catalysts. Then, different types of active sites (centers) and coordination in Fe–N–C are systematically summarized and discussed, and the possible attenuation mechanism and strategies are analyzed. Finally, some challenges faced by such catalysts and their prospects are proposed to shed some light on the future development trend of TM–H–C materials for advanced ORR catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Most materials recently developed for room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) lack in practical relevance due to their inconvenient crystalline morphology. Using amorphous material systems instead, programmable luminescent tags (PLTs) based on organic biluminescent emitter molecules with easy processing and smooth sample shapes are presented recently. Here, the effective quenching of the emitter&#39;s RTP by molecular oxygen (O 2 ) and the consumption of the excited singlet O 2 through a chemical reaction represent the central features. With customized activation schemes, high-resolution content can be written and later erased multiple times into such films, providing a versatile yet simple photonic platform for information storage. However, two important limitations remain: The immutable fluorescence of the emitters outshines the phosphorescent patterns by roughly one order of magnitude, allowing readout of the PLTs only after the excitation source is turned off. The programming of these systems is a rather slow process, where lowest reported activation times are still &gt;8 s. Here, a material-focused approach to PLTs with fast activation times of 120 ± 20 ms and high-contrast under continuous-wave illumination is demonstrated, leading to accelerated programming on industry relevant time scales and a simplified readout process both by eye and low cost cameras.},

  abstract     = {Introducing artificial strain in epitaxial thin films is an effective strategy to alter electronic structures of transition metal oxides (TMOs) and to induce novel phenomena and functionalities not realized in bulk crystals. This study reports a breaking of the conventional trade-off relation in thermopower ( S )–conductivity ( σ ) and demonstrates a 2 orders of magnitude enhancement of power factor (PF) in compressively strained LaTiO 3 (LTO) films. By varying substrates and reducing film thickness down to 4 nm, the out-of-plane to the in-plane lattice parameter ratio is controlled from 0.992 (tensile strain) to 1.034 (compressive strain). This tuning induces the electronic structure change from a Mott insulator to a metal and leads to a 10 3 -fold increase in σ up to 2920 S cm −1 . Concomitantly, the sign of S inverts from positive to negative, and both σ and S increase and break the trade-off relation between them in the n-type region. As a result, the PF (= S 2 σ ) is significantly enhanced to 300 µW m − 1 K −2 , which is 10 2 times larger than that of bulk LTO. Present results propose epitaxial strain as a means to finely tune strongly correlated TMOs close to their Mott transition, and thus to harness the hidden large thermoelectric PF.},

Nonetheless, these ideal prospects are hindered by the difficulties in photodetection featuring self-powered operation at room temperature. Here, this challenge is addressed for the first time by synthesizing the high-quality ZrGeSe with extraordinary quantum properties of Dirac nodal-line semimetal. Benefiting from its high mobility and gapless nature, a metal-ZrGeSe-metal photodetector with broken mirror symmetry allows for a high-efficiency photoelectric conversion assisted by the photo-thermoelectric effect. The designed architecture features ultrahigh sensitivity, excellent ambient stability, and an efficient rectified signal even above 0.26 THz. Maximum responsivity larger than 0.11 A W −1 , response time of 8.3 µs, noise equivalent power (NEP) less than 0.15 nW Hz −1/2 , and demonstrative imaging application are all achieved. The superb performances with a lower dark current and NEP less than 15 pW Hz −1/2 are validated through integrating the van der Waals heterostructure. These results open up an appealing perspective to explore the nontrivial topology of Dirac nodal-line semimetal by devising the peculiar device geometry that allows for a novel roadmap to address targeted terahertz application requirements.},

  abstract     = {The authors reveal a thermal actuating bilayer that undergoes reversible deformation in response to low-energy thermal stimuli, for example, a few degrees of temperature increase. It is made of an aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheet covalently connected to a polymer layer in which dibenzocycloocta-1,5-diene (DBCOD) actuating units are oriented parallel to CNTs. Upon exposure to low-energy thermal stimulation, coordinated submolecular-level conformational changes of DBCODs result in macroscopic thermal contraction. This unique thermal contraction offers distinct advantages. It&#39;s inherently fast, repeatable, low-energy driven, and medium independent. The covalent interface and reversible nature of the conformational change bestow this bilayer with excellent repeatability, up to at least 70 000 cycles. Unlike conventional CNT bilayer systems, this system can achieve high precision actuation readily and can be scaled down to nanoscale. A new platform made of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in tandem with the bilayer can harvest low-grade thermal energy and convert it into electricity. The platform produces 86 times greater energy than PVDF alone upon exposure to 6 °C thermal fluctuations above room temperature. This platform provides a pathway to low-grade thermal energy harvesting. It also enables low-energy driven thermal artificial robotics, ultrasensitive thermal sensors, and remote controlled near infrared (NIR) driven actuators.},

The VONWs directly grown on a cellulose fiber network increase the surface area up to 30-fold and boost the hydrophilicity owing to the presence of oxygen-rich functional groups in the nanowire surfaces. Taking advantage of the high surface area and hydrophilicity of VONWs, a soft thermo-hygroscopic VONW actuator capable of being controlled by both light and electric sources shows greatly enhanced actuation deformation by almost 70% and increased actuation speed over 3 times during natural convection cooling. Most importantly, the proposed VONW actuator exhibits a remarkably improved blocking force of up to 200% compared with a bare paper actuator under light stimulation, allowing them to realize a complex kirigami pop-up and to accomplish repeatable shape transformation from a 2D planar surface to a 3D configuration.},

However, the cathode structure collapse caused by H 2 O co-insertion in aqueous solution dramatically deteriorates the electrochemical performance and hampers the operation reliability of V 2 O 5 –Zn batteries. The real-time phase tracking and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation prove the high energy barrier that inhibits the Zn 2+ diffusion into the bulk V 2 O 5 , instead the ZnCl 2 “water-in-salt electrolyte” (WiSE) can enable the dominant proton insertion with negligible lattice strain or particle fragment. Thus, ZnCl 2 WiSE enables the enhanced reversibility and extended shelf life of the V 2 O 5 –Zn battery upon the high temperature storage. The improved electrochemical performance also benefits by the inhibition of vanadium cation dissolution, enlarged voltage window, as well as the suppression of the Zn dendrite protrusion.

At first, its rapid biocorrosion contributes to a burst release of Mg 2+ , leading to a pro-osteogenic immune microenvironment in bone. Meanwhile, with the simultaneous intervention of Ca and Si in the secondary phases of the new alloy, a hierarchical layered calcified matrix is rapidly formed at the degrading interface that favored the subsequent bone mineralization. In contrast, pure Mg or Mg–0.2Si alloy without the development of this interface at the beginning will unavoidably induce detrimental bone loss.

However, the practical application of LMAs is hampered by the short lifespan and unsatisfactory lithium utilization (&lt;50%). An oxide–oxide heterojunction enhanced with nanochamber structure design is proposed to improve lithium utilization and cycling performance of LMA under ultrahigh rates. Typically, a MnO 2 –ZnO heterojunction provides high binding energy for strong absorption of Li-ions and intimately bonded interfaces for fast transfer of electrons. Under the guidance of the smooth Li-ion migration and rapid electron flow, the Li metal can be restricted as thin layers within submicro scale in nanochambers with constrain boundary and stress dissipation, inhibiting the local agglomeration and blocking. Thus, the lithiophilic active sites can be effectively exposed to the Li-ions within submicro scale, improving the reversible conversion for high lithium utilization during long-term cycling. As such, the Li@MnZnO/CNF electrode achieves a high lithium utilization of 70% at a record-high current density of 50 mA cm −2 with areal capacity of 10 mAh cm −2 . This work offers an avenue to improve lithium utilization for long-lifespan LMAs working under high current densities and capacities.},

Here, a strategy to reliably isolate matching pairs of invasive (GBM INV ) and tumor core (GBM TC ) cells from the brains of 6 highly invasive patient-derived orthotopic models is described. Direct comparison of these GBM INV and GBM TC cells reveals a significantly elevated invasion capacity in GBM INV cells, detects 23/768 miRNAs over-expressed in the GBM INV cells (miRNA INV ) and 22/768 in the GBM TC cells (miRNA TC ), respectively. Silencing the top 3 miRNAs INV (miR-126, miR-369-5p, miR-487b) successfully blocks invasion of GBM INV cells in vitro and in mouse brains. Integrated analysis with mRNA expression identifies miRNA INV target genes and discovers KCNA1 as the sole common computational target gene of which 3 inhibitors significantly suppress invasion in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) effectively eliminates GBM invasion and significantly prolongs animal survival times ( P = 0.035). The results highlight the power of spatial dissection of functionally accurate GBM INV and GBM TC cells in identifying novel drivers of GBM invasion and provide strong rationale to support the use of biologically accurate starting materials in understanding cancer invasion and metastasis.},

Therefore, comparing molecular processes known to be involved in both systems separately can provide insight into promising areas of future research. Since development and regeneration share many mechanisms, comparing signaling molecules involved in both the developing vascular and nervous systems and shedding light to those that they have in common can reveal processes, which have not yet been studied from a regenerative perspective, yet hold great potential. Hence, this review discusses and compares processes involved in the development of the vascular and nervous systems, in order to provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms, which are most promising with regards to treatment for neurovascular disorders. Vascular endothelial growth factor, semaphorins, and ephrins are found to hold the most potential, while fibroblast growth factor, bone morphogenic protein, slits, and sonic hedgehog are shown to participate in both the developing vascular and nervous systems, yet have not been studied at the neurovascular level, therefore being of special interest for future research.},

  abstract     = {Cell membrane vesicles (CMVs) are composed of natural cell membranes which makes them effective drug delivery systems with low immunogenicity and prolonged circulation time. However, targeting delivery of CMVs in vivo for clinical applications is still a major challenge. In this study, CXCR4 recombinant lentivirus is transfected into MC-3T3 cells and membrane CXCR4-enriched MC-3T3 cells are obtained. CMVs with enriched membrane CXCR4 display (CXCR4-CMVs) are obtained from the transfected MC-3T3 cells. Curcumin, an effective natural anti-inflammatory compound, is encapsulated into CXCR4-CMVs through physical entrapment (CXCR4/Cur-CMVs), with the membrane integrity of CXCR4/Cur-CMVs being well-preserved. CXCR4/Cur-CMVs induce enhanced M2 macrophage polarization, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, and significantly improve homing via the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in vitro. Utilizing ulcerative colitis and apical periodontitis as inflammatory disease models, it is found that CXCR4/Cur-CMVs are obviously aggregated within inflammatory areas after intravenous administration, which results in significant amelioration of ulcerative colitis and apical periodontitis. Therefore, this research may provide a feasible and innovative approach for fabricating an inflammatory site-targeting delivery system, by engineering CMVs to increase membrane-presenting CXCR4 receptor.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid integration of n-type oxide with p-type polymer transistors is an attractive approach for realizing high performance complementary circuits on flexible substrates. However, the stability of solution-processed oxide transistors is limiting the lifetime and reliability of such circuits. Oxygen vacancies are the main defect degrading metal oxide transistor performance when ambient oxygen adsorbs onto metal oxide films. Here, an effective surface passivation treatment based on negative oxygen ion exposure combined with UV light is demonstrated, that is able to significantly reduce surface oxygen vacancy concentration and improve the field effect mobility to values up to 41 cm 2 V −1 s −1 with high on–off current ratio of 10 8 . The treatment also reduces the threshold voltage shift after 2 days in air from 5 to 0.07 V. The improved stability of the oxide transistors also improves the lifetime of hybrid complementary circuits and stable operation of complementary, analog amplifiers is confirmed for 60 days in air. The suggested approach is facile and can be widely applicable for flexible electronics using low-temperature solution-processed metal oxide semiconductors.},

This work shows a direct connection between magnetic response functions in mechanically strained samples of Mn 3 O 4 and MnV 2 O 4 and stripe-like patternings of the bulk magnetization which appear below known magnetostructural transitions. Building off previous magnetic force microscopy data, a small-angle neutron scattering is used to show that these patterns represent distinctive magnetic phenomena which extend throughout the bulk of two separate materials, and further are controllable via applied magnetic field and mechanical stress. These results are unambiguously connected to the anomalously large magnetoelastic and magnetodielectric response functions reported for these materials, by performing susceptibility measurements on the same crystals and directly correlating local and macroscopic data.},

However, direct observation of the detailed chronological protein searching image is still a formidable challenge. Here, for the first time, a single-molecule electrical monitoring technique is utilized to realize label-free detection of the DBP–DNA interaction process based on high-gain silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (SiNW FETs). The whole binding process of WRKY domain and DNA has been visualized with high sensitivity and single-base resolution. Impressively, the swinging of hydrogen bonds between amino acid residues and bases in DNA induce the dynamic collective motion of DBP–DNA.

The traditional trial-and-error method has been unprecedentedly challenged in the modern era when the number of components and phases in novel alloys keeps increasing, with high-entropy alloys as the representative. New opportunities emerge for alloy design in the artificial intelligence era. Here, a successful machine-learning (ML) method has been developed to identify the microstructure images with eye-challenging morphology for a number of martensitic and ferritic steels. Assisted by it, a new neural-network method is proposed for the inverse design of alloys with 20 components, which can accelerate the design process based on microstructure. The method is also readily applied to other material systems given sufficient microstructure images. This work lays the foundation for inverse alloy design based on microstructure images with extremely similar features.},

  abstract     = {Lipid-based nanoparticles have been applied extensively in drug delivery and vaccine strategies and are finding diverse applications in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic—from vaccine-component encapsulation to modeling the virus, itself. High-throughput, highly flexible methods for characterization are of great benefit to the development of liposomes featuring surface proteins. DNA-directed patterning is one such method that offers versatility in immobilizing and segregating lipid-based nanoparticles for subsequent analysis. Here, oligonucleotides are selectively conjugated onto a glass substrate and then hybridized to complementary oligonucleotides tagged to liposomes, patterning them with great control and precision. The power of DNA-directed patterning is demonstrated by characterizing a novel recapitulative lipid-based nanoparticle model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—S–liposomes—that presents the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein on its surface. Patterning a mixture of S–liposomes and liposomes that display the tetraspanin CD63 to discrete regions of a substrate shows that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) specifically binds to S–liposomes. Subsequent introduction of S–liposomes to ACE2-expressing cells tests the biological function of S–liposomes and shows agreement with DNA-directed patterning-based assays. Finally, multiplexed patterning of S–liposomes verifies the performance of commercially available neutralizing antibodies against the two S variants. Overall, DNA-directed patterning enables a wide variety of custom assays for the characterization of any lipid-based nanoparticle.},

HEAs with body-centered-cubic (BCC) or hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) structures are proven to possess high strength and hardness but low ductility. The faced-centered-cubic (FCC) HEAs present considerable ductility, excellent corrosion and radiation resistance. However, their strengths are relatively low. Therefore, the strategy of strengthening the ductile FCC matrix phase is usually adopted to design HEAs with excellent performance. Among various strengthening methods, precipitation strengthening plays a dazzling role since the characteristics of multiple principal elements and slow diffusion effect of elements in HEAs provide a chance to form fine and stable nanoscale precipitates, pushing the strengths of the alloys to new high levels. This paper summarizes and review the recent progress in nanoprecipitate-strengthened HEAs and their strengthening mechanisms. The alloy-design strategies and control of the nanoscale precipitates in HEAs are highlighted. The future works on the related aspects are outlined.},

  abstract     = {Dysregulation of the cell cycle machinery leads to genomic instability and is a hallmark of cancer associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Identifying and targeting aberrant cell cycle machinery is expected to improve current therapies for CRC patients. Here,upregulated polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) signaling, accompanied by deregulation of cell cycle-related pathways in CRC is identified. It is shown that aberrant PLK1 signaling correlates with recurrence and poor prognosis in CRC patients. Genetic and pharmacological blockade of PLK1 significantly increases the sensitivity to oxaliplatin in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, transcriptomic profiling analysis reveals that cell cycle-related pathways are activated by oxaliplatin treatment but suppressed by a PLK1 inhibitor. Cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) is further identified as a critical downstream effector of PLK1 signaling, which is transactivated via the PLK1-MYC axis. Increased CDC7 expression is also found to be positively correlated with aberrant PLK1 signaling in CRC and is associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, a CDC7 inhibitor synergistically enhances the anti-tumor effect of oxaliplatin in CRC models, demonstrating the potential utility of targeting the PLK1-MYC-CDC7 axis in the treatment of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Recently, viral infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and Influenza, are the subjects of major concerns worldwide. One strategy for addressing these concerns focuses on nasal vaccines, which have great potential for achieving successful immunization via safe, easy, and affordable approaches. However, conventional nasal vaccines have major limitations resulting from fast removal when pass through nasal mucosa and mucociliary clearance hindering their effectiveness. Herein a nanoparticulate vaccine (NanoVac) exhibiting photochemical immunomodulation and constituting a new self-assembled immunization system of a photoactivatable polymeric adjuvant with influenza virus hemagglutinin for efficient nasal delivery and antigen-specific immunity against pathogenic influenza viruses is described. NanoVac increases the residence period of antigens and further enhances by spatiotemporal photochemical modulation in the nasal cavity. As a consequence, photochemical immunomodulation of NanoVacs successfully induces humoral and cellular immune responses followed by stimulation of mature dendritic cells, plasma cells, memory B cells, and CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, resulting in secretion of antigen-specific immunoglobulins, cytokines, and CD8 + T cells. Notably, challenge with influenza virus after nasal immunization with NanoVacs demonstrates robust prevention of viral infection. Thus, this newly designed vaccine system can serve as a promising strategy for developing vaccines that are active against current hazardous pathogen outbreaks and pandemics.},

  abstract     = {While decades of research have enriched the knowledge of how to grow cells into mature tissues, little is yet known about the next phase: fusing of these engineered tissues into larger functional structures. The specific effect of multicellular interfaces on tissue fusion remains largely unexplored. Here, a facile 3D-bioassembly platform is introduced to primarily study fusion of cartilage–cartilage interfaces using spheroids formed from human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) and articular chondrocytes (hACs). 3D-bioassembly of two adjacent hMSCs spheroids displays coordinated migration and noteworthy matrix deposition while the interface between two hAC tissues lacks both cells and type-II collagen. Cocultures contribute to increased phenotypic stability in the fusion region while close initial contact between hMSCs and hACs (mixed) yields superior hyaline differentiation over more distant, indirect cocultures. This reduced ability of potent hMSCs to fuse with mature hAC tissue further underlines the major clinical challenge that is integration. Together, this data offer the first proof of an in vitro 3D-model to reliably study lateral fusion mechanisms between multicellular spheroids and mature cartilage tissues. Ultimately, this high-throughput 3D-bioassembly model provides a bridge between understanding cellular differentiation and tissue fusion and offers the potential to probe fundamental biological mechanisms that underpin organogenesis.},

Here, the successful construction of CuO@CoOOH p-n heterojunction (i.e., p-type CuO and n-type CoOOH) nanoarray electrocatalyst through an in situ anodic oxidation of CuO@CoS x on copper foam is reported. The p-n heterojunction can remarkably modify the electronic properties of the space-charge region and facilitate the electron transfer. Moreover, in situ Raman study reveals the generation of SO 4 2− from CoS x oxidation, and electron cloud density distribution and density functional theory calculation suggest that surface-adsorbed SO 4 2− can facilitate the OER process by enhancing the adsorption of OH − . The positively charged CoOOH in the space-charge region can significantly enhance the OER activity. As a result, the CuO@CoOOH p-n heterojunction shows significantly enhanced OER performance with a low overpotential of 186 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . The successful preparation of a large scale (14 × 25 cm 2 ) sample demonstrates the possibility of promoting the catalyst to industrial-scale production. This study offers new insights into the design and fabrication of non-noble metal-based p-n heterojunction electrocatalysts as effective catalytic materials for energy storage and conversion.},

In this work, MnCo 2 S 4 -CoS 1.097 nanotubes are successfully prepared via a reflux- hydrothermal process. This novel cathode catalyst delivers high discharge/charge specific capacities of 21 765/21 746 mAh g −1 at 200 mA g −1 and good rate capability. In addition, a favorable cycling stability with a fixed specific capacity of 1000 mAh g −1 at high current density of 1000 mA g −1 (167 cycles) and 2000 mA g −1 (57 cycles) are delivered. It is proposed that fast transmission of ions and electrons accelerated by the built-in electric field, multiple active sites from the heterostructure, and nanotube architecture with large specific surface area are responsible for the superior electrochemical performance.

Recent methods combining organoid technology with cell fate reprogramming hold promise for developing new regenerative methods for SwG regeneration. Here, a practical strategy for engineering functional human SwGs in vitro and in vivo is provided. First, by forced expression of the ectodysplasin-A in human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) combined with specific SwG culture medium, HEKs are efficiently converted into SwG cells (iSwGCs). The iSwGCs show typical morphology, gene expression pattern, and functions resembling human primary SwG cells. Second, by culturing the iSwGCs in a special 3D culturing system, SwG organoids (iSwGOs) that exhibit structural and biological features characteristic of native SwGs are obtained. Finally, these iSwGOs are successfully transplanted into a mouse skin damage model and they develop into fully functioning SwGs in vivo. Regeneration of functional SwG organoids from reprogrammed HEKs highlights the great translational potential for personalized SwG regeneration in patients with large skin defects.},

Here, orientationally ordered nematic colloidal dispersions are reported of pentagonal gold bipyramids that exhibit narrow but controlled polarization-dependent surface plasmon resonance spectra and facile electric switching. Bipyramids tend to orient with their C 5 rotation symmetry axes along the nematic director, exhibiting spatially homogeneous density within aligned samples. Topological solitons, like heliknotons, allow for spatial reorganization of these nanoparticles according to elastic free energy density within their micrometer-scale structures. With the nanoparticle orientations slaved to the nematic director and being switched by low voltages ≈1 V within a fraction of a second, these plasmonic composite materials are of interest for technological uses like color filters and plasmonic polarizers, as well as may lead to the development of unusual nematic phases, like pentatic liquid crystals.},

The SnO 2 -embedded nuclei remarkably improve the morphology and crystallinity of the optically active perovskite layers. The improved ETL-to-perovskite electrical contact and dense packing of large-grained perovskites enhance the carrier mobility and suppress charge recombination. The power conversion efficiency increases from 20.12% (blank device) to 21.87% (21.72%) for devices with MACl (FACl) as an ETL dopant.

However, since CdSe and CdS have the same crystal structure, same cations, and similar lattice parameters, it is very challenging to image the interface. Herein, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, high-angle annular dark-field imaging, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping are combined to characterize the core@shell structure and identify the interface in the CdSe@CdS QDs with different CdS shell thicknesses. By examining changes in lattice spacing in an individual CdSe@CdS quantum dot, the atomic core@shell interface is identified. For thin-shelled QDs, an ideal coherent interface forms between core and shell due to the small lattice mismatch, and the lattice spacing remains unchanged at the core and shell regions. For thick-shelled QDs, the lattice spacing is different at the core and shell regions, while the heterostructured interface is still coherent and cannot be clearly imaged. As the shell thickness further increases, a sharp core@shell interface appears. The results define an approach to characterize the heterostructure of two materials with the same crystalline structure and cations.},

It is hypothesized that NPCs are critical for malignant transformation and survival of lung cancer cells, and test the hypothesis in lowly and highly metastatic non-small human lung cancer cells (NSCLCs). It is shown that malignant transformation is paralleled by an increased NPCs density, and a balanced pathological weakening of the physiological stringency of the NPC barrier. Pharmacological interference using barrier-breaking compounds collapses the stringency. Concomitantly, it induces drastic overall structural changes of NSCLCs, terminating their migration. Moreover, the degree of malignancy is found to be paralleled by substantially decreased lamin A/C levels. The latter provides crucial structural and mechanical stability to the nucleus, and interacts with NPCs, cytoskeleton, and nucleoskeleton for cell maintenance, survival, and motility. The recent study reveals the physiological importance of the NPC barrier stringency for mechanical and structural resilience of normal cell nuclei. Hence, reduced lamin A/C levels in conjunction with controlled pathological weakening of the NPC barrier stringency may facilitate deformability of NSCLCs during the metastasis steps. Modulation of the NPC barrier presents a potential strategy for suppressing the malignant phenotype or enhancing the effectiveness of currently existing chemotherapeutics.},

Herein, a self-stabilized supramolecular assembly (SSA) constructed from a PEGylated dendritic peptide conjugate (PEG-dendritic peptide-pyropheophorbide a, PDPP), for augmenting tumor retention and therapy, is reported. The supramolecular self-assembly process of PDPP is concentration-dependent with multiple morphologies. By tailoring the concentration of PDPP, the supramolecular self-assembly is driven by noncovalent interactions to form a variety of SSAs (unimolecular micelles, oligomeric aggregates, and multi-aggregates) with different sizes from nanometer to micrometer. SSAs at 100 nm with a spherical shape possess extremely high stability to prolong blood circulation about 4.8-fold higher than pyropheophorbide a (Ppa), and enhance tumor retention about eight-fold higher than Ppa on day 5 after injection, which leads to greatly boosting the in vivo photodynamic therapeutic efficiency. RNA-seq demonstrates that these effects of SSAs are related to the inhibition of MET-PI3K-Akt pathway. Overall, the supramolecular self-assembly mechanism for the synthetic PEGylated dendritic peptide conjugate sheds new light on the development of supramolecular assemblies for tumor therapy.},

As Co doping level increases, PSCxFN thin films exhibit higher concentration of oxygen vacancies ( V o • • ) as revealed by X-ray diffraction and synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculation results suggest that Co doping leads to more distortion in Fe  O octahedra and weaker metal  oxygen bonds caused by the increase of antibonding state, thereby lowering formation energy. As a consequence, PSCxFN thin film with higher Co-doping level presents larger amount of exsolved particles on the surface. Both the facilitated formation and B-site cation exsolution lead to the enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity. Excessive Co doping until 70%, nevertheless, results in partial decomposition of thin film and degrades the stability. Pr 0.4 S r0.6 (Co 0.2 Fe 0.7 Nb 0.1 )O 3 with moderate Co doping level displays both good HOR activity and stability. This work clarifies the critical role of B-site cation doping in determining the formation process, the surface activity, and structure stability of perovskite oxides.},

  abstract     = {With the advantage of reversible shape-morphing between two different permanent shapes under external stimuli, the two-way shape-memory aerogel is expected to become a preferred aerogel for developing practical applications in actuators, sensors, robotics, and more. Herein, the first two-way shape-memory liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)-based aerogel is prepared by an orthogonal heat and light curing strategy coupled with an intermediate mechanical stretching step. The differential scanning calorimetry, temperature-varied wide-angle X-ray scattering, and polarizing optical microscope results indicate that the aerogel possesses a liquid crystal phase and the insider mesogens are well-oriented along the stretching direction. In addition to having superior compressibility and excellent shape stability, this LCE-based aerogel can perform a reversible shape deformation during the heating/cooling cycles with a shrinkage ratio of 37%. The work, that is disclosed here, realizes a truly two-way shape-memory behavior rather than the one-way shape deformation of traditional polymer aerogel materials, and may promote potential applications of this novel LCE-based aerogel material in control devices, soft actuators, and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Necrosis induces strong inflammation with undesirable implications in clinics compared with apoptosis. Fortunately, the switch between necrosis and apoptosis could be realized by tailoring the appropriate structural properties of gold nano rods (GNRs) that could precisely modulate cell death pathways. Herein, the intracellular interaction between GNRs and organelles is monitored and it is found that lysosomes dominates necrosis/apoptosis evoking. Then the surface molecule density of GNRs, which is first defined as ρ surf. molecule ( N surf. molecules /( a × π × Diameter × Length)), mediates lysosome activities as the membrane permeabilization (LMP), the Cathepsin B and D release, the cross-talk between lysosome and different organelles, which selectively evokes apoptosis or necrosis and the production of TNF- α from macrophages. GNRs with small ρ surf. molecule mainly induce apoptosis, while with large ρ surf. molecule they greatly contribute to necrosis. Interestingly, necrosis can be suppressed by GNRs with higher ρ surf. molecule due to the overexpression of key protease caspase 8, which cleaves the RIP1-RIP3 complex and activates caspase 3 followed by necrosis to apoptosis transition. This investigation indicates that the ρ surf. molecule greatly affects the utility of nanomaterials and different structural properties of nanomaterials have different implications in clinics.},

As breakthrough concepts, i) living cancer tissues convey intact profiles of patient-specific microenvironmental signatures. ii) The growth mechanisms of cancer mass with intense cell-cell interactions can be harnessed to develop self-homing nano-targeting by using cancer cell-derived nanovesicles (CaNVs). Hence, a tissueoid model of ovarian cancer (OC) is developed by culturing OC patient tissues in a 3D gel chip, whose microchannel networks enable perfusion to maintain tissue viability. A novel model of systemic cancer responses is approached by xenografting OC tissueoids into ischaemic hindlimbs in nude mice. CaNVs are produced to carry general chemotherapeutics or new drugs under pre/clinical studies that target the BRCA mutation or energy metabolism, thereby increasing the test scope. This pioneer study cross-validates drug responses from the OC clinic, tissueoid, and animal model by demonstrating the alignment of results in drug type-specific efficiency, BRCA mutation-dependent drug efficiency, and metabolism inhibition-based anti-cancer effects. Hence, this study provides a directional foundation to accelerate the discovery of patient-specific drugs with CaNV application towards future precision medicine.},

  abstract     = {Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells can generate high power using a potentially green fuel (H 2 ) and zero emissions of greenhouse gas (CO 2 ). However, significant mass transport resistances in the interface region of the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), between the membrane and the catalyst layers remains a barrier to achieving MEAs with high power densities and long-term stabilities. Here, a 3D-interfacial zipping concept is presented to overcome this challenge. Vinylbenzyl-terminated bi-cationic quaternary-ammonium-based polyelectrolyte is employed as both the anionomer in the anion-exchange membrane (AEM) and catalyst layers. A quaternary-ammonium-containing covalently locked interface is formed by thermally induced inter-crosslinking of the terminal vinyl groups. Ex situ evaluation of interfacial bonding strength and in situ durability tests demonstrate that this 3D-zipped interface strategy prevents interfacial delamination without any sacrifice of fuel cell performance. A H 2 /O 2 AEMFC test demonstration shows promisingly high power densities (1.5 W cm −2 at 70 °C with 100% RH and 0.2 MPa backpressure gas feeds), which can retain performances for at least 120 h at a usefully high current density of 0.6 A cm −2 .},

Proton conduction, extensively studied in the analogue metal-organic frameworks under high-humidity conditions, is however largely unexplored in spite of the opportunities provided by the particular sensitivity of npCPs to lattice perturbations. Here, AC admittance spectroscopy is used to unveil the mechanism behind charge transport in the nonporous 1 ·2CH 3 CN. The conductance in the crystals is found to be of protonic origin. A vehicle mechanism is triggered by the dynamics of the weakly coupled acetonitrile molecules in the lattice that can be maintained by a combination of thermal cycles, even at low humidity levels. An analogue 1 ·pyrrole npCP is formed by in situ exchange of these weakly bound acetonitrile molecules by pyrrole. The color and conduction properties are determined by the molecules weakly bonded in the lattice. This is the first example of acetonitrile-mediated proton transport in an npCP showing distinct optical response to different molecules. These findings open the door to the design of switchable protonic conductors and capacitive sensors working at low humidity levels and with selectivity to different molecules.},

The molecular determinants of radiation response remain unclear. AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are key players in innate immunity and determine the course of infections, inflammatory diseases, senescence, and cancer. Here it is reported that mice lacking ALRs are resistant to irradiation-induced BM injury. It is shown that nuclear ALRs are inhibitors of DNA repair, thereby accelerate genome destabilization, micronuclei generation, and cell death, and that this novel function is uncoupled from their role in innate immunity. Mechanistically, ALRs bind to and interfere with chromatin decompaction vital for DNA repair. The finding uncovers ALRs as targets for new interventions against genotoxic tissue injury and as possible biomarkers for predicting the outcome of radio/chemotherapy.},

The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 33.3 mV for acidic solution, while 65.1 mV for alkaline solution at a specific current density of 10 mA cm −2 . This study not only paves a scalable pathway to developing cost-efficient catalysts in moderate conditions, but also demonstrates an effective surface modulation strategy for 0D/1D heterostructures.},

Using unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analyses (scRNA-seq), the effects of MO on the myogenic process is investigated in embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) mouse embryos. The results suggest that MO induces systematic hypoxia, which is correlated with enhanced BMP signaling and impairs skeletal muscle differentiation within the dermomyotome (DM). The Notch-signaling effectors, HES1 and HEY1, which also act down-stream of BMP signaling, suppress myogenic differentiation through transcriptionally repressing the important myogenic regulator MEF2C. Moreover, the major hypoxia effector, HIF1A, enhances expression of HES1 and HEY1 and blocks myogenic differentiation in vitro. In summary, this data demonstrate that MO induces hypoxia and impairs myogenic differentiation by up-regulating BMP signaling within the DM, which may account for the disruptions of skeletal muscle development and function in progeny.},

  abstract     = {Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have been widely used in photovoltaic technologies. Despite tremendous progress in their efficiency and stability, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still facing the challenges of upscaling and stability for practical applications. As a mature film preparation technology, magnetron sputtering has been widely used to prepare metals, metallic oxides, and some semiconductor films, which has great application potential in the fabrication of PSCs. Here, a unique technology where high-quality perovskite films are prepared via magnetron sputtering for controllable composition, solvent-free, large-area, and massive production, is presented. This strategy transforms the perovskite materials from powder to thin films by magnetron sputtering and post-treatment (vapor-assisted treatment with methanaminium iodide gas and methylamine gas treatment), which is greatly favorable to manufacture tandem solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs with perovskite films fabricated by magnetron sputtering is 6.14%. After optimization, high-performance perovskite films with excellent electronic properties are obtained and stable PSCs with excellent reproducibility are realized, showing a PCE of up to 15.22%. The entirely novel synthetic approach opens up a new and promising way to achieve high-throughput magnetron sputtering for large-area production in commercial applications of planar heterojunction and tandem PSCs.},

  abstract     = {Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is one of the major precision medicine treatment options for lung adenocarcinoma. Due to common development of drug resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs, third-generation inhibitors, including osimertinib and rociletinib, have been developed. A model of EGFR-driven lung cancer and a method to develop tumors of distinct epigenetic states through 3D organotypic cultures are described here. It is discovered that activation of the EGFR T790M/L858R mutation in lung epithelial cells can drive lung cancers with alveolar or bronchiolar features, which can originate from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells or bronchioalveolar stem cells, but not basal cells or club cells of the trachea. It is also demonstrated that these clones are able to retain their epigenetic differences through passaging orthotopically in mice and crucially that they have distinct drug vulnerabilities. This work serves as a blueprint for exploring how epigenetics can be used to stratify patients for precision medicine decisions.},

  abstract     = {Flexible perovskite solar cells ( f -PSCs) have attracted increasing attention because of their enormous potential for use in consumer electronic devices. The key to achieve high device performance is to deposit pinhole-free, uniform and defect-less perovskite films on the rough surface of polymeric substrates. Here, a solvent engineering to tailor the crystal morphology of FA-alloyed perovskite films prepared by one-step blade coating is first deployed. It is found that the use of binary solvents DMF:NMP, rather than the conventional DMF:DMSO, enables to deposit dense and uniform FA-alloyed perovskite films on both the rigid and flexible substrates. As a decisive step, an embedding 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is in situ formed by incorporating a small amount of 4-guanidinobutanoic acid (GBA). Accordingly, photovoltage increases up to 100 mV are realized due to the markedly suppressed nonradiative recombination, leading to high efficiencies of 21.45% and 20.16% on the rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. In parallel, improved mechanical robustness of the flexible devices is achieved due to the presence of the embedded 2D phases. The results underpin the importance of morphology control and defect passivation in delivering high-performance flexible FA-alloyed flexible perovskite devices.},

  abstract     = {Fenton-like reactions with persulfates as the oxidants have attracted increasing attentions for the remediation of emerging antibiotic pollutions. However, developing effective activators with outstanding activities and long-term stabilities remains a great challenge in these reactions. Herein, a novel activator is successfully synthesized with single iron atoms anchored on porous N-doped carbon (Fe-N-PC) by a facile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The single Fe atoms are coordinated with four N atoms according to the XANES, and the Fe-N 4 -PC shows enhanced activity for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of single Fe atoms will regulate the main active sites from graphite N into Fe-N 4 , thus could enhance the stability and tune the PMS activation pathway from non-radical into radical dominated process. In addition, the N atoms connected with single Fe atoms in the Fe-N 4 -C structure can be used to enhance the adsorption of organic molecules on these materials. Therefore, the Fe-N 4 -C here has dual roles for antibiotics adsorption and PMS activation. The CVD synthesized Fe-N 4 -C shows enhanced performance in persulfates based Fenton-like reactions, thus has great potential in the environmental remediation field.},

  abstract     = {Condensation is ubiquitous in nature and industry. Heterogeneous condensation on surfaces is typified by the continuous cycle of droplet nucleation, growth, and departure. Central to the mechanistic understanding of the thermofluidic processes governing condensation is the rapid and high-fidelity extraction of interpretable physical descriptors from the highly transient droplet population. However, extracting quantifiable measures out of dynamic objects with conventional imaging technologies poses a challenge to researchers. Here, an intelligent vision-based framework is demonstrated that unites classical thermofluidic imaging techniques with deep learning to fundamentally address this challenge. The deep learning framework can autonomously harness physical descriptors and quantify thermal performance at extreme spatio-temporal resolutions of 300 nm and 200 ms, respectively. The data-centric analysis conclusively shows that contrary to classical understanding, the overall condensation performance is governed by a key tradeoff between heat transfer rate per individual droplet and droplet population density. The vision-based approach presents a powerful tool for the study of not only phase-change processes but also any nucleation-based process within and beyond the thermal science community through the harnessing of big data.},

To selectively target TRPM8 channels against cold allodynia, a cyclic peptide DeC-1.2 is de novo designed with the optimized hot-spot centric approach. DeC-1.2 modality specifically inhibited the ligand activation of TRPM8 but not the cold activation as measured in single-channel patch clamp recordings.

Here, it is found that the m 6 A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 are both expressed in cerebellar granule cells (GCs) and their axons. Knockdown (KD) of YTHDF1 or YTHDF2 significantly increases GC axon growth rates in vitro. By integrating anti-YTHDF1&amp;2 RIP-Seq with the quantitative proteomic analysis or RNA-seq after KD of YTHDF1 or YTHDF2, a group of transcripts which may mediate the regulation of GC axon growth by YTHDFs is identified. Among them, Dvl1 and Wnt5a , encoding the key components of Wnt pathway, are further found to be locally translated in axons, which are controlled by YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, respectively. Specific ablation of Ythdf1 or Ythdf2 in GCs increases parallel fiber growth, promotes synapse formation in cerebellum in vivo, and improves motor coordination ability. Together, this study identifies a mechanism by which the m 6 A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 work synergistically on the Wnt5a pathway through regulating local translation in GC axons to control cerebellar parallel fiber development.},

The development of highly efficient and low-costing electrocatalysts for the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) associated with ammonia removal is subsequently crucial. In this study, for the first time, the authors demonstrate that a perovskite oxide LaNi 0.5 Cu 0.5 O 3- δ after being annealed in Ar (LNCO55-Ar), is an excellent non-noble bifunctional catalyst towards both AOR and HER, making it suitable as a symmetric ammonia electrolyser (SAE) in alkaline medium. In contrast, the LNCO55 sample fired in air (LNCO55-Air) is inactive towards AOR and shows very poor HER activity. Through combined experimental results and theoretical calculations, it is found that the superior AOR and HER activities are attributed to the increased active sites, the introduction of oxygen vacancies, the synergistic effect of B-site cations and the different active sites in LNCO55-Ar. At 1.23 V, the assembled SAE demonstrates ≈100% removal efficiency in 2210 ppm ammonia solution and &gt;70% in real landfill leachate. This work opens the door for developments towards bifunctional catalysts, and also takes a profound step towards the development of low-costing and simple device configuration for ammonia electrolysers.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death, which is characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lethal lipid peroxides and involved in many critical diseases. Recent reports revealed that cellular energy metabolism activities such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and tricarboxylic acid cycle are involved in the regulation of key ferroptosis markers such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore imposing potential regulatory roles in ferroptosis. Remarkably, tumor cells can activate adaptive metabolic responses to inhibit ferroptosis for self-preservation such as the upregulation of glycolysis and PPP. Due to the rapid proliferation of tumor cells and the intensified metabolic rate, tumor energy metabolism has become a target for disrupting the redox homeostasis and induce ferroptosis. Based on these emerging insights, regulatory impact of those-tumor specific metabolic aberrations is systematically characterized, such as rewired glucose metabolism and metabolic compensation through glutamine utilization on ferroptosis and analyzed the underlying molecular mechanisms. Additionally, those ferroptosis-based therapeutic strategies are also discussed by exploiting those metabolic vulnerabilities, which may open up new avenues for tumor treatment in a clinical context.},

NEAT1_1 is downregulated in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and its decreased expression correlates with recurrence in AML patients. It is demonstrated that NEAT1_1 suppresses leukemogenesis and LSC function but is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, NEAT1_1 is released from the nucleus into the cytoplasm of AML cells, regulated by transcription factor C/EBP β and nuclear protein NAP1L1. Cytoplasmic NEAT1_1 interacts with Wnt component DVL2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase Trim56, facilitates Trim56-mediated DVL2 degradation, and thus suppresses Wnt signaling.

  abstract     = {The 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) found at the surface of SrTiO 3 and related interfaces has attracted significant attention as a promising basis for oxide electronics. In order to utilize its full potential, the response of this 2DEG to structural changes and surface modification must be understood in detail. Here, a study of the detailed electronic structure evolution of the 2DEG as a function of sample temperature and surface step density is presented. By comparing the experimental results with ab initio calculations, it is shown that local structure relaxations cause a metal-insulator transition of the system around 135 K. This study presents a new and simple way of tuning the 2DEG via surface vicinality and identifies how the operation of prospective devices will respond to changes in temperature.},

  abstract     = {Age is a major risk factor for cancer. While the importance of age related genetic alterations in cells on cancer progression is well documented, the effect of aging extracellular matrix (ECM) has been overlooked. This study shows that the aging breast ECM alone is sufficient to drive normal human mammary epithelial cells (KTB21) to a more invasive and cancer-like phenotype, while promoting motility and invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 cells. Decellularized breast matrix from aged mice leads to loss of E-cadherin membrane localization in KTB21 cells, increased cell motility and invasion, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines and cancer-related proteins. The aged matrix upregulates cancer-related genes in KTB21 cells and enriches a cell subpopulation highly expressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes. Lysyl oxidase knockdown reverts the aged matrix-induced changes to the young levels; it relocalizes E-cadherin to cell membrane, and reduces cell motility, invasion, and cytokine production. These results show for the first time that the aging ECM harbors key biochemical, physical, and mechanical cues contributing to invasive and cancer-like behavior in healthy and cancer mammary cells. Differential response of cells to young and aged ECMs can lead to identification of new targets for cancer treatment and prevention.},

Herein, the use of a multijunction MOST device that combines various photoswitches with different onsets of absorption to push the efficiency limit on solar energy collection and storage is explored. With a parametric model calculation, it is shown that the efficiency limit of MOST concept can be improved from 13.0% to 18.2% with a double-junction system and to 20.5% with a triple-junction system containing ideal, red-shifted MOST candidates. As a proof-of-concept, the use of a three-layered MOST device is experimentally demonstrated. The device uses different photoswitches including a norbornadiene derivative, a dihydroazulene derivative, and an azobenzene derivative in liquid state with different MOST properties, to increase the energy capture and storage behavior. This conceptional device introduces a new way of thinking and designing optimal molecular candidates for MOST , as much improvement can be made by tailoring molecules to efficiently store solar energy at specific wavelengths.},

  abstract     = {Interfacial and bulk properties between the catalyst layer and the porous transport layer (PTL) restrict the iridium loading reduction for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), by limiting their mass and charge transport. Using titanium fiber PTLs of varying thickness and porosity, the bulk and interface transport properties are investigated, correlating them to PEMWEs cell performance at ultra-low Ir loadings of ≈0.05 mg Ir cm −2 . Electrochemical experiments, tomography, and modeling are combined to study the bulk and interfacial impacts of PTLs on PEMWE performance. It is found that the PEMWE performance is largely dependent on the PTL properties at ultra-low Ir loadings; bulk structural properties are critical to determine the mass transport and Ohmic resistance of PEMWEs while the surface properties of PTLs are critical to govern the catalyst layer utilization and electrode kinetics. The PTL-induced variation in kinetic and mass transport overpotential are on the order of ≈40 and 60 mV (at 80 A mg Ir −1 ), respectively, while a nonnegligible 35 mV (at 3 A cm −2 ) difference in Ohmic overpotential. Thus at least 150 mV improvement in PEMWE performance can be achieved through PTL structural optimization without membrane thickness reduction or advent of new electrocatalysts.},

In-depth characterization of gluten-specific CD4 + T cells and CeD-associated (CD38 + and CD103 + ) CD8 + and γδ + T cells in blood of treated CeD patients undergoing a 3 day gluten challenge is reported. The phenotypic profile of gluten-specific cells changes profoundly with gluten exposure and the cells adopt the profile of gluten-specific cells in untreated disease (CD147 + , CD70 + , programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) + , inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) + , CD28 + , CD95 + , CD38 + , and CD161 + ), yet with some markers being unique for day 6 cells (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CXCR6), CD132, and CD147) and with integrin α 4 β 7, C-C motif chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), and CXCR3 being expressed stably at baseline and day 6. Among gluten-specific CD4 + T cells, 52% are CXCR5 + at baseline, perhaps indicative of germinal-center reactions, while on day 6 all are CXCR5 − . Strikingly, the phenotypic profile of gluten-specific CD4 + T cells on day 6 largely overlaps with that of CeD-associated (CD38 + and CD103 + ) CD8 + and γδ + T cells.

  abstract     = {There is no doubt that hydrogen energy can play significant role in promoting the development and progress of modern society. The utilization of hydrogen energy has developed rapidly, but it is far from the requirement of human. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop methodologies and technologies for efficient hydrogen production, especially high activity and durable electrocatalysts. Here a bimetallic oxide cluster on heterostructure of vanadium ruthenium oxides/graphdiyne (VRuO x /GDY) is reported. The unique acetylene-rich structure of graphdiyne achieves outstanding characteristics of electrocatalyst: i) controlled preparation of catalysts for achieving multiple-metal clusters; ii) regulation of catalyst composition and morphology for synthesizing high-performance catalysts; iii) highly active and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties. The optimal porous electrocatalyst (VRu 0.027 O x /GDY) can deliver 10 mA cm −2 at low overpotentials of 13 and 12 mV together with robust long-term stability in alkaline and neutral media, respectively, which are much smaller than Pt/C. The results reveal that the synergism of different components can efficiently facilitate the electron/mass transport properties, reduce the energy barrier, and increase the active site number for high catalytic performances.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite materials in different dimensions show great potential in direct X-ray detection, but each with limitations stemming from its own intrinsic properties. Particularly, the sensitivity of two-dimensional (2D) perovskites is limited by poor carrier transport while ion migration in three-dimensional (3D) perovskites causes the baseline drifting problem. To circumvent these limitations, herein a double-layer perovskite film is developed with properly aligned energy level, where 2D (PEA) 2 MA 3 Pb 4 I 13 (PEA=2-phenylethylammonium, MA=methylammonium) is cascaded with vertically crystallized 3D MAPbI 3 . In this new design paradigm, the 3D layer ensures fast carrier transport while the 2D layer mitigates ion migration, thus offering a high sensitivity and a greatly stabilized baseline. Besides, the 2D layer increases the film resistivity and enlarges the energy barrier for hole injection without compromising carrier extraction. Consequently, the double-layer perovskite detector delivers a high sensitivity (1.95 × 10 4 μ C Gy air −1 cm −2 ) and a low detection limit (480 nGy air s −1 ). Also demonstrated is the X-ray imaging capacity using a circuit board as the object. This work opens up a new avenue for enhancing X-ray detection performance via cascade assembly of various perovskites with complementary properties.},

  abstract     = {Organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn tremendous attention owing to their remarkable photovoltaic performance and simple preparation process. However, conventional wet-chemical synthesis methods inevitably create defects both in the bulk and at the interfaces of perovskites, leading to recombination of charge carriers and reduced stability. Herein, a bilateral interface modification to perovskites by doping room-temperature synthesized CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals (CN) is reported. The ultrafast transient absorption measurement reveals that CN effectively suppresses the defect at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface and boosts the interfacial electron transport. Meanwhile, the in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy and contact potential difference characterizations verify that the CN within the upper part of the perovskites enhances the built-in electric field, facilitating oriented migration of the carriers within the perovskite. Combining the superiorities of CN modifiers on both sides, the bilaterally modified CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -based planar PSCs exhibit optimal power conversion efficiency exceeding 20% and improved device stability.},

By utilizing hydrogenated amorphous silicon that is optimized to provide an extremely low extinction coefficient in the visible regime, the metalens is highly efficient with measured focusing efficiencies of around 44%. They numerically design and experimentally realize and characterize tunable focusing and demonstrate electrically tunable active imaging at visible wavelengths using the bifocal metalens combined with liquid crystals. Diffraction limited focusing and imaging is verified through the analysis of the measured optical intensities at the focal points and the modulation transfer function.

One example is the stress-response strategy of the Venus flytrap, which enables such a delicate plant to perceive and prey on insects at an imperceptible speed by their soft terminal lobes. Here, inspired by this unique stress-response strategy, a soft gripper that aims at the challenges of high-speed dynamic grasping tasks is presented. The gripper, called high-speed soft gripper (HSG), is based on two basic design concepts. One is a snap-through instability that enables the HSG to sense the mechanical stimuli and actuating instantly. The other one is the spider-inspired pneumatic-powered control system that makes the trigger process repeatable and controllable. Utilizing the stress-response strategy, the HSG can accomplish high-speed sensing and grasping and handle a dynamic grasping task like catching a thrown baseball. Whereas soft machines typically exhibit slow locomotion speed and low manipulation strength for the intrinsic limitations of soft materials, the exploration of the stress-response strategy in this study can help pave the way for designing a new generation of practical high-speed soft robots.},

In the current study, the descriptors are fully examined of the NanoEL phenomenon elicited by generic citrate-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of changing size and concentration, from microscopic gap formation and actin reorganization down to molecular signaling pathways and nanoscale interactions of AuNPs with VE-cadherin and its intra/extracellular cofactors. Employing synergistic in silico methodologies, for the first time the molecular and statistical mechanics of cadherin pair disruption, especially in response to AuNPs of the smallest size and highest concentration are revealed. This study marks a major advancement toward establishing a comprehensive NanoEL framework for complementing the understanding of the transcytotic pathway and for guiding the design and application of future nanomedicines harnessing the myriad functions of the mammalian vasculature.},

While various types of artificial cilia have been engineered recently, they often involve complex manufacturing protocols and focus on transporting liquids only. Here, soft magnetic carpets are created via an easy self-assembly route based on the Rosensweig instability. These carpets can transport not only liquids but also solid objects that are larger and heavier than the artificial cilia, using a crowd-surfing effect.This amphibious transportation is locally and reconfigurably tunable by simple micromagnets or advanced programmable magnetic fields with a high degree of spatial resolution. Two surprising cargo reversal effects are identified and modeled due to collective ciliary motion and nontrivial elastohydrodynamics. While the active carpets are generally applicable to integrated control systems for transport, mixing, and sorting, these effects can also be exploited for microfluidic viscosimetry and elastometry.},

  abstract     = {Solvent engineering by Lewis-base solvent and anti-solvent is well known for forming uniform and stable perovskite thin films. The perovskite phase crystallizes from an intermediate Lewis-adduct upon annealing-induced crystallization. Herein, it is explored the effects of trimethyl phosphate (TMP), as a novel aprotic Lewis-base solvent with a low donor number for the perovskite film formation and photovoltaic characteristics of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). As compared to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide (DMF), the usage of TMP directly crystallizes the perovskite phase, i.e., reduces the intermediate phase to a negligible degree, right after the spin-coating, owing to the high miscibility of TMP with the anti-solvent and weak bonding in the Lewis adduct. Interestingly, the PSCs based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) derived from TMP/DMF-mixed solvent exhibit a higher average power conversion efficiency of 19.68% (the best: 20.02%) with a smaller hysteresis in the current-voltage curve, compared to the PSCs that are fabricated using DMSO/DMF-mixed (19.14%) or DMF-only (18.55%) solvents. The superior photovoltaic properties are attributed to the lower defect density of the TMP/DMF-derived perovskite film. The results indicate that a high-performance PSC can be achieved by combining a weak Lewis base with a well-established solvent engineering process.},

High-throughput generation of organoids in alginate microbeads is achieved utilizing microfluidic droplet technology. Tumor pieces within the alginate microbeads developed both luminal- and solid-like structures and displayed a high similarity to the original fresh tumor in cellular phenotypes and lineages. The mechanical forces of the luminal organoids in the alginate capsules are analyzed with the theory of the thick-wall pressure vessel (TWPV) model. The luminal pressure of the organoids increase with the lumen growth and can reach 2 kPa after two weeks’ culture. Finally, the mammary tumor organoids are treated with doxorubicin and latrunculin A to evaluate their application as a drug screening platform. It is found that the drug response is related to the luminal size and pressures of organoids.

One representative example is the topical delivery of predatory bacteria to treat ocular bacterial infections. However, there is a lack of suitable methods for the delivery of predatory bacteria into ocular tissue. This work introduces cryomicroneedles (cryoMN) for the ocular delivery of predatory Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus ( B. bacteriovorus ) bacteria. The cryoMN patches are prepared by freezing B. bacteriovorus containing a cryoprotectant medium in a microneedle template. The viability of B. bacteriovorus in cryoMNs remains above 80% as found in long-term storage studies, and they successfully impede the growth of gram-negative bacteria in vitro or in a rodent eye infection model. The infection is significantly relieved by nearly six times through 2.5 days of treatment without substantial effects on the cornea thickness and morphology. This approach represents the safe and efficient delivery of new class of antimicrobial armamentarium to otherwise impermeable ocular surface and opens up new avenues for the treatment of ocular surface disorders.},

  abstract     = {Fast charging (&lt;15 min) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for electrical vehicles (EVs) is widely seen as the key factor that will greatly stimulate the EV markets, and its realization is mainly hindered by the sluggish diffusion of Li + . To have a mechanistic understanding of Li + diffusion within LIBs, in this study, structural evolutions of electrodes for a Ni-rich LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 (NMC622) || graphite cylindrical cell with high areal loading (2.78 mAh cm −2 ) are developed for operando neutron powder diffraction study at different charging rates. Via sequential Rietveld refinements, changes in structures of NMC622 and Li x C 6 are obtained during moderate and fast charging (from 0.27 C to 4.4 C). NMC622 exhibits the same structural evolution regardless of C-rates. For phase transitions of Li x C 6 , the stage I (LiC 6 ) phase emerges earlier during the stepwise intercalation at a lower state of charge when charging rate is increased. It is also found that the stage II (LiC 12 ) → stage I (LiC 6 ) transition is the rate-limiting step during fast charging. The LiC 12 → LiC 6 transition mechanism is further analyzed using the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov model. It is concluded as a diffusion-controlled, 1D phase transition with decreasing nucleation kinetics under increasing chargingrates.},

  abstract     = {Self-healing soft electronic material composition is crucial to sustain the device long-term durability. The fabrication of self-healing soft electronics exposed to high moisture environment is a significant challenge that has yet to be fully achieved. This paper presents the novel concept of a water-assisted room-temperature autonomous self-healing mechanism based on synergistically dynamic covalent Schiff-based imine bonds with hydrogen bonds. The supramolecular water-assisted self-healing polymer (WASHP) films possess rapid self-healing kinetic behavior and high stretchability due to a reversible dissociation–association process. In comparison with the pristine room-temperature self-healing polymer, the WASHP demonstrates favorable mechanical performance at room temperature and a short self-healing time of 1 h; furthermore, it achieves a tensile strain of 9050%, self-healing efficiency of 95%, and toughness of 144.2 MJ m −3 . As a proof of concept, a versatile WASHP-based light-emitting touch-responsive device (WASHP-LETD) and perovskite quantum dot (PeQD)-based white LED backlight are designed. The WASHP-LETD has favorable mechanical deformation performance under pressure, bending, and strain, whereas the WASHP-PeQDs exhibit outstanding long-term stability even over a period exceeding one year in a boiling water environment. This paper provides a mechanically robust approach for producing eco-friendly, economical, and waterproof e-skin device components.},

  abstract     = {Biological cells are contained by a fluid lipid bilayer (plasma membrane, PM) that allows for large deformations, often exceeding 50% of the apparent initial PM area. Isolated lipids self-organize into membranes, but are prone to rupture at small (&lt;2–4%) area strains, which limits progress for synthetic reconstitution of cellular features. Here, it is shown that by preserving PM structure and composition during isolation from cells, vesicles with cell-like elasticity can be obtained. It is found that these plasma membrane vesicles store significant area in the form of nanotubes in their lumen. These act as lipid reservoirs and are recruited by mechanical tension applied to the outer vesicle membrane. Both in experiment and theory, it is shown that a “superelastic” response emerges from the interplay of lipid domains and membrane curvature. This finding allows for bottom-up engineering of synthetic biomaterials that appear one magnitude softer and with threefold larger deformability than conventional lipid vesicles. These results open a path toward designing superelastic synthetic cells possessing the inherent mechanics of biological cells.},

The formation of new, positive social relationships can alleviate feelings of loneliness, but requires rapid trustworthiness decisions during initial encounters and it is still unclear how loneliness hinders interpersonal trust. Here, a multimodal approach including behavioral, psychophysiological, hormonal, and neuroimaging measurements is used to probe a trust-based mechanism underlying impaired social interactions in loneliness. Pre-stratified healthy individuals with high loneliness scores ( n = 42 out of a screened sample of 3678 adults) show reduced oxytocinergic and affective responsiveness to a positive conversation, report less interpersonal trust, and prefer larger social distances compared to controls ( n = 40). Moreover, lonely individuals are rated as less trustworthy compared to controls and identified by the blinded confederate better than chance. During initial trust decisions, lonely individuals exhibit attenuated limbic and striatal activation and blunted functional connectivity between the anterior insula and occipitoparietal regions, which correlates with the diminished affective responsiveness to the positive social interaction. This neural response pattern is not mediated by loneliness-associated psychological symptoms. Thus, the results indicate compromised integration of trust-related information as a shared neurobiological component in loneliness, yielding a reciprocally reinforced trust bias in social dyads.},

Chiral hybrid perovskites (CHPs) that combine CPL-sensitive absorption induced by chiral organic ligands and superior photoelectric properties of perovskites are promising candidates for direct CPL detection. To date, most of the CHP detectors are made up of polycrystalline thin-film, which results in a rather limited discrimination of CPL due to the existence of redundant impurities and intrinsic defect states originating from rapid crystallization process. Here, it is developed a direct CPL detector with high photocurrent and polarization selectivity based on low-defect CHP single-crystal nanowire arrays. Large-scale CHP nanowires are obtained through a micropillar template-assisted capillary-bridge rise approach. Thanks to the high crystallinity and ordered crystallographic alignment of these arrays, a CPL photodetector with high light on/off ratio of 1.8 × 10 4 , excellent responsivity of 1.4 A W −1 , and an outstanding anisotropy factor of 0.24 for photocurrent has been achieved. These results would provide useful enlightenment for direct CPL detection in high-performance chiral optoelectronics.},

Further, loss of function studies and protein therapeutic experiment in mice revealed that PZP promotes diet-induced thermogenesis through activating brown adipose tissue (BAT). Mechanistically, circulating PZP can bind to cell surface glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78) to promote uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression via a p38 MAPK-ATF2 signaling pathway in BAT. These studies illuminate a systemic regulation in which the IF promotes BAT thermogenesis through the endocrinal system and provide a novel potential target for treating obesity and related disorders.},

With the growing interest in electronics that are environmentally sustainable and biologically safe, developing aqueous-compatible organic materials is gaining growing interest. Herein, a rationally designed iron terpyridyl coordination polymer (CP) is prepared by controlled electropolymerization for realization of aqueous compatible EC and energy storage applications. Detailed analysis is established, showing that the CP grows in a 1D fashion and exhibits a predominant capacitive behavior which is reflected from its rapid charge–transfer kinetics.

The emerging role of the substance P-NK-1R system in oncogenesis raises the possibility of repurposing well-tolerated NK-1R antagonists for cancer treatment. This study reports that human colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with high NK-1R expression have poor survival, and NK-1R antagonists SR140333 and aprepitant induce apoptotic cell death in CRC cells and inhibit CRC xenograft growth. This cytotoxicity induced by treatment with NK-1R antagonists is mediated by induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress triggers calcium release, resulting in the suppression of prosurvival extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-c-Myc signaling. Along with ER calcium release, one ER stress pathway mediated by protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) is specifically activated, leading to increased expression of proapoptotic C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Moreover, NK-1R antagonists enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by increasing the sensitivity and overcoming resistance to 5-fluorouracil in CRC cells through the induction of sustained ER stress and the consequent suppression of ERK-c-Myc signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, the findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the efficacy of NK-1R antagonists either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for cancer treatment.},

The present paper details a neurostimulation scheme using gas-filled nanostructures, gas vesicles (GVs), as actuators for improving the efficacy and precision of ultrasound stimuli. Sonicated primary neurons display dose-dependent, repeatable Ca 2+ responses, closely synced to stimuli, and increased nuclear expression of the activation marker c-Fos in the presence of GVs. GV-mediated ultrasound triggered rapid and reversible Ca 2+ responses in vivo and could selectively evoke neuronal activation in a deep-seated brain region. Further investigation indicate that mechanosensitive ion channels are important mediators of this effect. GVs themselves and the treatment scheme are also found not to induce significant cytotoxicity, apoptosis, or membrane poration in treated cells. Altogether, this study demonstrates a simple and effective method to achieve enhanced and better-targeted neurostimulation with non-invasive low-intensity ultrasound.},

However, attempts to increase the number of sensor pixels have been thwarted by the need for complex inner circuits and the resulting interferences with the output. Technological challenges, such as real-time spatiotemporal mapping and long-time reliability, must be resolved for large-scale sensor matrices. This paper reports a simple and robust sensor with an arch-bridge architecture (ABA) to address these challenges. The device, which consists of an anti-icing all-transparent material system, is fabricated by immobilizing ABA ionic arrays on predefined grooves on the substrate. It systematically integrates ABA structure-designing, resistance-position-sensing, and parallel-addressing logic, allowing for an improvement of three orders of magnitude in the scanning speed (million-scale pixels) without logical “diagnose confusion.” In addition, it can withstand 100 000 stretching cycles without functional failure. It is also resistant to interferences from stretching. humidity, wet surfaces, and power lines. The proposed strategy is envisaged to serve as a general solution for high-density, large-area tactile sensors in various applications.},

However, endogenous temperature sensors, such as ion channels and heat-shock promoters, are fully activated only at noxious temperatures above this range, making them unsuitable for medical applications. Here, a genetically encoded protein thermometer (human enhanced gene activation thermometer; HEAT) is designed that can trigger transgene expression in the range of 37–40 °C by linking a mutant coiled-coil temperature-responsive protein sensor to a synthetic transcription factor. To validate the construct, a HEAT-transgenic monoclonal human cell line, FeverSense, is generated and it is confirmed that it works as a fever sensor that can temperature- and exposure-time-dependently trigger reporter gene expression in vitro and in vivo. For translational proof of concept, microencapsulated designer cells stably expressing a HEAT-controlled insulin production cassette in a mouse model of type-1 diabetes are subcutaneously implanted and topical heating patches are used to apply heat corresponding to a warm sensation in humans.

  abstract     = {Prognosis and treatment of metastatic cancer continues to be one of the most difficult and challenging areas of oncology. Treatment usually consists of chemotherapeutics, which may be ineffective due to drug resistance, adverse effects, and dose-limiting toxicity. Therefore, novel approaches such as immunotherapy have been investigated to improve patient outcomes and minimize side effects. S100A9 is a calcium-binding protein implicated in tumor metastasis, progression, and aggressiveness that modulates the tumor microenvironment into an immunosuppressive state. S100A9 is expressed in and secreted by immune cells in the pre-metastatic niche, as well as, post-tumor development, therefore making it a suitable targeted for prophylaxis and therapy. In previous work, it is demonstrated that cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) acts as an adjuvant when administered intratumorally. Here, it is demonstrated that systemically administered, S100A9-targeted CPMV homes to the lungs leading to recruitment of innate immune cells. This approach is efficacious both prophylactically and therapeutically against lung metastasis from melanoma and breast cancer. The current research will facilitate and accelerate the development of next-generation targeted immunotherapies administered as prophylaxis, that is, after surgery of a primary breast tumor to prevent outgrowth of metastasis, as well as, therapy to treat established metastatic disease.},

Unfortunately, currently available formulations require burdensome separate injections at mealtimes and have disparate pharmacokinetics that do not mimic endogenous co-secretion. Here, amphiphilic acrylamide copolymers are used to create a stable co-formulation of monomeric insulin and amylin analogues (lispro and pramlintide) with synchronous pharmacokinetics and ultra-rapid action. The co-formulation is stable for over 16 h under stressed aging conditions, whereas commercial insulin lispro (Humalog) aggregates in 8 h. The faster pharmacokinetics of monomeric insulin in this co-formulation result in increased insulin–pramlintide overlap of 75 ± 6% compared to only 47 ± 7% for separate injections. The co-formulation results in similar delay in gastric emptying compared to pramlintide delivered separately. In a glucose challenge, in rats, the co-formulation reduces deviation from baseline glucose compared to insulin only, or separate insulin and pramlintide administrations. Further, comparison of interspecies pharmacokinetics of monomeric pramlintide suggests that pharmacokinetics observed for the co-formulation will be well preserved in future translation to humans. Together these results suggest that the co-formulation has the potential to improve mealtime glucose management and reduce patient burden in the treatment of diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Direct charge trapping memory, a new concept memory without any dielectric, has begun to attract attention. However, such memory is still at the incipient stage, of which the charge-trapping capability depends on localized electronic states that originated from the limited surface functional groups. To further advance such memory, a material with rich hybrid states is highly desired. Here, a van der Waals heterostructure design is proposed utilizing the 2D graphdiyne (GDY) which possesses abundant hybrid states with different chemical groups. In order to form the desirable van der Waals coupling, the plasma etching method is used to rapidly achieve the ultrathin 2D GDY with smooth surface for the first time. With the plasma-treated 2D GDY as charge-trapping layer, a direct charge-trapping memory based on GDY/MoS 2 is constructed. This bilayer memory is featured with large memory window (90 V) and high degree of modulation (on/off ratio around 8 × 10 7 ). Two operating mode can be achieved and data storage capability of 9 and 10 current levels can be obtained, respectively, in electronic and opto-electronic mode. This GDY/MoS 2 memory introduces a novel application of GDY as rich states charge-trapping center and offers a new strategy of realizing high performance dielectric-free electronics, such as optical memories and artificial synaptic.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and designing interfacial band alignment in a molecular heterojunction provides a foundation for realizing its desirable electronic functionality. In this study, a tailored molecular heterojunction selector is implemented by controlling its interfacial band offset between the molecular self-assembled monolayer with opposite dipole orientations and the 2D semiconductor (1 L -MoS 2 or 1 L -WSe 2 ). The molecular dipole moment direction determines the direction of the band bending of the 2D semiconductors, affecting the dominant transport pathways upon voltage application. Notably, in the molecular heterostructure with 1 L -WSe 2 , the opposite rectification direction is observed depending on the molecular dipole moment direction, which does not hold for the case with 1 L -MoS 2 . In addition, the nonlinearity of the molecular heterojunction selector can be significantly affected by the molecular dipole moment direction, type of 2D semiconductor, and metal work function. According to the choice of these heterojunction constituents, the nonlinearity is widely tuned from 1.0 × 10 1 to 3.6 × 10 4 for the read voltage scheme and from 0.4 × 10 1 to 2.0 × 10 5 for the half-read voltage scheme, which can be scaled up to an ≈482 Gbit crossbar array.},

Several epidemiological studies show the correlation between chronical PM2.5 exposure and incidents of neurological disorders including Alzheimer&#39;s disease. However, the mechanisms have not been well understood, partly due to the lack of model systems that reflect the physiologically relevant innate immunity in human brains. Here, PM2.5-polluted human brain models (PMBs) are created in a 3D microfluidic platform reconstituting key aspects of human brain immunity under the PM2.5 exposure. PM2.5 penetration across a blood–brain barrier (BBB) model and accumulation in the brain tissue side of the model are first validated. Second, the PMB model shows that the BBB-penetrating PM2.5 initiates astrogliosis, resulting in slight neuronal loss and microglial infiltration. Third, it is demonstrated that the infiltrating microglia obtain M1 phenotype induced by interleukin-1 β and interferon- γ from neurons and reactive astrocytes under the PM2.5 exposure. Finally, it is observed that additional proinflammatory mediators and nitric oxide released from the M1 microglia exacerbate neuronal damages, such as synaptic impairment, phosphoric tau accumulation, and neuronal death. This study suggests that PM2.5 can be a potential environmental risk factor for dementia mediated by the detrimental neuroinflammation.},

Understanding the dynamic properties of the icing interface is crucial for shedding new light on the design of new anti-icing surfaces to meet challenges of harsh conditions including extremely low temperature and/or long working time. This article surveys the state-of-the-art anti-icing surfaces and dissects their dynamic changes of the chemical/physical states at icing interface. According to the focused critical ice–substrate contacting locations, namely the most important ice–substrate interface and the adjacent regions in the substrate and in the ice, the available anti-icing surfaces are for the first time re-assessed by taking the dynamic evolution into account. Subsequently, the recent works in the preparation of dynamic anti-icing surfaces (DAIS) that consider time-evolving properties, with their potentials in practical applications, and the challenges confronted are summarized and discussed, aiming for providing a thorough review of the promising concept of DAIS for guiding the future icephobic materials designs.},

Recently, along with elemental sulfur (S 8 ), sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN), in which active sulfur moieties are covalently bounded to carbon backbone, has received significant attention as an electrode material. Importantly, SPAN can serve as a universal cathode with minimized metal–polysulfide dissolution because sulfur is immobilized through covalent bonding at the carbon backbone. Considering these unique structural features, SPAN represents a new approach beyond elemental S 8 for MSBs. However, the development of SPAN electrodes is in its infancy stage compared to conventional S 8 cathodes because several issues such as chemical structure, attached sulfur chain lengths, and over-capacity in the first cycle remain unresolved. In addition, physical, chemical, or specific treatments are required for tuning intrinsic properties such as sulfur loading, porosity, and conductivity, which have a pivotal role in improving battery performance. This review discusses the fundamental and technological discussions on SPAN synthesis, physicochemical properties, and electrochemical performance in MSBs. Further, the essential guidance will provide research directions on SPAN electrodes for potential and industrial applications of MSBs.},

  abstract     = {Recognition of specific antigens expressed in cancer cells is the initial process of cytolytic T cell-mediated cancer killing. However, this process can be affected by other non-cancerous cellular components in the tumor microenvironment. Here, it is shown that interleukin-33 (IL-33)-activated macrophages protect melanoma cells from tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-mediated killing. Mechanistically, IL-33 markedly upregulates metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) expression in macrophages, which acts as a sheddase to trim NKG2D, an activating receptor expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, subsets of CD4+ T cells, iNKT cells, and γδ T cells. Further, MMP-9 also cleaves the MHC class I molecule, cell surface antigen-presenting complex molecules, expressed in melanoma cells. Consequently, IL-33-induced macrophage MMP-9 robustly mitigates the tumor killing-effect by T cells. Genetic and pharmacological loss-of-function of MMP-9 sheddase restore T cell-mediated cancer killing. Together, these data provide compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence showing novel mechanisms underlying the IL-33-macrophage-MMP-9 axis-mediated immune tolerance against cancer cells. Targeting each of these signaling components, including IL-33 and MMP-9 provides a new therapeutic paradigm for improving anticancer efficacy by immune therapy.},

In an attempt to answer this question, a mouse model berrying an activation mutation of FGFR2 (FGFR2-S252W) in the mammary gland is generated. It is found that FGF/FGFR2 signaling drives the development of triple-negative breast cancer accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal transition that is regulated by FGFR2-STAT3 signaling. It is demonstrated that FGFR2 suppresses BRCA1 via the ERK-YY1 axis and promotes tumor progression. BRCA1 knockout in the mammary gland of the FGFR2-S252W mice significantly accelerated tumorigenesis. It is also shown that FGFR2 positively regulates PD-L1 and that a combination of FGFR2 inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade kills cancer cells.

  abstract     = {Metasurface retroreflectors, which scatter the incident electromagnetic wave back to incoming direction, have received significant attention due to their compelling advantages of low profile and light weight compared with conventional bulky retroreflection devices. However, the current metasurface retroreflectors still have limitations in wide-angle and omnidirectional operations. This work proposes a high-efficiency, wide-angle, reconfigurable, and omnidirectional retroreflector composed of spin-locked phase gradient metasurface with a thickness of only 5.2 mm or 0.07 operating wavelength. The reflection phase of constituent meta-atoms can be controlled dynamically and continuously by altering their orientation states through individually addressing each mechanically rotational meta-atom, whereas the reflection handedness is kept the same as incidence. Therefore, adaptive and arbitrary momentum can be imparted to the incident wave, providing high-efficiency retroreflection over a wide continuous range from −47° to 47°. Moreover, such high-performance retroreflection is extended to omnidirectional level, enabling great degrees of freedom that are unavailable by previous researches. As a proof of concept, a retroreflective metasurface is fabricated and experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies. The proposed thin thickness, high efficiency, and reconfigurable metasurface retroreflector can be extended to other frequencies that may offer an untapped platform toward reconfigurable spin-based retroreflection devices for electromagnetic signal processing.},

A wide range of developed nanotechnology-based approaches for bacterial detection and removal together with biofilm eradication are summarized. The challenging effects of nanotechnologies on beneficial bacteria in the human body and environment and the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to nanotherapeutics are also reviewed.},

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the blooming interaction of nanotechnology and biotechnology, biosynthetic cellular membrane vesicles (Bio-MVs) have shown superior characteristics for therapeutic transportation because of their hydrophilic cavity and hydrophobic bilayer structure, as well as their inherent biocompatibility and negligible immunogenicity. These excellent cell-like features with specific functional protein expression on the surface can invoke their remarkable ability for Bio-MVs based recombinant protein therapy to facilitate the advanced synergy in poly-therapy. To date, various tactics have been developed for Bio-MVs surface modification with functional proteins through hydrophobic insertion or multivalent electrostatic interactions. While the Bio-MVs grow through genetically engineering strategies can maintain binding specificity, sort orders, and lead to strict information about artificial proteins in a facile and sustainable way. In this progress report, the most current technology of Bio-MVs is discussed, with an emphasis on their multi-functionalities as “tailorable shells” for delivering bio-functional moieties and therapeutic entities. The most notable success and challenges via genetically engineered tactics to achieve the new generation of Bio-MVs are highlighted. Besides, future perspectives of Bio-MVs in novel bio-nanotherapy are provided.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between the electronic state of active sites and N 2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance is essential to explore efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe and Mo sites are designed and achieved in the form of well-defined FeN 4 and MoN 4 coordination in polyphthalocyanine (PPc) organic framework to investigate the influence of the spin state of FeN 4 on NRR behavior. The neighboring MoN 4 can regulate the spin state of Fe center in FeN 4 from high-spin ( d xy 2 d yz 1 d xz 1 d z 2 1 d x 2 − y 2 1 ) to medium-spin ( d xy 2 d yz 2 d xz 1 d z 2 1 ), where the empty d orbitals and separate d electron favor the overlap of Fe 3d with the N 2p orbitals, more effectively activating N≡N triple bond. Theoretical modeling suggests that the NRR preferably takes place on FeN 4 instead of MoN 4 , and the transition of Fe spin state significantly lowers the energy barrier of the potential determining step, which is conducive to the first hydrogenation of N 2 . As a result, FeMoPPc with medium-spin FeN 4 exhibits 2.0 and 9.0 times higher Faradaic efficiency and 2.0 and 17.2 times higher NH 3 yields for NRR than FePPc with high-spin FeN 4 and MoPPc with MoN 4 , respectively. These new insights may open up opportunities for exploiting efficient NRR electrocatalysts by atomically regulating the spin state of metal centers.},

A recent overview of advanced EV detection nanotechnologies is discussed here. First, several key challenges in EV-based liquid biopsies are introduced. Then, the related pivotal advances in nanotechnologies for EV isolation based on physical features, chemical affinity, and the combination of nanostructures and chemical affinity are summarized. Next, a summary of high-sensitivity sensors for EV detection and advanced approaches for single EV detection are provided. Later, EV analysis is introduced in practical clinical scenarios, and the application of machine learning in this field is highlighted.

Without protective agents, Re I -diimine complex already exhibits excellent emission yield (34%, λ em = 583 nm) and large two-photon absorption cross-sections ( σ 2 = 300 GM @ 800 nm) in water (pH 7.4). After extravasation, remarkably, the collagen-bound probes further enhanced their excitation efficiency by increasing the deoxygenated lifetime from 4.0 to 7.5 µs, paving a way to visualize tumor hypoxia and tissue ischemia in vivo.

  abstract     = {Respiratory tract microbiome is closely related to respiratory tract infections, while characterization of oropharyngeal microbiome in recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is not studied. Herein, oropharyngeal swabs are collected from confirmed cases (CCs) with COVID-19 (73 subjects), suspected cases (SCs) (36), confirmed cases who recovered (21), suspected cases who recovered (36), and healthy controls (Hs) (140) and then completed MiSeq sequencing. Oropharyngeal microbial α -diversity is markedly reduced in CCs versus Hs. Opportunistic pathogens are increased, while butyrate-producing genera are decreased in CCs versus Hs. The classifier based on eight optimal microbial markers is constructed through a random forest model and reached great diagnostic efficacy in both discovery and validation cohorts. Notably, the classifier successfully diagnosed SCs with positive IgG antibody as CCs and is demonstrated from the perspective of the microbiome. Importantly, several genera with significant differences gradually increase and decrease along with recovery from COVID-19. Forty-four oropharyngeal operational taxonomy units (OTUs) are closely correlated with 11 clinical indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Hs based on Spearman correlation analysis. Together, this research is the first to characterize oropharyngeal microbiota in recovered COVID-19 cases and suspected cases, to successfully construct and validate the diagnostic model for COVID-19 and to depict the correlations between microbial OTUs and clinical indicators.},

  abstract     = {DNA-binding proteins, including transcription factors (TFs), play essential roles in various cellular processes and pathogenesis of diseases, deeming to be potential therapeutic targets. However, these proteins are generally considered undruggable as they lack an enzymatic catalytic site or a ligand-binding pocket. Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology has been developed by engineering a bifunctional molecule chimera to bring a protein of interest (POI) to the proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thus inducing the ubiquitination of POI and further degradation through the proteasome pathway. Here, the development of oligonucleotide-based PROTAC (O&#39;PROTACs), a class of noncanonical PROTACs in which a TF-recognizing double-stranded oligonucleotide is incorporated as a binding moiety of POI is reported. It is demonstrated that O&#39;PROTACs of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and ETS-related gene (ERG), two highly cancer-related transcription factors, successfully promote degradation of these proteins, impede their transcriptional activity, and inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The programmable nature of O&#39;PROTACs indicates that this approach is also applicable to destruct other TFs. O&#39;PROTACs not only can serve as a research tool but also can be harnessed as a therapeutic arsenal to target DNA binding proteins for effective treatment of diseases such as cancer.},

  abstract     = {Evolution has decided to gift an articular structure to vertebrates, but not to invertebrates, owing to their distinct survival strategies. An articular structure permits kinematic motion in creatures. However, it is inappropriate for creatures whose survival strategy depends on the high deformability of their body. Accordingly, a material in which the presence of the articular structure can be altered, allowing the use of two contradictory strategies, will be advantageous in diverse dynamic applications. Herein, spatial micro-water molecule manipulation, termed engineering on variable occupation of water (EVO), that is used to realize a material with dual mechanical modes that exhibit extreme differences in stiffness is introduced. A transparent and homogeneous soft material (110 kPa) reversibly converts to an opaque material embodying a mechanical gradient (ranging from 1 GPa to 1 MPa) by on-demand switching. Intensive theoretical analysis of EVO yields the design of spatial transformation scheme. The EVO gel accomplishes kinematic motion planning and shows great promise for multimodal kinematics. This approach paves the way for the development and application of smart functional materials.},

In this work, a novel smart agent, KN046@ 19 F-ZIF-8, is developed to overcome these limitations. KN046 is a novel recombinant humanized PD-L1/CTLA-4 bispecific single-domain antibody-Fc fusion protein, which can bind to both PD-L1 and CTLA-4 effectively. ZIF-8 is a smart delivery system, which can safely and effectively deliver KN406 to a tumor. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the smart agent KN046@ 19 F-ZIF-8 not only improves the immune response rate of the antibody drug in treatment of tumors but also reduces its toxic side effects, thereby achieving excellent antitumor efficacy.

Herein, for the first time covalently functionalized few-layer black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) are applied as novel sonosensitizers in SDT, achieving not only boosted SDT efficacy but also inhibited cytotoxicity relative to the pristine BPNSs. Three different covalently functionalized-BPNSs are synthesized, including the first fullerene-functionalized BPNSs with C 60 covalently bonded onto the surface of BPNSs (abbreviated as C 60 -s-BP), surface-functionalized BPNSs by benzoic acid (abbreviated as BA-s-BP), and edge-functionalized BPNSs by C 60 (abbreviated as C 60 -e-BP), and the role of covalent functionalization pattern of BPNSs on its SDT efficacy is systematically investigated. Except C 60 -e-BP, both surface-functionalized BPNSs (C 60 -s-BP, BA-s-BP) exhibit higher SDT efficacies than the pristine BPNSs, while the highest SDT efficacy is achieved for BA-s-BP due to its strongest capability of generating the hydroxyl (·OH) radicals, which act as the dominant ROS to kill the tumor cells.},

With the requirements of miniaturization and portability of modern electronics, conducting film that can endure in-plane shrinkage is urgently needed but still remains challenging. Here, a new type of conducting film achieving reversible in-plane folding–unfolding function with large deformation by infusing conductive liquids into hierarchically structured polymer films consisting of both nanostructured polymer nanofibers and microstructured frames is reported. Nanostructured polymer nanofibers that can be completely wetted by the conductive liquids provide capillary forces to gain reversible in-plane folding–unfolding property, while the microstructured frames greatly enhance the extent during folding–unfolding process. Conductivity of the produced films can be significantly improved by rationally tuning the composition of infused conductive liquids, which always keeps high values during the folding–unfolding deformation. It is believed that this work may serve as the basis for robust fabrication of flexible conducting films with reversible in-plane folding–unfolding function, and can also put one-step forward of modern soft electronics.},

Unlike isotropic solids, in designed structures, peculiar couplings between shear and normal deformations can be achieved and exploited for practical applications. Here, a metamaterial is engineered that can be programmed to contract or extend under torsion and undergo nonlinear twist under compression. First, it is shown that the system exhibits a novel type of inverted Poynting effect, where axial compression induces a nonlinear torsion. Then the Poynting modulus of the structure is programmed from initial negative values to zero and positive values via a pre-compression applied prior to torsion. The work opens avenues for programming nonlinear elastic moduli of materials and tuning the couplings between shear and normal responses by rational design. Obtaining inverted and programmable Poynting effects in metamaterials inspires diverse applications from designing machine materials, soft robots, and actuators to engineering biological tissues, implants, and prosthetic devices functioning under compression and torsion.},

  abstract     = {Mounting evidence supports that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) play important roles in maintaining the integrity of normal brains, and that their dysfunction is the etiology of numerous severe neurological diseases. OPCs exhibit diverse heterogeneity in the adult brain, and distinct germinal zones of the embryonic brain contribute to OPC genesis. However, it remains obscure whether developmental origins shape OPC heterogeneity in the adult brain. Here, an in vivo clonal analysis approach is developed to address this. By combining OPC-specific transgenes, in utero electroporation, and the PiggyBac transposon system, the lineages of individual neonatal OPCs derived from either dorsal or ventral embryonic germinal zones are traced, and the landscape of their trajectories is comprehensively described throughout development. Surprisingly, despite behaving indistinguishably in the brain before weaning, dorsally derived OPCs continuously expand throughout life, but ventrally derived OPCs eventually diminish. Importantly, clonal analysis supports the existence of an intrinsic cellular “clock” to control OPC expansion. Moreover, knockout of NF1 could circumvent the distinction of ventrally derived OPCs in the adult brain. Together, this work shows the importance of in vivo clonal analysis in studying stem/progenitor cell heterogeneity, and reveals that developmental origins play a role in determining OPC fate.},

Here, the authors propose a novel natural-synthetic polymers composite structural color hydrogel film with high stretchability, flexibility, conductivity, and superior self-reporting ability to construct ideal multiple-signal bionic electronic skins. The composite hydrogel film is prepared by using the mixture of polyacrylamide (PAM), silk fibroin (SF), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (4-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, PP), and graphene oxide (GO) to replicate colloidal crystal templates and construct inverse opal scaffolds, followed by subsequent acid treatment. Due to these specific structures and components, the resultant film is imparted with vivid structural color and high conductivity while retaining the composite hydrogel&#39;s original stretchability and flexibility. The authors demonstrate that the composite hydrogel film has obvious color variation and electromechanical properties during the stretching and bending process, which could thus be utilized as a multi-signal response electronic skin to realize real-time color sensing and electrical response during human motions. These features indicate that the proposed composite structural color hydrogel film can widen the practical value of bionic electronic skins.},

The DynarFace allows accumulating attachment of IMBs on circulating rare cell (CRC) surfaces during hydrodynamically enhanced interface collision, where accumulatively enhanced magnetic trapping force improves capture efficiency toward CRCs with medium expression of biomarkers from blood samples by 134.81% compared with traditional non-dynamic interfaces. Moreover, magnet withdrawing-induced disappearance of trapping force affords DynarFace disassembly and CRC release with high efficiency (&gt;98%) and high viability (≈98%), compatible with downstream in vitro culture and gene analysis of CRCs.

  abstract     = {Blood exchanges between young and old partners demonstrate old blood has a detrimental effect on brain health of young animals. Previous studies primarily investigate soluble blood factors, such as transforming growth factor-beta, on the brain and the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, the role of blood cellular components, particularly erythrocytes, has not been defined. Erythrocyte morphology and rigidity change as mammals age, altering their transport within the capillary bed. This impacts downstream biological events, such as the release of reactive oxygen species and hemoglobin, potentially compromising the BBB. Here, a micro electrical BBB (µE-BBB), with cocultured endothelial and astrocytic cells, and a built-in trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) system is described to monitor the effect of capillary shear stress on erythrocytes derived from young and old mice and people and the subsequent effects of these cells on BBB integrity. This is monitored by the passage of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran and real-time profiling of TEER across the BBB after old and young erythrocyte exposure. Compared to young erythrocytes, old erythrocytes induce an increased permeability by 42% and diminished TEER by 2.9% of the µE-BBB. These results suggest that changes in circulating erythrocytes are a biomarker of aging in the context of BBB integrity.},

  abstract     = {Liquid–liquid phase-separated (LLPS) transcriptional factor assemblies at super-enhancers (SEs) provide a conceptual framework for underlying transcriptional control in mammal cells. However, the mechanistic understanding of LLPS in aberrant transcription driven by dysregulation of SEs in human malignancies is still elusive. By integrating SE profiling and core regulatory circuitry (CRC) calling algorithm, the CRC of metastatic and chemo-resistant osteosarcoma is delineated. CRC components, HOXB8 and FOSL1, produce dense and dynamic phase-separated droplets in vitro and liquid-like puncta in cell nuclei. Disruption of CRC phase separation decreases the chromatin accessibility in SE regions and inhibits the release of RNA polymerase II from the promoter of SE-driven genes. Importantly, absence of CRC key component causes a reduction in osteosarcoma tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, it is shown that CRC condensates can be specifically attenuated by the H3K27 demethylase inhibitor, GSK-J4. Pharmacological inhibition of the CRC phase separation results in metastasis suppression and re-sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in patient-derived xenograft model. Taken together, this study reveals a previously unknown mechanism that CRC factors formed LLPS condensates, and provides a phase separation-based pharmacological strategy to target undruggable CRC components for the treatment of metastatic and chemo-resistant osteosarcoma.},

  abstract     = {Aquaporins (AQPs), the natural water channel, have been actively investigated for overcoming the limitations of conventional desalination membranes. An AQP-based biomimetic high-pressure desalination membrane is designed by tethering AQP-carrying red blood cell membrane (RBCM) vesicles onto graphene oxide (GO). RBCMs with AQPs are incorporated into GO based on the molecular recognition between the integrin of RBCM and Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) ligand on the GO surface. GO is pre-functionalized with the Glycine-Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate-Serine peptide to capture RBCMs. RBCMs are inserted between GO flakes through the material-specific interaction between integrin of RBCM and RGD ligand, thus ensuring sufficient coverage of channels/defects in the GO for the full functioning of the AQPs. The incorporated AQPs are not completely fixed at the GO, as tethering is mediated by the integrin–RGD pair, and suitable AQP flexibility for appropriate functioning is guaranteed without frictional hindrance from the solid substrate. The integrity of the GO–RBCMs binding can provide mechanical strength for enduring high-pressure reverse-osmosis conditions for treating large amounts of water. This biomimetic membrane exhibits 99.1% NaCl rejection and a water permeance of 7.83 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 at 8 bar with a 1000-ppm NaCl feed solution, which surpasses the upper-bound line of current state-of-the-art membranes.},

Here, a multifunctional chemical sensing platform based on dual-resonant SEIRA device for sensitive and multifunctional on-chip detection of poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate) (PECA) is reported. It is experimentally demonstrated that the SEIRA sensing platform achieves multiple functions required by the PECA glue industry, including vibrational detection, thickness measurement, and in situ observation of polymerization and curing, which are usually realized by separately using a spectrometer, a viscometer, and an ellipsometer in the past. Specifically, the all-in-one sensor offers a dual-band fingerprint vibration identification, sub-nm level detection limit, and ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.76%/nm in thickness measurement, and second-level resolution in real-time observation of polymerization and curing. This work not only provides a valuable toolkit for ultra-sensitive and multifunctional on-chip detection of PECA, but also gives new insights into the SEIRA technology for multi-band, multi-functional, and on-chip chemical sensing.},

  abstract     = {Lower-limb motion monitoring is highly desired in various application scenarios ranging from rehabilitation to sports training. However, there still lacks a cost-effective, energy-saving, and computational complexity-reducing solution for this specific demand. Here, a motion capturing and energy harvesting hybridized lower-limb (MC-EH-HL) system with 3D printing is demonstrated. It enables low-frequency biomechanical energy harvesting with a sliding block-rail piezoelectric generator (S-PEG) and lower-limb motion sensing with a ratchet-based triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG). A unique S-PEG is proposed with particularly designed mechanical structures to convert lower-limb 3D motion into 1D linear sliding on the rail. On the one hand, high output power is achieved with the S-PEG working at a very low frequency, which realizes self-sustainable systems for wireless sensing under the Internet of Things framework. On the other hand, the R-TENG gives rise to digitalized triboelectric output, matching the rotation angles to the pulse numbers. Additional physical parameters can be estimated to enrich the sensory dimension. Accordingly, demonstrative rehabilitation, human-machine interfacing in virtual reality, and sports monitoring are presented. This developed hybridized system exhibits an economic and energy-efficient solution to support the need for lower-limb motion tracking in various scenarios, paving the way for self-sustainable multidimensional motion tracking systems in near future.},

  abstract     = {The triboelectric effect is a ubiquitous phenomenon in which the surfaces of two materials are easily charged during the contact-separation process. Despite the widespread consequences and applications, the charging mechanisms are not sufficiently understood. Here, the authors report that, in the presence of a strain gradient, the charge transfer is a result of competition between flexoelectricity and triboelectricity, which could enhance charge transfer during triboelectric measurements when the charge transfers of both effects are in the same direction. When they are in the opposite directions, the direction and amount of charge transfer could be modulated by the competition between flexoelectric and triboelectric effects, which leads to a distinctive phenomenon, that is, the charge transfer is reversed with varying forces. The subsequent results on the electrical power output signals from the triboelectrification support the proposed mechanism. Therefore, the present study emphasizes the key role of the flexoelectric effect through experimental approaches, and suggests that both the amount and direction of charge transfer can be modulated by manipulating the mixed triboelectric and flexoelectric effects. This finding may provide important information on the triboelectric effect and can be further extended to serve as a guideline for material selection during a nanopatterned device design.},

  abstract     = {As a chronic metabolic disease, diabetes mellitus (DM) creates a hyperglycemic micromilieu around implants, resulting inthe high complication and failure rate of implantation because of mitochondrial dysfunction in hyperglycemia. To address the daunting issue, the authors innovatively devised and developed mitochondria-targeted orthopedic implants consisted of nutrient element coatings and polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Dual nutrient elements, in the modality of ZnO and Sr(OH) 2 , are assembled onto the sulfonated PEEK surface (Zn&amp;Sr-SPEEK). The results indicate the synergistic liberation of Zn 2+ and Sr 2+ from coating massacres pathogenic bacteria and dramatically facilitates cyto-activity of osteoblasts upon the hyperglycemic niche. Intriguingly, Zn&amp;Sr-SPEEK implants are demonstrated to have a robust ability to recuperate hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial dynamic disequilibrium and dysfunction by means of Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) gene down-regulation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) resurgence, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination, ultimately enhancing osteogenicity of osteoblasts. In vivo evaluations utilizing diabetic rat femoral/tibia defect model at 4 and 8 weeks further confirm that nutrient element coatings substantially augment bone remodeling and osseointegration. Altogether, this study not only reveals the importance of Zn 2+ and Sr 2+ modulation on mitochondrial dynamics that contributes to bone formation and osseointegration, but also provides a novel orthopedic implant for diabetic patients with mitochondrial modulation capability.},

Here, the spatiotemporal localization of ganglioside GM1, a glycolipid receptor involved in signaling, during sphingomyelinase-mediated hydrolysis is described. Real-time visualization of the dynamic remodeling of the heterogeneous lipid membrane that occurs due to sphingomyelinase action is used to examine GM1 clustering, and unexpectedly, it is found that it is more complex than previously thought. Specifically, lipid membranes generate two distinct types of condensed GM1: 1) rapidly formed but short-lived GM1 clusters that are formed in ceramide-rich domains nucleated from the liquid-disordered phase; and 2) late-onset yet long-lasting, high-density GM1 clusters that are formed in the liquid-ordered phase. These findings suggest that multiple pathways exist in a plasma membrane to synergistically facilitate the rapid amplification and persistence of signals.},

Such anisotropic lattice rippling modulates the intrinsic point defect (Te vacancy) distribution, in which they aggregate at the constrictive inner side of the undulating structure, presumably due to the ripple-induced asymmetric strain as elaborated by density functional theory.

Herein, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst is designed and fabricated by encapsulating Co nanoparticles in interconnected N-doped hollow porous carbon nanofibers (designated as Co@N-C/PCNF) using an ultrafast high-temperature shock technology. Benefiting from the synergistic effect and intrinsic activity of the Co  N  C moiety, as well as porous structure of carbon nanofibers, the Co@N-C/PCNF composite shows high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both OER (289 mV at 10 mA cm −2 ) and ORR (half-wave potential of 0.85 V). The Co  N  C moiety in the composite can modulate the local environmental and electrical structure of the catalysts, thus optimizing the adsorption/desorption kinetics and decreasing the reaction barriers for promoting the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Co@N-C/PCNF-based aqueous Zn–air batteries (AZAB) provide high power density of 292 mW cm −2 , and the assembled flexible ZAB can power wearable devices.},

  abstract     = {At the microsite “Evolution Slope”, Tabigha, Israel, wild barley ( Hordeum spontaneum ) populations adapted to dry Terra Rossa soil, and its derivative abutting wild barley population adapted to moist and fungi-rich Basalt soil. However, the mechanisms underlying the edaphic adaptation remain elusive. Accordingly, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and metabolome analysis are performed on ten wild barley accessions inhabiting Terra Rossa and Basalt soil. A total of 121 433 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 10 478 DMR-genes are identified between the two wild barley populations. DMR-genes in CG context (CG-DMR-genes) are enriched in the pathways related with the fundamental processes, and DMR-genes in CHH context (CHH-DMR-genes) are mainly associated with defense response. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis reveal that the primary and secondary metabolisms are more active in Terra Rossa and Basalt wild barley populations, respectively. Multi-omics analysis indicate that sugar metabolism facilitates the adaptation of wild barley to dry Terra Rossa soil, whereas the enhancement of phenylpropanoid/phenolamide biosynthesis is beneficial for wild barley to inhabit moist and fungi pathogen-rich Basalt soil. The current results make a deep insight into edaphic adaptation of wild barley and provide elite genetic and epigenetic resources for developing barley with high abiotic stress tolerance.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of commercial flexible/wearable devices, flexible batteries have attracted great attention as optimal power sources. However, a combination of high energy density and excellent arbitrary deformation ability is still a critical challenge to satisfy practical applications. Inspired by rigid and soft features of chemical molecular structures, novel bidirectional flexible snake-origami lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with both high energy density and favorable flexibility are designed and fabricated. The flexible snake-origami battery consists of rigid and soft segments, where the former is designed as the energy unit and the latter served as the deformation unit. With the unique features from such design, the as-fabricated battery with calculating all the components exhibits a record-setting energy density of 357 Wh L −1 (133 Wh kg −1 ), compared with the cell-scale flexible LIBs achieved from both academic and industry. Additionally, a design principle is established to verify the validity of utilizing rigid-soft-coupled structure for enduring various deformations, and the intrinsic relationship between battery structure, energy density, and flexibility can be confirmed. The results suggest that the design principle and performance of bidirectional flexible snake-origami batteries will provide a new reliable strategy for achieving high energy flexible batteries for wearable devices.},

Here, spin–vibronic coupling (SVC)-assisted ultrapure blue emitters obtained by joining two carbazole-derived moieties at a para position of a phenyl unit and performing substitutions using several blocking groups are presented. Despite a relatively large singlet–triplet gap (∆ E ST ) of &gt;0.2 eV, efficient triplet-to-singlet crossover can be realized, with assistance from resonant SVC. To enhance the spin crossover, electronic energy levels are fine-tuned, thereby causing ∆ E ST to be in resonance with a triplet–triplet gap (∆ E TT ). A sizable population transfer between spin multiplicities (&gt;10 3 s −1 ) is achieved, and this result agrees well with theoretical predictions. An OLED fabricated using a multiple-resonance-type SVC-TADF emitter with CIE color coordinates of (0.15, 0.05) exhibits ultrapure blue emissions, with a narrow full-width-at-half-maximum of 21 nm and a high external quantum efficiency of 23.1%.},

Here the authors report QD superlattices in which the gain medium facilitates excitonic delocalization to decrease Auger recombination and in which the macroscopic dimensions of the structures provide the optical feedback required for lasing. The authors develope a self-assembly strategy that relies on sodiumd—an assembly director that passivates the surface of the QDs and induces self-assembly to form ordered three-dimensional cubic structures. A density functional theory model that accounts for the attraction forces between QDs allows to explain self-assembly and superlattice formation. Compared to conventional organic-ligand-passivated QDs, sodium enables higher attractive forces, ultimately leading to the formation of micron-length scale structures and the optical faceting required for feedback. Simultaneously, the decreased inter-dot distance enabled by the new ligand enhances exciton delocalization among QDs, as demonstrated by the dynamically red-shifted photoluminescence. These structures function as the lasing cavity and the gain medium, enabling nanosecond-sustained lasing with a threshold of 25 µJ cm –2 .},

In this work, the authors demonstrate ultrahigh-performance metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) SBPDs based on amorphous ( a -) Ga 2 O 3 via a post-annealing process. The post-annealed MSM a -Ga 2 O 3 SBPDs exhibit superhigh sensitivity of 733 A/W and high response speed of 18 ms, giving a high gain-bandwidth product over 10 4 at 5 V. The SBPDs also show ultrahigh photo-to-dark current ratio of 3.9 × 10 7 . Additionally, the PDs demonstrate super-high specific detectivity of 3.9 × 10 16 Jones owing to the extremely low noise down to 3.5 fW Hz −1/2 , suggesting high signal-to-noise ratio. Underlying mechanism for such superior photoelectric properties is revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy and first principles calculation. Furthermore, for the first time, a large-scale, high-uniformity 32 × 32 image sensor array based on the post-annealed a -Ga 2 O 3 SBPDs is fabricated. Clear image of target object with high contrast can be obtained thanks to the high sensitivity and uniformity of the array.

Currently there is no other way to modulate the amplitude or frequency but to structurally redesign the entire fluidic circuitry. This is mainly because there is currently no method to create an analog circuit-like behavior in the digital fluidic circuits using conventional digitized fluidic gates. In this work, a new approach is presented to designing a circuit with digitized fluidic gates that is comparable to an analog circuit capable of actively tuning the circuit&#39;s fluidic characteristics, such as pressure gain, amplitude of output, and time response. For the first time, a pressure-controlled oscillator is modeled, designed, and prototyped that not only controls the fluidic oscillation, but also modulates its frequency using only a single, quasi-static pressure input. It can also demonstrate the circuit&#39;s performance for the control of a soft robotic system by actively modulating the motion of a soft earthworm robot up to twice of crawling speeds. This work has distinct contributions to designing and building intelligent pneumatic controllers toward truly comprehensive soft robotic systems.},

However, these properties often change in unfavorable directions owing to the spontaneous formation of vacancies at high temperatures. Although it is crucial to maintain high thermoelectric performance over a broad temperature range, the suppression of vacancies is challenging since their formation is thermodynamically preferred. In this study, using PbTe as a model system, it is demonstrated that a high thermoelectric dimensionless figure of merit, zT ≈ 2.1 at 723 K, can be achieved by suppressing the vacancy formation via dopant balancing. Hole-killer Te vacancies are suppressed by Ag doping because of the increased electron chemical potential. As a result, the re-dissolution of Na 2 Te above 623 K can significantly increase the hole concentration and suppress the drop in the power factor. Furthermore, point defect scattering in material systems significantly reduces lattice thermal conductivity. The synergy between defect and carrier engineering offers a pathway for achieving a high thermoelectric performance by alleviating the power factor drop and can be utilized to enhance thermoelectric properties of thermoelectric materials.},

Such scaffolds are usually composed of a near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion agent and a conventional bone scaffold for photothermal therapy (PTT) and long-term bone regeneration. However, the reported photothermal conversion agents are mainly restricted to the first biological window (NIR-I) with intrinsic poor tissue penetration depth. Also, most of these agents are non-bioactive materials, which induced potential systemic side toxicity after implantation. Herein, a NIR-II photothermal conversion agent (Wesselsite [SrCuSi 4 O 10 ] nanosheets, SC NSs) with tremendous osteogenic and angiogenic bioactivity, is rationally integrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) via 3D printing.

However, outside of 2D materials derived from van der Waals layered bulk materials only a few other such materials are realized, and it remains difficult to confirm their 2D freestanding structure. Despite that, many metals are predicted to exist as 2D systems. In this review, the authors summarize the recent progress made in the synthesis and characterization of these 2D metals, so called metallenes, and their oxide forms, metallene oxides as free standing 2D structures formed in situ through the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) to synthesize these materials. Two primary approaches for forming freestanding monoatomic metallic membranes are identified. In the first, graphene pores as a means to suspend the metallene or metallene oxide and in the second, electron-beam sputtering for the selective etching of metal alloys or thick complex initial materials is employed to obtain freestanding single-atom-thick 2D metal. The data show a growing number of 2D metals/metallenes and 2D metal/ metallene oxides having been confirmed and point to a bright future for further discoveries of these 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {High-throughput screening has become one of the major strategies for the discovery of novel functional materials. However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of sufficient and diverse materials in current materials repositories such as the open quantum materials database (OQMD). Recent progress in deep learning have enabled generative strategies that learn implicit chemical rules for creating hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generative design of novel cubic materials. When trained on 375 749 ternary materials from the OQMD database, the authors show that the model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such materials have been verified by phonon dispersion calculation. Considering the importance of cubic materials in wide applications such as solar panels, the GAN model provides a promising approach to significantly expand existing materials repositories, enabling the discovery of new functional materials via screening.

  abstract     = {The efficacy of cardiac regenerative strategies for myocardial infarction (MI) treatment is greatly limited by the cardiac microenvironment. The combination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging to suppress the oxidative stress damage and macrophage polarization to regenerative M2 phenotype in the MI microenvironment can be desirable for MI treatment. Herein, melanin nanoparticles (MNPs)/alginate (Alg) hydrogels composed of two marine-derived natural biomaterials, MNPs obtained from cuttlefish ink and alginate extracted from ocean algae, are proposed. Taking advantage of the antioxidant property of MNPs and mechanical support from injectable alginate hydrogels, the MNPs/Alg hydrogel is explored for cardiac repair by regulating the MI microenvironment. The MNPs/Alg hydrogel is found to eliminate ROS against oxidative stress injury of cardiomyocytes. More interestingly, the macrophage polarization to regenerative M2 macrophages can be greatly promoted in the presence of MNPs/Alg hydrogel. An MI rat model is utilized to evaluate the feasibility of the as-prepared MNPs/Alg hydrogel for cardiac repair in vivo. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and proangiogenesis effects of the hydrogel are investigated in detail. The present study opens up a new way to utilize natural biomaterials for MI treatment and allows to rerecognize the great value of natural biomaterials in cardiac repair.},

  abstract     = {Engineered cartilage derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) always fails to maintain the cartilaginous phenotype in the subcutaneous environment due to the ossification tendency. Vascular invasion is a prerequisite for endochondral ossification during the development of long bone. As an oral antitumor medicine, Inlyta (axitinib) possesses pronounced antiangiogenic activity, owing to the inactivation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. In this study, axitinib-loaded poly( ε -caprolactone) (PCL)/collagen nanofibrous membranes are fabricated by electrospinning for the first time. Rabbit-derived MSCs-engineered cartilage is encapsulated in the axitinib-loaded nanofibrous membrane and subcutaneously implanted into nude mice. The sustained and localized release of axitinib successfully inhibits vascular invasion, stabilizes cartilaginous phenotype, and helps cartilage maturation. RNA sequence further reveals that axitinib creates an avascular, hypoxic, and low immune response niche. Timp1 is remarkably upregulated in this niche, which probably plays a functional role in inhibiting the activity of matrix metalloproteinases and stabilizing the engineered cartilage. This study provides a novel strategy for stable subcutaneous chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stromal cells, which is also suitable for other medical applications, such as arthritis treatment, local treatment of tumors, and regeneration of other avascular tissues (cornea and tendon).},

  abstract     = {Aberrant SMAD3 activation has been implicated as a driving event in cancer metastasis, yet the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here, SMAD3 is identified as a nonhistone substrate of lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A). The acetylation of SMAD3 at K20 and K117 by KAT6A promotes SMAD3 association with oncogenic chromatin modifier tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) and disrupts SMAD3 interaction with tumor suppressor TRIM33. This event in turn promotes KAT6A-acetylated H3K23-mediated recruitment of TRIM24–SMAD3 complex to chromatin and thereby increases SMAD3 activation and immune response-related cytokine expression, leading to enhanced breast cancer stem-like cell stemness, myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis. Inhibiting KAT6A in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating TNBC xenograft-bearing animals markedly attenuates metastasis and provides a significant survival benefit. Thus, the work presents a KAT6A acetylation-dependent regulatory mechanism governing SMAD3 oncogenic function and provides insight into how targeting an epigenetic factor with immunotherapies enhances the antimetastasis efficacy.},

Meanwhile, challenges in the approaches toward achieving high-performance devices still inspire the search for new 2D vdW materials with precious properties. In this study, via molecular beam epitaxy, for the first time, the vdW SnI 2 monolayer is successfully fabricated with a new structure. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy characterization, as corroborated by the density functional theory calculation, indicates that this SnI 2 monolayer exhibits a band gap of ≈2.9 eV in the visible purple range, and an indirect- to direct-band gap transition occurs in the SnI 2 bilayer. This study provides a new semiconducting 2D material that is promising as a building block in future electronics/optoelectronics.},

In this review paper, first, the authors introduce the background of PR and describe how this phenomenon was originally identified in semiconductors. Then, the theory and modelling of PR is reviewed and some of the important parameters that are used to quantify PR are highlighted. Next, a variety of the methods used to achieve and characterize PR in materials and devices are discussed. Examples of how the performance parameters of different types of optoelectronic devices are affected by PR are described. Finally, a summary of the roles of PR in semiconductor materials and devices and an outlook on how PR can be used to solve existing problems and challenges in the field of optoelectronics are provided. From this review, it is apparent that PR can have a positive impact on optoelectronic device performance, and that further in-depth theoretical and experimental studies are needed to rigorously demonstrate the advantages and importance of PR.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there have been numerous studies on utilizing surface treatments or photosensitizing layers to improve photodetectors based on 2D materials. Meanwhile, avalanche breakdown phenomenon has provided an ultimate high-gain route toward photodetection in the form of single-photon detectors. Here, the authors report ultrasensitive avalanche phototransistors based on monolayer MoS 2 synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. A lower critical field for the electrical breakdown under illumination shows strong evidence for avalanche breakdown initiated by photogenerated carriers in MoS 2 channel. By utilizing the photo-initiated carrier multiplication, their avalanche photodetectors exhibit the maximum responsivity of ≈3.4 × 10 7 A W −1 and the detectivity of ≈4.3 × 10 16 Jones under a low dark current, which are a few orders of magnitudes higher than the highest values reported previously, despite the absence of any additional chemical treatments or photosensitizing layers. The realization of both the ultrahigh photoresponsivity and detectivity is attributed to the interplay between the carrier multiplication by avalanche breakdown and carrier injection across a Schottky barrier between the channel and metal electrodes. This work presents a simple and powerful method to enhance the performance of photodetectors based on carrier multiplication phenomena in 2D materials and provides the underlying physics of atomically thin avalanche photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {While tremendous progress has recently been made in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), large-area blue devices feature inferior performance due to uneven morphologies and vast defects in the solution-processed perovskite films. To alleviate these issues, a facile and reliable interface engineering scheme is reported for manipulating the crystallization of perovskite films enabled by a multifunctional molecule 2-amino-1,3-propanediol (APDO)-triggered “anchoring effect” at the grain-growth interface. Sky-blue perovskite films with large-area uniformity and low trap states are obtained, showing the distinctly improved radiative recombination and hole-transport capability. Based on the APDO-induced interface engineering, synergistical boost in device performance is achieved for large-area sky-blue PeLED (measuring at 100 mm 2 ) with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.2% and a highly prolonged operational lifetime. A decent EQE up to 6.1% is demonstrated for the largest sky-blue device emitting at 400 mm 2 .},

  abstract     = {The deficiency of antigen-specific T cells and the induction of various treatment-induced immunosuppressions still limits the clinical benefit of cancer immunotherapy. Although the chemo-immunotherapy adjuvanted with Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist (TLR 7/8a) induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and in situ vaccination effect, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is also significantly increased in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN), which offsets the activated antitumor immunity. To address the treatment-induced immunosuppression, an assemblable immune modulating suspension (AIMS) containing ICD inducer (paclitaxel) and supra-adjuvant (immune booster; R848 as a TLR 7/8a, immunosuppression reliever; epacadostat as an IDO inhibitor) is suggested and shows that it increases cytotoxic T lymphocytes and relieves the IDO-related immunosuppression (TGF- β , IL-10, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells) in both TME and TDLN, by the formation of in situ depot in tumor bed as well as by the efficient migration into TDLN. Local administration of AIMS increases T cell infiltration in both local and distant tumors and significantly inhibits the metastasis of tumors to the lung. Reverting treatment-induced secondary immunosuppression and reshaping “cold tumor” into “hot tumor” by AIMS also increases the response rate of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, which promises a new nanotheranostic strategy in cancer immunotherapy.},

A new pseudo-NP design principle is described, i.e., the combination of NP-fragments by transformations that are not part of current biosynthesis pathways. A collection of indofulvin pseudo-NPs is obtained from 2-hydroxyethyl-indoles and ketones derived from the fragment-sized NP griseofulvin by means of an iso-oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction. Cheminformatic analysis indicates that the indofulvins reside in an area of chemical space sparsely covered by NPs, drugs, and drug-like compounds and they may combine favorable properties of these compound classes. Biological evaluation of the compound collection in different cell-based assays and the unbiased high content cell painting assay reveal that the indofulvins define a new autophagy inhibitor chemotype that targets mitochondrial respiration.},

  abstract     = {Recently, novel core–shell MOF@COF hybrids display excellent performance in various fields because of their inherited advantages from their parent MOFs and/or COFs. However, it is still a grand challenge to adjust the morphology of MOFs and/or COFs for consequent performance improvement. Herein, a Ti-MOF@TpTt hybrid coated with ultra-thin COF nanobelt, which is different from the fibrillar-like parent COF, is successfully synthesized through a sequential growth strategy. The as-obtained Pd decorated Ti-MOF@TpTt catalyst exhibits much higher photocatalytic performance than those of Ti-MOF, TpTt-COF, and Ti-MOF@TpTt hybrids with fibrillar-like COF shell for the photocatalytic cascade reactions of ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis and nitroarenes hydrogenation. These can be attributed to its high BET surface area, core–shell structure, and type II heterojunction, which offers more accessible active sites and improves the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers. Finally, the possible mechanisms of the cascade reaction are also proposed to well explain the improved performance of this photocatalytic system. This work presents a constructive route for designing core–shell MOF@COF hybrids with controllable morphology adjustment of COF shell, leading to the improved photocatalytic ability to broaden the applications of MOF/COF hybrid materials.},

The extracellular signals of CAFs have been attributed to the extracellular matrix, cytokines, cell surface checkpoints, and exosomes. In the present study, it is demonstrated that the CD10 transmembrane hydrolase expressed on a subset of CAFs supports tumor stemness and induces chemoresistance. Mechanistically, CD10 degenerates an antitumoral peptide termed osteogenic growth peptide (OGP). OGP restrains the expression of rate-limiting desaturase SCD1 and inhibits lipid desaturation, which is required for cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting CD10 significantly improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. Clinically, CD10-OGP signals are associated with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. The collective data suggest that a nexus between the niche and lipid metabolism in CSCs is a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer.},

However, current conversion efficiency of chemical energy to light is very low, limited by the competing process of heat dissipation released as black body radiation. From a fundamental point of view, the direct conversion of chemical energy into light without this detour is possible. This so called cataluminescence from methanol combustion over Er-substituted SrTiO 3 with high efficiency is demonstrated. The catalytically active quaternary perovskites Er 0.15 La 0.15 Sr 0.55 Ti 0.95 Cu 0.05 O 3 − δ exsolute and reabsorb metallic Cu particles onto the surface in reducing and oxidizing conditions, respectively. Thus, it is able to manipulate the surface structure and investigate its influence on the catalytic as well as luminescent properties. The fuel to air ratio around the stoichiometry point changes the conditions from reducing to oxidizing and thereby alters the surface properties. This is evidenced by post mortem X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoemission as well as operando optical spectroscopy. Cataluminescence takes place under oxidizing conditions (lean fuel to air mixture) on the Er-perovskite oxide with a strong selective near infrared emission, while reducing conditions stimulate formation of plasmonic Cu-nanoparticles, which emit black body radiation.},

In this study, pyrrolidinum and quaternary ammonium cations are attached to the polyphenylene oxide (PPO) backbone through flexible spacer units (five, seven, or nine carbon atoms) with different terminal alkyl groups. The Van der Waals force and electrostatic repulsion between the ionomer binder and catalyst are regulated through the flexible spacer units and terminal alkyl groups to alleviate the agglomeration of catalyst particles and acquire a high catalytic activity. To evaluate the electrochemical stability of the cationic groups, the alkaline stability of the ionomer binder is tested under a constant voltage to simulate the true operational environment of the fuel cells. The results reveal that the degradation of the cation groups of ionomer binder is accelerated under a constant voltage condition. This phenomenon in neglect earlier, may serve as a useful reference for the synthesis and performance enhancement of ionomer binders.},

This all-fiber structure is highly porous and ultralight, with large specific area (for efficient water evaporation), interconnected channels (for easy vapor escape), and low thermal conductivity (to avoid heat loss). The unique unidirectional water-transfer behavior of the nonwoven enables it to spontaneously pump an adjustable amount of water for interfacial solar heating and a delicate balance between water supply and loss may accelerate the evaporation speed of water. These distinct benefits endow the solar evaporator with excellent evaporation rates of 1.44 kg m –2 h –1 under the simulated irradiation of 1 sun and 12.81 kg m –2 d –1 under natural sunlight. Moreover, the evaporator can be fabricated by using low-cost materials and industrialized methods (overall cost ≈2.4 USD m −2 ), making one believe its practical significance for commercial solar steam evaporation.},

Unfortunately, vitrified systems ≥3 mL like large tissues and organs, cannot currently be rewarmed sufficiently rapidly or uniformly by convective approaches to avoid ice crystallization or cracking failures. A new volumetric rewarming technology entitled “nanowarming” addresses this problem by using radiofrequency excited iron oxide nanoparticles to rewarm vitrified systems rapidly and uniformly. Here, for the first time, successful recovery of a rat kidney from the vitrified state using nanowarming, is shown. First, kidneys are perfused via the renal artery with a cryoprotective cocktail (CPA) and silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (sIONPs). After cooling at −40 °C min −1 in a controlled rate freezer, microcomputed tomography (µCT) imaging is used to verify the distribution of the sIONPs and the vitrified state of the kidneys. By applying a radiofrequency field to excite the distributed sIONPs, the vitrified kidneys are nanowarmed at a mean rate of 63.7 °C min −1 . Experiments and modeling show the avoidance of both ice crystallization and cracking during these processes. Histology and confocal imaging show that nanowarmed kidneys are dramatically better than convective rewarming controls. This work suggests that kidney nanowarming holds tremendous promise for transplantation.},

  abstract     = {Employing X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and momentum-resolved density fluctuation (MRDF) theory, the magnetic and electronic properties of ultrathin NdNiO 3 (NNO) film in proximity to ferromagnetic (FM) La 0.67 Sr 0.33 MnO 3 (LSMO) layer are investigated. The experimental data shows the direct magnetic coupling between the nickelate film and the manganite layer which causes an unusual ferromagnetic (FM) phase in NNO. Moreover, it is shown the metal–insulator transition in the NNO layer, identified by an abrupt suppression of ARPES spectral weight near the Fermi level ( E F ), is absent. This observation suggests that the insulating AFM ground state is quenched in proximity to the FM layer. Combining the experimental data (XMCD and AREPS) with the momentum-resolved density fluctuation calculation (MRDF) reveals a direct link between the MIT and the magnetic orders in NNO systems. This work demonstrates that the proximity layer order can be broadly used to modify physical properties and enrich the phase diagram of RENiO 3 (RE = rare-earth element).},

  abstract     = {The balance between antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) critically regulates tumor initiation and progression. However, whether and how the tumor-favoring redox status is controlled by cytokine networks remain poorly defined. Here, it is shown that IL-36 γ and IL-36Ra reciprocally regulate the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by modulating glutathione metabolism and ROS resolution. Knockout, inhibition, or neutralization of IL-36 γ significantly inhibits NSCLC progression and prolongs survival of the Kras LSL-G12D/+ Tp53 fl/fl and Kras LSL-G12D/+ Lkb1 fl/fl mice after tumor induction, whereas knockout of IL-36Ra exacerbates tumorigenesis in these NSCLC mouse models and accelerates death of mice. Mechanistically, IL-36 γ directly upregulates an array of genes involved in glutathione homeostasis to reduce ROS and prevent oxidative stress-induced cell death, which is mitigated by IL-36Ra or IL-36 γ neutralizing antibody. Consistently, IL-36 γ staining is positively and negatively correlated with glutathione biosynthesis and ROS in human NSCLC tumor biopsies, respectively. These findings highlight essential roles of cytokine networks in redox for tumorigenesis and provide potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.},

  abstract     = {Recent investigations reveal that lactate is not a waste product but a major energy source for cells, especially in the mitochondria, which can support cellular survival under glucose shortage. Accordingly, the new understanding of lactate prompts to target it together with glucose to pursue a more efficient cancer starvation therapy. Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoplatforms are used to co-deliver α -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC) and glucose oxidase (GOx) and fulfill the task of simultaneous depriving of lactate and glucose, resulting in a new nanomedicine CHC/GOx@ZIF-8. The synthesis conditions are carefully optimized in order to yield monodisperse and uniform nanomedicines, which will ensure reliable and steady therapeutic properties. Compared with the strategies aiming at a single carbon source, improved starvation therapy efficacy is observed. Besides, more than boosting the energy shortage, CHC/GOx@ZIF-8 can block the lactate-fueled respiration and relieve solid tumor hypoxia, which will enhance GOx catalysis activity, depleting extra glucose, and producing more cytotoxic H 2 O 2 . By the synergistically enhanced anti-tumor effect, both in vitro and in vivo cancer-killing efficacies of CHC/GOx@ZIF-8 show twice enhancements than the GOx mediated therapy. The results demonstrate that the dual-depriving of lactate and glucose is a more advanced strategy for strengthening cancer starvation therapy.},

Here, single-cell RNA sequencing is performed with T cells sorted from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and patients with B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Unbiased bioinformatics analysis enabled the authors to identify 13 T cell clusters in the patients based on their molecular properties. All 11 major T cell subsets in healthy individuals are found in the patients with B-ALL, with the counterparts in the patients universally showing more activated characteristics. Two exhausted T cell populations, characterized by up-regulation of TIGIT , PDCD1 , HLADRA , LAG3 , and CTLA4 are specifically discovered in B-ALL patients. Of note, these exhausted T cells possess remarkable heterogeneity, and ten sub-clusters are further identified, which are characterized by different cell cycle phases, naïve states, and GNLY (coding granulysin) expression. Coupled with single-cell T cell receptor repertoire profiling, diverse originations of the exhausted T cells in B-ALL are suggested, and clonally expanded exhausted T cells are likely to originate from CD8 + effector memory/terminal effector cells. Together, these data provide for the first-time valuable insights for understanding exhausted T cell populations in leukemia.},

  abstract     = {Nanovesicles (NVs) are emerging as innovative, theranostic tools for cargo delivery. Recently, surface engineering of NVs with membrane proteins from specific cell types has been shown to improve the biocompatibility of NVs and enable the integration of functional attributes. However, this type of biomimetic approach has not yet been explored using human neural cells for applications within the nervous system. Here, this paper optimizes and validates the scalable and reproducible production of two types of neuron-targeting NVs, each with a distinct lipid formulation backbone suited to potential therapeutic cargo, by integrating membrane proteins that are unbiasedly sourced from human pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons. The results establish that both endogenous and genetically engineered cell-derived proteins effectively transfer to NVs without disruption of their physicochemical properties. NVs with neuron-derived membrane proteins exhibit enhanced neuronal association and uptake compared to bare NVs. Viability of 3D neural sphere cultures is not disrupted by treatment, which verifies the utility of organoid-based approaches as NV testing platforms. Finally, these results confirm cellular association and uptake of the biomimetic humanized NVs to neurons within rodent cranial nerves. In summary, the customizable NVs reported here enable next-generation functionalized theranostics aimed to promote neuroregeneration.},

The specific recognition of DNA modifications by the transcriptional protein machinery is thought to be a potential mechanism for epigenetic-driven gene regulation, and many modified DNA-specific binding proteins have been uncovered. However, the panoramic view of the roles of DNA modification readers at the proteome level remains largely unclear. Here, a recently developed concatenated tandem array of consensus transcription factor (TF) response elements (catTFREs) approach is employed to profile the binding activity of TFs at DNA modifications. Modified DNA-binding activity is quantified for 1039 TFs, representing 70% of the TFs in the human genome. Additionally, the modified DNA-binding activity of 600 TFs is monitored during the mouse brain development from the embryo to the adult stages. Readers of these DNA modifications are predicted, and the hierarchical networks between the transcriptional protein machinery and modified DNA are described. It is further demonstrated that ZNF24 and ZSCAN21 are potential readers of 5fC-modified DNA. This study provides a landscape of TF–DNA modification interactions that can be used to elucidate the epigenetic-related transcriptional regulation mechanisms under physiological conditions.},

Herein, the authors propose a strategy to significantly reduce the superficial lattice tensile strain by means of incorporating an inorganic 2D Cl-terminated Ti 3 C 2 (Ti 3 C 2 Cl x ) MXene into the bulk and surface of CsPbBr 3 film. Arising from the strong interaction between Cl atoms in Ti 3 C 2 Cl x and the under-coordinated Pb 2+ in CsPbBr 3 lattice, the expanded perovskite lattice is compressed and confined to act as a lattice “tape”, in which the Pb  Cl bond plays a role of “glue” and the 2D Ti 3 C 2 immobilizes the lattice. Finally, the defective surface is healed and a champion efficiency as high as 11.08% with an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage up to 1.702 V is achieved on the best all-inorganic CsPbBr 3 PSC, which is so far the highest efficiency record for this kind of PSCs. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device demonstrates nearly unchanged performance under 80% relative humidity over 100 days and 85 °C over 30 days.},

Herein, a surface phosphorization-monolithic strategy is proposed to embed CoO nanoparticles into paulownia carbon plate (P–CoO@PWC) as monolithic electrodes. Benefiting from the retention of natural transport channels, P–CoO@PWC-2 is conducive to the construction of three-phase interface structure for efficient mass transfer and high electrical conductivity. The electrode exhibits remarkable catalytic activities for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small overpotential gap ( E OER − E ORR = 0.68 V). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporation of P on P–CoO@PWC-2 surface adjusts the electronic structure to promote the dissociation of water and the activation of oxygen, thus inducing catalytic activity. The monolithic P–CoO@PWC-2 electrode for quasi-solid-state or aqueous ZABs has excellent specific power, low charge–discharge voltage gap (0.83 V), and long-term cycling stability (over 700 cycles). This work serves as a new avenue for transforming abundant biomass into high-value energy-related engineering products.},

These tiny devices, which move and navigate by themselves, are typically based on inorganic microstructures that are not biodegradable and potentially toxic, often using toxic fuels or elaborate external energy sources, which limits their real-world applications. One potential solution to these issues is to go back to nature. Here, the authors use high-speed Aqua Sperm micromotors obtained from North African catfish ( Clarias gariepinus , B. 1822) to destroy bacterial biofilm. These Aqua Sperm micromotors use water-induced dynein ATPase catalyzed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation as biocompatible fuel to trigger their fast speed and snake-like undulatory locomotion that facilitate biofilm destruction in less than one minute. This efficient biofilm destruction is due to the ultra-fast velocity as well as the head size of Aqua Sperm micromotors being similar to bacteria, which facilitates their entry to and navigation within the biofilm matrix. In addition, the authors demonstrate the real-world application of Aqua Sperm micromotors by destroying biofilms that had colonized medical and laboratory tubing.

However, a few bottlenecks for practical applications are high-cost, low productivity, and severe sunlight angle dependence. Herein, solar evaporation with enhanced photocatalytic capacity that is light direction insensitive and of efficiency breakthrough by virtue of a three-dimensional (3D) photothermal catalytic spherical isotopic evaporator is demonstrated. A homogeneous layer of microfluidic blow spun polyamide nanofibers loaded with efficient light absorber of polypyrrole nanoparticles conformally wraps onto a lightweight, thermal insulating plastic sphere, featuring favorable interfacial solar heating and efficient water transportation. The 3D spherical geometry not only guarantees the omnidirectional solar absorbance by the light-facing hemisphere, but also keeps the other hemisphere under shadow to harvest energy from the warmer environment. As a result, the light-to-vapor efficiency exceeds the theoretical limit, reaching 217% and 156% under 1 and 2 sun, respectively. Simultaneously, CO 2 photoreduction with generated steam reveals a favorable clean fuels production rate using photocatalytic spherical evaporator by secondary growth of Cu 2 O nanoparticles. Finally, an outdoor demonstration manifests a high evaporation rate and easy-to-perform construction on-site, providing a promising opportunity for efficient and decentralized water and clean fuel production.},

A survival-assured liver injury preconditioning (SALIC) protocol, which consists of retrorsine pretreatment and cycling 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) administration by defined concentrations and time intervals, is developed to reduce the mortality of FRG rats and induce a regenerative microenvironment for xeno-repopulation. Human hepatocyte repopulation is boosted to 31 ± 4% in rat livers at 7 months after transplantation, equivalent to approximately a 1200-fold expansion. Human liver features of transcriptome and zonation are reproduced in humanized rats. Remarkably, they provide sufficient samples for the pharmacokinetic profiling of human-specific metabolites. This model is thus preferred for pharmacological studies and human hepatocyte production. SALIC may also be informative to hepatocyte transplantation in other large-sized species.},

  abstract     = {The development of solventless system for modulating properties of network materials is imperative for the next generation sustainable technology. Utilization of photostimulation is important owing to its spatial and temporal locality, yet designing photoresponsive network materials exhibiting repeatable and dramatic change in their properties remains a challenge. Here, the authors report a photocleavable regenerative network (PRN) linked with photoresponsive hexaarylbiimidazoles (HABIs) synthesized from narrow dispersity star-shaped poly(dimethylsiloxane)s (PDMSs) having 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole end groups. The use of urea anion as a catalyst for ring opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic siloxane initiated from silanols enables control of molecular weight and dispersity. The rheological measurements for the synthesized PRNs exhibit drastic changes in storage and loss moduli ( G ′ and G ″) upon photoirradiation in the solid state ( G ′ &gt; G ″). This photocontrolled change in viscoelasticity with retaining solidity enables application of PRNs as a remotely-controlled photo-melt adhesive and photo-scissible string. The developed PRNs will enable a wide variety of applications such as industrially important next-generation sustainable adhesive, sealant, and reversibly-deformable 3D printing materials with their spatially and temporally local manipulability, solventless handleability, and excellent reversibility.},

Here, a wireless scalp electronic system with virtual reality for real-time, continuous classification of motor imagery brain signals is introduced. This low-profile, portable system integrates imperceptible microneedle electrodes and soft wireless circuits. Virtual reality addresses subject variance in detectable EEG response to motor imagery by providing clear, consistent visuals and instant biofeedback. The wearable soft system offers advantageous contact surface area and reduced electrode impedance density, resulting in significantly enhanced EEG signals and classification accuracy. The combination with convolutional neural network-machine learning provides a real-time, continuous motor imagery-based brain–machine interface. With four human subjects, the scalp electronic system offers a high classification accuracy (93.22 ± 1.33% for four classes), allowing wireless, real-time control of a virtual reality game.},

  abstract     = {Conjugated polymers need to be doped to increase charge carrier density and reach the electrical conductivity necessary for electronic and energy applications. While doping increases carrier density, Coulomb interactions between the dopant molecules and the localized carriers are poorly screened, causing broadening and a heavy tail in the electronic density-of-states (DOS). The authors examine the effects of dopant-induced disorder on two complimentary charge transport properties of semiconducting polymers, the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, and demonstrate a way to mitigate them. Their simulations, based on a modified Gaussian disorder model with Miller-Abrahams hopping rates, show that dopant-induced broadening of the DOS negatively impacts the Seebeck coefficient versus electrical conductivity trade-off curve. Increasing the dielectric permittivity of the polymer mitigates dopant-carrier Coulomb interactions and improves charge transport, evidenced by simultaneous increases in conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. They verified this increase experimentally in iodine-doped P3HT and P3HT blended with barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ) nanoparticles. The addition of 2% w/w BaTiO 3 nanoparticles increased conductivity and Seebeck across a broad range of doping, resulting in a fourfold increase in power factor. Thus, these results show a promising path forward to reduce the dopant-charge carrier Coulomb interactions and mitigate their adverse impact on charge transport.},

  abstract     = {In various reactive oxygen species (ROS)-based antitumor approaches (e.g., photodynamic therapy), increasing attentions are made to improve ROS level, but the short lifetime that is another decisive hurdle of ROS-based antitumor outcomes is not even explored yet. To address it, a photocleaved O 2 -released nanoplatform is constructed to release and switch ROS into reactive nitrogen species (RNS) for repressing hypoxic breast tumor. Systematic explorations validate that the nanoplatforms can attain continuous photocontrolled O 2 release, alleviate hypoxia, and elevate ROS level. More significantly, the entrapped PDE5 inhibitor (PDE5-i) in this nanoplatform can be enzymatically decomposed into nitric oxide that further combines with ROS to generate RNS, enabling the persistent antitumor effect since RNS features longer lifetime than ROS. Intriguingly, ROS conversion into RNS can help ROS to evade the hypoxia-induced resistance to ROS-based antitumor. Eventually, RNS production unlocks robust antitumor performances along with ROS elevation and hypoxia mitigation. Moreover, this extraordinary conversion from ROS into RNS also can act as a general method to solve the short lifetime of ROS.},

  abstract     = {IRF8 is a key regulator of innate immunity receptor signaling and plays diverse functions in the development of hematopoietic cells. The effects of IRF8 on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are still unknown. Here, it is demonstrated that IRF8 deficiency results in a decreased number of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) in mice. However, the repopulation capacity of individual HSCs is significantly increased. Transcriptomic analysis shows that IFN- γ and IFN- α signaling is downregulated in IRF8-deficient HSCs, while their response to proinflammatory cytokines is unchanged ex vivo. Further tests show that Irf8 −/− HSCs can not respond to CpG, an agonist of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in mice, while long-term CpG stimulation increases wild-type HSC abundance and decreases their bone marrow colony-forming capacity. Mechanistically, as the primary producer of proinflammatory cytokines in response to CpG stimulation, dendritic cells has a blocked TLR9 signaling due to developmental defect in Irf8 −/− mice. Macrophages remain functionally intact but severely reduce in Irf8 −/− mice. In NK cells, IRF8 directly regulates the expression of Tlr9 and its deficiency leads to no increased IFN γ production upon CpG stimulation. These results indicate that IRF8 regulates HSCs, at least in part, through controlling TLR9 signaling in diverse innate immune cells.},

Sinoporphyrin sodium-mediated sonodynamic therapy (DVDMS-SDT) induces regression of plaque neovascularization in humans without causing obvious side effects. However, a clinical noninvasive theranostic strategy for atherosclerotic plaque neovascularization is urgently needed. A nanoplatform designed for multimodality imaging-guided SDT in plaque angiogenesis theranostics, termed PFP–HMME@PLGA/MnFe 2 O 4 –ramucirumab nanoparticles (PHPMR NPs), is fabricated. It encapsulates manganese ferrite (MnFe 2 O 4 ), hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME), and perfluoropentane (PFP) stabilized by polylactic acid-glycolic acid (PLGA) shells and is conjugated to an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. With excellent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging ability, the distribution of PHPMR NPs in plaque can be observed in real time. Additionally, they actively accumulate in the mitochondria of rabbit aortic endothelial cells (RAECs), and the PHPMR NP-mediated SDT promotes mitochondrial-caspase apoptosis via the production of reactive oxygen species and inhibits the proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis of RAECs. On day 3, PHPMR NP-mediated SDT induces apoptosis in neovessel endothelial cells and improves hypoxia in the rabbit advanced plaque. On day 28, PHPMR NP-mediated SDT reduces the density of neovessels, subsequently inhibiting intraplaque hemorrhage and inflammation and eventually stabilizing the plaque. Collectively, PHPMR NP-mediated SDT presents a safe and effective theranostic strategy for inhibiting plaque angiogenesis.},

H3K9me3 inhibition by small chemicals, HP1α knockdown, or knockout of H3K9 methylase SETDB1, induces formation of cytoplasmic puncta containing histones H3.1, H4 and cytosolic DNA, which in turn activates inflammatory genes and autophagic degradation. Autophagy deficiency rescues H3 degradation, and enhances the activation of inflammatory genes. MRE11 , a subunit of MRN complex, enters cytoplasm after heterochromatin dysregulation. Deficiency of MRE11 or NBS1 , but not RAD50 , inhibits CLIC puncta in cytosol. MRE11 depletion represses tumor growth enhanced by HP1α deficiency, suggesting a connection between CLIC and tumorigenesis.

By the conformal printing of Ag nanowires onto GaN nanopillars, a highly sensitive SERS substrate with excellent uniformity can be fabricated. As a result, remarkable SERS performance with a substrate enhancement factor of 1.4 × 10 11 at 10 fM for rhodamine 6G molecules with minimal spot variations can be realized.

  abstract     = {The role of neutrophils in bone regeneration remains elusive. In this study, it is shown that intramuscular implantation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) (commonly recognized as a chemotactic cytokine for neutrophils) at different levels lead to outcomes resembling those of fracture hematoma at various stages. Ectopic endochondral ossification is induced by certain levels of IL-8, during which neutrophils are recruited to the implanted site and are N2-polarized, which then secrete stromal cell-derived factor-1 α (SDF-1 α ) for bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) chemotaxis via the SDF-1/CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4) axis and its downstream phosphatidylinositol 3&#39;-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and β -catenin-mediated migration. Neutrophils are pivotal for recruiting and orchestrating innate and adaptive immunocytes, as well as BMSCs at the initial stage of bone healing and regeneration. The results in this study delineate the mechanism of neutrophil-initiated bone regeneration and interaction between neutrophils and BMSCs, and innate and adaptive immunities. This work lays the foundation for research in the fields of bone regenerative therapy and biomaterial development, and might inspire further research into novel therapeutic options.},

  abstract     = {Tight junctions (TJs) are essential components of epithelial tissues connecting neighboring cells to provide protective barriers. While their general function to seal compartments is well understood, their role in collective cell migration is largely unexplored. Here, the importance of the TJ zonula occludens (ZO) proteins ZO1 and ZO2 for epithelial migration is investigated employing video microscopy in conjunction with velocimetry, segmentation, cell tracking, and atomic force microscopy/spectroscopy. The results indicate that ZO proteins are necessary for fast and coherent migration. In particular, ZO1 and 2 loss (dKD) induces actomyosin remodeling away from the central cortex towards the periphery of individual cells, resulting in altered viscoelastic properties. A tug-of-war emerges between two subpopulations of cells with distinct morphological and mechanical properties: 1) smaller and highly contractile cells with an outward bulging apical membrane, and 2) larger, flattened cells, which, due to tensile stress, display a higher proliferation rate. In response, the cell density increases, leading to crowding-induced jamming and more small cells over time. Co-cultures comprising wildtype and dKD cells migrate inefficiently due to phase separation based on differences in contractility rather than differential adhesion. This study shows that ZO proteins are necessary for efficient collective cell migration by maintaining tissue fluidity and controlling proliferation.},

Antibacterial materials in biomedical applications and hospital hygiene have attracted great interest, in particular, the emergence of surface design strategies offer an effective alternative to antibiotics, thereby preventing the possible development of bacterial resistance. In this review, recent progress on advanced surface modifications to prevent bacterial infections are addressed comprehensively, starting with the key factors against bacterial adhesion, followed by varying strategies that can inhibit biofilm formation effectively. Furthermore, “super antibacterial systems” through pre-treatment defense and targeted bactericidal system, are proposed with increasing evidence of clinical potential. Finally, the advantages and future challenges of surface strategies to resist healthcare-associated infections are discussed, with promising prospects of developing novel antimicrobial materials.},

Incorporating biomimetic geometries into the design of metastructures has created low-density metamaterials with extraordinary physical and photonic properties. However, the use of surface-based biomimetic geometries restricts the freedom to tune the relative density, mechanical strength, and topological phase. The Steiner tree method inspired by the feature of the shortest connection distance in biological neural networks is applied, to create 3D metastructures and, through two-photon nanolithography, neuron-inspired 3D structures with nanoscale features are successfully achieved. Two solutions are presented to the 3D Steiner tree problem: the Steiner tree networks (STNs) and the twisted Steiner tree networks (T-STNs). STNs and T-STNs possess a lower density than surface-based metamaterials and that T-STNs have Young&#39;s modulus enhanced by 20% than the STNs. Through the analysis of the space groups and symmetries, a topological nontrivial Dirac-like conical dispersion in the T-STNs is predicted, and the results are based on calculations with true predictive power and readily realizable from microwave to optical frequencies. The neuron-inspired 3D metastructures opens a new space for designing low-density metamaterials and topological photonics with extraordinary properties triggered by a twisting degree-of-freedom.},

Herein, it is found that the temperature dependence of bandgap in CsPbBr 3 perovskites is variable with material dimensionality. In contrast to the monotonous redshift ordinarily observed in bulk-like CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals (NCs), the bandgap of 2D CsPbBr 3 nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibits an initial blueshift then redshift trend with decreasing temperature (290–10 K). The Bose–Einstein two-oscillator modeling manifests that the blueshift-redshift crossover of bandgap in the NPLs is attributed to the significantly larger weight of contribution from electron-optical phonon interaction to the bandgap renormalization in the NPLs than in the NCs. These new findings may gain deep insights into the origin of bandgap shift with temperature for both fundamentals and applications of perovskite semiconductor materials.},

  abstract     = {Neuroblastoma (NB) arises from oncogenic disruption of neural crest (NC) differentiation. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) to induce differentiation has improved survival in some NB patients, but not all patients respond, and most NBs eventually develop resistance to RA. Loss of the chromatin modifier chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit p150 (CHAF1A) promotes NB cell differentiation; however, the mechanism by which CHAF1A drives NB oncogenesis has remained unexplored. This study shows that CHAF1A gain-of-function supports cell malignancy, blocks neuronal differentiation in three models (zebrafish NC, human NC, and human NB), and promotes NB oncogenesis. Mechanistically, CHAF1A upregulates polyamine metabolism, which blocks neuronal differentiation and promotes cell cycle progression. Targeting polyamine synthesis promotes NB differentiation and enhances the anti-tumor activity of RA. The authors&#39; results provide insight into the mechanisms that drive NB oncogenesis and suggest a rapidly translatable therapeutic approach (DFMO plus RA) to enhance the clinical efficacy of differentiation therapy in NB patients.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasizes mainly to the liver, which accounts for the majority of CRC-related deaths. Here it is shown that metastatic cells undergo specific chromatin remodeling in the liver. Hepatic growth factor (HGF) induces phosphorylation of PU.1, a pioneer factor, which in turn binds and opens chromatin regions of downstream effector genes. PU.1 increases histone acetylation at the DPP4 locus. Precise epigenetic silencing by CRISPR/dCas9 KRAB or CRISPR/dCas9 HDAC revealed that individual PU.1-remodeled regulatory elements collectively modulate DPP4 expression and liver metastasis growth. Genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of each factor along this chromatin remodeling axis strongly suppressed liver metastasis. Therefore, microenvironment-induced epimutation is an important mechanism for metastatic tumor cells to grow in their new niche. This study presents a potential strategy to target chromatin remodeling in metastatic cancer and the promise of repurposing drugs to treat metastasis.},

The two-stage master regulator Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon (VIPER) analysis of macrophage TLR2 and TLR4 signature genes integrated with coexpression network genes derived from 371 patient-derived carotid specimens identifies activated RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator p15 ( SUB1/Sub1 , PC4 ) as a master regulon in the atherogenic TLR response. It is found that TLR2 and TLR4 signaling is proinflammatory and proatherosclerotic in chow-fed apolipoprotein E-deficient ( ApoE −/− ) mice. Through transgenic myeloid-specific Sub1 knockout in ApoE −/− mice, it is discovered that these proatherosclerotic effects of TLR2 and TLR4 signaling are mediated by Sub1. Sub1 knockout in macrophages enhances anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization and cholesterol efflux. Irradiated low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient ( Ldlr −/− ) mice transplanted with Sub1 −/− murine bone marrow display reduced atherosclerosis. Promoter analysis reveals Sub1-dependent activation of interferon regulatory factor 1 ( Irf1 ) transcription in a casein kinase 2 (Ck2)-dependent manner, and Sub1 -knockout macrophages display decreased Irf1 expression. Artificial Irf1 overexpression in Sub1 -knockout macrophages enhances proinflammatory M1 skewing and lowers cholesterol clearance. In conclusion, the TLR master regulon Sub1, and its downstream effect on the transcription factor Irf1, promotes a proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype and enhances atherosclerotic burden in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Generation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), a key step in tumor metastasis, occurs during surgical tumor resection, often performed under general anesthesia. Propofol is the commonly used anesthetic, but its effects on CTCs and tumor metastasis remain largely unknown. Propofol effects are investigated in an experimental metastasis model by injecting tumor cells and, subsequently, low- or standard-dose propofol to nude mice through tail vein. Propofol- or vehicle-treated tumor cells are also injected to the mice. An in vitro tumor cell–vascular endothelial cell adhesion assay, immunofluorescence, and other methods are employed to assess how propofol affects tumor cell adhesion and extension. Propofol induces more lung tumor metastasis in mice than control. Mechanistically, propofol enhances tumor cell adhesion and extension through GABA A R to downregulate TRIM21 expression, leading to upregulation of Src, a protein associated with cell adhesion. These results demonstrate that propofol may promote tumor metastasis through GABA A R–TRIM21–Src mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling plays a significant role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The authors have previously shown that Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), a chromatin remodeling protein, contributes to hepatic ROS accumulation in multiple animal and cellular models of liver injury. Here it is reported that DNA damage-induced transcript 4 (DDIT4) is identified as a direct transcriptional target for BRG1. DDIT4 overexpression overcomes BRG1 deficiency to restore ROS production whereas DDIT4 knockdown phenocopies BRG1 deficiency in suppressing ROS production in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DDIT4 coordinates the assembly of the p38-MAPK signaling complex to drive ROS production in an S-nitrosylation dependent manner. Molecular docking identifies several bioactive DDIT4-inteacting compounds including imatinib, nilotinib, and nateglinide, all of which are confirmed to attenuate hepatic ROS production, dampen p38-MAPK signaling, and ameliorate liver injury by influencing DDIT4 S-nitrosylation. Importantly, positive correlation between ROS levels and BRG1/DDIT4/S-nitrosylated DDIT4 levels is detected in human liver biopsy specimens. In conclusion, the data reveal a transcription-based signaling cascade that contributes to ROS production in liver injury.},

Moreover, molecular oxygen is employed as the terminal oxidant in this transformation. A library of 36 compounds as a new class of BF 2 complexes with remarkable photophysical properties is delivered in good to excellent yields, showing a substituent-dependency on the photophysical properties, derived from the π – π * character of the photoexcited state. In addition, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) is observed and quantified for the brightest exemplars. The excited state properties are fully investigated in solids and in THF/H 2 O mixtures.

This phenomenon, termed the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), effect has been observed in chiral molecules, supramolecular structures, polymers, and metal-organic films. Which spin is preferred in the transmission depends on the handedness of the system and the tunneling direction of the electrons. Molecular motors based on overcrowded alkenes show multiple inversions of helical chirality under light irradiation and thermal relaxation. The authors found here multistate switching of spin selectivity in electron transfer through first generation molecular motors based on the four accessible distinct helical configurations, measured by magnetic-conductive atomic force microscopy. It is shown that the helical state dictates the molecular organization on the surface. The efficient spin polarization observed in the photostationary state of the right-handed motor coupled with the modulation of spin selectivity through the controlled sequence of helical states, opens opportunities to tune spin selectivity on-demand with high spatio-temporal precision. An energetic analysis correlates the spin injection barrier with the extent of spin polarization.},

  abstract     = {Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have demonstrated significant light detection potential, with a performance comparable to that of commercially available photodetectors. In this study, a general design guideline, which is applicable to both inverted and regular structures, is proposed for high-performance perovskite photodiodes through an interfacial built-in electric field ( E ) for efficient carrier separation and transport. The interfacial E generated at the interface between the active and charge transport layers far from the incident light is critical for effective charge carrier collection. The interfacial E can be modulated by unintentional doping of the perovskite, whose doping type and density can be easily controlled by the post-annealing time and temperature. Employing the proposed design guideline, the inverted and regular perovskite photodiodes exhibit the external quantum efficiency of 83.51% and 76.5% and responsivities of 0.37 and 0.34 A W −1 , respectively. In the self-powered mode, the dark currents reach 7.95 × 10 −11 and 1.47 × 10 −8 A cm −2 , providing high detectivities of 7.34 × 10 13 and 4.96 × 10 12 Jones, for inverted and regular structures, respectively, and a long-term stability of at least 1600 h. This optimization strategy is compatible with existing materials and device structures and hence leads to substantial potential applications in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {MXenes as an emerging two-dimensional (2D) material have attracted tremendous interest in electrochemical energy-storage systems such as supercapacitors. Nevertheless, 2D MXene flakes intrinsically tend to lie flat on the substrate when self-assembling as electrodes, leading to the highly tortuous ion pathways orthogonal to the current collector and hindering ion accessibility. Herein, a facile strategy toward multi-scale structural engineering is proposed to fabricate high-performance MXene hydrogel supercapacitor electrodes. By unidirectional freezing of the MXene slurry followed by a designed thawing process in the sulfuric acid electrolyte, the hydrogel electrode is endowed with a three-dimensional (3D) open macrostructure impregnated with sufficient electrolyte and H + -intercalated microstructure, which provide abundant active sites for ion storage. Meanwhile, the ordered channels bring through-electrode ion and electron transportation pathways that facilitate electrolyte infiltration and mass exchange between electrolyte and electrode. Furthermore, this strategy can also be extended to the fabrication of a 3D-printed all-MXene micro-supercapacitor (MSC), delivering an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 2.0 F cm –2 at 1.2 mA cm –2 and retaining 1.2 F cm –2 at 60 mA cm –2 together with record-high energy density (0.1 mWh cm –2 at 0.38 mW cm –2 ).},

As revealed here, phononic thermal transport is vulnerable to GBs even when they are ultra-narrow and aligned along the temperature gradient direction. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations uncover large reductions in the phononic thermal conductivity ( κ p ) along linear GBs comprising periodically repeating pentagon-heptagon dislocations. Green&#39;s function calculations and spectral energy density analysis indicate that the origin of the κ p reduction is hidden in the periodic GB strain field, which behaves as a reflective diffraction grating with either diffuse or specular phonon reflections, and represents a source of anharmonic phonon–phonon scattering. The non-monotonic dependence with dislocation density of κ p uncovered here is unaccounted for by the classical Klemens theory. It can help identify GB structures that can best preserve the integrity of the phononic transport.},

The degradation experiment indicates the anti-acid and colon-targeted property of the alginate hydrogel shell, and the in vivo imaging shows the mucoadhesive ability of the thiolated-hyaluronic acid hydrogel core of the microsphere, which reduces the systematic exposure and prolongs the local drug dwell time. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo study demonstrate that the microsphere significantly reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, induces specific type 2 macrophage differentiation, and remarkably alleviates colitis in the mice model. Moreover, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing reveals an optimized gut flora composition, probiotics including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus significantly augment, while the detrimental communities are inhibited, which benefits the intestinal homeostasis.

  abstract     = {Colloidal quantum dot (QD), a solution-processable nanoscale optoelectronic building block with well-controlled light absorption and emission properties, has emerged as a promising material system capable of interacting with various photonic structures. Integrated QD/photonic structures have been successfully realized in many optical and optoelectronic devices, enabling enhanced performance and/or new functionalities. In this review, the recent advances in this research area are summarized. In particular, the use of four typical photonic structures, namely, diffraction gratings, resonance cavities, plasmonic structures, and photonic crystals, in modulating the light absorption (e.g., for solar cells and photodetectors) or light emission (e.g., for color converters, lasers, and light emitting diodes) properties of QD-based devices is discussed. A brief overview of QD-based passive devices for on-chip photonic circuit integration is also presented to provide a holistic view on future opportunities for QD/photonic structure-integrated optoelectronic systems.},

  abstract     = {Acute kidney injury (AKI), as a common oxidative stress-related renal disease, causes high mortality in clinics annually, and many other clinical diseases, including the pandemic COVID-19, have a high potential to cause AKI, yet only rehydration, renal dialysis, and other supportive therapies are available for AKI in the clinics. Nanotechnology-mediated antioxidant therapy represents a promising therapeutic strategy for AKI treatment. However, current enzyme-mimicking nanoantioxidants show poor biocompatibility and biodegradability, as well as non-specific ROS level regulation, further potentially causing deleterious adverse effects. Herein, the authors report a novel non-enzymatic antioxidant strategy based on ultrathin Ti 3 C 2 -PVP nanosheets (TPNS) with excellent biocompatibility and great chemical reactivity toward multiple ROS for AKI treatment. These TPNS nanosheets exhibit enzyme/ROS-triggered biodegradability and broad-spectrum ROS scavenging ability through the readily occurring redox reaction between Ti 3 C 2 and various ROS, as verified by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that TPNS can serve as efficient antioxidant platforms to scavenge the overexpressed ROS and subsequently suppress oxidative stress-induced inflammatory response through inhibition of NF- κ B signal pathway for AKI treatment. This study highlights a new type of therapeutic agent, that is, the redox-mediated non-enzymatic antioxidant MXene nanoplatforms in treatment of AKI and other ROS-associated diseases.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Huge efforts have been made to develop anti-AD drugs in the past decades. However, all drug development programs for disease-modifying therapies have failed. Possible reasons for the high failure rate include incomplete understanding of complex pathophysiology of AD, especially sporadic AD (sAD), and species difference between humans and animal models used in preclinical studies. In this study, sAD is modeled using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived 3D brain organoids. Because the blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage is a well-known risk factor for AD, brain organoids are exposed to human serum to mimic the serum exposure consequence of BBB breakdown in AD patient brains. The serum-exposed brain organoids are able to recapitulate AD-like pathologies, including increased amyloid beta (A β ) aggregates and phosphorylated microtubule-associated tau protein (p-Tau) level, synaptic loss, and impaired neural network. Serum exposure increases A β and p-Tau levels through inducing beta-secretase 1 (BACE) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 alpha / beta (GSK3 α / β ) levels, respectively. In addition, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain organoids reveals that serum exposure reduced synaptic function in both neurons and astrocytes and induced immune response in astrocytes. The human brain organoid-based sAD model established in this study can provide a powerful platform for both mechanistic study and therapeutic development in the future.},

However, when assembled on various substrates, isolated Pt single atoms are often demonstrated to proceed through the two-electron ORR pathway due to the unfavorable O─O bond cleavage thermodynamics in the absence of catalytic ensemble sites. In addition, although their distinct local coordination environments at the exact single active sites are intensively explored, the interactions and synergy between closely neighboring single atom sites remain elusive. Herein, atomically dispersed Pt monomers strongly interacting on a Mo 2 C support is demonstrated as a model catalyst in the four-electron ORR, and the beneficial interactions between two closely neighboring and yet non-contiguous Pt single atom sites (named as quasi-paired Pt single atoms) are shown. Compared to isolated Pt single atom sites, the quasi-paired Pt single atoms deliver a superior mass activity of 0.224 A mg −1 Pt and near-100% selectivity toward four-electron ORR due to the synergistic interaction from the two quasi-paired Pt atom sites in modulating the binding mode of reaction intermediates.

  abstract     = {Mobile colistin resistance enzyme MCR-3 is a phosphoethanolamine transferase modifying lipid A in Gram-negative bacteria. MCR-3 generally mediates low-level (≤8 mg L −1 ) colistin resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, but occasionally confers high-level (&gt;128 mg L −1 ) resistance in aeromonads. Herein, it is determined that MCR-3, together with another lipid A modification mediated by the arnBCADTEF operon, may be responsible for high-level colistin resistance in aeromonads. Lipid A is the critical site of pathogens for Toll-like receptor 4 recognizing. However, it is unknown whether or how MCR-3-mediated lipid A modification affects the host immune response. Compared with the wild-type strains, increased mortality is observed in mice intraperitoneally-infected with mcr-3 -positive Aeromonas salmonicida and Escherichia coli strains, along with sepsis symptoms. Further, mcr-3 -positive strains show decreased clearance rates than wild-type strains, leading to bacterial accumulation in organs. The increased mortality is tightly associated with the increased tissue hypoxia, injury, and post-inflammation. MCR-3 expression also impairs phagocytosis efficiency both in vivo and in vitro, contributing to the increased persistence of mcr-3 -positive bacteria in tissues compared with parental strains. This study, for the first time, reveals a dual function of MCR-3 in bacterial resistance and pathogenicity, which calls for caution in treating the infections caused by mcr -positive pathogens.},

However, the feasible molecular designing strategy of fully exploiting triplet excitons to enhance TADF properties is still in demand. Herein, TADF emitters with multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons are designed by concisely halogenating the electron acceptors containing carbonyl moiety. Compared with the chlorinated and brominated analogues, the fluorinated emitter exhibits distinguishing molecular stacking structures, participating in the formation of trimers through integrating C  H···F and C═O···H hydrogen bonds together. It is also demonstrated that the multiple channels can be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin-flip of triplet excitons, and to take charge of the relatively superior reverse intersystem crossing constant rate of 6.20 × 10 5 s –1 , and thus excellent photoluminescence quantum yields over 90% can easily be achieved. Then the solution-processable organic light emitting diode based on fluorinated emitter can achieve a record-high external quantum efficiency value of 27.13% and relatively low efficiency roll-off with remaining 24.74% at 1000 cd m −2 . This result manifests the significance of enhancing photophysical properties through constructing multiple conversion channels of triplets excitons for high-efficiency TADF emitters and provides a guideline for the future study.},

Placing a desalination compartment between SWB anode and cathode (denoted as seawater battery desalination; SWB-D) enables seawater desalination while charging SWB. Since seawater desalination is a mature technology, primarily occupied by membrane-based processes such as reverse osmosis (RO), the energy cost has to be considered for alternative desalination technologies. So far, the feasibility of the SWB-D system based on the unit cost per desalinated water ($ m −3 ) has been insufficiently discussed. Therefore, this perspective aims to provide this information and offer future research directions based on the detailed cost analysis. Based on the calculations, the current SWB-D system is expected to have an equipment cost of ≈1.02 $ m −3 (lower than 0.60–1.20 $ m −3 of RO), when 96% of the energy is recovered and stable performance for 1000 cycles is achieved. The anion exchange membrane (AEM) and separator contributes greatly to the material cost occupying 50% and 41% of the total cost, respectively. Therefore, future studies focusing on creating low cost AEMs and separators will pave the way for the large-scale application of SWB-D.},

  abstract     = {Increased acrolein (ACR), a toxic metabolite derived from energy consumption, is associated with diabetes and its complications. However, the molecular mechanisms are mostly unknown, and a suitable animal model with internal increased ACR does not exist for in vivo studying so far. Several enzyme systems are responsible for acrolein detoxification, such as Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH), Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST). To evaluate the function of ACR in glucose homeostasis and diabetes, akr1a1a −/− zebrafish mutants are generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Accumulated endogenous acrolein is confirmed in akr1a1a −/− larvae and livers of adults. Moreover, a series of experiments are performed regarding organic alterations, the glucose homeostasis, transcriptome, and metabolomics in Tg(fli1:EGFP ) zebrafish. Akr1a1a −/− larvae display impaired glucose homeostasis and angiogenic retina hyaloid vasculature, which are caused by reduced acrolein detoxification ability and increased internal ACR concentration. The effects of acrolein on hyaloid vasculature can be reversed by acrolein-scavenger l -carnosine treatment. In adult akr1a1a −/− mutants, impaired glucose tolerance accompanied by angiogenic retina vessels and glomerular basement membrane thickening, consistent with an early pathological appearance in diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, are observed. Thus, the data strongly suggest impaired ACR detoxification and elevated ACR concentration as biomarkers and inducers for diabetes and diabetic complications.},

In the field of nonlinearity, second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a research focus due to its diverse applications. There have been many researches for realizing SHG in optical regime using nonlinear characteristics of optical materials, but its efficiency is low. In microwave frequencies, SHGs are basically studied in the guided-wave systems. Here, high-efficiency SHGs of spatial waves are presented in the microwave frequency using nonlinear metasurface loaded with active chips at the subwavelength scale. The nonlinear meta-atom is composed of receiving antenna, transmitting antenna, and active circuit of frequency multiplier, which can realize strongly nonlinear response and link the EM signals from the receiving to transmitting antennas. Correspondingly, to achieve the function of spatial-wave frequency multiplication, the working frequency of the transmitting antenna in the meta-atom should be twice as that of the receiving antenna, and hence the active chip is well matched to obtain the signal transforming with high efficiency.

  abstract     = {As the preliminary synthetic analogs of living cells, protocells with life-like features serve as a versatile platform to explore the origin of life. Although protocells constructed from multiple components have been developed, the transition of primitive cellular compartments toward structural complexity and advanced function remains a scientific challenge. Herein, a programmable pathway is established to exploit a simple chemistry to construct structural transition of protocell models from emulsion droplets, nanocapsules to molecularly crowded droplets. The transitional process toward distinct cell-like compartments is driven by interfacial self-assembly of simple components and regulated by physicochemical cues (e.g., mechanical force, solvent evaporation, acid/base equilibrium) triggered dynamic covalent chemistry. These protocell models are further studied by comparing their compartmentalization behavior, sequestration efficiency, and the ability to enrich biomolecules (e.g., enzyme and substrate) toward catalytic reaction or biological activity within the compartments. The results showcase physiochemical cues-driven programmable transition of life-like compartments toward functionalization, and offer a new step toward the design of living soft materials.},

  abstract     = {Accessible and adaptable nucleic acid diagnostics remains a critical challenge in managing the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Here, an integrated molecular nanotechnology that enables direct and programmable detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets in native patient specimens is reported. Termed synergistic coupling of responsive equilibrium in enzymatic network (SCREEN), the technology leverages tunable, catalytic molecular nanostructures to establish an interconnected, collaborative architecture. SCREEN mimics the extraordinary organization and functionality of cellular signaling cascades. Through programmable enzyme–DNA nanostructures, SCREEN activates upon interaction with different RNA targets to initiate multi-enzyme catalysis; through system-wide favorable equilibrium shifting, SCREEN directly transduces a single target binding into an amplified electrical signal. To establish collaborative equilibrium coupling in the architecture, a computational model that simulates all reactions to predict overall performance and optimize assay configuration is developed. The developed platform achieves direct and sensitive RNA detection (approaching single-copy detection), fast response (assay reaction is completed within 30 min at room temperature), and robust programmability (across different genetic loci of SARS-CoV-2). When clinically evaluated, the technology demonstrates robust and direct detection in clinical swab lysates to accurately diagnose COVID-19 patients.},

They are expected to see increasing deployment in performance critical areas including electric vehicles, grid storage, space, and sea vehicle operations. Unfortunately, competitive performance cannot be achieved when LBs operating under extreme temperature conditions where the lithium-ion chemistry fail to perform optimally. In this review, a brief overview of the challenges in developing LBs for low temperature (&lt;0 °C) and high temperature (&gt;60 °C) operation are provided followed by electrolyte design strategies involving Li salt modification, solvation structure optimization, additive introduction, and solid-state electrolyte utilization for LBs are introduced. Specifically, the prospects of using lithium metal batteries (LMBs), lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries, and lithium oxygen (Li-O 2 ) batteries for performance under low and high temperature applications are evaluated. These three chemistries are presented as prototypical examples of how the conventional low temperature charge transfer resistances and high temperature side reactions can be overcome.

Here, pulsed electric fields (PEFs) which induce reversible or irreversible electroporation (IRE) and tumour-treating fields (TTFs) are reviewed highlighting the foundations, advances, and considerations of each method when applied to glioblastoma (GBM). Several biological aspects of GBM that contribute to treatment complexity (heterogeneity, recurrence, resistance, and blood-brain barrier(BBB)) and electrophysiological traits which are suggested to promote glioma progression are described. Particularly, the biological responses at the cellular and molecular level to specific parameters of the electrical stimuli are discussed offering ways to compare these parameters despite the lack of a universally adopted physical description. Reviewing the literature, a disconnect is found between electrotherapy techniques and how they target the biological complexities of GBM that make treatment difficult in the first place. An attempt is made to bridge the interdisciplinary gap by mapping biological characteristics to different methods of electrotherapy, suggesting important future research topics and directions in both understanding and treating GBM. To the authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first paper that attempts an in-tandem assessment of the biological effects of different aspects of intermediate frequency electrotherapy methods, thus offering possible strategies toward GBM treatment.},

The present study proposes an approach based on triboelectric stimulation to rejuvenate senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) by fabricating a pulsed triboelectric nanogenerator (P-TENG) that can produce stable pulsed current output unaffected by the triggered frequency. The senescence phenotypes of aged BMSCs are reversed by triboelectric stimulation at 30 µA at 1.5 Hz. Triboelectric stimulation enhances the proliferation of aged BMSCs and increases their pluripotency and differentiation capacity. Additionally, mechanistic investigations reveal that pulsed triboelectric stimulation by P-TENG rejuvenates senescent BMSCs by enhancing MDM2-dependent p53 degradation, which is demonstrated by loss-of-function studies of MDM2 and p53. Overall, this study identifies a new approach for the rejuvenation of senescent BMSCs and describes a promising therapeutic intervention for many diseases associated with aged BMSCs.},

Despite the significant potential of magnetic nanovehicles in electromagnetic field (EF)-activated drug delivery, modularizing a tandem magnetoresponsive activity in a one-nanoparticle system to meet different requirements at both tissue and cellular levels remain highly challenging. Herein, a strategy is described by employing sequential EF frequencies in inducing a succession of magnetoresponses in the magnetic nanovehicles that aims to realize cascaded tissue penetration and nuclear accumulation. This nanovehicle features ferrimagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide nanorings coated with a thermo-responsive polyethylenimine copolymer (PI/FVIOs). It is shown that the programmed cascading of low frequency (L f )-EF-induced magnetophoresis and medium frequency (M f )-EF-stimulated magneto-thermia can steer the Doxorubicin (DOX)-PI/FVIOs to the deep tissue and subsequently trigger intracellular burst release of DOX for successful nuclear entry. By programming the order of different EF frequencies, it is demonstrated that first-stage L f -EF and subsequent M f -EF operation enables DOX-PI/FVIOs to effectively deliver 86.2% drug into the nucleus in vivo . This nanodelivery system empowers potent antitumoral activity in various models of intractable tumors, including DOX-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells, triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells with poor permeability.},

  abstract     = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignant tumor of the kidneys. Approximately 70% of RCC cases are clear cell renal cell carcinoma with von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) gene mutation and activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting VEGF have emerged as promising agents for RCC treatment. Apart from primary resistance, acquired resistance to TKIs after initial tumor regression is common in RCC. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibition, including PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, alone or in combination with TKIs has improved the overall survival of patients with RCC. Ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) has been reported in many types of cancer and has been implicated in tumor progression. However, the role of RRM2 in TKIs resistance in RCC remains unclear. In this study, the authors have demonstrated that RRM2 is upregulated in sunitinib-resistant RCC cells and patient tissues. They also find that RRM2 stabilizes ANXA1 and activates the AKT pathway independent of its ribonucleotide reductase activity, promoting sunitinib resistance in RCC. Moreover, RRM2 regulated antitumor immune responses, and knockdown of RRM2 enhance the anti-tumor efficiency of PD-1 blockade in renal cancer. Collectively, these results suggest that aberrantly expressed RRM2 may be a promising therapeutic target for RCC.},

However, a detailed study revealing the role of EEF in altering the intermolecular and intramolecular water structure is lacking. Herein, an EEF is proved to tune water state by accelerating the thermal movement of water molecules, lowering the molecular escaping energy, and loosening the hydrogen bond structure. The detailed mechanisms and field interactions (heat and electrostatic) are investigated by in situ Raman characterizations and molecular dynamic simulations, which reveal that an EEF can effectively reduce the free energy barrier of water evaporation and then increase the evaporated water molecule flux. As a proof of concept, an EEF is integrated into an interfacial two-dimentional solar steam generator, enhancing the efficiency by up to 15.6%. Similar to a catalyst lowing activation energy and enhancing kinetics of a chemical reaction, the EEF enhances water state tuning, lowers evaporation enthalpy, and then boosts steam generation rate with negligible additional energy consumption, which can serve as a generic method for water evaporation enhancement in water harvesting, purification, and beyond.},

Transport into the cell&#39;s cytosolic compartment should ideally be controllable and it should involve biologically compatible and degradable vehicles. Addressing these challenges, nanocontainers based on cyclodextrin amphiphiles that are stabilized by a biodegradable peptide shell are developed and their potential to deliver fluorescently labeled cargo into human cells is analyzed. Host–guest mediated self-assembly of a thiol-containing short peptide or a cystamine-cross-linked polypeptide shell on cyclodextrin vesicles produce short peptide-shelled (SPSV ss ) or polypeptide-shelled vesicles (PPSV ss ), respectively, with redox-responsive and biodegradable features. Whereas SPSV ss are permeable and less stable, PPSV ss effectively encapsulate cargo and show a strictly regulated release of membrane impermeable cargo triggered by either reducing conditions or peptidase treatment. Live cell experiments reveal that the novel PPSV SS are readily internalized by primary human endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and cervical cancer cells and that the reductive microenvironment of the cells’ endosomes trigger release of the hydrophilic cargo into the cytosol. Thus, PPSV SS represent a highly efficient, biodegradable, and tunable system for overcoming the plasma membrane as a natural barrier for membrane-impermeable cargo.},

  abstract     = {Ferrimagnetic thin films are attractive for low-power spintronic applications because of their low magnetization, small angular momentum, and fast spin dynamics. Spin orbit torques (SOT) can be applied with proximal heavy metals that also generate interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions (DMI), which can stabilize ultrasmall skyrmions and enable fast domain wall motion. Here, the properties of a ferrimagnetic CoGd alloy between two heavy metals to increase the SOT efficiency, while maintaining a significant DMI is studied. SOT switching for various capping layers and alloy compositions shows that Pt/CoGd/(W or Ta) films enable more energy-efficient SOT magnetization switching than Pt/CoGd/Ir. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance confirms that Pt/CoGd/W has the highest spin-Hall angle of 16.5%, hence SOT efficiency, larger than Pt/CoGd/(Ta or Ir). Density functional theory calculations indicate that CoGd films capped by W or Ta have the largest DMI energy, 0.38 and 0.32 mJ m −2 , respectively. These results show that Pt/CoGd/W is a very promising ferrimagnetic structure to achieve small skyrmions and to move them efficiently with current.},

  abstract     = {Blood cell analysis is a major pillar of biomedical research and healthcare. These analyses are performed in central laboratories. Rapid shipment from collection site to the central laboratories is currently needed because cells and biomarkers degrade rapidly. The dried blood spot from a fingerstick allows the preservation of cellular molecules for months but entire cells are never recovered. Here leucocyte elution is optimized from dried blood spots. Flow cytometry and mRNA expression profiling are used to analyze the recovered cells. 50–70% of the leucocytes that are dried on a polyester solid support via elution after shaking the support with buffer are recovered. While red blood cells lyse upon drying, it is found that the majority of leucocytes are preserved. Leucocytes have an altered structure that is improved by adding fixative in the elution buffer. Leucocytes are permeabilized, allowing an easy staining of all cellular compartments. Common immunophenotyping and mRNAs are preserved. The ability of a new biomarker (CD169) to discriminate between patients with and without Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome induced by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is also preserved. Leucocytes from blood can be dried, shipped, and/or stored for at least 1 month, then recovered for a wide variety of analyses, potentially facilitating biomedical applications worldwide.},

  abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented global health crisis, resulting in a critical need for effective vaccines that generate protective antibodies. Protein subunit vaccines represent a promising approach but often lack the immunogenicity required for strong immune stimulation. To overcome this challenge, it is first demonstrated that advanced biomaterials can be leveraged to boost the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 protein subunit vaccines. Additionally, it is reported that oxygen is a powerful immunological co-adjuvant and has an ability to further potentiate vaccine potency. In preclinical studies, mice immunized with an oxygen-generating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cryogel-based vaccine (O 2 -Cryogel VAX ) exhibit a robust Th1 and Th2 immune response, leading to a sustained production of highly effective neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Even with a single immunization, O 2 -Cryogel VAX achieves high antibody titers within 21 days, and both binding and neutralizing antibody levels are further increased after a second dose. Engineering a potent vaccine system that generates sufficient neutralizing antibodies after one dose is a preferred strategy amid vaccine shortage. The data suggest that this platform is a promising technology to reinforce vaccine-driven immunostimulation and is applicable to current and emerging infectious diseases.},

Scavenging of chemokines by multiarmed poly(ethylene glycol)-glycosaminoglycan (starPEG-GAG) hydrogels has recently been shown to support regeneration in a diabetic mouse chronic skin wound model. Herein, a textile-starPEG-GAG composite wound contact layer (WCL) capable of selectively sequestering pro-inflammatory chemokines is reported. Systematic variation of the local and integral charge densities of the starPEG-GAG hydrogel component allows for tailoring its affinity profile for biomolecular signals of the wound milieu. The composite WCL is subsequently tested in a large animal (porcine) model of human wound healing disorders. Dampening excessive inflammatory signals without affecting the levels of pro-regenerative growth factors, the starPEG-GAG hydrogel-based WCL treatment induced healing with increased granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, and deposition of connective tissue (collagen fibers). Thus, this biomaterials technology expands the scope of a new anti-inflammatory therapy toward clinical use.},

Dysfunctions in the kidney, retina, cardiovascular system, neurons, and liver represent the common complications of diabetes, which again lack effective therapies that can reverse organ injury. Overall, the molecular mechanisms of how type 2 diabetes develops and leads to irreparable organ damage remain elusive. This review particularly focuses on novel targets that may play role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

In this work, superstructured macroporous carbon rods composed of defective graphitic nanosheets are synthesized by direct carbonization of crystalline poly tannic acid (PTA) rods as precursors. During carbonization, PTA rods with a highly ordered lamellar structure induce a spatially confined two-step localized contraction that takes place in different dimensions and directions in each step. The unexpected contraction behavior results in the sponge-like macroporous carbon superstructure with large surface area, high porosity, and abundant defects, thus showing a superior electrocatalytic performance with high activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction reaction. The study provides new understandings in the design of functional carbon materials with distinctive structures and applications.},

Through group theory analysis and hybrid density functional theory calculation, the charge-neutral cation vacancy in III-V compounds is found to satisfy a unique 5-electron-8-orbital electronic configuration with T d symmetry, which is possible for single-photon emission. Furthermore, it is confirmed that this type of single-photon emitter only exists in wide bandgap III-nitrides among all the III-V compounds. The corresponding photon energy in GaN, AlN, and AlGaN lies within the optimal range for transfer in optical fiber, thereby render the charge-neutral cation vacancy in wide-bandgap III-nitrides as a promising single-photon emitter for quantum information applications.},

Patients who undergo conventional enucleation treatments consistently suffer permanent blindness, facial defects, and mental disorders, therefore, novel therapeutic modalities are urgently required. Herein, an injectable and stimuli-responsive drug delivery antibacterial hydrogel (CP@Au@DC_AC50) is constructed via a facile grinding method that is inspired by the preparation process of traditional Chinese medicine. The incorporation of gold nanorods can enhance the mechanical strength of the hydrogel and realize photothermal therapy (PTT) and thermosensitive gel-sol transformation to release the gene-targeted drug DC_AC50 on demand in response to low-density near-infrared (NIR) light. The orthotopic model of UM is built successfully and indicates the excellent efficiency of CP@Au@DC_AC50 in killing tumors without damage to normal tissue because of its synergistic mild temperature PTT and gene-targeted therapy. Moreover, the eyeball infection model reveals the remarkable antibacterial properties of the hydrogel which can prevent endophthalmitis in the eyeball. There is negligible difference between the CP@Au@DC_AC50+NIR group and normal group. This NIR light-triggered gene-targeted therapy/PTT/antibacterial treatment pattern provides a promising strategy for building multifunctional therapeutic platform against intraocular tumors and exhibits great potential for the clinical treatment of UM.},

Human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hES-MSCs) are shown to exert more potent cardioprotective effects against cardiac ischemia than human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs), associated with enhanced neovascularization. The purpose of this study is to search for angiogenic lncRNAs enriched in hES-MSCs, and investigate their roles and mechanisms. AC103746.1 is one of the most highly expressed intergenic lncRNAs detected in hES-MSCs versus hBM-MSCs, and named as SCDAL ( s tem c ell- d erived a ngiogenic l ncRNA). SCDAL knockdown significantly reduce the angiogenic potential and reparative effects of hES-MSCs in the infarcted hearts, while overexpression of SCDAL in either hES-MSCs or hBM-MSCs exhibits augmented angiogenesis and cardiac function recovery. Mechanistically, SCDAL induces growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6) expression via direct interaction with SNF5 at GDF6 promoter. Secreted GDF6 promotes endothelial angiogenesis via non-canonical vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 activation. Furthermore, SCDAL- GDF6 is expressed in human endothelial cells, and directly enhances endothelial angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, these findings uncover a previously unknown lncRNA-dependent regulatory circuit for angiogenesis. Targeted intervention of the SCDAL -GDF6 pathway has potential as a therapy for ischemic heart diseases.},

  abstract     = {Copper plays pivotal roles in metabolic homoeostasis, but its potential role in human tumorigenesis is not well defined. Here, it is revealed that copper activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB, also termed AKT) oncogenic signaling pathway to facilitate tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, copper binds 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), in turn promotes PDK1 binding and subsequently activates its downstream substrate AKT to facilitate tumorigenesis. Blocking the copper transporter 1 (CTR1)-copper axis by either depleting CTR1 or through the use of copper chelators diminishes the AKT signaling and reduces tumorigenesis. In support of an oncogenic role for CTR1, the authors find that CTR1 is abnormally elevated in breast cancer, and is subjected by NEDD4 like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (Nedd4l)-mediated negative regulation through ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Accordingly, Nedd4l displays a tumor suppressive function by suppressing the CTR1-AKT signaling. Thus, the findings identify a novel regulatory crosstalk between the Nedd4l-CTR1-copper axis and the PDK1-AKT oncogenic signaling, and highlight the therapeutic relevance of targeting the CTR1-copper node for the treatment of hyperactive AKT-driven cancers.},

In this work, synchrotron single-crystal diffraction measurements combined with second harmonic generation measurements reveal the absence of inversion symmetry below room temperature in CsPbBr 3 . Local structural analysis by pair distribution function and X-ray absorption fine structure methods are performed to ascertain the local ordering, atomic pair correlations, and phase evolution in a broad range of temperatures. The currently accepted space group assignments for CsPbBr 3 are found to be incorrect in a manner that profoundly impacts physical properties. New assignments are obtained for the bulk structure: I m 3 ¯ (above ≈410 K), P 2 1 / m (between ≈300 K and ≈410 K), and the polar group Pm (below ≈300 K), respectively. The newly observed structural distortions exist in the bulk structure consistent with the expectation of previous photoluminescence and Raman measurements. High-pressure measurements reveal multiple low-pressure phases, one of which exists as a metastable phase at ambient pressure.

  abstract     = {Renewable organic cathodes with abundant elements show promise for sustainable rechargeable batteries. Herein, for the first time, utilizing C 60 fullerene as organic cathode for room-temperature lithium-ion battery is reported. The C 60 cathode shows robust electrochemical performance preferably in ether-based electrolyte. It delivers discharge capacity up to 120 mAh g −1 and specific energy exceeding 200 Wh kg −1 with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 91%. The as-fabricated battery holds a capacity of 90 mAh g −1 after 50 cycles and showcases remarkable rate performance with 77 mAh g −1 retained at 500 mA g −1 . Noteworthily, three couples of unusual flat voltage plateaus recur at ≈2.4, 1.7, and 1.5 V, respectively. Diffusion-dominated three-electron-redox reactions are revealed by cyclic voltammogram and plateau capacities. Intriguingly, it is for the first time unveiled by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) that the C 60 cathode underwent three reversible phase transitions during lithiation/delithiation process, except for the initial discharge when irreversible polymerization in between C 60 nanoclusters existed as suggested by the characteristic irreversible peak shifts in both in situ XRD pattern and in situ Raman spectra. Cs-corrected transmission electron microscope corroborated these phase evolutions. Importantly, delithiation potentials derived from density-functional-theory simulation based on proposed phase structures qualitatively consists with experimental ones.},

Direct blockade of TRPV1 exhibits significant analgesic effects but also incurs severe side effects such as hyperthermia, causing failures of TRPV1 inhibitors in clinical trials. In order to selectively target TRPV1 channels that are actively involved in pain-sensing, peptidic positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) based on the high-resolution structure of the TRPV1 intracellular ankyrin-repeat like domain are de novo designed. The hotspot centric approach is optimized for protein design; its usage in Rosetta increases the success rate in protein binder design. It is demonstrated experimentally, with a combination of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging, surface plasmon resonance, and patch-clamp recording, that the designed PAMs bind to TRPV1 with nanomolar affinity and allosterically enhance its response to ligand activation as it is designed. It is further demonstrated that the designed PAM exhibits long-lasting in vivo analgesic effects in rats without changing their body temperature, suggesting that they have potentials for developing into novel analgesics.},

Various perovskites have shown optically pumped stimulated emission of lasing and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), yet the ultimate goal of electrically pumped stimulated emission has not been achieved. As an essential step toward this goal, here, a perovskite diode structure that simultaneously exhibits stable operation at high current density (≈1 kA cm −2 ) and optically excited ASE (with a threshold of 180 µJ cm −2 ) is reported. This diode structure achieves an electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 0.8% at 850 A cm −2 , which is estimated to be ≈3% of the charge carrier population required to reach ASE in the same device. It is shown that the formation of a large angle waveguide mode and the reduction of parasitic absorption losses are two major design principles for diodes to obtain a positive gain for stimulated emission. In addition to its prospect as a perovskite laser, a new application of electrically pumped ASE is proposed as an ideal perovskite LED architecture allowing 100% external radiation efficiency.},

However, as a result of the structural complexity of spinel oxides, systematic and in-depth studies on enhancing the OER performance of spinel oxides remain inadequate. In particular, the construction of active sites regarding the large number of unoccupied octahedral interstices has not yet been explored. Herein, more octahedral sites with high OER activities are constructed on the surface of spinel oxides via a cationic misalignment, which is induced by the defects in the spinel oxide solutions, i.e., MoFe 2 O 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 nanosheets supported on an iron foam (MCFO NS/IF). With increased active sites and modified electronic structure, the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst exhibits the excellent OER catalytic activity with an onset potential of 1.41 V versus RHE and an overpotential of 290 mV to achieve a current density of 500 mA cm −2 . Moreover, such an electrocatalyst also demonstrates fast kinetics with the Tafel slope of 38 mV dec −1 and superior durability by maintaining the OER activity at 250 mA cm −2 for 1000 h.},

  abstract     = {Under conditions of starvation, normal and tumor epithelial cells can rewire their metabolism toward the consumption of extracellular proteins, including extracellular matrix-derived components as nutrient sources. The mechanism of pericellular matrix degradation by starved cells has been largely overlooked. Here it is shown that matrix degradation by breast and pancreatic tumor cells and patient-derived xenograft explants increases by one order of magnitude upon amino acid and growth factor deprivation. In addition, it is found that collagenolysis requires the invadopodia components, TKS5, and the transmembrane metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, which are key to the tumor invasion program. Increased collagenolysis is controlled by mTOR repression upon nutrient depletion or pharmacological inhibition by rapamycin. The results reveal that starvation hampers clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in MT1-MMP accumulation in arrested clathrin-coated pits. The study uncovers a new mechanism whereby mTOR repression in starved cells leads to the repurposing of abundant plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits into robust ECM-degradative assemblies.},

However, most of the times, the synthesis requires to use up to three different precursor and very high temperatures for the synthesis. Moreover, the low reciprocal solubility of boron nitride and graphene often leads to BN-C composite materials due to phase segregation. Herein, an innovative method is presented to prepare BCN thin films by chemical vapor deposition from a single source precursor, melamine diborate. The deposition occurs homogenously at relatively low temperatures generating very high degree of sp 2 conjugation. The as-prepared thin films possess high transparency and refractive index values in the visible range that are of interest for reflective mirrors and lenses. Furthermore, they are wide-bandgap semiconductor with very positive valence band, making these materials very stable against oxidation of interest as protective coating and charge transport layer for solar cells. The simple chemical vapor deposition method that relies on commonly available and low-hazard precursor can open the way for application of BCN thin films in optics, optoelectronics, and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect generates quantized electric charge Hall conductance without external magnetic field. It requires both nontrivial band topology and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. In most cases, one can break the TRS of time-reversal invariant topological materials to yield QAH effect, which is essentially a topological phase transition. However, conventional topological phase transition induced by external field/stimulus usually needs a route along which the bandgap closes and reopens. Hence, the transition occurs only when the magnitude of field/stimulus is larger than a critical value. In this work the authors propose that using gapless systems, the transition can happen at an arbitrarily weak (but finite) external field strength. For such an unconventional topological phase transition, the bandgap closing is guaranteed by bulk-edge correspondence and symmetries, while the bandgap reopening is induced by external fields. This concept is demonstrated on the 2D surface states of 3D topological insulators like Bi 2 Se 3 , which become 2D QAH insulators once a circularly polarized light is turned on, according to the Floquet time crystal theory. The sign of quantized Chern number can be controlled via the chirality of the light. This provides a convenient and dynamic approach to trigger topological phase transitions and create QAH insulators.},

However, the implementation of such functional hBN demands precise lateral nanostructuration and integration with other two-dimensional materials, and hence, novel routes of synthesis beyond exfoliation. Here, a disruptive approach is demonstrated, namely, imprinting the lateral pattern of an atomically stepped one-dimensional template into a hBN monolayer. Specifically, hBN is epitaxially grown on vicinal Rhodium (Rh) surfaces using a Rh curved crystal for a systematic exploration, which produces a periodically textured, nanostriped hBN carpet that coats Rh(111)-oriented terraces and lattice-matched Rh(337) facets with tunable width. The electronic structure reveals a nanoscale periodic modulation of the hBN atomic potential that leads to an effective lateral semiconductor multi-stripe. The potential of such atomically thin hBN heterostructure for future applications is discussed.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to propose and validate a preclinical in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tool to monitor neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke, based on injection of a novel multimodal nanoprobe, NanoGd, specifically designed for internalization by phagocytic cells. First, it is verified that NanoGd is efficiently internalized by microglia in vitro. In vivo MRI coupled with intravenous injection of NanoGd in a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model results in hypointense signals in the ischemic lesion. In these mice, longitudinal two-photon intravital microscopy shows NanoGd internalization by activated CX3CR1-GFP/+ cells. Ex vivo analysis, including phase contrast imaging with synchrotron X-ray, histochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy corroborate NanoGd accumulation within the ischemic lesion and uptake by immune phagocytic cells. Taken together, these results confirm the potential of NanoGd-enhanced MRI as an imaging biomarker of neuroinflammation at the subacute stage of ischemic stroke. As far as it is known, this work is the first to decipher the working mechanism of MR signals induced by a nanoparticle passively targeted at phagocytic cells by performing intravital microscopy back-to-back with MRI. Furthermore, using a gadolinium-based rather than an iron-based contrast agent raises future perspectives for the development of molecular imaging with emerging computed tomography technologies.},

  abstract     = {Although dipolar forces between copolymer chains are relatively weak, they result in ubiquitous inter- and/or intramolecular interactions which are particularly critical in achieving the mechanical integrity of polymeric materials. In this study, a route is developed to obtain self-healable properties in thermoplastic copolymers that rely on noncovalent dipolar interactions present in essentially all macromolecules and particularly fluorine-containing copolymers. The combination of dipolar interactions between C─F and C═O bonds as well as CH 2 /CH 3 entities facilitates self-healing without external intervention. The presence of dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and induced-dipole induced dipole interactions leads to a viscoelastic response that controls macroscopic autonomous multicycle self-healing of fluorinated copolymers under ambient conditions. Energetically favorable dipolar forces attributed to monomer sequence and monomer molar ratios induces desirable copolymer tacticities, enabling entropic energy recovery stored during mechanical damage. The use of dipolar forces instead of chemical or physical modifications not only eliminates additional alternations enabling multiple damage-repair cycles but also provides further opportunity for designing self-healable commodity thermoplastics. These materials may offer numerous applications, ranging from the use in electronics, ion batteries, H 2 fuel dispense hoses to self-healable pet toys, packaging, paints and coatings, and many others.},

  abstract     = {Physical organ models are the objects that replicate the patient-specific anatomy and have played important roles in modern medical diagnosis and disease treatment. 3D printing, as a powerful multi-function manufacturing technology, breaks the limitations of traditional methods and provides a great potential for manufacturing organ models. However, the clinical application of organ model is still in small scale, facing the challenges including high cost, poor mimicking performance and insufficient accuracy. In this review, the mainstream 3D printing technologies are introduced, and the existing manufacturing methods are divided into &quot;directly printing&quot; and &quot;indirectly printing&quot;, with an emphasis on choosing suitable techniques and materials. This review also summarizes the ideas to address these challenges and focuses on three points: 1) what are the characteristics and requirements of organ models in different application scenarios, 2) how to choose the suitable 3D printing methods and materials according to different application categories, and 3) how to reduce the cost of organ models and make the process simple and convenient. Moreover, the state-of-the-art in organ models are summarized and the contribution of 3D printed organ models to various surgical procedures is highlighted. Finally, current limitations, evaluation criteria and future perspectives for this emerging area are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Calcium hydroxyphosphate, Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (OH) 2 , is commonly known as hydroxyapatite (HAP). The acidic calcium and basic phosphate/hydroxide sites in HAP can be modified via isomorphous substitution of calcium and/or hydroxide ions to enable a cornucopia of catalyzed reactions. Herein, isomorphic substitution of Ca 2+ ions by Cu 2+ ions especially at very low levels of exchange created new analogs of molecular surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) in Cu x Ca 10− x (PO 4 ) 6 (OH) 2 , thereby boosting its performance metrics in heterogeneous CO 2 photocatalytic hydrogenation. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterization and density functional theory calculations provided fundamental insights into the catalytically active SFLPs defined as proximal Lewis acidic Cu 2+ and Lewis basic OH − . The photocatalytic pathway proceeds through a formate reaction intermediate, which is generated by the reaction of CO 2 with heterolytically dissociated H 2 on the SFLPs. Given the wealth of information thus uncovered, it is highly likely that this work will spur the further development of similar classes of materials, leading to the advancement and, ultimately, large-scale application of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction technologies.},

Herein, the authors studied the effects of mixed passivation utilizing organic phenylethylammonium bromide and inorganic ionic cesium bromide (PEABr + CsBr) on the all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbI 2 Br) solar cells for the first time. The treatment with different passivation mechanisms enhances the perovskite film quality, resulting in uniform surface morphology and compact film with low trap density. Besides, the passivation improves the energy level alignment, which benefits the hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface and drives the interface electron separation, suppressing the charge recombination and realizing a high open-circuit voltage ( V oc ). Finally, the device represents a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.70%, a V oc of 1.30 V, and an excellent fill factor (FF) of 0.82. The V oc loss and high FF should be among the best values for CsPbI 2 Br based devices. Furthermore, the treated devices exhibit remarkable long-term stability with only 8% PCE loss after storing in a glove box for more than 1000 h without encapsulation.},

  abstract     = {Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is highly heterogeneous. Here, the authors perform exome sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing on 73 tumor regions from 14 ICC patients to portray the multi-faceted intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) landscape of ICC. The authors show that ITH is highly concordant across genomic, transcriptomic, and immune levels. Comparison of these data to 8 published datasets reveals significantly higher degrees of ITH in ICC than hepatocellular carcinoma. Remarkably, the authors find that high-ITH tumors highly overlap with the IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase)-mutant subgroup ( IDH -SG), comprising of IDH -mutated tumors and IDH -like tumors, that is, those IDH -wildtype tumors that exhibit similar molecular profiles to the IDH -mutated ones. Furthermore, IDH -SG exhibits less T cell infiltration and lower T cell cytotoxicity, indicating a colder tumor microenvironment (TME). The higher ITH and colder TME of IDH -SG are successfully validated by single-cell RNA sequencing on 17 503 cells from 4 patients. Collectively, the study shows that IDH mutant subgroup status, rather than IDH mutation alone, is associated with ITH and the TME of ICC tumors. The results highlight that IDH -like patients may also benefit from IDH targeted therapies and provide important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of ICC.},

Here it is investigated if administration of a mixture of combined metabolic activators (CMAs) consisting of glutathione and NAD+ precursors can restore metabolic function and thus aid the recovery of COVID-19 patients. CMAs include l -serine, N -acetyl- l -cysteine, nicotinamide riboside, and l -carnitine tartrate, salt form of l -carnitine. Placebo-controlled, open-label phase 2 study and double-blinded phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to investigate the time of symptom-free recovery on ambulatory patients using CMAs. The results of both studies show that the time to complete recovery is significantly shorter in the CMA group (6.6 vs 9.3 d) in phase 2 and (5.7 vs 9.2 d) in phase 3 trials compared to placebo group. A comprehensive analysis of the plasma metabolome and proteome reveals major metabolic changes. Plasma levels of proteins and metabolites associated with inflammation and antioxidant metabolism are significantly improved in patients treated with CMAs as compared to placebo. The results show that treating patients infected with COVID-19 with CMAs lead to a more rapid symptom-free recovery, suggesting a role for such a therapeutic regime in the treatment of infections leading to respiratory problems.},

Their strategy can convert microneedles with almost all water-containing components from softness into hardness for guaranteeing satisfactory penetration, thus removing their material component limitations. As all fabrication procedures are mild and actives can maintain activity during these processes, the ice microneedles can carry and deliver various actives from small molecules and macromolecules to even living organisms. They have demonstrated that these ice microneedles can easily penetrate mouse and swine skins using a microneedle injector, with their active-carried tips left inside after their ice base melts. Thus, by loading heparin, erythropoietin, or biosafe Bacillus subtilis ( B. subtilis ) inside the ice microneedles to treat mouse models, the practical values of these microneedles are well displayed, indicating their bright prospects in universal drug delivery systems.},

Moreover, the mobility of the modular components brings remote modification and reconfiguration capabilities.

Although many extremity VML models have been conducted, craniofacial VML has not been well-studied due to unavailable in vivo assay tools. Here, this paper reports a wireless, noninvasive nanomembrane system that integrates skin-wearable printed sensors and electronics for real-time, continuous monitoring of VML on craniofacial muscles. The craniofacial VML model, using biopsy punch-induced masseter muscle injury, shows impaired muscle regeneration. To measure the electrophysiology of small and round masseter muscles of active mice during mastication, a wearable nanomembrane system with stretchable graphene sensors that can be laminated to the skin over target muscles is utilized. The noninvasive system provides highly sensitive electromyogram detection on masseter muscles with or without VML injury. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the wireless sensor can monitor the recovery after transplantation surgery for craniofacial VML. Overall, the presented study shows the enormous potential of the masseter muscle VML injury model and wearable assay tool for the mechanism study and the therapeutic development of craniofacial VML.},

  abstract     = {Tissue architecture is a prerequisite for its biological functions. Recapitulating the three-dimensional (3D) tissue structure represents one of the biggest challenges in tissue engineering. Two-dimensional (2D) tissue fabrication methods are currently in the main stage for tissue engineering and disease modeling. However, due to their planar nature, the created models only represent very limited out-of-plane tissue structure. Here compressive buckling principle is harnessed to create 3D biomimetic cell-laden microstructures from microfabricated planar patterns. This method allows out-of-plane delivery of cells and extracellular matrix patterns with high spatial precision. As a proof of principle, a variety of polymeric 3D miniature structures including a box, an octopus, a pyramid, and continuous waves are fabricated. A mineralized bone tissue model with spatially distributed cell-laden lacunae structures is fabricated to demonstrate the fabrication power of the method. It is expected that this novel approach will help to significantly expand the utility of the established 2D fabrication techniques for 3D tissue fabrication. Given the widespread of 2D fabrication methods in biomedical research and the high demand for biomimetic 3D structures, this method is expected to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D tissue fabrication and open up new possibilities in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.},

Despite various descriptors are reported, it still has limitations in the facile prediction, given that complicated analytical techniques as well as time-consuming modeling and calculations are indispensable. In the present work, strong correlation of magnetic property with OER performance is revealed by in-depth investigations on the crystal and electronic structures. A facile descriptor of Curie/Neel temperature ( T C/N ) is developed for La 2− x Sr x Co 2 O 6− δ perovskite oxides, based on the inference that both magnetism and OER are rooted in the electron exchange interaction. Specifically, both the T C/N and OER activity are proportional to the degree of p-d orbital hybridization, which increases with enlarged bond angle of Co─O─Co and/or increased oxidation of Co. This finding reveals that T C/N from magnetic characterizations is an effective descriptor in designing novel OER electrocatalysts, and interdisciplinary researches are advantageous for revealing the controversial mechanisms of OER process.},

However, their practical application is hindered because of the limitations of existing construction methods. Herein, a strategy is proposed for the superhydrophobic-substrate-assisted construction of free-standing 3D microcavity-patterned conducting polymer films (McPCPFs) at micrometer resolution. Easy-peeling and nondestructive transfer properties are achieved through electrochemical polymerization along the solid/liquid/gas triphase interface on micropillar-structured substrates. The effects of the wettability and geometrical parameters of the substrates on the construction of McPCPFs are systematically investigated in addition to the evolution of the epitaxial growth along the triphase interface at different polymerization times. The McPCPFs can be easily peeled from superhydrophobic surfaces using ethanol because of weak adhesion and nondestructively transferred to various substrates taking advantage of the capillarity. Furthermore, sensitive light-driven McPCPF locomotion on organic liquid surfaces is demonstrated. Ultimately, a facile strategy for the construction of free-standing 3D microstructure-patterned conducting polymer films is proposed, which can improve productivity and applicability of the films in different fields and expand the application scope of superwettable interfaces.},

To augment the functionalities of DW motion-based devices, it is essential to improve controllability over the DW motion. Other than electric current, which is known to induce unidirectional shifting of a train of DWs, an application of in-plane magnetic field also enables the control of DW dynamics by rotating the DW magnetization and consequently modulating the inherited chiral DW structure. Applying an external bias field, however, is not a viable approach for the miniaturization of the devices as the external field acts globally. Here, the programmable exchange-coupled DW motion in the antiferromagnet (AFM)/ferromagnet (FM) system is demonstrated, where the role of an external in-plane field is replaced by the exchange bias field from AFM layer, enabling the external field-free modulations of DW motions. Interestingly, the direction of the exchange bias field can also be reconfigured by simply injecting spin currents through the device, enabling electrical and programmable operations of the device. Furthermore, the result inspires a prototype DW motion-based device based on the AFM/FM heterostructure, that could be easily integrated in logic devices.},

  abstract     = {The regulation of cardiomyocyte differentiation is a fundamental aspect of cardiac development and regenerative medicine. PTEN plays important roles during embryonic development. However, its role in cardiomyocyte differentiation remains unknown. In this study, a low-cost protocol for cardiomyocyte differentiation from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is presented and it is shown that Pten deletion potently suppresses cardiomyocyte differentiation. Transcriptome analysis shows that the expression of a series of cardiomyocyte marker genes is downregulated in Pten −/− cardiomyocytes. Pten ablation induces Dnmt3b expression via the AKT/FoxO3a pathway and regulates the expression of a series of imprinted genes, including Igf2 . Double knockout of Dnmt3l and Dnmt3b rescues the deficiency of cardiomyocyte differentiation of Pten −/− ESCs. The DNA methylomes from wild-type and Pten −/− embryoid bodies and cardiomyocytes are analyzed by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Pten deletion significantly promotes the non-CG (CHG and CHH) methylation levels of genomic DNA during cardiomyocyte differentiation, and the non-CG methylation levels of cardiomyocyte genes and Igf2 are increased in Pten −/− cardiomyocytes. Igf2 or Igf1r deletion also suppresses cardiomyocyte differentiation through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, and IGF2 supplementation partially rescues the cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, Pten conditional knockout mice are generated and the role of PTEN in cardiomyocyte differentiation is verified in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation inter-chip communication requires ultrafast ultra-compact interconnects. Designer plasmonics offers a possible route towards this goal. Further development of the plasmonic technique to circuit applications requires the direct amplification of plasmonic signals on a compact platform. However, significant signal distortions and limited operational speeds prevent the application of traditional MOS-based amplifiers to plasmonics. Up to day, the amplification of surface plasmons without phase distortion has remained a scientific challenge. In this work, the concept of parametric amplification (PA) is transplanted to the plasmonics and is realized experimentally an ultrathin reconfigurable PA using a spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) waveguide integrated with tunable and nonlinear varactors. The measured parametric gain in the experiment can reach up to 9.14 dB within a short nonlinear propagation length, for example, six SSPP wavelengths, in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. By tuning the bias voltage of varactors, the phase-matching condition can be precisely controlled over a broad frequency band, enabling the authors to realize the multi-frequency PA of plasmonic signals. Measured phase responses confirm that the plasmonic parametric amplifier can significantly suppress the signal distortions as compared with the traditional MOS-based amplifier, which is a property highly desired for ultrafast wireless communication systems and integrated circuits.},

To better understand the anomalous quantum transport properties of these materials and their implications for future applications such as electronic and thermoelectric devices, it is crucial to discover more novel material platforms for performing anomalous transverse transport studies. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that low-cost Fe-based Heusler compounds exhibit large anomalous Hall and Nernst effects. An anomalous Hall conductivity of 250–750 S cm −1 and Nernst thermopower of above 2 µV K −1 are observed near room temperature. The positive effect of anti-site disorder on the anomalous Hall transport is revealed. Considering the very high Curie temperature (nearly 1000 K), larger Nernst thermopowers at high temperatures are expected owing to the existing magnetic order and the intrinsic BC. This work provides a background for developing low-cost Fe-based Heusler compounds as a new material platform for anomalous transport studies and applications, in particular, near and above room temperature.},

Such soft gripper can self-adapt the size of its effective suction area with respect to the applied load. The elastomeric membrane covering edge of the soft gripper can develop an air-tight self-sealing with parts even smaller than the gripper diameter. Such gripper shows 4 times higher adhesion than the one without the membrane on various textured surfaces. The two major advantages, underactuated self-adaptability and enhanced suction performance, allow the membrane-based suction mechanism to grip various three-dimensional (3D) geometries and delicate parts, such as egg, lime, apple, and even hydrogels without noticeable damage, which can have not been gripped with the previous adhesive microstructures-based and active suction-based soft grippers.

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs are potential candidates for lung cancer prevention and therapy. A major limitation is the lack of an efficient delivery system to directly deliver miRNA to cancer cells while limiting systemic exposure. The delivery of miRNA via inhalation is a potential strategy for lung cancer prevention in high-risk individuals. In this study, the authors investigate the efficacy of aerosolized let-7b miRNA treatment in lung cancer prevention. Let-7b shows significant inhibition of B[a]P-induced lung adenoma with no detectable side effects. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating T cells from primary tumors reveals that Let-7b post-transcriptionally suppresses PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that let-7b miRNAs may promote antitumor immunity in vivo. Let-7b treatment decreases the expression of PD-1 in CD8+ T cells and reduces PD-L1 expression in lung tumor cells. The results suggest that this aerosolized let-7b mimic is a promising approach for lung cancer prevention, and that the in vivo tumor inhibitory effects of let-7b are mediated, at least in part, by immune-promoting effects via downregulating PD-L1 in tumors and/or PD-1 on CD8+ T cells. These changes potentiate antitumor CD8+ T cell immune responses, and ultimately lead to tumor inhibition.},

In this work, ultrathin two-dimensional plasmonic PtAg nanosheets are discovered with strong broadband light absorption from NIR-I to NIR-II biowindow, which exhibit outstanding photothermal and photoacoustic effects under both 785 and 1064 nm lasers. Photothermal conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PtAg nanosheets reach 19.2% under 785 nm laser and 45.7% under 1064 nm laser. The PCE under 1064 nm laser is higher than those of most reported inorganic NIR-II photothermal nanoagents. After functionalization with folic acid modified thiol-poly(ethylene glycol) (SH-PEG-FA), PtAg nanosheets endowed with good biocompatibility and 4T1 tumor-targeted function give high performances for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) in vivo under both 785 and 1064 nm lasers. The effective ablation of tumors in mice can be realized without side effects and tumor metastasis by PAI-guided PTT of PtAg nanosheets under 785 or 1064 nm laser. The results demonstrate that the prepared PtAg nanosheets with ultrathin thickness and small size can serve as a promising phototheranostic nanoplatform for PAI-guided PTT of tumors in both NIR-I and NIR-II biowindows.},

  abstract     = {The in situ investigation of the dynamic growth process and novel assembly phenomena of graphene on liquid copper (Cu) is of great significance to deeply understand the special behavior of graphene and self-assembly mechanism. Here, the direct observation of the graphene growth and motion behavior on liquid Cu via in situ imaging is reported. Evidence of graphene movement on liquid Cu is offered and it is demonstrated that the translation and rotation behaviors of graphene are affected by the surface condition of liquid Cu. The self-assembly process of graphene array is also revealed by capturing the dynamic changes of graphene in real-time. Further analysis highlights the importance of surface energy of liquid Cu and the interaction between graphene building blocks during the self-assembling process. The growth parameters are also investigated to flexibly control the assembly configuration of graphene arrays. This work provides an insight into the mechanism of graphene motion and assembly behavior that can be used to guide the controllable manipulation of 2D materials and on-demand fabrication assembly structures with desired properties.},

However, our current knowledge about MPIs in cancers remains limited due to the complexity of cancer cells. Herein, the authors construct an integrative MPI network and propose a MPI network based hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtyping and mechanism exploration workflow. Based on the expressions of hub proteins on the MPI network, two prognosis-distinctive HCC subtypes are identified. Meanwhile, multiple interdependent features of the poor prognostic subtype are observed, including hypoxia, DNA hypermethylation of metabolic pathways, fatty acid accumulation, immune pathway up-regulation, and exhausted T-cell infiltration. Notably, the immune pathway up-regulation is probably induced by accumulated unsaturated fatty acids which are predicted to interact with multiple immune regulators like SRC and TGFB1. Moreover, based on tumor microenvironment compositions, the poor prognostic subtype is further divided into two sub-populations showing remarkable differences in metabolism. The subtyping shows a strong consistency across multiple HCC cohorts including early-stage HCC. Overall, the authors redefine robust HCC prognosis subtypes and identify potential MPIs linking metabolism to immune regulations, thus promoting understanding and clinical applications about HCC metabolism heterogeneity.},

Great efforts have been devoted to developing new-generation patches with distinctive features promoting wound healing. Here, inspired by the structure of octopus suction cups and the component of natural tissue, a biocompatible wound patch with selective adhesiveness and individualized design using a combined strategy of template-replication and mask-guided lithography is presented. Such patches are based on Ecoflex film with suction-cup-mimicking microstructures to adhere to normal skin and with biocompatible gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to contact wounded areas. An ultraviolet mask with a tailorable pattern is employed to shape the GelMA hydrogel into customized geometry replicating individual wound areas, and thus both adhesion and antiadhesion properties are integrated into the same patch. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor is loaded to accelerate the healing process. Based on these advantages, the authors demonstrate that the present patches not only adhere to different skin surfaces, but also promote the treatment of a rat cutaneous wound model. Thus, it is believed that this versatile patch can break through the limitation of traditional patches and be ideal candidates for wound healing and related biomedical applications.},

Considering that the antitumor effect is closely related to the size of the nanodrugs, it is particularly important to develop a therapeutic system with size adjustability in the tumor microenvironment, which is still a great challenge in the field of nanotheranostics. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activated aggregation strategy is reported for imaging-guided precision therapy of tumors. The ROS-activated nanoplatform is constructed based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with an HOCl probe on its surface (namely, Au–MB–PEG NPs). The Au–MB–PEG NPs show high sensitivity toward HOCl, resulting in the modulation of surface charge and rapid aggregation of AuNPs, and simultaneous release of methylene blue as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). In the tumor environment, the aggregated AuNPs ensure higher tumor accumulation and retention. Furthermore, the redshift of the absorption of aggregated AuNPs leads to activated photoacoustic imaging signals and photothermal therapy (PTT) under near-infrared irradiation. Au–MB–PEG NPs thus efficiently inhibit the tumor growth through combined PTT–PDT therapy. This work contributes to the design of stimuli-induced size-aggregation nanodrugs, thereby attaining advanced performance in cancer diagnosis and treatment.},

To improve their market penetration, while minimizing onboard weight and maximizing space-efficiency, materials costs must be reduced (&lt;10 $ kg −1 ) and the volumetric energy-density increased (&gt;8 Wh L −1 ). Carbon nanofibers display good gravimetric capacitance, yet their marketability is hindered by their low density (0.05–0.1 g cm −3 ). Here, the authors increase the packing density of low-cost, free-standing carbon nanofiber mats (from 0.1 to 0.6 g cm −3 ) through uniaxial compression. X-ray computed tomography reveals that densification occurs by reducing the inter-fiber pore size (from 1–5 µm to 0.2–0.5 µm), which are not involved in double-layer capacitance. The improved packing density is directly proportional to the volumetric performances of the device, which reaches a volumetric capacitance of 130 F cm −3 and energy density of 6 Wh L −1 at 0.1 A g −1 using a loading of 3 mg cm −2 . The results outperform most commercial and lab-scale porous carbons synthesized from bioresources (50–100 F cm −3 , 1–3 Wh L −1 using 10 mg cm −2 ) and contribute to the scalable design of sustainable electrodes with minimal ‘dead volume’ for efficient supercapacitors.},

Thus far, the focus has been on the creation of mesopores in zeolites, however, little is known about a microporosity upgrading and its effect on the diffusion and catalytic performance. Here the authors show that the “birth” of mesopore formation in faujasite (FAU) type zeolite starts by removing framework T atoms from the sodalite (SOD) cages followed by propagation throughout the crystals. This is evidenced by following the diffusion of xenon (Xe) in the mesoporous FAU zeolite prepared by unbiased leaching with NH 4 F in comparison to the pristine FAU zeolite. A new diffusion pathway for the Xe in the mesoporous zeolite is proposed. Xenon first penetrates through the opened SOD cages and then diffuses to supercages of the mesoporous zeolite. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Xe diffusion between SOD cage and supercage occurs only in hierarchical FAU structure with defect-contained six-member-ring separating these two types of cages. The catalytic performance of the mesoporous FAU zeolite further indicates that the upgraded microporosity facilitates the intracrystalline molecular traffic and increases the catalytic performance.},

Here, an MST4-p β -catenin Thr40 signaling axis essential for intestinal stem cell (ISC) homeostasis and CRC development is uncovered. In response to Wnt3a stimulation, the kinase MST4 directly phosphorylates β -catenin at Thr40 to block its Ser33 phosphorylation by GSK3 β . Thus, MST4 mediates an active process that prevents β -catenin from binding to and being degraded by β -TrCP, leading to accumulation and full activation of β -catenin. Depletion of MST4 causes loss of ISCs and inhibits CRC growth. Mice bearing either MST4 T178E mutation with constitutive kinase activity or β -catenin T40D mutation mimicking MST4-mediated phosphorylation show overly increased ISCs/CSCs and exacerbates CRC. Furthermore, the MST4-p β -catenin Thr40 axis is upregulated and correlated with poor prognosis of human CRC. Collectively, this work establishes a previously undefined machinery for β -catenin activation, and further reveals its function in stem cell and tumor biology, opening new opportunities for targeted therapy of CRC.},

The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and tumor heterogeneity limit the treatment effectiveness of various interventions. Here, an ultrasound augmented chemo/immuno therapy for GBM using a neutrophil-delivered nanosensitizer, is developed. The sensitizer is composed of a ZnGa 2 O 4 :Cr 3+ (ZGO) core for persistent luminescence imaging and a hollow sono-sensitive TiO 2 shell to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for controlled drug release. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (Anti-PD-1 antibody) is trapped in the interior of the porous ZGO@TiO 2 with paclitaxel (PTX) loaded liposome encapsulation to form ZGO@TiO 2 @ALP. Delivered by neutrophils (NEs), ZGO@TiO 2 @ALP-NEs can penetrate through BBB for GBM accumulation. After intravenous injection, ultrasound irradiation at GBM sites initiates ROS generation from ZGO@TiO 2 @ALP, leading to liposome destruction for PTX and anti-PD-1 antibody release to kill tumors and induce local inflammation, which in-turn attractes more ZGO@TiO 2 @ALP-NEs to migrate into tumor sites for augmented and sustained therapy. The treatment enhances the survival rate of the GBM bearing mice from 0% to 40% and endows them with long-term immuno-surveillance for tumor recurrence, providing a new approach for precision therapy against GBM and other cancers.},

However, the side effects of systemic immunosuppression and limited long-term viability of engrafted islets, together with the scarcity of donor organs, highlight an urgent need for the development of new, improved, and safer cell-replacement strategies. Induction of local immunotolerance to prevent allo-rejection against islets and stem cell derived β cells has the potential to improve graft function and broaden the applicability of cellular therapy while minimizing adverse effects of systemic immunosuppression. In this mini review, recent developments in non-encapsulation, local immunomodulatory approaches for T1D cell replacement therapies, including islet/ β cell modification, immunomodulatory biomaterial platforms, and co-transplantation of immunomodulatory cells are discussed. Key advantages and remaining challenges in translating such technologies to clinical settings are identified. Although many of the studies discussed are preliminary, the growing interest in the field has led to the exploration of new combinatorial strategies involving cellular engineering, immunotherapy, and novel biomaterials.

PWWP domain containing 2b (PWWP2B), which is identified as a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex (NuRD), interacts and stabilizes HDAC1/2 at the thermogenic gene promoters to suppress their expression. Ablation of Pwwp2b promotes adipocyte thermogenesis and ameliorates diet-induced obesity in vivo. Intriguingly, Pwwp2b is not only a brown fat-enriched gene but also dramatically induced by cold and sympathetic stimulation, which may serve as a physiological brake to avoid over-activation of thermogenesis in brown and beige fat cells.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable potassium metal batteries are promising energy storage devices with potentially high energy density and markedly low cost. However, eliminating dendrite growth and achieving a stable electrode/electrolyte interface are the key challenges to tackle. Herein, a novel “quasi-liquid” potassium-sodium alloy (KNA) anode comprising only 3.5 wt% sodium (KNA-3.5) is reported, which exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance able to be reversibly cycled at 4 mA cm –2 for 2000 h. Moreover, it is demonstrated that adding a small amount of sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF 6 ) into the potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide electrolyte allows for the formation of the “quasi-liquid” KNA on electrode surface. Comprehensive experimental studies reveal the formation of an unusual metastable KNa 2 phase during plating, which is believed to facilitate simultaneous nucleation and suppress the growth of dendrites, thereby improving the electrode&#39;s cycle lifetime. The “quasi-liquid” KNA-3.5 anode demonstrates markedly enhanced electrochemical performance in a full cell when pairing with Prussian blue analogs or sodium rhodizonate dibasic as the cathode material, compared to the pristine potassium anode. Importantly, unlike the liquid KNA reported before, the “quasi-liquid” KNA-3.5 exhibits good processability and can be readily shaped into sheet electrodes, showing substantial promise as a dendrite-free anode in rechargeable potassium metal batteries.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution fluid dispensing techniques play a critical role in modern digital microfluidics, micro-biosensing, and advanced fabrication. Though most of existing dispensers can achieve precise and high-throughput fluid dispensing, they suffer from some inherent problems, such as specially fabricated dispensing micronozzles/microtips, large operating systems, low volume tunability, and poor performance for low surface tension liquids and liquids containing solid/liquid additives. Herein, the authors propose a facile, low-frequency micro dispensing technique based on the Rayleigh–Plateau instability of singular liquid jets, which are stimulated by the air cavity collapse arising in the impact of microliter drops on non-wetting surfaces. This novel dispensing strategy is capable to produce single microdrops of low-viscosity liquids with a tunable volume from picoliters to nanoliters, and the operational surface tension range covers most laboratory solvents. The dispensing function is implemented without using small-dimension nozzles/tips and enables handling diverse complex liquids. Moreover, the rather simple operating platform allows the integration of the whole dispensing function into a handy portable device with a low cost. Employing this microdispensing technique, the authors have controlled microchemical reactions, handled liquid samples in biological analysis, and fabricated smart materials and devices. The authors envision that this rational microdrop generator would find applications in various research areas.},

The simulations of such fascinating multi-stimuli responsiveness, including thigmotropism, bioluminescence, color-changing ability, and so on, are of great significance for scientists to develop novel biomimetic smart materials. However, most biomimetic color-changing or luminescence materials can only realize a single stimulus-response, hence the design and fabrication of multi-stimuli responsive materials with synergistic color-changing are still on the way. Here, a bioinspired multi-stimuli responsive actuator with color- and morphing-change abilities is developed by taking advantage of the assembled cellulose nanocrystals-based cholesteric liquid crystal structure and its water/temperature response behaviors. The actuator exhibits superfast, reversible bi-directional humidity and near-infrared (NIR) light actuating ability (humidity: 9 s; NIR light: 16 s), accompanying with synergistic iridescent appearance which provides a visual cue for the movement of actuators. This work paves the way for biomimetic multi-stimuli responsive materials and will have a wide range of applications such as optical anti-counterfeiting devices, information storage materials, and smart soft robots.},

  abstract     = {Precision farming has the potential to increase global food production capacity whilst minimizing traditional inputs. However, the adoption and impact of precision farming are contingent on the availability of sensors that can discern the state of crops, while not interfering with their growth. Electrical impedance spectroscopy offers an avenue for nondestructive monitoring of crops. To that end, it is reported on the deployment of impedimetric sensors utilizing microneedles (MNs) that can be used to pierce the waxy exterior of plants to obtain sensitive impedance spectra in open-air settings with an average relative noise value of 3.83%. The sensors are fabricated using a novel micromolding and release method that is compatible with UV photocurable and thermosetting polymers. Assessments of the quality of the MNs under scanning electron microscopy show that the replication process is high in fidelity to the original design of the master mold and that it can be used for upward of 20 replication cycles. The sensor&#39;s performance is validated against conventional planar sensors for obtaining the impedance values of Arabidopsis thaliana . As a change is detected in impedance due to lighting and hydration, this raises the possibility for their widespread use in precision farming.},

Herein, a new photoacoustic (PA) imaging-optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)-laser speckle (LS) multimodal imaging strategy is first proposed, which is not only able to precisely macro guide the thermo-chemotherapy of tumor by monitoring blood oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) and hemoglobin content (HbT), but also capable of long-term microscopic investigating the microvessel morphology (microvascular density) and hemodynamics changes (relative blood flow) before and after the nanotherapeutics in vivo. Moreover, to realize the tumor thermo-chemotherapy treatment based on this novel multimodal imaging strategy, a 2D 5-fluorouracil silicon nanosheets (5-Fu-Si NSs) therapeutic agent is designed. Furthermore, 2D high-resolution tumor microvascular images in different stage display that tendency of the thermo-chemotherapy effect is closely associated with tumor angiogenesis. Taken together, the investigations establish the fundamental base in theory and technology for further tailoring the novel specific diagnosis and treatment strategy in tumor. More importantly, this technique will be beneficial to evaluate the tumor microvascular response to nanotherapeutics at microscale.},

  abstract     = {Astrocyte maldevelopment is implicated in various neuropsychiatric diseases associated with early life stress. However, the underlying astrocytopathy mechanism, which can result in the psychiatric symptoms, remains unclear. In this study, it is shown that a reduced oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) population accompanies hindered hippocampal astrocytic development in an improved parental isolation mouse model, and that the loss of OPCs suppresses astrocytic network formation and activity. It is further demonstrated that OPC-derived Wnt ligands, in particular Wnt7b, are required for Wnt/ β -catenin pathway-mediated astrocytic development and subsequent effects related to neuronal function. In addition, focal replenishment of Wnt7a/b is sufficient to rescue astrocytic maldevelopment. These results elucidate a Wnt-paracrine-dependent but myelin-independent role of OPCs in regulating astrocytic development, which provides a unique insight into the astrocytopathy mechanism in early life stress, and can be implicated in the pathogenesis of human early life stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract     = {Nanotechnology changed the concept of treatment for a variety of diseases, producing a huge impact regarding drug and gene delivery. Among the different targeted diseases, osteoporosis has devastating clinical and economic consequences. Since current osteoporosis treatments present several side effects, new treatment approaches are needed. Recently, the application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has become a promising alternative. Wnt/ β -catenin signaling pathway controls bone development and formation. This pathway is negatively regulated by sclerostin, which knock-down through siRNA application would potentially promote bone formation. However, the major bottleneck for siRNA-based treatments is the necessity of a delivery vector, bringing nanotechnology as a potential solution. Among the available nanocarriers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have attracted great attention for intracellular delivery of siRNAs. The mesoporous structure of MSNs permits the delivery of siRNAs together with another biomolecule, achieving a combination therapy. Here, the effectiveness of a new potential osteoporosis treatment based on MSNs is evaluated. The proposed system is effective in delivering SOST siRNA and osteostatin through systemic injection to bone tissue. The nanoparticle administration produced an increase expression of osteogenic related genes improving the bone microarchitecture. The treated osteoporotic mice recovered values of a healthy situation approaching to osteoporosis remission.},

  abstract     = {Metal-coordinated supramolecular nanoassemblies have recently attracted extensive attention as materials for cancer theranostics. Owing to their unique physicochemical properties, metal-coordinated supramolecular self-assemblies can bridge the boundary between traditional inorganic and organic materials. By tailoring the structural components of the metal ions and binding ligands, numerous multifunctional theranostic nanomedicines can be constructed. Metal-coordinated supramolecular nanoassemblies can modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus facilitating the development of TME-responsive nanomedicines. More importantly, TME-responsive organic–inorganic hybrid nanomaterials can be constructed in vivo by exploiting the metal-coordinated self-assembly of a variety of functional ligands, which is a promising strategy for enhancing the tumor accumulation of theranostic molecules. In this review, recent advancements in the design and fabrication of metal-coordinated supramolecular nanomedicines for cancer theranostics are highlighted. These supramolecular compounds are classified according to the order in which the coordinated metal ions appear in the periodic table. Furthermore, the prospects and challenges of metal-coordinated supramolecular self-assemblies for both technical advances and clinical translation are discussed. In particular, the superiority of TME-responsive nanomedicines for in vivo coordinated self-assembly is elaborated, with an emphasis on strategies that enhance the accumulation of functional components in tumors for an ideal theranostic outcome.},

Therefore, atomic-scale identification and their quantification warrant precise engineering that widens their application to many fields, ranging from development of optoelectronic devices to magnetic semiconductors. Scanning transmission electron microscopy with a sub-Å probe has provided a facile way to observe local dopants and defects in 2D TMDs. However, manual data analytics of experimental images is a time-consuming task, and often requires subjective decisions to interpret observed signals. Therefore, an approach is required to automate the detection and classification of dopants and defects. In this study, based on a deep learning algorithm, fully convolutional neural network that shows a superior ability of image segmentation, an efficient and automated method for reliable quantification of dopants and defects in TMDs is proposed with single-atom precision. The approach demonstrates that atomic dopants and defects are precisely mapped with a detection limit of ≈1 × 10 12 cm −2 , and with a measurement accuracy of ≈98% for most atomic sites. Furthermore, this methodology is applicable to large volume of image data to extract atomic site-specific information, thus providing insights into the formation mechanisms of various defects under stimuli.},

An intact BBB is also critical for the maintenance of normal neuronal function. In cerebral vascular diseases and neurological disorders, the BBB can be disrupted, contributing to disease progression. While restoration of BBB integrity serves as a robust biomarker of better clinical outcomes, the restrictive nature of the intact BBB presents a major hurdle for delivery of therapeutics into the brain. Recent studies show that the BBB is actively engaged in crosstalk between neuronal and the circulatory systems, which defines another important role of the BBB: as an interfacing conduit that mediates communication between two sides of the BBB. This role has been subject to extensive investigation for brain-targeted drug delivery and shows promising results. The dual roles of the BBB make it a unique target for drug development. Here, recent developments and novel strategies to target the BBB for therapeutic purposes are reviewed, from both barrier and carrier perspectives.},

In this work, the carbon cloth covered with CoS 2 nanoparticles (CC-CoS 2 ) is prepared to function as both three-dimensional (3D) current collector and physicochemical barrier to retard migration of soluble lithium polysulfides. On the one hand, the CC-CoS 2 film works as a robust 3D current collector and host with high conductivity, high sulfur loading, and high capability of capturing polysulfides. On the other hand, the 3D porous CC-CoS 2 film serves as a multifunctional interlayer that exhibits efficient physical blocking, strong chemisorption, and fast catalytic redox reaction kinetics toward soluble polysulfides. Consequently, the Al@S/AB@CC-CoS 2 cell with a sulfur loading of 1.2 mg cm −2 exhibits a high rate capability (≈823 mAh g −1 at 4 C) and delivers excellent capacity retention (a decay of ≈0.021% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 4 C). Moreover, the sandwiched cathode of CC-CoS 2 @S/AB@CC-CoS 2 is designed for high sulfur loading LSBs. The CC-CoS 2 @S/AB@CC-CoS 2 cells with sulfur loadings of 4.2 and 6.1 mg cm −2 deliver high reversible capacities of 1106 and 885 mAh g −1 , respectively, after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.

  abstract     = {COVID-19 is disastrous to global health and the economy. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits similar clinical symptoms and immunopathological sequelae to SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, much of the developmental progress on SARS-CoV vaccines can be utilized for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Careful antigen selection during development is always of utmost importance for the production of effective vaccines that do not compromise recipient safety. This holds especially true for SARS-CoV vaccines, as several immunopathological disorders are associated with the activity of structural and nonstructural proteins encoded in the virus&#39;s genetic material. Whole viral protein and RNA-encoding full-length proteins contain both protective and “dangerous” sequences, unless pathological fragments are deleted. In light of recent advances, peptide vaccines may present a very safe and effective alternative. Peptide vaccines can avoid immunopathological pro-inflammatory sequences, focus immune responses on neutralizing immunogenic epitopes, avoid off-target antigen loss, combine antigens with different protective roles or mechanisms, even from different viral proteins, and avoid mutant escape by employing highly conserved cryptic epitopes. In this review, an attempt is made to exploit the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vaccine antigen screening, with particular attention to the pathological and immunogenic properties of SARS proteins.},

However, an understanding of how this unique topology can affect the properties of highly solvated materials like hydrogels remain under investigated. Here, it is investigated how the high functionality and large overall size of brush polymers enhances the gelation kinetics of low polymer weight percent gels, enabling 100-fold faster gelation rates and 15-fold higher stiffness values than gels crosslinked by traditional star polymers of the same composition and polymer chain length. This work demonstrates that brush polymer topology provides a useful means to control gelation kinetics without the need to manipulate polymer composition or crosslinking chemistry. The unique architecture of brush polymers also results in restrained or even nonswelling behavior at different temperatures, regardless of the polymer concentration. Brush polymers therefore are an interesting tool for examining how high-functionality polymer building blocks can affect structure–property relationships and chemical kinetics in hydrogel materials, and also provide a useful rapidly-setting hydrogel platform with tunable properties and great potential for multiple material applications.},

Through the direct activation of cognate receptors on interactive surfaces, the materials enable increased cell growth and differentiation compared to that achieved by soluble growth factors.

Herein, a novel CSE membrane is proposed, that consists of interwoven garnet/polyethylene oxide-Li bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LLZO/PEO-LiTFSI) microfibers. This CSE exhibits high Li-ion conductivity and exceptional Li dendrite suppression capability, which can be attributed to the uniform LLZO dispersion in PEO-LiTFSI and the vertical/horizontal anisotropic Li-ion conduction in the CSE. The uniform LLZO particles can generate large interaction regions between LLZO and PEO-LiTFSI, which thus form continuous Li-ion transfer pathways, retard the interfacial side reactions and strengthen the deformation resistance. More importantly, the anisotropic Li-ion conduction, that is, Li-ion transfers much faster along the microfibers than across the microfibers, can effectively homogenize the electric field distribution in the CSE during cycling, which thus prevents the excessive concentration of Li-ion flux. Finally, solid-state Li||LiFePO 4 cells based on this CSE show excellent electrochemical performances. This work enriches the structure design strategy of high-performance CSEs and may be helpful for further pushing the solid-state Li metal batteries towards practical applications.},

However, the interface engineering for the Sb 2 Se 3 nanorod array-based solar cell is more crucial to increase the performance, because it is challenging to coat a compact buffer layer with perfect coverage to form a uniform heterojunction interface due to its large surface area and length–diameter ratio. In this work, an intermeshing In 2 S 3 nanosheet-CdS composite as the buffer layer, compactly coating on the Sb 2 Se 3 nanorod surface is constructed. The application of In 2 S 3 -CdS composite buffers build a gradient conduction band energy configuration in the Sb 2 Se 3 /buffer heterojunction interface, which reduces the interface recombination and enhances the transfer and collection of photogenerated electrons. The energy-level regulation minimizes the open-circuit voltage deficit at the interfaces of buffer/Sb 2 Se 3 and buffer/ZnO layers in the Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells. Consequently, the Sb 2 Se 3 nanorod array solar cell based on In 2 S 3 -CdS composite buffers achieves an efficiency of as high as 9.19% with a V OC of 461 mV.},

  abstract     = {Dry eye disease (DED) has high personal and societal costs, but its pathology remains elusive due to intertwined biophysical and biochemical processes at the ocular surface. Specifically, mucin deficiency is reported in a subset of DED patients, but its effects on ocular interfacial properties remain unclear. Herein a novel in vitro mucin-deficient mimetic ocular surface (Mu-DeMOS) with a controllable amount of membrane-tethered mucin molecules is developed to represent the diseased ocular surfaces. Contact angle goniometry on mimetic ocular surfaces reveals that high surface roughness, but not the presence of hydrophilic mucin molecules, delivers constant hydration over native ocular surface epithelia. Live-cell rheometry confirms that the presence of mucin-like glycoproteins on ocular epithelial cells reduces shear adhesive strength at cellular interfaces. Together, optimal surface roughness and surface chemistry facilitate sustainable lubrication for healthy ocular surfaces, while an imbalance between them contributes to lubrication-related dysfunction at diseased ocular epithelial surfaces. Furthermore, the restoration of low adhesive strength at Mu-DeMOS interfaces through a mucin-like glycoprotein, recombinant human lubricin, suggests that increased frictional damage at mucin-deficient cellular surfaces may be reversible. More broadly, these results demonstrate that Mu-DeMOS is a promising platform for drug screening assays and fundamental studies on ocular physiology.},

Microneedles technologies have recently emerged as powerful tools for transdermal applications with inherent painlessness and biosafety. In this work, for the first time to the authors&#39; knowledge, a fully integrated wearable closed-loop system (IWCS) based on mini-invasive microneedle platform is developed for in situ diabetic sensing and treatment. The IWCS consists of three connected modules: 1) a mesoporous microneedle-reverse iontophoretic glucose sensor; 2) a flexible printed circuit board as integrated and control; and 3) a microneedle-iontophoretic insulin delivery component. As the key component, mesoporous microneedles enable the painless penetration of stratum corneum, implementing subcutaneous substance exchange. The coupling with iontophoresis significantly enhances glucose extraction and insulin delivery and enables electrical control. This IWCS is demonstrated to accurately monitor glucose fluctuations, and responsively deliver insulin to regulate hyperglycemia in diabetic rat model. The painless microneedles and wearable design endows this IWCS as a highly promising platform to improve the therapies of diabetic patients.},

These macroencapsulation systems have to meet a number of stringent and challenging design criteria in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reversing T1D. In this progress report, the design considerations and functional requirements of macroencapsulation systems are reviewed, specifically for stem-cell derived islets (SC-islets), highlighting distinct design parameters.

  abstract     = {Micro-supercapacitors are notorious for their low energy densities compared to micro-batteries. While MXenes have been identified as promising capacitor-type electrode materials for alternative zinc-ion hybrid micro-supercapacitors (ZHMSCs) with higher energy density, their tightly spaced layered structure renders multivalent zinc-ions with large radii intercalation inefficient. Herein, through insertion of 1D core-shell conductive BC@PPy nanofibers between MXene nanosheets, an interlayer structure engineering technique for MXene/BC@PPy capacitor-type electrodes towards ZHMSCs is presented. Owing to simultaneously achieving two objectives: (i) widening the interlayer space and (ii) providing conductive connections between the loose MXene layers, enabled by the conductive BC@PPy nanospacer, the approach effectively enhances both ion and electron transport within the layered MXene structure, significantly increasing the areal capacitance of the MXene/BC@PPy film electrode to 388 mF cm −2 , which is a 10-fold improvement from the pure MXene film electrode. Pairing with CNTs/MnO2 battery-type electrodes, the obtained ZHMSCs exhibit an areal energy density up to 145.4 μWh cm −2 with an outstanding 95.8% capacity retention after 25000 cycles, which is the highest among recently reported MXene-based MSCs and approaches the level of micro-batteries. The interlayer structure engineering demonstrated in the MXene-based capacitor-type electrode provides a rational means to achieve battery-levelenergy density in the ZHMSCs.},

However, the severe restrictions of the monotonic light response and complicated circuitry design remain challenges for the development of artificial visual devices. Here, the concept of a smart artificial retina based on an organic optical sensing inverter device that can be operated as a multiwavelength photodetector and recorder is reported first. The device exhibits a light-triggered broadband (red/green/blue) response, a low energy consumption as low as ±5 V, and an ultrafast response speed (&lt;300 ms). Moreover, the multifunctional component is also combined within a single cell for health monitoring of the artificial retina during light surveillance to avoid retinopathy.

Secondary infections are a leading cause of influenza&#39;s high morbidity and mortality, and significantly factored into the severity of the 1918, 1968, and 2009 pandemics. Furthermore, there is an increased incidence of other respiratory infections even in vaccinated individuals during influenza season. Putative mechanisms responsible for vaccine failures against influenza as well as other respiratory infections during influenza season are investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are used from influenza vaccinated individuals to assess antigen-specific responses to influenza, measles, and varicella. The observations made in humans to a mouse model to unravel the mechanism is confirmed and extended. Infection with influenza virus suppresses an ongoing adaptive response to vaccination against influenza as well as other respiratory pathogens, i.e., Adenovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by preferentially infecting and killing activated lymphocytes which express elevated levels of sialic acid receptors. These findings propose a new mechanism for the high incidence of secondary respiratory infections due to bacteria and other viruses as well as vaccine failures to influenza and other respiratory pathogens even in immune individuals due to influenza viral infections.},

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs play an important role in early development, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell death, and are aberrantly expressed in many types of cancers. To understand their function and diagnose cancer at an early stage, it is crucial to quantitatively detect microRNA without invasive labels. Here, a plasmonic biosensor based on surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) for rapid, label-free, and ultrasensitive detection of miR-155 is reported. This technology leverages metamaterial perfect absorbers stimulating the SEIRA effect to provide up to 1000-fold near-field intensity enhancement over the microRNA fingerprint spectral bands. Additionally, it is discovered that the limit of detection (LOD) of the biosensor can be greatly improved by using tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN) as carriers. By using near-field enhancement of SEIRA and specific binding of TDN, the biosensor achieves label-free detection of miR-155 with a high sensitivity of 1.162% p m −1 and an excellent LOD of 100 × 10 −15 m . The LOD is about 5000 times lower than that using DNA single strand as probes and about 100 times lower than that of the fluorescence detection method. This work can not only provide a powerful diagnosis tool for the microRNAs detection but also gain new insights into the field of label-free and ultrasensitive SEIRA-based biosensing.},

  abstract     = {Although obesity occurs in most of the patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), a fraction of patients with T2D are underweight or have normal weight. Several studies have linked the gut microbiome to obesity and T2D, but the role of gut microbiota in lean individuals with T2D having unique clinical characteristics remains unclear. A metagenomic and targeted metabolomic analysis is conducted in 182 lean and abdominally obese individuals with and without newly diagnosed T2D. The abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila ( A. muciniphila ) significantly decreases in lean individuals with T2D than without T2D, but not in the comparison of obese individuals with and without T2D. Its abundance correlates inversely with serum 3 β -chenodeoxycholic acid ( β CDCA) levels and positively with insulin secretion and fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19) concentrations. The supplementation with A. muciniphila is sufficient to protect mice against high sucrose-induced impairment of glucose intolerance by decreasing β CDCA and increasing insulin secretion and FGF15/19. Furthermore, β CDCA inhibits insulin secretion and FGF15/19 expression. These findings suggest that decreased abundance of A. muciniphila is linked to the impairment of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in lean T2D, paving the way for new therapeutic options for the prevention or treatment of diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Efficient charge storage media play a pivotal role in transistor-based memories and thus are under intense research. In this work, the charge storage ability of type-I InP/ZnS core/shell quantum dots is well revealed through studying a pentacene-based organic transistor with the quantum dots (QDs) integrated. The quantum well-like energy band structure enables the QDs to directly confine either holes or electrons in the core, signifying a dielectric layer-free nonvolatile memory. Especially, the QDs in this device can be charged by electrons using light illumination as the exclusive method. The electron charging process is ascribed to the photoexcitation process in the InP-core and the hot holes induced. The QDs layer demonstrates an electron storage density of ≈5.0 × 10 11 cm −2 and a hole storage density of ≈6.4 × 10 11 cm −2 . Resultingly, the output device shows a fast response speed to gate voltage (10 µs), large memory window (42 V), good retention (&gt;4.0 × 10 4 s), and reliable endurance. This work suggests that the core/shell quantum dot as a kind of charge storage medium is of great promise for optoelectronic memories.},

Herein, guided by theoretical modeling, an effective tactic for realizing water-resistant Li anode by implementing a wax-assisted transfer protocol is reported to passivate the Li surface with an inert high-quality chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene layer. This electrically conductive and mechanically robust graphene coating enables serving as an artificial solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI), guiding homogeneous Li plating/stripping, suppressing dendrite and “dead” Li formation, as well as passivating the Li surface from moisture erosion and side reactions. Consequently, lithium–air batteries fabricated with the passivated Li anodes demonstrate a superb cycling performance up to 2300 h (230 cycles at 1000 mAh g −1 , 200 mA g −1 ). More strikingly, the anode recycled thereafter can be recoupled with a fresh cathode to continuously run for 400 extended hours. Comprehensive time-lapse and ex situ microscopic and spectroscopic investigations are further carried out for elucidating the fundamentals behind the extraordinary air and electrochemical stability.},

However, the immune response can also lead to abnormal tissue healing or scar formation if not well directed. This review first introduces the general immune response post injury, with focus on the major immune cells including neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. Next, a variety of implant-mediated immunomodulation strategies to regulate immune response through physical, chemical, and biological cues are discussed. At last, various scaffold-facilitated regenerations of different tissue types, such as, bone, cartilage, blood vessel, and nerve system, by harnessing the immunomodulation are presented. Therefore, the most recent data in biomaterials and immunomodulation is presented here in a bid to shape expert perspectives, inspire researchers to go in new directions, and drive development of future strategies focusing on targeted, sequential, and dynamic immunomodulation elicited by implants.},

Particularly, the soft material cannot be ignited under an open flame at 400–500 °C, because of coupling dual flame retardant mechanisms containing the endothermic effect of liquid water evaporation and the barrier effect of calcium mineral salt on oxygen.

Here, it is demonstrated that KRAS G12C inhibition induces sustained activation of focal adhesive kinase (FAK) and show that a combination therapy comprising KRAS G12C inhibition and a FAK inhibitor (IN10018) achieves synergistic anticancer effects. It can simultaneously reduce the extent of drug resistance. Diverse CDX and PDX models of KRAS G12C mutant cancer are examined and synergistic benefits from the combination therapy are consistently observed. Mechanistically, it is found that both aberrant FAK–YAP signaling and FAK-related fibrogenesis impact on the development of KRAS G12C inhibitor resistance.

The accumulation of nanoparticles in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice induced by the PAF strategy displays a fivefold enhancement in comparison with that of the traditional passive targeting pathway, in a significantly shortened time (45 min vs 24 h) with an enhanced penetration depth in tumors. Additionally, a tumor-bearing mouse model is rationally designed to unveil the mechanism, indicating that the nanoparticles enter solid tumors through enhanced transportation across blood vessel barriers via both inter-endothelial gaps and active trans-endothelial pathways. This process is specifically driven by PAF generated from the nanoparticles under NIR laser irradiation. The study thus demonstrates a new nanotherapeutic strategy with low dose, enhanced delivery efficiency in tumor, and boosted therapeutic efficacy, opening new doors for designing novel nanocarriers.},

  abstract     = {Obesity and type 2 diabetes are strongly associated with adipose tissue dysfunction and impaired adipogenesis. Understanding the molecular underpinnings that control adipogenesis is thus of fundamental importance for the development of novel therapeutics against metabolic disorders. However, translational approaches are hampered as current models do not accurately recapitulate adipogenesis. Here, a scaffold-free versatile 3D adipocyte culture platform with chemically defined conditions is presented in which primary human preadipocytes accurately recapitulate adipogenesis. Following differentiation, multi-omics profiling and functional tests demonstrate that 3D adipocyte cultures feature mature molecular and cellular phenotypes similar to freshly isolated mature adipocytes. Spheroids exhibit physiologically relevant gene expression signatures with 4704 differentially expressed genes compared to conventional 2D cultures (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05), including the concerted expression of factors shaping the adipogenic niche. Furthermore, lipid profiles of &gt;1000 lipid species closely resemble patterns of the corresponding isogenic mature adipocytes in vivo ( R 2 = 0.97). Integration of multi-omics signatures with analyses of the activity profiles of 503 transcription factors using global promoter motif inference reveals a complex signaling network, involving YAP, Hedgehog, and TGF β signaling, that links the organotypic microenvironment in 3D culture to the activation and reinforcement of PPAR γ and CEBP activity resulting in improved adipogenesis.},

A previous study suggested an association between a synonymous SNP (rs1012672, C→T) in LRP6 gene and LOAD; and that is indeed correlated with diminished LRP6 gene expression in the frontal cortex region. The authors show that LRP6 is a unique Wnt coreceptor on astrocytes, serving as a bimodal switch that modulates their metabolic landscapes. The Wnt-LRP6 mediated mTOR-AKT axis is essential for sustaining glucose metabolism. In its absence, Wnt switches to activate the LRP6-independent Ca 2+ -PKC-NFAT axis, resulting in a transcription network that favors glutamine and branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolism over glucose metabolism. Exhaustion of these raw materials essential for neurotransmitter biosynthesis and recycling results in compromised synaptic, cognitive, and memory functions; priming for early changes that are frequently found in LOAD. The authors also highlight that intranasal supplementation of glutamine and BCAAs is effective in preserving neuronal integrity and brain functions, proposing a nutrient-based method for delaying cognitive and memory decline when LRP6 cell surface levels and functions are suboptimal.},

  abstract     = {20–30% of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) develop distant metastasis or recurrence leading to poor survival, of which the underlying key molecular events have yet to be addressed. Here alternative splicing events in 85 NPC samples are profiled using transcriptome analysis and it is revealed that the long isoform of GOLIM4 (-L) with exon-7 is highly expressed in NPC and associated with poor prognosis. Lines of evidence demonstrate the pro-tumorigenic function of GOLIM4-L in NPC cells. It is further revealed that RBFOX2 binds to a GGAA motif in exon-7 and promotes its inclusion forming GOLIM4-L . RBFOX2 knockdown suppresses the tumorigenesis of NPC cells, phenocopying GOLIM4-L knockdown, which is significantly rescued by GOLIM4-L overexpression. High expression of RBFOX2 is correlated with the exon-7 inclusion of GOLIM4 in NPC biopsies and associated with worse prognosis. It is observed that RBFOX2 and GOLIM4 can influence vesicle-mediated transport through maintaining the organization of Golgi apparatus. Finally, it is revealed that RAB26 interacts with GOLIM4 and mediates its tumorigenic potentials in NPC cells. Taken together, the findings provide insights into how alternative splicing contributes to NPC development, by highlighting a functional link between GOLIM4-L and its splicing regulator RBFOX2 activating vesicle-mediated transport involving RAB26.},

  abstract     = {Among transition metal dichalcogenides (TMdCs) as alternatives for Pt-based catalysts, metallic-TMdCs catalysts have highly reactive basal-plane but are unstable. Meanwhile, chemically stable semiconducting-TMdCs show limiting catalytic activity due to their inactive basal-plane. Here, metallic vanadium sulfide (VS n ) nanodispersed in a semiconducting MoS 2 film (V–MoS 2 ) is proposed as an efficient catalyst. During synthesis, vanadium atoms are substituted into hexagonal monolayer MoS 2 to form randomly distributed VS n units. The V–MoS 2 film on a Cu electrode exhibits Pt-scalable catalytic performance; current density of 1000 mA cm −2 at 0.6 V and overpotential of −0.08 V at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 with excellent cycle stability for hydrogen-evolution-reaction (HER). The high intrinsic HER performance of V–MoS 2 is explained by the efficient electron transfer from the Cu electrode to chalcogen vacancies near vanadium sites with optimal Gibbs free energy (−0.02 eV). This study provides insight into ways to engineer TMdCs at the atomic-level to boost intrinsic catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution.},

  abstract     = {The main approach for exploring metastable materials is via trial-and-error synthesis, and there is limited understanding of how metastable materials are kinetically stabilized. In this study, a metastable phase superionic conductor, β -Li 3 YCl 6 , is discovered through in situ X-ray diffraction after heating a mixture of LiCl and YCl 3 powders. While Cl − arrangement is represented as a hexagonal close packed structure in both metastable β -Li 3 YCl 6 synthesized below 600 K and stable α -Li 3 YCl 6 above 600 K, the arrangement of Li + and Y 3+ in β -Li 3 YCl 6 determined by neutron diffraction brought about the cell with a 1/√3 a -axis and a similar c -axis of stable α -Li 3 YCl 6 . Higher Li + ion conductivity and lower activation energy for Li + transport are observed in comparison with α -Li 3 YCl 6 . The computationally calculated low migration barrier of Li + supports the low activation energy for Li + conduction, and the calculated high migration barrier of Y 3+ kinetically stabilizes this metastable phase by impeding phase transformation to α -Li 3 YCl 6 . This work shows that the combination of in situ observation of solid-state reactions and computation of the migration energy can facilitate the comprehension of the solid-state reactions allowing kinetic stabilization of metastable materials, and can enable the discovery of new metastable materials in a short time.},

Here, inspired by frogs’ croaking behavior, a bionic triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-based ultra-sensitive self-powered electromechanical sensor for muscle-triggered communication HMI application is developed. The sensor possesses a high sensitivity (54.6 mV mm −1 ), a high-intensity signal (± 700 mV), and a wide sensing range (0–5 mm). The signal intensity is 206 times higher than that of traditional biopotential electromyography methods. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and Morse code, the safe, accurate (96.3%), and stable communication aid HMI applications are achieved. The authors&#39; bionic TENG-based electromechanical sensor provides a valuable toolkit for HMI applications of the disabled, and it brings new insights into the interdisciplinary cross-integration between TENG technology and bionics.},

Electric fishes, such as the electric eel and the torpedo ray, provide inspiration for such a power source with their ability to generate massive discharges of electricity solely from the metabolic processes within their bodies. Inspired by their example, the device presented in this work harnesses electric power from ion gradients established by capturing the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from human breath. Upon localized exposure to CO 2 , this novel adaptation of reverse electrodialysis chemically generates ion gradients from a single initial solution uniformly distributed throughout the device instead of requiring the active circulation of two different external solutions. A thorough analysis of the relationship between electrical output and the concentration of carbon capture agent (monoethanolamine, MEA), the amount of CO 2 captured, and the device geometry informs device design. The prototype device presented here harvests enough energy from a breath-generated ion gradient to power small electronic devices, such as a light-emitting diode (LED).},

By performing the dynamic single-cell transcriptomic landscape of human megakaryopoiesis in vitro, it is found that the immune signatures of MKs can be traced back to the progenitor stage. Furthermore, two surface markers, CD148 and CD48, are identified for mature MKs with immune characteristics. At the functional level, these CD148 + CD48 + MKs can respond rapidly to immune stimuli both in vitro and in vivo, exhibit high-level expression of immune receptors and mediators, and may function as immune-surveillance cells. The findings uncover the cellular heterogeneity and a novel immune subset of human adult MKs and should greatly facilitate the understanding of the divergent functions of MKs under physiological and pathological conditions.},

Most acoustic levitators rely on complex electronic hardware and software to shape the acoustic field and realize their dynamic operation. Here, the authors introduce a dynamic acoustic levitator that is based on mechanically controlling the opening and (partial) closing of subwavelength apertures. This simple approach relies on the use of a single ultrasonic transducer and is shown to permit the facile and reliable manipulation of a variety targets ranging from solid particles, to fluid and ferrofluidic drops. Experimental observations agree well with numerical simulations of the Gor&#39;kov potential. Remarkably, this system even enables the generation of time-varying potentials and induces oscillatory and rotational motion in the levitated objects via a feedback mechanism between the trapped object and the trapping potential. This is shown to result in long distance translation, in-situ rotation and self-modulated oscillation of the trapped particles. In addition, dense ferrofluidic droplets are levitated and transformed inside the levitator. Controlling subwavelength apertures opens the possibility to realize simple powerful levitators that nevertheless allow for the versatile dynamic manipulation of levitated matter.},

This AIE-active ligand, TTPy-NH 2 , well fits into the lattices of quasi-2D-PVK and leaves hydrophobic tails surrounding PVK layers, making the presented TTPy-NH 2 /PVK film extraordinary in terms of both luminescence and stability. Benefiting from the prominent sensitization function and AIE tendency of TTPy-NH 2 , the presented TTPy-NH 2 /PVK film exhibits a high quantum yield of 62.2%, unique blue-red dual-emission property of both blue and red, high stability with the remnant of more than 94% fluorescence intensity remnant after 21 days. As a result, TTPy-NH 2 /PVK film is capable of constituting high-performance white light-emitting diodes, with its color gamut reaching 138% of the National Television System Committee （NTSC） standard and the maximum efficiency is 105 lm W −1 at 20 mA. Evidently, a win-win effect is achieved by the integration of AIE-active ligands and quasi-2D-PVK, which are two of the most reputable solid-state luminogens. This developed protocol thus opens up a new avenue for exploring the next generation of luminescent devices.},

  abstract     = {Current treatment approaches toward spinal cord injuries (SCI) have mainly focused on overcoming the inhibitory microenvironment that surrounds lesion sites. Unfortunately, the mere modulation of the cell/tissue microenvironment is often insufficient to achieve desired functional recovery. Therefore, stimulating the intrinsic growth ability of injured neurons becomes crucial. MicroRNAs (miRs) play significant roles during axon regeneration by regulating local protein synthesis at growth cones. However, one challenge of using miRs to treat SCI is the lack of efficient delivery approaches. Here, a 3D fiber-hydrogel scaffold is introduced which can be directly implanted into a spinal cord transected rat. This 3D scaffold consists of aligned electrospun fibers which provide topographical cues to direct axon regeneration, and collagen matrix which enables a sustained delivery of miRs. Correspondingly, treatment with Axon miRs (i.e., a cocktail of miR-132/miR-222/miR-431) significantly enhances axon regeneration. Moreover, administration of Axon miRs along with anti-inflammatory drug, methylprednisolone, synergistically enhances functional recovery. Additionally, this combined treatment also decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and enhance gene expressions related to extracellular matrix deposition.

  abstract     = {Inflammatory modulations focusing on macrophage phenotype are promising candidates to promote better cardiac healing post myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury. However, the peak of monocyte/macrophage recruitment is later than the time when enhanced permeability and retention effect disappears, which greatly increases the difficulty of reprogramming macrophages through systemic administration. Meanwhile, the inability of nanomaterials to release their contents to specific intracellular locations through reasonable cellular internalization pathways is another obstacle to achieving macrophage reprogramming. Here, inspired by the increase in circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates in patients′ post-MI/R and the high efficiency of fusogenic liposomes to deliver contents to the cytoplasm of target cells, a platelet-like fusogenic liposome (PLPs) is constructed. Under the coating of PLPs, mesoporous silica nanospheres with a payload of miR-21, an anti-inflammatory agent, can be specifically delivered to inflammatory monocytes in the blood circulation of MI/R induced mice. Then it directly enters the cytoplasm of monocytes through membrane fusion, thereby realizing the reparative reprogramming of the inflamed macrophages derived from it. In vivo administration of the resulting formula can effectively preserve the cardiac function of mice undergone MI/R. Minimal invasiveness and biological safety make this nano-platform a promising approach of immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Histone acetylation is a key histone post-translational modification that shapes chromatin structure, dynamics, and function. Bromodomain (BRD) proteins, the readers of acetyl-lysines, are located in the center of the histone acetylation-signaling network. How they regulate DNA repair and genome stability remains poorly understood. Here, a conserved function of the yeast Bromodomain Factor 1 (Bdf1) and its human counterpart TAF1 is reported in promoting DNA double-stranded break repair by homologous recombination (HR). Depletion of either yeast BDF1 or human TAF1, or disruption of their BRDs impairs DNA end resection, Replication Protein A (RPA) and Rad51 loading, and HR repair, causing genome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Mechanistically, it is shown that Bdf1 preferentially binds the DNA damage-induced histone H4 acetylation (H4Ac) via the BRD motifs, leading to its chromatin recruitment. Meanwhile, Bdf1 physically interacts with RPA, and this interaction facilitates RPA loading in the chromatin context and the subsequent HR repair. Similarly, TAF1 also interacts with H4Ac or RPA. Thus, Bdf1 and TAF1 appear to share a conserved mechanism in linking the HR repair to chromatin acetylation in preserving genome integrity.},

Natural products dominate the preferred chemical scaffolds for the discovery of antibacterial agents. Here, the potential of natural flavonoids from plants against MDR bacteria, is demonstrated. Structure–activity relationship analysis shows the prenylation modulates the activity of flavonoids and obtains two compounds, α -mangostin (AMG) and isobavachalcone (IBC). AMG and IBC not only display rapid bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but also restore the susceptibility of colistin against Gram-negative pathogens. Mechanistic studies generally show such compounds bind to the phospholipids of bacterial membrane, and result in the dissipation of proton motive force and metabolic perturbations, through distinctive modes of action. The efficacy of AMG and IBC in four models associated with infection or contamination, is demonstrated. These results suggest that natural products of plants may be a promising and underappreciated reservoir to circumvent the existing antibiotic resistance.},

Thus, appropriate regulation of MAVS expression is essential for antiviral immunity against RNA virus infection.

Here, it is reported that the MAVS mRNA undergoes N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification through methyltransferase-like protein 14 (METTL14), which leads to a fast turnover of MAVS mRNA. Knockdown or deficiency of METTL14 increases MAVS mRNA stability, and downstream phosphorylation of TBK1/IRF3 and interferon- β production in response to RNA viruses. Compared to wild-type mice, heterozygotes Mettl14 +/− mice better tolerate RNA virus infection.

Here, a nanoengineered heterostructure for the first-time demonstration of a nanointerface using an inserted graphene layer between black phosphorus (BP) and InSe which inhibits interlayer recombination and greatly improves photodetection performances is presented. In addition, a transition of the transport characteristics of the device is induced by graphene, from diffusion motion of minority carriers to drift motion of majority carriers. These two reasons together with an internal photoemission effect make the BP/G/InSe-based photodetector have ultrahigh specific detectivity at room temperature. The results demonstrate that high-performance vdW heterostructure photodetectors can be achieved through simple structural manipulation of the heterojunction interface on nanoscale.},

This paper presents a bi-shell valve that can fast actuate soft actuators neither relying on the fast volume input provided by pressure control strategies nor requiring modifications to the architecture of the actuator. The bi-shell valve consists of a spherical cap and an imperfect shell with a geometrically tuned defect that enables shell snapping interaction to convert a slowly dispensed volume input into a fast volume output. This function is beyond those of current valves capable to perform fluidic flow regulation. Validated through experiments, the analysis unveils that the spherical cap sets the threshold of the snapping pressure along with the upper bounds of volume and energy output, while the imperfect shell interacts with the cap to store and deliver the desired output for rapid actuation. Geometry variations of the bi-shell valve are provided to show that the concept is versatile. A final demonstration shows that the soft valve can quickly actuate a striker.},

Despite what is known about the process of fibrosis in mammals, novel approaches for combating fibrosis and scarring are necessary. It is hypothesized that scarring has evolved as a solution to maximize healing speed to reduce fluid loss and infection. This hypothesis, however, is complicated by regenerative animals, which have arguably the most remarkable healing abilities and are capable of scar-free healing. This review explores the differences observed between adult mammalian healing that typically results in fibrosis versus healing in regenerative animals that heal scarlessly. Each stage of wound healing is surveyed in depth from the perspective of many regenerative and fibrotic healers so as to identify the most important molecular and physiological variances along the way to disparate injury repair outcomes. Understanding how these powerful model systems accomplish the feat of scar-free healing may provide critical therapeutic approaches to the treatment or prevention of fibrosis.},

Though many approaches have been developed to generate desired structures in polymeric films, few of them can effectively and dynamically achieve periodic porous structures. Here, a facile way is proposed to introduce periodic stratified porous structures into polyelectrolyte films. A photo-crosslinkable polyelectrolyte film of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and photoreactive poly(acrylic acid) derivative (PAA-N 3 ) is prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly. Stratified crosslinking of the PEI/PAA-N 3 film is generated basing on standing-wave optics. The periodic stratified porous structure is constructed by forming pores in noncrosslinked regions in the film. Thanks to the dynamic mobility of polyelectrolytes, this structural controlment can be repeated several times. The size of pores corresponding to the layer spacing of the film contributes to the structural colors. Furthermore, structural color patterns are fabricated in the film by selective photo-crosslinking using photomasks. Although the large-scale structural controlment in thick (micron-scale and above) films needs to be explored further, this work highlights the periodic structural controlment in polymeric films and thus presents an approach for application potentials in sensor, detection, and ink-free printing.},

However, there is little known about the demand pattern for calcium salts and collagen needed by biomineralization. In this study, natural bone biomineralization is analyzed, and a novel interplay between calcium concentration and collagen production is observed. Any quantitative change in one of the entities causes a corresponding change in the other. Translocation-associated membrane protein 2 (TRAM2) is identified as an intermediate factor whose silencing disrupts this relationship and causes poor mineralization. TRAM2 directly interacts with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and modulates SERCA2b activity to couple calcium enrichment with collagen biosynthesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that osteoblasts can independently and directly regulate the process of biomineralization via this coupling. This knowledge has significant implications for the developmentally inspired design of biomaterials for bone regenerative applications.},

  abstract     = {Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) performance have significantly improved in the last decade (&gt;1 W cm −2 ), and is now comparable with that of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). At high current densities, issues in the catalyst layer (CL, composed of catalyst and ionomer), like oxygen transfer, water balance, and microstructural evolution, play important roles in the performance. In addition, CLs for AEMFCs have different requirements than for PEMFCs, such as chemical/physical stability, reaction mechanism, and mass transfer, because of different conductive media and pH environment. The anion exchange ionomer (AEI), which is the soluble or dispersed analogue of the anion exchange membrane (AEM), is required for hydroxide transport in the CL and is normally handled separately with the electrocatalyst during the electrode fabrication process. The importance of the AEI–catalyst interface in maximizing the utilization of electrocatalyst and fuel/oxygen transfer process must be carefully investigated. This review briefly covers new concepts in the complex AEMFC catalyst layer, before a detailed discussion on advances in CLs based on the design of AEIs and electrocatalysts. The importance of the structure–function relationship is highlighted with the aim of directing the further development of CLs for high-performance AEMFC.},

  abstract     = {As the understanding of disease grows, so does the opportunity for personalization of therapies targeted to the needs of the individual. To bring about a step change in the personalization of medical devices it is shown that multi-material inkjet-based 3D printing can meet this demand by combining functional materials, voxelated manufacturing, and algorithmic design. In this paper composite structures designed with both controlled deformation and reduced biofilm formation are manufactured using two formulations that are deposited selectively and separately. The bacterial biofilm coverage of the resulting composites is reduced by up to 75% compared to commonly used silicone rubbers, without the need for incorporating bioactives. Meanwhile, the composites can be tuned to meet user defined mechanical performance with ±10% deviation. Device manufacture is coupled to finite element modelling and a genetic algorithm that takes the user-specified mechanical deformation and computes the distribution of materials needed to meet this under given load constraints through a generative design process. Manufactured products are assessed against the mechanical and bacterial cell-instructive specifications and illustrate how multifunctional personalization can be achieved using generative design driven multi-material inkjet based 3D printing.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that threatens &gt;10 million people annually. Despite advances in TB diagnostics, patients continue to receive an insufficient diagnosis as TB symptoms are not specific. Many existing biodiagnostic tests are slow, have low clinical performance, and can be unsuitable for resource-limited settings. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a rapid, sputum-free, and cost-effective triage test for real-time detection of TB is urgently needed. This article reports on a new diagnostic pathway enabling a noninvasive, fast, and highly accurate way of detecting TB. The approach relies on TB-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are detected and quantified from the skin headspace. A specifically designed nanomaterial-based sensors array translates these findings into a point-of-care diagnosis by discriminating between active pulmonary TB patients and controls with sensitivity above 90%. This fulfills the WHO&#39;s triage test requirements and poses the potential to become a TB triage test.},

This study leverages hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for the first time to address these two issues and reports the PD-1-Ab-mediated immune responses against various stroma-rich solid malignancies. The results demonstrate that HBO promoted PD-1 Ab delivery and T cells infiltration into tumor parenchyma by depleting the extracellular matrix&#39;s main components, such as collagen and fibronectin. Furthermore, HBO disrupts hypoxia-mediated immunosuppression and helps PD-1 Ab trigger robust cytotoxic T lymphocytes and long-lasting immunological memory to inhibit tumor relapses. Such enhanced immune responses are effective in solid tumors from rodents and the cancer cells from hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The results illustrate that HBO bolsters antitumor efficacy of PD-1 Ab, and the HBO–PD-1 Ab combination is a promising stroma-rich solid tumors’ treatment in the clinic.},

However, the longevity of such implanted devices remains limited by the deterioration of their signal sensitivity over time due to acute inflammation from insertion trauma and chronic inflammation caused by the foreign body reaction. To address this challenge, a lubricated surface is fabricated to minimize friction during insertion and avoid immunogenicity during neural signal recording. Reduced friction force leads to 86% less impulse on the brain tissue, and thus immediately increases the number of measured signal electrodes by 102% upon insertion. Furthermore, the signal measurable period increases from 8 to 16 weeks due to the prevention of gliosis. By significantly reducing insertion damage and the foreign body reaction, the lubricated immune-stealthy probe surface (LIPS) can maximize the longevity of implantable BMIs.},

Here, a “Janus” digital coding metasurface with the capabilities to program various electromagnetic functions in the reflected (with R-codes) and transmitted (with T-codes) waves simultaneously is presented. Three PIN diodes are employed to design the metaparticle, and the state of the PIN diodes can be switched to change the reflected and transmitted phases independently. Three schemes achieved by the proposed programmable metasurface are provided as illustrative examples, including anomalous deflections, beam focusing, and scattering reduction in the full space. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype composed of 10 × 20 metaparticles is fabricated and the measured results are in good agreement with the designs and numerical results, validating the full-space modulations enabled by the programmable metasurface. It is expected that the new programmable metasurface can broaden the applications in stealth technologies, imaging systems, and the next generation of wireless communications.},

Based on the previous theoretical and experimental studies, the underlying 2e − ORR catalytic mechanism is firstly unveiled, in aspect of reaction pathway, thermodynamic free energy diagram, limiting potential, and volcano plots. Then, various types of efficient catalysts for producing H 2 O 2 via 2e − ORR pathway are summarized. Additionally, the catalytic active sites and factors to influence catalysts’ performance, such as electronic structure, carbon defect, functional groups (O, N, B, S, F etc.), synergistic effect, and others (pH, pore structure, steric hindrance effect, etc.) are discussed. The H 2 O 2 electrogeneration via 2e − ORR also has various potential applications in wastewater treatment, disinfection, organics degradation, and energy storage. Finally, potential future directions and prospects in 2e − ORR catalysts for electrochemically producing H 2 O 2 are examined.

To this end, a crossbar device using 2D HfSe 2 is fabricated, and then the top layers are oxidized into “high- k ” dielectric HfSe x O y via oxygen plasma treatment, so that the cell resistance can be remarkably increased. This two-terminal Ti/HfSe x O y /HfSe 2 /Au device exhibits excellent forming-free resistive switching performance with high switching speed (&lt;50 ns), low operation voltage (&lt;3 V), large switching window (10 3 ), and good data retention. Most importantly, the operation current and the power consumption reach 100 pA and 0.1 fJ to 0.1 pJ, much lower than other Hf  O based memristors.

The performance of MSCs is often restricted by its low areal energy density, which is due to the low areal mass loading of active materials. Constructing thick planar microelectrode with fine structure and high aspect ratio is an efficient way to increase mass loading, but limited by the breakable nature of porous electrode materials. Here, it is found that the mechanical and electrical properties of porous electrodes, as well as their surface area utilization and internal ion diffusion pathway, can be synergistically tuned by infilling gel electrolyte into internal pores of porous electrode films. The tuned thick porous electrode films are robust enough to enable laser ablation of three dimensional (3D) microelectrodes for high mass loading and high aspect ratio. The areal capacitance of 3D microelectrodes is able to increase linearly with mass loading (or thickness) up to at least 13 mg cm −2 (or 260 µm) for a value of up to 4640 mF cm −2 based on active carbon. The 3D MSCs deliver areal energy density of 1318 μWh cm −2 , which is comparable to the best of Li-ion 3D microbatteries while exhibiting superior electrochemical and mechanical stability.},

However, it remains to understand the fundamental interplay between the catalyst, and the electrolyte in such configuration toward CO 2 reduction performance. Herein, the dramatic influence of electrolyte alkalinity in widening potential window for CO 2 electroreduction in a flow-cell system based on SnS nanosheets is reported. The optimized SnS catalyst operated in 1 m KOH achieves a maximum formate Faradaic efficiency of 88 ± 2% at −1.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with the current density of ≈120 mA cm −2 . Alkaline electrolyte is found suppressing the hydrogen evolution across all potentials which is particularly dominant at the less negative potentials, as well as CO evolution at more negative potentials. This in turn widens the potential window for formate conversion (&gt;70% across −0.5 to −1.5 V vs RHE). A comparative study to SnO x counterpart indicates sulfur also acts to suppress hydrogen evolution, although electrolyte alkalinity resulting in a greater suppression. The boosting of the electrochemical potential window, along with high current densities in SnS derived catalytic system offers a highly attractive and promising route toward industrial-relevant electrocatalytic production of formate from CO 2 .},

Herein, an electrocatalyst containing both Ru SAs and NPs anchored on defective carbon (Ru SA+NP /DC) has been synthesized via a Ru–alginate metal–organic supramolecules conversion method. Ru SA+NP /DC exhibits low overpotentials of 16.6 and 18.8 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Notably, its mass activities are dramatically improved, which are about 1.1 and 2.4 times those of Pt/C at an overpotential of 50 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ru SAs own the most appropriate H* adsorption strength and thus, plays a dominant role for HER in acid electrolyte, while Ru NPs facilitate the dissociation of H 2 O that is the rate-determining step in alkaline electrolyte, leading to a remarkable HER activity.},

  abstract     = {Genomic amplification of OTUD7B is frequently found across human cancers. But its role in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is known to execute epigenetic regulation by forming corepressor complex with CoREST/histone deacetylases (HDACs). However, the molecular mechanisms by which cells maintain LSD1/CoREST complex integrity are unknown. Here, it is reported that LSD1 protein undergoes K63-linked polyubiquitination. OTUD7B is responsible for LSD1 deubiquitination at K226/277 residues, resulting in dynamic control of LSD1 binding partner specificity and cellular homeostasis. OTUD7B deficiency increases K63-linked ubiquitination of LSD1, which disrupts LSD1/CoREST complex formation and targets LSD1 for p62-mediated proteolysis. Consequently, OTUD7B deficiency impairs genome-wide LSD1 occupancy and enhances the methylation of H3K4/H3K9, therefore profoundly impacting global gene expression and abrogating breast cancer metastasis. Moreover, physiological fluctuation of OTUD7B modulates cell cycle-dependent LSD1 oscillation, ensuring the G1/S transition. Both OTUD7B and LSD1 proteins are overpresented in high-grade or metastatic human breast cancer, while dysregulation of either protein is associated with poor survival and metastasis. Thus, OTUD7B plays a unique partner-switching role in maintaining the integrity of LSD1/CoREST corepressor complex, LSD1 turnover, and breast cancer metastasis.},

Factors affecting cytokines quantification in biological fluids, native levels in different body fluids, sample processing and storage conditions, sensitivity to freeze-thaw, and soluble cytokine receptors are discussed. In addition, recent advances in in vitro and in vivo assays, biosensors based on different signal outputs and intracellular to extracellular protein expression are summarized. Various quantification platforms for high-sensitivity and reliable measurement of cytokines in different scenarios are discussed, and commercially available cytokine assays are compared.

Integration of these features in flexible e-skin is highly desirable; however, it is challenging to construct an e-skin to meet the requirements of practical applications. Herein, a bio-inspired multifunctional e-skin with a multilayer nanostructure based on spider web and ant tentacle is constructed, which can collect biological energy through a triboelectric nanogenerator for the simultaneous detection of pressure, humidity, and temperature. Owing to the poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanofibers spider web structure, internal bead-chain structure, and the collagen aggregate nanofibers based positive friction material, e-skin exhibits the highest pressure sensitivity (0.48 V kPa −1 ) and high detection range (0–135 kPa). Synchronously, the nanofibers imitating the antennae of ants provide e-skin with short response and recovery time (16 and 25 s, respectively) to a wide humidity range (25–85% RH). The e-skin is demonstrated to exhibit temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR = 0.0075 °C −1 ) in a range of the surrounding temperature (27–55 °C). Moreover, the natural collagen aggregate and the all-nanofibers structure ensure the biodegradability, biocompatibility, and breathability of the e-skin, showing great promise for practicability.},

In transition metal oxides, strong correlations characteristic of narrow d bands are at the origin of remarkable properties such as the opening of Mott gap, enhanced effective mass, and anomalous vibronic coupling, to mention a few. SrVO 3 with V 4+ in a 3d 1 electronic configuration is the simplest example of a 3D correlated metallic electronic system. Here, the authors&#39; focus on the observation of a (roughly) quadratic temperature dependence of the inverse electron mobility of this seemingly simple system, which is an intriguing property shared by other metallic oxides. The systematic analysis of electronic transport in SrVO 3 thin films discloses the limitations of the simplest picture of e–e correlations in a Fermi liquid (FL); instead, it is shown show that the quasi-2D topology of the Fermi surface (FS) and a strong electron–phonon coupling, contributing to dress carriers with a phonon cloud, play a pivotal role on the reported electron spectroscopic, optical, thermodynamic, and transport data. The picture that emerges is not restricted to SrVO 3 but can be shared with other 3d and 4d metallic oxides.},

However, the instability of perovskite QDs and the strong optical scattering of the thick opaque QD scintillator film imped it to realize high-quality and robust X-ray image. Herein, the europium (Eu) doped CsPbBr 3 QDs are in situ grown inside transparent amorphous matrix to form glass-ceramic (GC) scintillator with glass phase serving as both matrix and encapsulation for the perovskite QD scintillators. The small amount of Eu dopant optimizes the crystallization of CsPbBr 3 QDs and makes their distribution more uniform in the glass matrix, which can significantly reduce the light scattering and also enhance the photoluminescence emission of CsPbBr 3 QDs. As a result, a remarkably high spatial resolution of 15.0 lp mm −1 is realized thanks to the reduced light scattering, which is so far a record resolution for perovskite scintillator based X-ray imaging, and the scintillation stability is also significantly improved compared to the bare perovskite QD scintillators. Those results provide an effective platform particularly for the emerging perovskite nanocrystal scintillators to reduce light scattering and improve radiation hardness.},

The birefringence of fluorooxosulfates can be 4.8–15.5 times that of sulfates with the same metal cations while maintaining a DUV band gap. The polarizing microscope measurement confirms the birefringence enhancement by using the millimeter crystals experimentally. The theoretical studies from micro and macro levels further reveal a novel universal strategy that the fluorine induced anisotropic electronic distribution in fluorooxo–tetrahedral group is responsible for the enhancement of birefringence.

Although these vaccines are generally effective, challenges in vaccine development and access remain. A randomized, double-blind, dose escalation, placebo- and positive-controlled, phase 1/2 trial (ChiCTR1800015865) is performed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an alternative recombinant tetanus vaccine based on the Hc domain of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT-Hc) in healthy adult volunteers. The primary outcome is the safety profile of the recombinant tetanus vaccine, and immunogenicity is the secondary outcome. 150 eligible participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive one of the three doses of recombinant tetanus vaccine (TeNT-Hc 10/20/30 µg), TT vaccine, or placebo. The recombinant tetanus vaccine shows a good safety profile. The frequency of any solicited and unsolicited adverse events after each vaccination does not differ across the vaccine and placebo recipients. No serious treatment-related adverse events occur. The recombinant tetanus vaccine shows strong immune responses (seroconversion rates, geometric mean titer, and antigen-specific CD4+/CD8+ T-cell responses), which are roughly comparable to those of the TT vaccine. In conclusion, the findings from this study support that recombinant tetanus vaccine is safe and immunogenic; thereby, it represents a novel vaccine candidate against tetanus.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites are one of the promising candidates for the next-generation semiconductors due to their superlative optoelectronic properties. However, one of the limiting factors for potential applications is their chemical and structural instability in different environments. Herein, the stability of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 perovskite solar cell is explored in different atmospheres using impedance spectroscopy. An equivalent circuit model and distribution of relaxation times (DRTs) are used to effectively analyze impedance spectra. DRT is further analyzed via machine learning workflow based on the non-negative matrix factorization of reconstructed relaxation time spectra. This exploration provides the interplay of charge transport dynamics and recombination processes under environment stimuli and illumination. The results reveal that in the dark, oxygen atmosphere induces an increased hole concentration with less ionic character while ionic motion is dominant under ambient air. Under 1 Sun illumination, the environment-dependent impedance responses show a more striking effect compared with dark conditions. In this case, the increased transport resistance observed under oxygen atmosphere in equivalent circuit analysis arises due to interruption of photogenerated hole carriers. The results not only shed light on elucidating transport mechanisms of perovskite solar cells in different environments but also offer an effective interpretation of impedance responses.},

Near-infrared light-excited electron–hole pairs are effectively separated and transferred through the synergism of the internal electric field and band offset, which strongly boosts the photocatalytic eradication of MRSA biofilms by reactive oxygen species with an efficacy of 99.42% ± 0.22% in vivo. Additionally, the charge transfer endows the heterostructure with hyperthermia to assist biofilm eradication. Furthermore, CTO/RP nanofilm provides a superior biocompatible and osteoconductive platform that enables the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, thus contributing to the subsequent implant-to-bone osseointegration after eradicating MRSA biofilms.},

  abstract     = {Biomimetic strategies are useful for designing potent vaccines. Decorating a nanoparticulate adjuvant with cell membrane fragments as the antigen-presenting source exemplifies, such as a promising strategy. For translation, a standardizable, consistent, and scalable approach for coating nanoadjuvant with the cell membrane is important. Here a turbulent mixing and self-assembly method called flash nanocomplexation (FNC) for producing cell membrane-coated nanovaccines in a scalable manner is demonstrated. The broad applicability of this FNC technique compared with bulk-sonication by using ten different core materials and multiple cell membrane types is shown. FNC-produced biomimetic nanoparticles have promising colloidal stability and narrow particle polydispersity, indicating an equal or more homogeneous coating compared to the bulk-sonication method. The potency of a nanovaccine comprised of B16-F10 cancer cell membrane decorating mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the adjuvant CpG is then demonstrated. The FNC-fabricated nanovaccines when combined with anti-CTLA-4 show potency in lymph node targeting, DC antigen presentation, and T cell immune activation, leading to prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a melanoma mouse model. This study advances the design of a biomimetic nanovaccine enabled by a robust and versatile nanomanufacturing technique.},

  abstract     = {Through advances in molecular design, understanding of processing parameters, and development of non-traditional device fabrication techniques, the field of wearable and implantable skin-inspired devices is rapidly growing interest in the consumer market. Like previous technological advances, economic growth and efficiency is anticipated, as these devices will enable an augmented level of interaction between humans and the environment. However, the parallel growing electronic waste that is yet to be addressed has already left an adverse impact on the environment and human health. Looking forward, it is imperative to develop both human- and environmentally-friendly electronics, which are contingent on emerging recyclable, biodegradable, and biocompatible polymer technologies. This review provides definitions for recyclable, biodegradable, and biocompatible polymers based on reported literature, an overview of the analytical techniques used to characterize mechanical and chemical property changes, and standard policies for real-life applications. Then, various strategies in designing the next-generation of polymers to be recyclable, biodegradable, or biocompatible with enhanced functionalities relative to traditional or commercial polymers are discussed. Finally, electronics that exhibit an element of recyclability, biodegradability, or biocompatibility with new molecular design are highlighted with the anticipation of integrating emerging polymer chemistries into future electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, as part of the post-lithium-ion batteries (post-LIBs), are expected to deliver significantly higher energy densities. Their power densities, however, are today considerably worse than that of the LIBs, limiting the Li-S batteries to very few specific applications that need low power and long working time. With the rapid development of single cell components (cathode, anode, or electrolyte) in the last few years, it is expected that an integrated approach can maximize the power density without compromising the energy density in a Li-S full cell. Here, this goal is achieved by using a novel biomass porous carbon matrix (PCM) in the anode, as well as N-Co 9 S 8 nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the cathode. The authors&#39; approach unlocks the potential of the electrodes and enables the Li-S full pouch cells with unprecedented power densities and energy densities (325 Wh kg −1 and 1412 W kg −1 , respectively). This work addresses the problem of low power densities in the current Li-S technology, thus making the Li-S batteries a strong candidate in more application scenarios.},

Based on a two-component combination of an l -glutamine amide derivative and benzaldehyde, this gel has very soft rheological properties and self-healing characteristics. It is demonstrated that the gel can be formulated to encapsulate l- DOPA. These drug-loaded gels are characterized, and rapid release of the drug is obtained from the gel network. This drug-loaded hydrogel has appropriate rheological characteristics to be amenable for injection. This system is therefore tested as a vehicle for nasal delivery of neurologically-active drugs—a drug delivery strategy that can potentially avoid first pass liver metabolism and bypass the blood–brain barrier, hence enhancing brain uptake. In vitro tests indicate that the gel has biocompatibility with respect to nasal epithelial cells. Furthermore, animal studies demonstrate that the nasal delivery of a gel loaded with 3 H-labeled l- DOPA out-performed a simple intranasal l- DOPA solution. This is attributed to longer residence times of the gel in the nasal cavity resulting in increased blood and brain concentrations. It is demonstrated that the likely routes of brain penetration of intranasally-delivered l- DOPA gel involve the trigeminal and olfactory nerves connecting to other brain regions.},

  abstract     = {The impressive locomotion and manipulation capabilities of spiders have led to a host of bioinspired robotic designs aiming to reproduce their functionalities; however, current actuation mechanisms are deficient in either speed, force output, displacement, or efficiency. Here—using inspiration from the hydraulic mechanism used in spider legs—soft-actuated joints are developed that use electrostatic forces to locally pressurize a hydraulic fluid, and cause flexion of a segmented structure. The result is a lightweight, low-profile articulating mechanism capable of fast operation, high forces, and large displacement; these devices are termed spider-inspired electrohydraulic soft-actuated (SES) joints. SES joints with rotation angles up to 70°, blocked torques up to 70 mN m, and specific torques up to 21 N m kg −1 are demonstrated. SES joints demonstrate high speed operation, with measured roll-off frequencies up to 24 Hz and specific power as high as 230 W kg −1 —similar to human muscle. The versatility of these devices is illustrated by combining SES joints to create a bidirectional joint, an artificial limb with independently addressable joints, and a compliant gripper. The lightweight, low-profile design, and high performance of these devices, makes them well-suited toward the development of articulating robotic systems that can rapidly maneuver.},

  abstract     = {Developing flexible electrodes with high active materials loading and excellent mechanical stability is of importance to flexible electronics, yet remains challenging. Herein, robust flexible electrodes with an encapsulated core-multishell structure are developed via a spraying-hydrothermal process. The multilayer electrode possesses an architecture of substrate/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/bimetallic complex/rGO/bimetallic complex/rGO from the inside to the outside, where the cellulosic fibers serve as the substrate, namely, the core; and the multiple layers of rGO and bimetallic complex, are used as active materials, namely, the shells. The inner two rGO interlayers function as the cement that chemically bind to two adjacent layers, while the two outer rGO layers encapsulate the inside structure effectively protecting the electrode from materials detachment or electrolyte corrosion. The electrodes with a unique core-multishell structure exhibit excellent cycle stability and exceptional temperature tolerance (−25 to 40 °C) for lithium and sodium storage. A combination of experimental and theoretical investigations are carried out to gain insights into the synergetic effects of cobalt-molybdenum-sulfide (CMS) materials (the bimetallic complex), which will provide guidance for future exploration of bimetallic sulfides. This strategy is further demonstrated in other substrates, showing general applicability and great potential in the development of flexible energy storage devices.},

  abstract     = {Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) feature excellent device performance and device stability. However, they are facing problems when the amine-rich polyelectrolytes are used as cathode interfacial layers. In this work, a small molecule, ethanedithiol (EDT) at the polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/active layer interface is inserted for mitigating the undesirable reaction between amine-rich groups and electron-acceptor moieties in NFA. The main role of EDT is to passivate the PEIE surface and prevent electron flow to NFA and the unwanted reaction can be mitigated. It improves the performance of OPV devices by reducing the work function, decreasing trap-assisted recombination, and improving electron-mobility. As a result, the flexible device with the PEIE interfacial layer with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.20% can be improved to 10.11% after the inclusion of EDT. Moreover, EDT-modified device can retain 98.18% after it is bent for 200 cycles and can maintain 80.83% of its initial PCE under continuous light illuminated in ambient conditions without any encapsulation. Based on these findings, the proposed strategy constitutes a crucial step toward highly efficient flexible OPVs.},

  abstract     = {Low-dimensional hybrid metal halides are emerging as a highly promising class of single-component white-emitting materials for their unique broadband emission from self-trapped excitons (STEs). Despite substantial progress in the development of these metal halides, many challenges remain to be addressed to obtain a better fundamental understanding of the structure–property relationship and realize the full potentials of this class of materials. Here, via pressure regulation, a near 100% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of broadband emission is achieved in a corrugated 1D hybrid metal halide C 5 N 2 H 16 Pb 2 Br 6 , which possesses a highly distorted structure with an initial PLQY of 10%. Compression reduces the overlap between STE states and ground state, leading to a suppressed phonon-assisted non-radiative decay. The PL evolution is systematically demonstrated to be controlled by the pressure-regulated exciton–phonon coupling which can be quantified using Huang–Rhys factor S . Detailed studies of the S -PLQY relation for a series of 1D hybrid metal halides (C 5 N 2 H 16 Pb 2 Br 6 , C 4 N 2 H 14 PbBr 4 , C 6 N 2 H 16 PbBr 4 , and (C 6 N 2 H 16 ) 3 Pb 2 Br 10 ) reveal a quantitative structure–property relationship that regulating S factor toward 28 leads to the maximum emission.},

However, to date, there are rather limited long-term implantable materials owning to in situ molding incapability of metallics and poor mechanical property of nonmetallics. Here, Bi-based low melting point alloy, with unique properties of injectability, solid-liquid phase transition, mechanical capability, and biocompatibility, present obvious long-lasting bone affinity as the excellent artificial bone-substitute. It is particularly necessary to point out that the targeted injected Bi alloy remains in its original position for up to 210 days without moving, as well as, displays good osseointegration ability to resolve repeated revision trauma caused by losing bone repair material. Additionally, with outstanding electrical and thermal conductivity, an unconventional way using Bi alloy to realize very beneficial hyperthermia analgesia via non-invasive wireless energy delivery is first proposed, which avoids adverse effects on bone remodeling inflicted by traditional drugs. The significantly decreased expression of pain sensitizing factor, such as, interleukin-6, neuropeptide substance, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 reveals the potential mechanism of hyperthermia analgesia. The present findings suggest the combination therapy of Bi alloy in bone repair and analgesia, which owns far-reaching clinical application value.},

  abstract     = {An ideal tumor treatment is supposed to eliminate the primary tumor and simultaneously trigger the host antitumor immune responses to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis. Herein, a liposome encapsulating phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3K γ ) inhibitor IPI-549 and photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), denoted by LIC, is prepared for colon cancer treatment. LIC internalized into CT26 cells generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) under laser irradiation to cause immunogenic tumor cell death, during which immunostimulatory signals such as calreticulin are released to further induce T lymphocyte-mediated tumor cell killing. Meanwhile, IPI-549 transported by liposome can inhibit PI3K γ in the myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), resulting in downregulation of arginase 1 (Arg-1) and ROS to promote MDSCs apoptosis and reduce their immunosuppressive activity to CD8 + T cells. LIC-mediated immunogenic photodynamic therapy synergizes with MDSCs-targeting immunotherapy, which significantly inhibits tumor growth via facilitating the dendritic cell maturation and tumor infiltration of CD8 + T cells while decreasing the tumor infiltration of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, MDSCs, and M2-like tumor-associated macrophages. Moreover, the synergistic therapy increases the number of effector memory T cells (T EM ) in spleen, which suggests a favorable immune memory to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis. The Ce6 and IPI-549-coloaded multifunctional nanodrug demonstrates high efficacy in colon cancer treatment.},

  abstract     = {Switchable wetting and optical properties on a surface is synergistically realized by mechanical or temperature stimulus. Unfortunately, in situ controllable wettability together with programmable transparency on 2D/3D surfaces is rarely explored. Herein, Joule-heat-responsive paraffin-impregnated slippery surface (JR-PISS) is reported by the incorporation of lubricant paraffin, superhydrophobic micropillar-arrayed elastomeric membrane, and embedded transparent silver nanowire thin-film heater. Owing to its good flexibility, in situ controllable locomotion for diverse liquids on planar/curved JR-PISS is unfolded by alternately applying/discharging low electric-trigger of 6 V. Simultaneously, optical visibility can be reversibly converted between opaque and transparent modes. The switching principle is that in the presence of Joule-heat, solid paraffin would be melt and swell within 20 s to enable a slippery surface for decreasing light scattering and frictional force derived from contact angle hysteresis ( F CAH ). Once Joule-heat is discharged, undulating rough surface would reconfigure by cold-shrinkage of paraffin within 8 s to render light blockage and high F CAH . Upon its portable merit, in situ thermal management, programmable visibility, as well as steering functionalized droplets by electric-activated JR-PISSs are successfully deployed. Compared with previous Nepenthes-inspired slippery surfaces, the current JR-PISS is more competent for in situ harnessing optical and wetting properties on-demand.},

The remarkably increased electroactive surface area and the superior lithiophilic Ag seeds enable Li stripping/plating mainly inside the ditches. Benefitting from such unique structural design, the ditches-patterned and Ag-modified composite Li anode (D-Ag@Li) achieves excellent cyclability under 2 mA cm −2 / 4 mAh cm −2 over 360 h cycling with low nucleation overpotential of 16 mV.

Here, Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) is identified as novel factor for organ regeneration using combined transcription-factor-induced reprogramming and RNA-interference techniques. Loss of Dkk3 enhances the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells but does not affect de novo derivation of embryonic stem cells, three-germ-layer differentiation or colony formation capacity of liver and pancreatic organoids. However, DKK3 expression levels in wildtype animals and serum levels in human patients are elevated upon injury. Accordingly, Dkk3 -null mice display less liver damage upon acute and chronic failure mediated by increased proliferation in hepatocytes and LGR5 + liver progenitor cell population, respectively. Similarly, recovery from experimental pancreatitis is accelerated. Regeneration onset occurs in the acinar compartment accompanied by virtually abolished canonical-Wnt-signaling in Dkk3 -null animals. This results in reduced expression of the Hedgehog repressor Gli3 and increased Hedgehog-signaling activity upon Dkk3 loss. Collectively, these data reveal Dkk3 as a key regulator of organ regeneration via a direct, previously unacknowledged link between DKK3, canonical-Wnt-, and Hedgehog-signaling.},

These MOF derived nanocomposites offer symbiosis of properties like high crystallinities, inherited morphologies, controllable dimensions, and tunable textural properties. Particularly, adjustable energy band positions achieved by in situ tailored self/external doping and controllable surface functionalities make these nanocomposites promising photocatalysts. Despite some progress in this field, fundamental questions remain to be addressed to further understand the relationship between the structures, properties, and photocatalytic performance of nanocomposites. In this review, different synthesis approaches including self-template and external-template methods to produce MOF derived nanocomposites with various dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, or 3D), morphologies, chemical compositions, energy bandgaps, and surface functionalities are comprehensively summarized and analyzed. The state-of-the-art progress in the applications of MOF derived nanocomposites in photocatalytic water splitting for H 2 generation, photodegradation of organic pollutants, and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are systemically reviewed. The relationships between the nanocomposite properties and their photocatalytic performance are highlighted, and the perspectives of MOF derived nanocomposites for photocatalytic applications are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Organometallic two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets with tailorable components have recently fascinated the optoelectronic communities due to their solution-processable nature. However, the poor stability of organic molecules may hinder their practical application in photovoltaic devices. Instead of conventional organometallic 2D nanosheets with low weatherability, an air-stable π -conjugated 2D bis(dithiolene)iron(II) (FeBHT) coordination nanosheet (CONASH) is synthesized via bottom-up liquid/liquid interfacial polymerization using benzenehexathiol (BHT) and iron(II) ammonium sulfate [Fe(NH 4 ) 2 (SO 4 ) 2 ] as precursors. The uncoordinated thiol groups in FeBHT are easily oxidized, but the Fe(NH 4 ) 2 (SO 4 ) 2 dissociation rate is slow, which facilitates the protection of sulfur groups by iron(II) ions. The density functional theory calculates that the resultant FeBHT network gains the oxygen-repelling function for oxidation suppression. In air, the FeBHT CONASH exhibits self-powered photoresponses with short response times (&lt;40 ms) and a spectral responsivity of 6.57 mA W −1 , a specific detectivity of 3.13 × 10 11 Jones and an external quantum efficiency of 2.23% under 365 nm illumination. Interestingly, the FeBHT self-powered photodetector reveals extremely high long-term air stability, maintaining over 94% of its initial photocurrent after aging for 60 days without encapsulation. These results open the prospect of using organometallic 2D materials in commercialized optoelectronic fields.},

The single-junction-cell power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs to date has reached up to 25.2%, which is competitive to that of commercial silicon-based solar cells. Currently, solar cells are considered as the individual devices for energy conversion, while a series connection with an energy storage device would largely undermine the energy utilization efficiency and peak power output of the entire system. For substantially addressing such critical issue, advanced technology based on photovoltaic energy conversion–storage integration appears as a promising strategy to achieve the goal. However, there are still great challenges in integrating and engineering between energy harvesting and storage devices. In this review, the state-of-the-art of representative integrated energy conversion–storage systems is initially summarized. The key parameters including configuration design and integration strategies are subsequently analyzed. According to recent progress, the efforts toward addressing the current challenges and critical issues are highlighted, with expectation of achieving practical integrated energy conversion–storage systems in the future.},

  abstract     = {Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged as a severe opportunistic pathogen with multiple drug resistances. Finding effective vaccines against this pathogen is urgent. Although O-polysaccharides (OPS) of K. pneumoniae are suitable antigens for the preparation of vaccines given their low levels of diversity, the low immunogenicity (especially serotype O2) limit their application. In this study, a general Escherichia coli host system is developed to produce a nanoscale conjugate vaccine against K. pneumoniae using the Nano-B5 self-assembly platform. The experimental data illustrate that this nanoconjugate vaccine can induce an efficient humoral immune response in draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and elicit high titers of the IgG antibody against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The ideal prophylactic effects of these nanoconjugate vaccines are further demonstrated in mouse models of both systemic and pulmonary infection. These results demonstrate that OPS with low immunogenicity can be changed into an effective antigen, indicating that other haptens may be applicable to this strategy in the future. To the knowledge, this is the first study to produce biosynthetic nanoconjugate vaccines against K. pneumoniae in E. coli , and this strategy can be applied to the development of other vaccines against pathogenic bacteria.},

  abstract     = {The potential of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for applications in optoelectronics results from a unique combination of interesting photophysical properties and straightforward tunability of organic and inorganic units. Here, it is demonstrated that using MOF approach chromophores can be assembled into well-ordered 1D arrays using metal-oxo strands as lead structure, and the resulting porphyrinic rows exhibit unique photophysical properties and allow the realization of highly sensitive photodetectors. A porphyrinic MOF thin film, In-TCPP surface-coordinated MOF thin films with [021] orientation is fabricated using a layer-by-layer method, from In(NO 3 ) 3 and TCPP (5,10,15,20-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin). Detailed experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that the assembly yields a structure where In-oxo strands running parallel to the substrate fix the chromophoric linkers to yield 1D arrays of porphyrins. The frontier orbitals of this highly anisotropic arrangement are localized in these columnar arrangements of porphyrins and result in high photoactivity, which is exploited to fabricate a photodetector with record (as compared to other organic materials) responsivity in visible regime of 7.28 × 10 14 Jones and short rise/fall times (0.07/0.04 s). This oriented MOF thin film-based high-sensitive photodetector provides a new avenue to use inorganic, stable lead structures to assemble organic semiconductors into regular arrays, thus creating a huge potential for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.},

CuI can form thin films with high transparency in the visible light region using various low-temperature deposition techniques. This progress report aims to provide a basic understanding of CuI-based materials and recent progress in the development of various devices. The first section provides a brief introduction to CuI with respect to electronic structure, defect states, charge transport physics, and overviews the CuI film deposition methods. The material design concepts through doping/alloying approaches to adjust the optoelectrical properties are also discussed in the first section.

These changes of molecular electronic states are induced by protonation, aggregation, intramolecular structural changes, and other processes, depending on the surface environment. Intramolecular structural changes, such as co-planarization and decreased molecular motion are the most characteristic and interesting behavior of dye molecules at the surfaces, resulting in spectral shift and/or emission enhancement. In this review, adsorchromism at the surfaces of layered materials are summarized since their flexibility of interlayer distance, surface flatness, and transparency is suitable for a detailed observation. By understanding the relationship between adsorchromism and the electronic states of molecules on the surfaces, it will be possible to induce some desired functions which can be realized simply by adsorption, instead of complicated organic syntheses. Thus, adsorchromism has potential applications such as effective solar energy harvesting systems, or biological/chemical sensors to visualize environmental changes.},

  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has long been recognized to be a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, the high oxygen dependency of conventional PDT dramatically impairs its overall therapeutic efficacy, especially in hypoxic solid tumors. Exploration of distinctive PDT strategy involving both high-performance less-oxygen-dependent photosensitizers (PSs) and prominent drug delivery system is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, a precise nuclear targeting PDT protocol based on type-I PSs with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics is fabricated for the first time. Of the two synthesized AIE PSs, TTFMN is demonstrated to exhibit superior AIE property and stronger type-I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency owing to the introduction of tetraphenylethylene and smaller singlet–triplet energy gap, respectively. With the aid of a lysosomal acid-activated TAT-peptide-modified amphiphilic polymer poly(lactic acid)12k–poly(ethylene glycol)5k–succinic anhydride-modified TAT, the corresponding TTFMN-loaded nanoparticles accompanied with acid-triggered nuclear targeting peculiarity can quickly accumulate in the tumor site, effectively generate type-I ROS in the nuclear region and significantly suppress the tumor growth under white light irradiation with minimized systematic toxicity. This delicate “Good Steel Used in the Blade” tactic significantly maximizes the PDT efficacy and offers a conceptual while practical paradigm for optimized cancer treatment in further translational medicine.},

Herein, a two dimensional (2D) nanosheet ammonium cobalt phosphate hydrate (NH 4 CoPO 4 ·H 2 O) catalyst based on the earth-abundant non-noble metal is reported. When used for the challenging alkaline saline water electrolysis, the NH 4 CoPO 4 ·H 2 O catalyst with the optimal thickness of 30 nm achieves current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm −2 at the record low overpotentials of 252 and 268 mV, respectively, while maintaining remarkable stability during the alkaline saline water oxidation at room temperature. X-ray absorption fine spectra reveal that the activation of Co (II) ions (in NH 4 CoPO 4 ·H 2 O) to Co (III) species constructs the electrocatalytic active sites. The 2D nanosheet morphology of NH 4 CoPO 4 ·H 2 O provides a larger active surface area and more surface-exposed active sites, which enable the nanosheet catalyst to facilitate the alkaline freshwater and simulated seawater oxidation with excellent activity. The facile and environmentally-benign H 2 O-mediated synthesis route under mild condition makes NH 4 CoPO 4 ·H 2 O catalyst highly feasible for practical manufacturing. In comparison with noble metals, this novel electrocatalyst offers a cost-effective alternative for economic saline water oxidation to advance water electrolysis technology.},

However, the origin of such an enhancement has remained unclear owing to a lack of cases exhibiting definite improvements in charge carrier mobility, and the limited knowledge concerning the underlying mechanism thereof. In this study, the morphological changes and internal nanostructures of polymer blends based on various SP types with different intermolecular interactions in an insulating polystyrene matrix are investigated. Through this investigation, the physical confinement of donor–acceptor type SP chains in a continuous nanoscale network structure surrounded by polystyrenes is shown to induce structural ordering with more straight edge-on stacked SP chains.

In this study, fine CaO 2 nanoparticles with Cu–ferrocene molecules at the surface (CaO 2 /Cu–ferrocene) are successfully designed and synthesized. Under an acidic condition, the particles release Ca 2+ ions and H 2 O 2 in a rapid fashion, while they can remain stable in neutral. In addition, agitated production of • OH occurs following the Fenton reaction of H 2 O 2 and ferrocene molecules, and GSH is consumed by Cu 2+ ions to avoid the potential • OH consumption. More interestingly, in addition to the exogenous Ca 2+ released by the particles, the enhanced • OH production facilitates intracellular calcium accumulation by regulating Ca 2+ channels and pumps of tumor cells. It turns out that promoted • OH induction and intracellular calcium overload enable significant in vitro and in vivo antitumor phenomena.},

By leveraging the IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) analytics, a digital-twin-based virtual shop is successfully implemented to provide the users with real-time feedback about the details of the product. In general, by offering a more immersive experience in human–machine interactions, the proposed remote interactive system shows the great potential of being the advanced human–machine interface for the applications of the unmanned working space.},

Nonetheless, O 2 gradients present in 3D engineered platforms result in diverse cell behavior across the O 2 gradient, making it difficult to identify and study O 2 sensitive signaling pathways. Using a layer-by-layer assembled O 2 -controllable hydrogel, the authors precisely control O 2 concentrations and study uniform cell behavior in discretized O 2 gradients, then recapitulate the dynamics of cluster-based vasculogenesis, one mechanism for neovessel formation, and show distinctive gene expression patterns remarkably correlate to O 2 concentrations. Using RNA sequencing, it is found that time-dependent regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling enables cell survival and clustering in the high stress microenvironments. Various extracellular matrix modulators orchestrate hypoxia-driven endothelial cell clustering. Finally, clustering is facilitated by regulators of cell–cell interactions, mainly vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. Taken together, novel regulators of hypoxic cluster-based vasculogenesis are identified, and evidence for the utility of a unique platform is provided to study dynamic cellular responses to 3D hypoxic environments, with broad applicability in development, regeneration, and disease.},

  abstract     = {Design of new nanoplatforms that integrates multiple imaging and therapeutic components for precision cancer nanomedicine remains to be challenging. Here, a facile strategy is reported to prepare polydopamine (PDA)-coated molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanoflakes as a nanocarrier to load dual drug cisplatin (Pt) and 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT) for precision tumor theranostics. Preformed MoS 2 nanoflakes are coated with PDA, modified with methoxy-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-amine, and loaded with 1-MT and Pt. The formed functional 1-MT-Pt-PPDA@MoS 2 (the second P stands for PEG) complexes exhibit good colloidal stability and photothermal conversion efficiency (47.9%), dual pH-, and photothermal-sensitive drug release profile, and multimodal thermal, computed tomography and photoacoustic imaging capability. Due to the respective components of Pt, MoS 2 , and 1-MT that can block the immune checkpoint associated to tumoral indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-induced tryptophan metabolism, tri-mode chemo-photothermo-immunotherapy of tumors can be realized. In particular, under the near infrared laser irradiation, fast release of both drugs can be facilitated to achieve cooperative tumor therapy effect, and the combined immunogenic cell death induced by the dual-mode chemo-photothermo treatment and the 1-MT-induced immune checkpoint blockade can boost enhanced antitumor immune response to generate significant cytotoxic T cells for tumor killing. The developed 1-MT-Pt-PPDA@MoS 2 complexes may be used as an intelligent nanoplatform for cooperative precision imaging-guided combinational tumor therapy.},

These materials are useful to investigate light transport phenomena and for applications in imaging, sensing and energy storage. While coherent light can be generated using such materials, its directional emission is typically hampered by their strong scattering nature. Here, the authors directly image Rayleigh scattering, photoluminescence and weakly localized Raman light from a random network of silicon nanowires via real-space microscopy and Fourier imaging. Direct imaging enables us to gain insight on the light transport mechanisms in the random material, to visualize its weak localization length and to demonstrate out-of-plane beaming of the scattered coherent Raman light. The direct visualization of coherent light beaming in such random networks of silicon nanowires offers novel opportunities for fundamental studies of light propagation in disordered media. It also opens venues for the development of next generation optical devices based on disordered structures, such as sensors, light sources, and optical switches.},

However, the widespread use of polarimetric sensors is still limited by high noise, narrow photoresponse range, and low linearly dichroic ratio. Recently, the low-dimensional materials with intrinsic in-plane anisotropy structure exhibit the great potential to realize direct polarized photodetection. Here, strong anisotropy of 1D layered bismuth sulfide (Bi 2 S 3 ) is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically. The Bi 2 S 3 photodetector exhibits excellent device performance, which enables high photoresponsivity (32 A W −1 ), I on / I off ratio (1.08 × 10 4 ), robust linearly dichroic ratio (1.9), and Hooge parameter (2.0 × 10 −5 at 1 Hz) which refer to lower noise than most reported low-dimensional materials-based devices. Impressively, such Bi 2 S 3 nanowire exhibits a good broadband photoresponse, ranging from ultraviolet (360 nm) to short-wave infrared (1064 nm). Direct polarimetric imaging is implemented at the wavelengths of 532 and 808 nm. With these remarkable features, the 1D Bi 2 S 3 nanowires show great potential for direct dual-band polarimetric image sensors without using any external optical polarizer.},

Temperature-dependent normalized differential conductance analyses indicate the participation of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) at large negative bias, which follows typical thermally activated hopping behavior associated with the normal Marcus regime. In contrast, hopping involving the HOMO dominates the mechanism of charge transport at positive bias, yet it is nearly activationless indicating the junction operates in the inverted Marcus region. Thus, within the same junction it is possible to switch between Marcus and inverted Marcus regimes by changing the bias polarity. Consequently, the current only decreases with decreasing temperature at negative bias when hopping is “frozen out,” but not at positive bias resulting in a 30-fold increase in the molecular rectification efficiency. These results indicate that the charge transport in the inverted Marcus region is readily accessible in junctions with redox molecules in the weak coupling regime and control over different hopping regimes can be used to improve junction performance.},

Transcranial-magnetic, ultrasound, and alternating/direct current (AC/DC) stimulation are some available means of spatiotemporal controlled neuromodulation. There is also light-mediated control, such as optogenetics, which has revolutionized neuroscience research, yet its clinical translation is hampered by the need for gene manipulation. As a drug-based light-mediated control, the effect of a photoswitchable muscarinic agonist (Phthalimide-Azo-Iper (PAI)) on a brain network is evaluated in this study. First, the conditions to manipulate M2 muscarinic receptors with light in the experimental setup are determined. Next, physiological synchronous emergent cortical activity consisting of slow oscillations—as in slow wave sleep—is transformed into a higher frequency pattern in the cerebral cortex, both in vitro and in vivo, as a consequence of PAI activation with light. These results open the way to study cholinergic neuromodulation and to control spatiotemporal patterns of activity in different brain states, their transitions, and their links to cognition and behavior. The approach can be applied to different organisms and does not require genetic manipulation, which would make it translational to humans.},

  abstract     = {Regulatory T cells play a key role in immune tolerance to self-antigens, thereby preventing autoimmune diseases. However, no drugs targeting Treg cells have been approved for clinical trials yet. Here, a chimeric peptide is generated by conjugation of the cytoplasmic domain of CTLA-4 (ctCTLA-4) with dNP2 for intracellular delivery, dNP2-ctCTLA-4, and evaluated Foxp3 expression during Th0, Th1, Treg, and Th17 differentiation dependent on TGF- β . The lysine motif of ctCTLA-4, not tyrosine motif, is required for Foxp3 expression for Treg induction and amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Transcriptome analysis reveals that dNP2-ctCTLA-4-treated T cells express Treg transcriptomic patterns with properties of suppressive functions. In addition, the molecular interaction between the lysine motif of ctCTLA-4 and PKC- η is critical for Foxp3 expression. Although both CTLA-4-Ig and dNP2-ctCTLA-4 treatment in vivo ameliorated EAE progression, only dNP2-ctCTLA-4 requires Treg cells for inhibition of disease progression and prevention of relapse. Furthermore, the CTLA-4 signaling peptide is able to induce human Tregs in vitro and in vivo as well as from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of multiple sclerosis patients. These results collectively suggest that the chimeric CTLA-4 signaling peptide can be used for successful induction of regulatory T cells in vivo to control autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.},

Intercalation pseudocapacitive hydrated vanadium oxide Mn 1.4 V 10 O 24 ·12H 2 O with defective crystal structure, interlayer water, and large interlayer distance has been prepared by a spontaneous chemical synthesis method. The inserted Mn 2+ forms coordination bonds with the oxygen of the host material and strengthens the interaction between the layers, preventing damage to the structure. Combined with the experimental data and DFT calculation, it is found that Mn 2+ refines the structure stability, adjusts the electronic structure, and improves the conductivity of hydrated vanadium oxide. Also, Mn 2+ changes the migration path of Zn 2+ , reduces the migration barrier, and improves the rate performance. Therefore, Mn 2+ -inserted hydrated vanadium oxide electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 456 mAh g −1 at 0.2 A g –1 , 173 mAh g –1 at 40 A g –1 , and a capacity retention of 80% over 5000 cycles at 10 A g –1 .

Injection of triamcinolone acetonide (TA), an anti-inflammatory steroid drug, directly into the dermis of diseased skin using needle-syringe systems is a long-established procedure for treating recalcitrant lichenified lesions of CISDs, referred to as TA intralesional injection (TAILI). However, TAILI causes severe pain, causing patients to be stressed and reluctant to undergo treatment. Furthermore, the practitioner dependency on the amount and depth of the injected TA makes it difficult to predict the prognosis. Here, candle flame (“candlelit”)-shaped TA-loaded dissolving microneedles (Candlelit-DMN) are designed and fabricated out of biocompatible and biodegradable molecules. Candlelit-DMN distributes TA evenly across human skin tissue. Conjoined with the applicator, Candlelit-DMN is efficiently inserted into human skin in a standardized manner, enabling TA to be delivered within the target layer. In an in vivo skin inflammation mouse model, Candlelit-DMN inserted with the applicator effectively alleviates inflammation by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine gene expression, to the same extent as TAILI. This Candlelit-DMN with the applicator arouses the interest of dermatologists, who prefer it to the current TAILI procedure.},

  abstract     = {Chromosomal translocation results in development of an Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-Friend leukemia integration 1 ( EWS–FLI1 ) fusion oncogene in the majority of Ewing sarcoma. The persistent dependence of the tumor for this oncoprotein points to EWS–FLI1 as an ideal drug target. Although EWS–FLI1 transcriptional targets and binding partners are evaluated, the mechanisms regulating EWS–FLI1 protein stability remain elusive. Speckle-type POZ protein ( SPOP ) and OTU domain-containing protein 7A ( OTUD7A ) are identified as the bona fide E3 ligase and deubiquitinase, respectively, that control EWS–FLI1 protein turnover in Ewing sarcoma. Casein kinase 1 -mediated phosphorylation of the VTSSS degron in the FLI1 domain enhances SPOP activity to degrade EWS–FLI1 . Opposing this process, OTUD7A deubiquitinates and stabilizes EWS–FLI1 . Depletion of OTUD7A in Ewing sarcoma cell lines reduces EWS–FLI1 protein abundance and impedes Ewing sarcoma growth in vitro and in mice. Performing an artificial-intelligence-based virtual drug screen of a 4-million small molecule library, 7Ai is identified as a potential OTUD7A catalytic inhibitor. 7Ai reduces EWS–FLI1 protein levels and decreases Ewing sarcoma growth in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. This study supports the therapeutic targeting of OTUD7A as a novel strategy for Ewing sarcoma bearing EWS–FLI1 and related fusions, and may also be applicable to other cancers dependent on aberrant FLI1 expression.},

  abstract     = {Electrically insulating polymers are indispensable for electronic and energy applications, but their poor thermal conduction has increasingly become a bottleneck for high-performance devices. Highly drawn low-dimensional polymeric fibers and thin films can exhibit metallic conductivity. Extending this to bulk materials required by real world applications is prohibitive due to the additional interfacial thermal conduction barriers. It is demonstrated that highly aligned ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene microfibers can be incorporated into a silicone matrix to yield a fully organic bulk polymer composite with a continuous vertical phonon pathway. This leads to a perpendicular thermal conductivity of 38.27 W m −1 K −1 , at par with metals and two orders of magnitude higher than other bulk organic polymers. Taking further advantage of the mechanical flexibility of the microfibers, the processing method offers the freedom to tailor heat transfer pathways in a macroscopic 3D space. The material/process opens up opportunities for efficient thermal management in high-performance devices.},

  abstract     = {The trimethylation on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3k27me3), a transcriptionally repressive epigenetic mark of permissive chromatin, can be removed by the histone lysine demethylase 6a (Kdm6a). However, the physiological function of H3k27me3 and Kdm6a on circadian genes remains largely elusive. With the ChIP-Seq and mRNA microarray assays, a critical role is identified for Kdm6a in the regulation of H3k27me3 to impact the expression of Crytochrome 1 (Cry1) in the hypothalamus of diet induced obesity mice. More importantly, both conditional knockout and pharmacological inhibition of Kdm6a reduce body weight and stabilize blood glucose homeostasis. Although a Kdm6a inhibitor fails to decrease body weight in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, it significantly decreases Cry1 expression, enhances sensitivity to exogenous leptin administration, and blocks body weight increases in endo-leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Moreover, gene analysis of the human hypothalamus further reveals a positive correlation between Kdm6a and Cry1. The results show that inhibition of Kdm6a reduces the Cry1 expression and sensitizes leptin signaling to combat obesity-related disease. Therefore, it implicates Kdm6a as an attractive drug target for obesity and metabolic disorders.},

  abstract     = {Malaria remains the most important mosquito-borne infectious disease worldwide, with 229 million new cases and 409.000 deaths in 2019. The infection is caused by a protozoan parasite which attacks red blood cells by feeding on hemoglobin and transforming it into hemozoin. Despite the WHO recommendation of prompt malaria diagnosis, the quality of microscopy-based diagnosis is frequently inadequate while rapid diagnostic tests based on antigens are not quantitative and still affected by non-negligible false negative/positive results. PCR-based methods are highly performant but still not widely used in endemic areas. Here, a diagnostic tool (TMek), based on the paramagnetic properties of hemozoin nanocrystals in infected red blood cells (i-RBCs), is reported on. Exploiting the competition between gravity and magnetic forces, i-RBCs in a whole blood specimen are sorted and electrically detected in a microchip. The amplitude and time evolution of the electrical signal allow for the quantification of i-RBCs (in the range 10–10 5 i-RBC µL −1 ) and the distinction of the infection stage. A preliminary validation study on 75 patients with clinical suspect of malaria shows on-field operability, without false negative and a few false positive results. These findings indicate the potential of TMek as a quantitative, stage-selective, rapid test for malaria.},

  abstract     = {The origin of 2D electron gas (2DEG) at LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 (LAO/STO) interfaces has remained highly controversial since its discovery. Various models are proposed, which include electronic reconstruction via surface-to-interface charge transfer and defect-mediated doping involving cation intermixing or oxygen vacancy ( V O ) formation. It is shown that the polar field-assisted V O formation at the LAO/STO surface plays critical roles in the 2DEG formation and concurrent structural transition. Comprehensive scanning transmission electron microscopy analyses, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, demonstrate that V O forming at the LAO/STO surface above the critical thickness ( t c ) cancels the polar field by doping the interface with 2DEG. The antiferrodistortive (AFD) octahedral rotations in LAO, which are suppressed below the t c , evolve with the formation of V O above the t c . The present study reveals that local symmetry breaking and shallow donor behavior of V O induce the AFD rotations and relieve the electrical field by electron doping the oxide heterointerface.},

A new network-based systems biology approach, XDeath, is developed to detect crosstalk of signaling pathways associated with PCa progression. This unique integrated network merges gene causal regulation networks and protein-protein interactions to identify novel co-targets for PCa treatment. The results show that polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3a)-related signaling pathways are robustly enhanced during PCa progression and together they regulate autophagy as a common death mode. Mechanistically, it is shown that Plk1 phosphorylation of DNMT3a leads to its degradation in mitosis and that DNMT3a represses Plk1 transcription to inhibit autophagy in interphase, suggesting a negative feedback loop between these two proteins. Finally, a combination of the DNMT inhibitor 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) with inhibition of Plk1 suppresses PCa synergistically.},

  abstract     = {Proinflammatory (M1) macrophages play a vital role in antitumor immunity, and regulation of proinflammatory macrophage polarization is critical for immunotherapy. The polarization of macrophages can be regulated by biological or chemical stimulation, but investigations of the regulatory effect of physical stimulation are limited. Herein, regulating macrophage polarization with localized electrical signals derived from a piezoelectric β -phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) ( β -PVDF) film in a wireless mode is proposed. Charges released on the surface of the β -PVDF film driven by ultrasonic irradiation can significantly enhance the M1 polarization of macrophages. Mechanistic investigation confirms that electrical potentials rather than reactive oxygen species and mechanical forces enable Ca 2+ influx through voltage-gated channels and establishment of the Ca 2+ -CAMK2A-NF- κ B axis to promote the proinflammatory macrophage response during ultrasound treatment. Piezoelectric material-mediated electrical signal-activated proinflammatory macrophages significantly inhibit tumor cell proliferation. A method for electrogenetic regulation of immune cells as well as a powerful tool for engineering macrophages for immunotherapy is provided here.},

  abstract     = {There has been much interest in producing natural colorants to replace synthetic colorants of health concerns. Escherichia coli has been employed to produce natural colorants including carotenoids, indigo, anthocyanins, and violacein. However, production of natural green and navy colorants has not been reported. Many natural products are hydrophobic, which are accumulated inside or on the cell membrane. This causes cell growth limitation and consequently reduces production of target chemicals. Here, integrated membrane engineering strategies are reported for the enhanced production of rainbow colorants—three carotenoids and four violacein derivatives—as representative hydrophobic natural products in E. coli . By integration of systems metabolic engineering, cell morphology engineering, inner- and outer-membrane vesicle formation, and fermentation optimization, production of rainbow colorants are significantly enhanced to 322 mg L –1 of astaxanthin (red), 343 mg L –1 of β-carotene (orange), 218 mg L –1 of zeaxanthin (yellow), 1.42 g L –1 of proviolacein (green), 0.844 g L –1 of prodeoxyviolacein (blue), 6.19 g L –1 of violacein (navy), and 11.26 g L –1 of deoxyviolacein (purple). The membrane engineering strategies reported here are generally applicable to microbial production of a broader range of hydrophobic natural products, contributing to food, cosmetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.},

  abstract     = {Implant infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause major complications during the perioperative period. Diclofenac, one of the most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is often used to relieve pain and inflammation. In this study, it is found that high-dose diclofenac can inhibit the growth of MRSA, and does not easily induce drug-resistant mutations after continuous passage. However, low-doses diclofenac can resensitize bacteria to β -lactams, which help to circumvent drug resistance and improve the antibacterial efficacy of conventional antibiotics. Further, low-dose diclofenac in combination with β -lactams inhibit MRSA associated biofilm formation in implants. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses indicate that diclofenac can reduce the expression of genes and proteins associated with β -lactam resistance: mecA, mecR, and blaZ; peptidoglycan biosynthesis: murA, murC, femA, and femB; and biofilm formation: altE and fnbP. Murine implant infection models indicate that diclofenac combined with β -lactams, can substantially alleviate MRSA infections in vivo. In addition, it is investigated that low dose diclofenac can inhibit MRSA antibiotic resistance via the mecA/blaZ pathway and related biofilms in implants. The synergistic effect of diclofenac and β -lactams might have promising applications for preventing perioperative infection, considering its multitarget effects against MRSA.},

  abstract     = {Wearable electronics are becoming one of the key technologies in health care applications including health monitoring, data acquisitions, and real-time diagnosis. The commercialization of next-generation devices has been stymied by the lack of ultrathin, flexible, and reliable power sources. Wearable thermo-electrochemical cells (TECs), which can convert body heat to electricity via an electrochemical process, are showing great promise as power sources for such wearable systems. TECs harvest orders of magnitude more voltage per temperature difference (Seebeck coefficient (1–34 mV K −1 )) when compared to the more common thermoelectric generators (Seebeck coefficient ≈tens or hundreds of µV K −1 ). However, there still remain great challenges for TECs progressing towards wearable applications. This review summarizes the recent development of potentially wearable TECs with promise for body-heat harvesting, with a specific focus on flexible electrode materials, solid-state electrolytes, device fabrication, and strategies toward applications. It also clarifies the challenges and gives some future direction to enhance future investigations on high-performance wearable TECs for practical and self-powered wearable devices.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners do not provide only high-resolution medical imaging but also magnetic robot actuation and tracking. However, the rotational motion capabilities of MRI-powered wireless magnetic capsule-type robots have been limited due to the very high axial magnetic field inside the MRI scanner. Medical functionalities of such robots also remain a challenge due to the miniature robot designs. Therefore, a wireless capsule-type reversible orientation-locking robot (REVOLBOT) is proposed that has decoupled translational motion and planar orientation change capability by locking and unlocking the rotation of a spherical ferrous bead inside the robot on demand. Such an on-demand locking/unlocking mechanism is achieved by a phase-changing wax material in which the ferrous bead is embedded inside. Controlled and on-demand hyperthermia and drug delivery using wireless power transfer-based Joule heating induced by external alternating magnetic fields are the additional features of this robot. The experimental feasibility of the REVOLBOT prototype with steerable navigation, medical function, and MRI tracking capabilities with an 1.33 Hz scan rate is demonstrated inside a preclinical 7T small-animal MRI scanner. The proposed robot has the potential for future clinical use in teleoperated minimally invasive treatment procedures with hyperthermia and drug delivery capabilities while being wirelessly powered and monitored inside MRI scanners.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a material programming approach for designing 4D-printed self-shaping material systems based on biological role models. Plants have inspired numerous adaptive systems that move without using any operating energy; however, these systems are typically designed and fabricated in the form of simplified bilayers. This work introduces computational design methods for 4D-printing bio-inspired behaviors with compounded mechanisms. To emulate the anisotropic arrangement of motile plant structures, material systems are tailored at the mesoscale using extrusion-based 3D-printing. The methodology is demonstrated by transferring the principle of force generation by a twining plant ( Dioscorea bulbifera ) to the application of a self-tightening splint. Through the tensioning of its stem helix, D. bulbifera exhibits a squeezing force on its support to provide stability against gravity. The functional strategies of D. bulbifera are abstracted and translated to customized 4D-printed material systems. The squeezing forces of these bio-inspired motion mechanisms are then evaluated. Finally, the function of self-tightening is prototyped in a wrist-forearm splint—a common orthotic device for alignment. The presented approach enables the transfer of novel and expanded biomimetic design strategies to 4D-printed motion mechanisms, further opening the design space to new types of adaptive creations for wearable assistive technologies and beyond.},

Even more powerful results are found at the nanoscale, with the key discovery of new regimes of acoustic wave interaction with 200 fL droplets of deionized water. It is shown that 40 MHz-order surface acoustic waves can manipulate such droplets within fully transparent, high-aspect ratio, 100 nm tall, 20–130 micron wide, 5-mm long nanoslit channels. By forming traps as locally widened regions along such a channel, individual fluid droplets may be propelled from one trap to the next, split between them, mixed, and merged.

Nanomedicines developed to target endothelial α v β 3 -integrin are recently demonstrated to display extensive uptake by circulating phagocytes. These phagocytes show inherent tumor-homing capacities and therefore are capable of actively delivering the endocytosed nanomaterial in lesions. Here, the targeting kinetics and mechanisms of cyclic arginine–glycine–aspartate (cRGD)-decorated lipid nanoparticles (NPs) toward activated vasculature in inflamed lesions during wound healing are studied. The cRGD-NP targeting toward inflamed lesions is identified to be mechanistically similar to the NP accumulation in cancerous lesions. Through a complementary experimental approach, it is observed that circulating phagocytes engage cRGD-NPs and are subsequently homed to the inflamed endothelium. The inflammation-associated phagocytes remain static among endothelial cells upon targeting, resulting in the extensive presence of cRGD-NP-positive phagocytes in the angiogenic vessels. Hence, phagocytic immune cells contribute to cRGD-NP targeting toward angiogenesis. This mechanistic study underlines the need for detailed investigations of NP in vivo behavior. This is critically important for the realization of NPs potential as advanced (immunological) therapeutic agents.},

Quasi in situ synchrotron radiation X-ray spectroscopy directly identifies that the Mn–W dual-metal sites can enhance the polarization of the adsorbed N 2 , which is beneficial to the N 2 activation. Further theoretical calculations reveal that the increased polarization is originated from the electron back-donation into the antibonding orbitals of the adsorbed N 2 , hence lowering the reaction energy barrier toward the N 2 photofixation.

Herein, an unprecedented programmable unlocking nano-matryoshka-CRISPR system (PUN) targeting programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) is fabricated for permanent and complete and highly responsive immunotherapy. While PUN is inert at normal physiological conditions, enzyme-abundant tumor microenvironment and preternatural intracellular oxidative stress sequentially trigger programmable unlocking of PUN to realize a nano-matryoshka-like release of CRISPR/Cas9. The successful nucleus localization of CRISPR/Cas9 ensures the highly efficient disruption of PD-L1 and PTPN2 to unleash cascade amplified adaptive immune response via revoking the immune checkpoint effect. PD-L1 downregulation in tumor cells not only disrupts PD-1/PD-L1 interaction to attenuate the immunosurveillance evasion but also spurs potent immune T cell responses to enhance adaptive immunity. Synchronously, inhibition of JAK/STAT pathway is relieved by deleting PTPN2, which promotes tumor susceptibility to CD8 + T cells depending on IFN- γ , thus further amplifying adaptive immune responses. Combining these advances together, PUN exhibits optimal antitumor efficiency and long-term immune memory with negligible toxicity, which provides a promising alternative to current ICB therapy.},

  abstract     = {Phenotypic polarization of macrophages is regulated by a milieu of cues in the local tissue microenvironment. Currently, little is known about how the intrinsic regulators modulate proinflammatory (M1) versus prohealing (M2) macrophages activation. Here, it is observed that insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2)-deleted macrophages exhibit enhanced M1 phenotype and promote dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis development. However, the IGF2BP2 −/− macrophages are refractory to interleukin-4 (IL-4) induced activation and alleviate cockroach extract induced pulmonary allergic inflammation. Molecular studies indicate that IGF2BP2 switches M1 macrophages to M2 activation by targeting tuberous sclerosis 1 via an N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A)-dependent manner. Additionally, it is also shown a signal transducer and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6)-high mobility group AT-hook 2-IGF2BP2-peroxisome proliferator activated receptor- γ axis involves in M2 macrophages differentiation. These findings highlight a key role of IGF2BP2 in regulation of macrophages activation and imply a potential therapeutic target of macrophages in the inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract     = {A variety of emergent phenomena are enabled by interface engineering in the complex oxides heterostructures. While extensive attention is attracted to LaMnO 3 (LMO) thin films for observing the control of functionalities at its interface with substrate, the nature of the magnetic phases in the thin film is, however, controversial. Here, it is reported that the ferromagnetism in two and five unit cells thick LMO films epitaxially deposited on (001)-SrTiO 3 substrates, a ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic coupling in eight and ten unit cells ones, and a striking ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic pinning effect with apparent positive exchange bias in 15 and 20 unit cells ones are observed. This novel phenomenon in both 15 and 20 unit cells films indicates a coexistence of three magnetic orderings in a single LMO film. The high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy suggests a P2 1 /n to Pbnm symmetry transition from interface to surface, with the spatial stratification of MnO 6 octahedral morphology, corresponding to different magnetic orderings. These results can shed some new lights on manipulating the functionality of oxides by interface engineering.},

However, the control of their properties, especially ECL, remains elusive and afflicted by a series of problems. Here, the authors report CDs that display ECL in water via coreactant ECL, which is the dominant mechanism in biosensing applications. They take advantage of a multicomponent bottom-up approach for preparing and studying the luminescence properties of CDs doped with a dye acting as PL and ECL probe. The dependence of luminescence properties on the surface chemistry is further reported, by investigating the PL and ECL response of CDs with surfaces rich in primary, methylated, or propylated amino groups. While precursors that contribute to the core characterize the PL emission, the surface states influence the efficiency of the excitation-dependent PL emission. The ECL emission is influenced by surface states from the organic shell, but states of the core strongly interact with the surface, influencing the ECL efficiency. These findings offer a framework of pre- and post-synthetic design strategies to improve ECL emission properties, opening new opportunities for exploring biosensing applications of CDs.},

Predictive models based on individual testing platforms have shown varying levels of performance, while their final integrative model produces an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85.

Here, an imaging of the modal responses for a nanomechanical drum driven off resonance is presented. By using the frequency modal analysis, these shapes are described as a superposition of resonance modes. It is found that the spatial distribution of the oscillating component of the driving force, which is affected by both the shape of the actuating electrode and inherent device properties such as asymmetry and initial slack, greatly influences the modal weight or participation. This modal superposition analysis elucidates the dynamics of any nanomechanical system through modal weights.

The ferroelectric gelatine skin sensor has exceptionally high pressure sensitivity (≈41 mV Pa −1 ) and the lowest detection limit of pressure (≈0.005 Pa) and temperature (≈0.04 K) ever reported for ferroelectric sensors.

Here, a physiology-based design method for stretchable electronics and a novel airbag-type stretchable electrode array (ASEA) device for assessment of the complex female pelvic floor muscle (PFM) is proposed. Clinical trials show that the ASEA device is able to provide stable contact interface and multi-channel accurate data acquisition.

Furthermore, a muscle-unit evaluation method (MUEM) to assess the PFM complex state is proposed, especially its cross-interaction between muscles. Clinical trials show that MUEM can accurately and comprehensively assess PFM state and the correlations between main muscles, which unveils the mechanisms of some special muscle states that are not possible using traditional methods. This proof of concept research holds the promise for the development of new diagnostic strategies for muscle pathological research, and has the potential for clinical application and general implication.},

  abstract     = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the most restrictive and complicated barrier that keeps most biomolecules and drugs from the brain. An efficient brain delivery strategy is urgently needed for the treatment of brain diseases. Based on the studies of brain-targeting extracellular vesicles (EVs), the potential of using small apoptotic bodies (sABs) from brain metastatic cancer cells for brain-targeting drug delivery is explored. It is found that anti-TNF- α antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) combined with cationic konjac glucomannan (cKGM) can be successfully loaded into sABs via a transfection/apoptosis induction process and that the sABs generated by B16F10 cells have an extraordinarily high brain delivery efficiency. Further studies suggest that ASO-loaded sABs (sCABs) are transcytosed by b. End3 (brain microvascular endothelial cells, BMECs) to penetrate the BBB, which is mediated by CD44v6, and eventually taken up by microglial cells in the brain. In a Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) mouse model, sCABs dramatically ameliorate PD symptoms via the anti-inflammatory effect of ASO. This study suggests that sABs from brain metastatic cancer cells are excellent carriers for brain-targeted delivery, as they have not only an extraordinary delivery efficiency but also a much higher scale-up production potential than other EVs.},

The practical applications of these crystals in devices rely strongly on deterministic engineering of their spatially localized electromagnetic field distributions, which has remained challenging. The polariton interference can be enhanced and tailored by patterning the vdW crystal α -MoO 3 into microstructures that support highly in-plane anisotropic phonon polaritons. The orientation of the polaritonic in-plane isofrequency curve relative to the microstructure edges is a critical parameter governing the polariton interference, rendering the configuration of infrared electromagnetic field localizations by enabling the tuning of the microstructure size and shape and the excitation frequency. Thus, the study presents an effective rationale for engineering infrared light flow in planar photonic devices.},

With an increasing number of studies reporting their application in transcriptome engineering, viral interference, nucleic acid detection, and RNA imaging, type VI CRISPR-Cas systems and the associated Cas13 effectors particularly hold promise as RNA-targeting or RNA-binding tools.

The development of the autoregulatory circuit is a decisive event for converting hepatocytes into the cells of origin, since hepatocytes expressing the circuit have acquired tumorigenic potential before progressing to LCSCs.

  abstract     = {Nerve injury-induced maladaptive changes of gene expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contribute to neuropathic pain. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of gene expression. Here, a conserved lncRNA is reported, named DRG-specifically enriched lncRNA ( DS-lncRNA ) for its high expression in DRG neurons. Peripheral nerve injury downregulates DS-lncRNA in injured DRG due, in part, to silencing of POU domain, class 4, transcription factor 3, a transcription factor that interacts with the DS-lncRNA gene promoter. Rescuing DS-lncRNA downregulation blocks nerve injury-induced increases in the transcriptional cofactor RALY-triggered DRG Ehmt2 mRNA and its encoding G9a protein, reverses the G9a-controlled downregulation of opioid receptors and Kcna2 in injured DRG, and attenuates nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities in male mice. Conversely, DS-lncRNA downregulation increases RALY-triggered Ehmt2 / G9a expression and correspondingly decreases opioid receptor and Kcna2 expression in DRG, leading to neuropathic pain symptoms in male mice in the absence of nerve injury. Mechanistically, downregulated DS-lncRNA promotes more binding of increased RALY to RNA polymerase II and the Ehmt2 gene promoter and enhances Ehmt2 transcription in injured DRG. Thus, downregulation of DS-lncRNA likely contributes to neuropathic pain by negatively regulating the expression of RALY-triggered Ehmt2 /G9a, a key neuropathic pain player, in DRG neurons.},

  abstract     = {From basic research to industry process, battery energy storage systems have played a great role in the informatization, mobility, and intellectualization of modern human society. Some potential systems such as Li, Na, K, Mg, Zn, and Al secondary batteries have attracted much attention to maintain social progress and sustainable development. As one of the components in batteries, electrolytes play an important role in the upgrade and breakthrough of battery technology. Since room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) feature high conductivity, nonflammability, nonvolatility, high thermal stability, and wide electrochemical window, they have been widely applied in various battery systems and show great potential in improving battery stability, kinetics performance, energy density, service life, and safety. Thus, it is a right time to summarize these progresses. In this review, the composition and classification of various ILs and their recent applications as electrolytes in diverse metal-ion batteries (Li, Na, K, Mg, Zn, Al) are outlined to enhance the battery performances.},

However, clarifying and controlling co-catalyst related charge transfer process and parameters are still challenging. Herein, three parameters are proposed, V transfer (the electron transfer rate from MOF to co-catalyst), D transfer (the electron transfer distance from MOF to co-catalyst), and V consume (the electron consume rate from co-catalyst to the reactant), related to Pt on UiO-66-NH 2 in a photocatalytic process. These parameters can be controlled by rational manipulation of the co-catalyst via three steps: i) Compositional design by partial substitution of Pt with Pd to form PtPd alloy, ii) location control by encapsulating the PtPd alloy into UiO-66-NH 2 crystals, and iii) facet selection by exposing the encapsulated PtPd alloy (100) facets. As revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and first-principles simulations, the new Schottky junction (PtPd (100)@UiO-66-NH 2 ) with higher V transfer and V consume exhibits enhanced electron-hole separation and H 2 O activation than the traditional Pt/UiO-66-NH 2 junction, thereby leading to a significant enhancement in the photoactivity.},

At the same time, microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are indispensable in understanding the language of neurons. Here, the authors show transparent MEAs capable of recording action potentials from neurons and compatible with advanced microscopy. The electrodes are made of the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and are patterned by optical lithography, ensuring scalable fabrication with good control over device parameters. A thickness of 380 nm ensures low enough impedance and &gt;75% transparency throughout the visible part of the spectrum making them suitable for artefact-free recording in the presence of laser illumination. Using primary neuronal cells, the arrays record single units from multiple nearby sources with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.7 (17.7 dB). Additionally, it is possible to perform calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging, a measure of neuronal activity, using the novel transparent electrodes. Different biomarkers are imaged through the electrodes using conventional and super-resolution microscopy (SRM), showing no qualitative differences compared to glass substrates. These transparent MEAs pave the way for harnessing the synergy between the superior temporal resolution of electrophysiology and the selectivity and high spatial resolution of optical imaging.},

The AIR molecule has four elements, namely, an exofacial trigger group, a bilayer anchor, a toxin as a secondary messenger, and a self-immolative scaffold as a mechanism for signal transduction. Receptor installation into cells is established via a robust protocol with minimal cell handling. The synthetic receptor remains dormant in the engineered cells, but is effectively triggered externally by the addition of an activating biomolecule (enzyme) or in a mixed cell population through interaction with the surrounding cells. In 3D cell culture (spheroids), receptor activation is accessible for at least 5 days, which compares favorably with other state of the art receptor designs.},

Vascularization defects are therefore a major risk factor for chronic, non-healing wounds. The dynamics of mammalian tissue revascularization, vessel maturation, and remodeling remain poorly understood due to lack of suitable in vivo imaging tools. A label-free large-scale optoacoustic microscopy (LSOM) approach is developed for rapid, non-invasive, volumetric imaging of tissue regeneration over large areas spanning up to 50 mm with a depth penetration of 1.5 mm. Vascular networks in dorsal mouse skin and full-thickness excisional wounds are imaged with capillary resolution during the course of healing, revealing previously undocumented views of the angiogenesis process in an unperturbed wound environment. Development of an automatic analysis framework enables the identification of key features of wound angiogenesis, including vessel length, diameter, tortuosity, and angular alignment. The approach offers a versatile tool for preclinical research in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, empowering label-free, longitudinal, high-throughput, and quantitative studies of the microcirculation in processes associated with normal and impaired vascular remodeling, and analysis of vascular responses to pharmacological interventions in vivo.},

  abstract     = {One central task of developing nonvolatile phase change memory (PCM) is to improve its scalability for high-density data integration. In this work, by first-principles molecular dynamics, to date the thinnest PCM material possible (0.8 nm), namely, a monolayer Sb 2 Te 3 , is proposed. Importantly, its SET (crystallization) process is a fast one-step transition from amorphous to hexagonal phase without the usual intermediate cubic phase. An increased spatial localization of electrons due to geometrical confinement is found to be beneficial for keeping the data nonvolatile in the amorphous phase at the 2D limit. The substrate and superstrate can be utilized to control the phase change behavior: e.g., with passivated SiO 2 (001) surfaces or hexagonal Boron Nitride, the monolayer Sb 2 Te 3 can reach SET recrystallization in 0.54 ns or even as fast as 0.12 ns, but with unpassivated SiO 2 (001), this would not be possible. Besides, working with small volume PCM materials is also a natural way to lower power consumption. Therefore, the proposed PCM working process at the 2D limit will be an important potential strategy of scaling the current PCM materials for ultrahigh-density data storage.},

The NPC effect is impressively observed in the high resistance state branch of the RS memory, enabling the memristor function to be extended to both memory logic display and multistate data storage. The observed NPC effect is attributed to the excitation, migration, and compensation of oxygen vacancy at the GQDs/TiO x interface, at which the electron transportation is efficiently restricted because of the variation in the charge distribution and electrostatic potential under illumination. Experiments, theoretical calculations, and physical models are used to provide engineer the interface with the aim of building the NPC effect in the memristive device.

Here, the development of multifunctional alveolar macrophage (AM)-like nanoparticles (NPs) with photothermal inactivation capability for COVID-19 treatment is reported. The NPs, made by wrapping polymeric cores with AM membranes, display the same surface receptors as AMs, including the coronavirus receptor and multiple cytokine receptors. By acting as AM decoys, the NPs block coronavirus from host cell entry and absorb various proinflammatory cytokines, thus achieving combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment. To enhance the antiviral efficiency, an efficient photothermal material based on aggregation-induced emission luminogens is doped into the NPs for virus photothermal disruption under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. In a surrogate mouse model of COVID-19 caused by murine coronavirus, treatment with multifunctional AM-like NPs with NIR irradiation decreases virus burden and cytokine levels, reduces lung damage and inflammation, and confers a significant survival advantage to the infected mice. Crucially, this therapeutic strategy may be clinically applied for the treatment of COVID-19 at early stage through atomization inhalation of the NPs followed by NIR irradiation of the respiratory tract, thus alleviating infection progression and reducing transmission risk.},

Here, it is reported that elevated circular RNA FAT1 (circFAT1) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) unifies and regulates the positive association between cancer stemness and immune evasion by promoting STAT3 activation. circFAT1 knockdown (KD) reduces tumorsphere formation of SCC cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that circFAT1 KD impairs the cancer stemness signature and activates tumor cell-intrinsic immunity. Mechanistically, circFAT1 binding to STAT3 in the cytoplasm prevents STAT3 dephosphorylation by SHP1 and promotes STAT3 activation, resulting in inhibition of STAT1-mediated transcription. Moreover, circFAT1 KD significantly enhances PD1 blockade immunotherapy by promoting CD8 + cell infiltration into tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the results demonstrate that circFAT1 is an important regulator of cancer stemness and antitumor immunity.},

It is found that E-ZnO exhibits higher electron mobility and better matched energy level with perovskite compared to ZnO. In addition, in order to eliminate the proton transfer reaction at the ZnO/perovskite interface, a high quality perovskite film fabrication process that requires neither annealing nor antisolvent is developed. By taking advantages of both E-ZnO and the new process, the highest efficiency of 20.39% is obtained for PSCs based on E-ZnO. Moreover, the efficiency of unencapsulated PSCs with E-ZnO retains 95% of its initial value exposed in an ambient atmosphere after 3604 h. This work provides a feasible path toward high performance of PSCs, and it is believed that the present work will facilitate transition of perovskite photovoltaics in flexible and tandem devices since the annealing- and antisolvent-free technology.},

By integrating hierarchy and size effects, microarchitected metamaterials fabricated by two-photon lithography with a metallic or ceramic coating can be ultrastrong but lightweight. However, the attainment of both strength and ductility is generally mutually exclusive. Inspired by the Pantheon dome in Rome, which can withstand high load while keeping low density, microarchitected domes with a gradient helix are designed and deposited in a hierarchical nanostructured aluminum film with ultrahigh strength and considerable plasticity. Despite having a thick coating, which usually causes catastrophic collapse, the thick-walled metallic dome shows recoverability during compression. The compressive strength increases to 73 times that of current ductile-like microlattices, leading to the metamaterial occupying the domain of the material property space that is hitherto empty. Detailed in situ experimental and computational work reveals the graceful (noncatastrophic) failure due to the helical twisting and plastic flow in the supra-nanomaterial. It is a promising method of suppressing brittle failure via a combination of architectural and material design. It can be used to impart enhanced functionality, making programmable stiffness, and tailored energy absorption all possible.},

  abstract     = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an intriguing class of widely prevalent endogenous RNAs, the vast majority of which have not been characterized functionally. Here, we identified a novel oncogenic circRNA originating from the back-splicing of Exon2 and Exon3 of a tumor suppressor gene, ARHGAP35 (also known as P190-A), termed as circARHGAP35. have observe that circARHGAP35 and linear ARHGAP35 have antithetical expression and functions. Interestingly, circARHGAP35 contains a 3867 nt long ORF with an m 6 A-modified start codon and encodes a truncated protein comprising four FF domains and lacking the Rho GAP domain. Mechanistically, circARHGAP35 protein promotes cancer cell progression by interacting with TFII-I protein in the nucleus. The RNA binding protein, HNRNPL, facilitates the formation of circARHGAP35. Clinically, circARHGAP35 is associated with poor survival in cancer patients. Our findings characterize an oncogenic circRNA and demonstrate a novel mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer by circRNA through the production of a truncated protein.},

  abstract     = {New structural type of 2D AA′ n −1 M n X 3 n +1 type halide perovskites stabilized by symmetric diammonium cations has attracted research attention recently due to the short interlayer distance and better charge-transport for high-performance solar cells (PSCs). However, the distribution control of quantum wells (QWs) and its influence on optoelectronic properties are largely underexplored. Here effective phase-alignment is reported through dynamical control of film formation to improve charge transfer between quantum wells (QWs) for 2D perovskite (BDA)(MA) n -1 Pb n I 3 n +1 (BDA = 1,4-butanediamine, 〈 n 〉 = 4) film. The in situ optical spectra reveal a significantly prolonged crystallization window during the perovskite deposition via additive strategy. It is found that finer thickness gradient by n values in the direction orthogonal to the substrate leads to more efficient charge transport between QWs and suppressed charge recombination in the additive-treated film. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 14.4% is achieved, which is not only 21% higher than the control one without additive treatment, but also one of the high efficiencies of the low- n ( n ≤ 4) AA′ n −1 M n X 3 n +1 PSCs. Furthermore, the bare device retains 92% of its initial PCE without any encapsulation after ambient exposure for 1200 h.},

  abstract     = {Origami-based designs refer to the application of the ancient art of origami to solve engineering problems of different nature. Despite being implemented at dimensions that range from the nano to the meter scale, origami-based designs are always defined by the laws that govern their geometrical properties at any scale. It is thus not surprising to notice that the study of their applications has become of cross-disciplinary interest. This article aims to review recent origami-based applications in engineering, design methods and tools, with a focus on research outcomes from 2015 to 2020. First, an introduction to origami history, mathematical background and terminology is given. Origami-based applications in engineering are reviewed largely in the following fields: biomedical engineering, architecture, robotics, space structures, biomimetic engineering, fold-cores, and metamaterials. Second, design methods, design tools, and related manufacturing constraints are discussed. Finally, the article concludes with open questions and future challenges.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is profoundly affecting nearly all aspects of life on earth, including human societies, economies, and health. Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including data centers and other sources of large-scale computation. Although many important scientific milestones are achieved thanks to the development of high-performance computing, the resultant environmental impact is underappreciated. In this work, a methodological framework to estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardized and reliable way is presented and metrics to contextualize GHG emissions are defined. A freely available online tool, Green Algorithms ( www.green-algorithms.org ) is developed, which enables a user to estimate and report the carbon footprint of their computation. The tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also accounting for a broad range of hardware configurations. Finally, the GHG emissions of algorithms used for particle physics simulations, weather forecasts, and natural language processing are quantified. Taken together, this study develops a simple generalizable framework and freely available tool to quantify the carbon footprint of nearly any computation. Combined with recommendations to minimize unnecessary CO 2 emissions, the authors hope to raise awareness and facilitate greener computation.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical model is presented for the free energy Δ G b of complex formation between a highly charged polyelectrolyte and a protein. The model introduced here comprises both the effect of released counterions and the uptake or release of water molecules during complex formation. The resulting expression for Δ G b is hence capable of describing the dependence of Δ G b on temperature as well as on the concentration of salt in the system: An increase of the salt concentration in the solution increases the activity of the ions and counterion release becomes less effective for binding. On the other hand, an increased salt concentration leads to the decrease of the activity of water in bulk. Hence, release of water molecules during complex formation will be more advantageous and lead to an increase of the magnitude of Δ G b and the binding constant. It is furthermore demonstrated that the release or uptake of water molecules is the origin of the marked enthalpy–entropy cancellation observed during complex formation of polyelectrolytes with proteins. The comparison with experimental data on complex formation between a synthetic (sulfated dendritic polyglycerol) and natural polyelectrolytes (DNA; heparin) with proteins shows full agreement with theory.},

  abstract     = {The sustainable development of engineering biocomposites has been limited due to a lack of bio-based monomers combining favorable processing with high performance. Here, the authors report a novel and fully bio-based transparent wood biocomposite based on green synthesis of a new limonene acrylate monomer from renewable resources. The monomer is impregnated and readily polymerized in a delignified, succinylated wood substrate to form optically transparent biocomposites. The chemical structure of the limonene acrylate enables diffusion into the cell wall, and the polymer phase is both refractive index-matched and covalently linked to the wood substrate. This results in nanostructured biocomposites combining an excellent optical transmittance of 90% at 1.2 mm thickness and a remarkably low haze of 30%, with a high mechanical performance (strength 174 MPa, Young&#39;s modulus 17 GPa). Bio-based transparent wood holds great potential towards the development of sustainable wood nanotechnologies for structural applications, where transparency and mechanical performance are combined.},

Here, an efficient solution is developed for the disaggregation of magnetic beads and interparticle distance control with a magnetophoretic decoupler using an external rotating magnetic field. A unique magnetic potential energy distribution in the form of an asymmetric magnetic thin film around the gap is created and tuned in a controlled manner, regulated by the size ratio of the bead with a magnetic pattern. Hence, the aggregated beads are detached into single beads and transported in one direction in an array pattern. Furthermore, the simultaneous and accurate spacing control of multiple magnetic bead pairs is performed by adjusting the angle of the rotating magnetic field, which continuously changes the energy well associated with a specific shape of the magnetic patterns. This technique offers an advanced solution for the disaggregation and controlled manipulation of beads, can allow new possibilities for the enhanced functioning of lab on a chip and magnetic tweezers platforms for biological assays, intercellular interactions, and magnetic biochip systems.},

In a radiation proctitis rat model, a significant reduction in crypt injury is demonstrated with the device compared to without ( p &lt; 0.0087). Optimal device placement for radiation attenuation is further confirmed in a swine model. Dosimetric modeling in oral cavity cancer patients demonstrates a 30% radiation dose reduction to the normal buccal mucosa and a 15.2% dose reduction in the rectum for prostate cancer patients with the radioprotectant material in place compared to without. Finally, it is found that the rectal radioprotectant device is more cost-effective compared to a hydrogel rectal spacer.

  abstract     = {Majority of drugs are administered orally, yet their efficient absorption is often difficult to achieve, with a low dose fraction reaching the blood compartment. Here, a microstirring pill technology is reported with built-in mixing capability for oral drug delivery that greatly enhances bioavailability of its therapeutic payload. Embedding microscopic stirrers into a pill matrix enables faster disintegration and dissolution, leading to improved release profiles of three widely used model drugs, aspirin, levodopa, and acetaminophen, without compromising their loading. Unlike recently developed drug-carrying nanomotors, drug molecules are not associated with the microstirrers, and hence there is no limitation on the loading capacity. These embedded microstirrers are fabricated through the asymmetric coating of titanium dioxide thin film onto magnesium microparticles. In vitro tests illustrate that the embedded microstirrers lead to substantial enhancement of local fluid transport. In vivo studies using murine and porcine models demonstrate that the localized stirring capability of microstirrers leads to enhanced bioavailability of drug payloads. Such improvements are of considerable importance in clinical scenarios where fast absorption and high bioavailability of therapeutics are critical. The encouraging results obtained in porcine model suggest that the microstirring pill technology has translational potential and can be developed toward practical biomedical applications.},

Optimizing the coordination nature of metal atoms represents the advanced strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity and the selectivity of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we designed a transition-metal based sulfide-Ni 3 S 2 with abundant exposed Ni vacancies created by the interaction between chloride ions and the functional groups on the surface of Ni3S2 for the anchoring of atomically dispersed Pt (Pt SA -Ni 3 S 2 ). The theoretical calculation reveals that unique Pt-Ni 3 S 2 support interaction increases the d orbital electron occupation at the Fermi level and leads to a shift-down of the d -band center, which energetically enhances H 2 O adsorption and provides the optimum H binding sites. Introducing Pt into Ni position in Ni 3 S 2 system can efficiently enhance electronic field distribution and construct a metallic-state feature on the Pt sites by the orbital hybridization between S-3p and Pt-5d for improved reaction kinetics. Finally, the fabricated Pt SA -Ni 3 S 2 SAC is supported by Ag nanowires network to construct a seamless conductive three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure (Pt SA -Ni 3 S 2 @Ag NWs), and the developed catalyst shows an extremely great mass activity of 7.6 A mg −1 with 27-time higher than the commercial Pt/C HER catalyst.},

  abstract     = {The configurational entropy is an emerging descriptor in the functional materials genome. In thermoelectric materials, the configurational entropy helps tune the delicate trade-off between carrier mobility and lattice thermal conductivity, as well as the structural phase transition, if any. Taking GeTe as an example, low-entropy GeTe generally have high carrier mobility and distinguished zT &gt; 2, but the rhombohedral-cubic phase transition restricts the applications. In contrast, despite cubic structure and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, the degraded carrier mobility leads to a low zT in high-entropy GeTe. Herein, medium-entropy alloying is implemented to suppress the phase transition and achieve the cubic GeTe with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity yet decent carrier mobility. In addition, co-alloying of (Mn, Pb, Sb, Cd) facilitates multivalence bands convergence and band flattening, thereby yielding good Seebeck coefficients and compensating for decreased carrier mobility. For the first time, a state-of-the-art zT of 2.1 at 873 K and average zT ave of 1.3 between 300 and 873 K are attained in cubic phased Ge 0.63 Mn 0.15 Pb 0.1 Sb 0.06 Cd 0.06 Te. Moreover, a record-high Vickers hardness of 270 is attained.

  abstract     = {Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of 2D semiconductors and conjugated molecules are of increasing interest because of the prospect of a synergistic enhancement of (opto)electronic properties. In particular, perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) on monolayer (ML)-MoS 2 has been identified as promising candidate and a staggered type-II energy level alignment and excited state interfacial charge transfer have been proposed. In contrast, it is here found with inverse and direct angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy that PTCDA/ML-MoS 2 supported by insulating sapphire exhibits a straddling type-I level alignment, with PTCDA having the wider energy gap. Photoluminescence (PL) and sub-picosecond transient absorption measurements reveal that resonance energy transfer, i.e., electron–hole pair (exciton) transfer, from PTCDA to ML-MoS 2 occurs on a sub-picosecond time scale. This gives rise to an enhanced PL yield from ML-MoS 2 in the heterostructure and an according overall modulation of the photoresponse. These results underpin the importance of a precise knowledge of the interfacial electronic structure in order to understand excited state dynamics and to devise reliable design strategies for optimized optoelectronic functionality in van der Waals heterostructures.},

The proposed device achieves an extremely low SS of 11 mV/decade and a high on-off ratio of ≈10 6 by maintaining a high on-state drive current due to the steep switching of the TS device at the gate region. In particular, the proposed device can function as an infrared detectable phototransistor with excellent optical properties.

Formic acid (FA), which can be easily produced from CO 2 and more conveniently stored and transported than CO 2 , is an attractive CO 2 -equivalent carbon source as it can be assimilated more efficiently than CO 2 by microorganisms and also provides reducing power. Although there are native formatotrophs, they grow slowly and are difficult to metabolically engineer due to the lack of genetic manipulation tools. Thus, much effort is exerted to develop efficient FA assimilation pathways and synthetic microorganisms capable of growing solely on FA (and CO 2 ). Several innovative strategies are suggested to develop synthetic formatotrophs through rational metabolic engineering involving new enzymes and reconstructed FA assimilation pathways, and/or adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). In this paper, recent advances in development of synthetic formatotrophs are reviewed, focusing on biological FA and CO 2 utilization pathways, enzymes involved and newly developed, and metabolic engineering and ALE strategies employed. Also, future challenges in cultivating formatotrophs to higher cell densities and producing chemicals from FA and CO 2 are discussed.},

However, most lasers utilized lasing spectrum as a detection signal, which can hardly detect or characterize nanoscale structural changes in microcavity. Here the concept of amplified structured light-molecule interactions is introduced to monitor tiny bio-structural changes in a microcavity. Biomimetic liquid crystal droplets with self-assembled lipid monolayers are sandwiched in a Fabry–Pérot cavity, where subtle protein-lipid membrane interactions trigger the topological transformation of output vector beams. By exploiting Amyloid β (A β )-lipid membrane interactions as a proof-of-concept, it is demonstrated that vector laser beams can be viewed as a topology of complex laser modes and polarization states. The concept of topological-encoded laser barcodes is therefore developed to reveal dynamic changes of laser modes and A β -lipid interactions with different A β assembly structures. The findings demonstrate that the topology of vector beams represents significant features of intracavity nano-structural dynamics resulted from structured light-molecule interactions.},

  abstract     = {While traditional three-layer structure supercapacitors are under mechanical manipulations, the high-stress region concentrates, inevitably causing persistent structural problems including interlayer slippage, crease formation, and delamination of the electrode–electrolyte interface. Toward this, an all-polymeric, all-elastic and non-laminated supercapacitor with high mechanical reliability and excellent electrochemical performance is developed. Specifically, a polypyrrole electrode layer is in situ integrated into a silk fibroin-based elastic supramolecular hydrogel film with extensive hydrogen and covalent bonds, where a non-laminate device is realized with structural elasticity at the device level. The non-laminate configuration can avoid slippage and delamination, while the elasticity can preclude crease formation. Furthermore, under more severe mechanical damage, the supercapacitors can restore the electrochemical performance through non-autonomous self-healing capabilities, where the supramolecular design of host–guest interactions in the hydrogel matrix results in a superior self-healing efficiency approaching ≈95.8% even after 30 cutting/healing cycles. The all-elastic supercapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 0.37 F cm −2 and a volumetric energy density of 0.082 mW h cm −3 , which can well-maintain the specific capacitance even at −20 °C with over 85.2% retention after five cut/healing cycles.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density adopt some novel anode materials, which generally have the potential to exhibit higher capacity, superior rate performance as well as better cycling durability than conventional graphite anode, while on the other hand always suffer from larger active lithium loss (ALL) in the first several cycles. During the last two decades, various pre-lithiation strategies are developed to mitigate the initial ALL by presetting the extra Li sources to effectively improve the first Coulombic efficiency and thus achieve higher energy density as well as better cyclability. In this progress report, the origin of the huge initial ALL of the anode and its effect on the performance of full cells are first illustrated in theory. Then, various pre-lithiation strategies to resolve these issues are summarized, classified, and compared in detail. Moreover, the research progress of pre-lithiation strategies for the representative electrochemical systems are carefully reviewed. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives are particularly analyzed and outlooked. This progress report aims to bring up new insights to reassess the significance of pre-lithiation strategies and offer a guideline for the research directions tailored for different applications based on the proposed pre-lithiation strategies summaries and comparisons.},

Here, a non-porous ingot-type sodium (Na) metal growth with self-modulated shiny-smooth interfaces is reported for the first time. The Na metal anode can be cycled reversibly, without forming whiskers, mosses, gas bubbles, or disconnected metal particles that are usually observed in other studies. The ideal interfacial stability confirmed in the microcapillary cells is the key to enable anode-free Na metal full cells with a capacity retention rate of 99.93% per cycle, superior to available anode-free Na and Li batteries using liquid electrolytes. Contradictory to the common beliefs established around alkali metal anodes, there is no repeated SEI formation on or within the sodium anode, supported by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy elemental depth profile analyses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy diagnosis, and microscopic imaging.},

This work aims at solving these challenges, through developing a tribo-induced color tuner that can be integrated into the vastly distributed commercial SSL system. This tribo-induced color tuner includes a concentric color conversion plate consisting of (Sr,Ca)AlSiN 3 :Eu phosphor and TiO 2 , a tribo-induced liquid lens, and a rotary freestanding sliding TENG. The color oscillation between purple and pink is achieved upon the tribo-charging by the TENG, which reveals the input mechanical motion signals. The signal can be conveniently sent by everywhere-existed lamps and processed by everyone-owned smartphone cameras or closed-circuit televisions. Through this approach, the function of wireless sensing is achieved without the need of preamplification, with no additional power supply required, as demonstrated for wireless sensing of the rotation speed. The smart lighting for underwater photographing is also demonstrated by the color-tunable SSL system with the best imaging quality achieved.},

Common types of nanocomposites consist of a combination of two different elements, with a nanoparticle that is linked to, or surrounded by, another organic or inorganic material, for example in a core-shell or heterostructure configuration. A general family of nanoparticle composites concerns the coating of a nanoscale material by a polymer, SiO 2 or carbon. Other materials, such as graphene or graphene oxide (GO), are used as supports forming composites when nanoscale materials are deposited onto them. In this Review we focus on magnetic nanocomposites, describing their synthetic methods, physical properties and applications. Several types of nanocomposites are presented, according to their composition, morphology or surface functionalization. Their applications are largely due to the synergistic effects that appear thanks to the co-existence of two different materials and to their interface, resulting in properties often better than those of their single-phase components. Applications discussed concern magnetically separable catalysts, water treatment, diagnostics-sensing and biomedicine.},

Analytical formulae of the performance scales, i.e., temperature difference utilization ratio ( φ th ) and maximum output power ( P max ), are derived to optimize the leaf-TEG dimensions. In an air duct (substrate: 36 °C, air: 6 °C, air flowing: 1 m s −1 ), the 10-leaf-TEG shows a φ th of 73% and P max of 0.38 µW per leaf. A proof-of-concept wearable 100-leaf-TEG (60 cm 2 ) generates 11 µW on an arm at room temperature. Furthermore, the leaf-TEG is flexible and durable that is confirmed by bending and brushing over 1000 times.

The local intense photon heating induces strong thermal nonequilibrium between optical and acoustic phonons. Both first principle calculations and recent indirect Raman measurements prove this phenomenon. To date, no direct measurement of the thermal nonequilibrium between optical and acoustic phonons has been reported. Here, this physical phenomenon is directly characterized for the first time through a novel approach combining both electrothermal and optothermal techniques. While the optical phonon temperature is determined from Raman wavenumber, the acoustic phonon temperature is precisely determined using high-precision thermal conductivity and laser power absorption that are measured with negligible nonequilibrium among energy carriers. For graphene paper, the energy coupling factor between in-plane optical and overall acoustic phonons is found at (1.59–3.10) × 10 15 W m −3 K −1 , agreeing well with the quantum mechanical modeling result of 4.1 × 10 15 W m −3 K −1 . Under ≈1 µm diameter laser heating, the optical phonon temperature rise is over 80% higher than that of the acoustic phonons. This observation points out the importance of subtracting optical–acoustic phonon thermal nonequilibrium in Raman-based thermal characterization.},

Advantages such as open mesoporous channel, high specific surface area, ease of surface modification, and multifunctional integration are the driving forces for the application of mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs) in bone disease diagnosis and treatment. To achieve better therapeutic effects, it is necessary to understand the properties of MNs and cargo delivery mechanisms, which are the foundation and key in the design of MNs. The main types and characteristics of MNs for bone regeneration, such as mesoporous silica ( m SiO 2 ), mesoporous hydroxyapatite ( m HAP), mesoporous calcium phosphates ( m CaPs) are introduced. Additionally, the relationship between the cargo release mechanisms and bone regeneration of MNs-based nanocarriers is elucidated in detail. Particularly, MNs-based smart cargo transport strategies such as sustained cargo release, stimuli-responsive (e.g., pH, photo, ultrasound, and multi-stimuli) controllable delivery, and specific bone-targeted therapy for bone disease diagnosis and treatment are analyzed and discussed in depth. Lastly, the conclusions and outlook about the design and development of MNs-based cargo delivery systems in diagnosis and treatment for bone tissue engineering are provided to inspire new ideas and attract researchers’ attention from multidisciplinary areas spanning chemistry, materials science, and biomedicine.},

  abstract     = {In this article, two different types of spacer cations, 1,4-butanediamonium (BDA 2+ ) and 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA + ) are co-used to prepare the perovskite precursor solutions with the formula of (BDA) 1- a (PEA 2 ) a MA 4 Pb 5 X 16 . By simply mixing the two spacer cations, the self-assembled polycrystalline films of (BDA) 0.8 (PEA 2 ) 0.2 MA 4 Pb 5 X 16 are obtained, and BDA 2+ is located in the crystal grains and PEA + is distributed on the surface. The films display a small exciton binding energy, uniformly distributed quantum wells and improved carrier transport. Besides, utilizing mixed spacer cations also induces better crystallinity and vertical orientation of 2D perovskite (BDA) 0.8 (PEA 2 ) 0.2 MA 4 Pb 5 X 16 films. Thus, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.21% is achieved in the optimized perovskite solar cells with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag. In addition, the complementary humidity and thermal stability are obtained, which are ascribed to the enhanced interlayer interaction by BDA 2+ and improved moisture resistance by the hydrophobic group of PEA + . The encapsulated devices are retained over 95% or 75% of the initial efficiency after storing 500 h in ambient air under 40 ± 5% relative humidity or 100 h in nitrogen at 60 °C.},

  abstract     = {Gas-based therapy has emerged as a new green therapy strategy for anti-tumor treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy is still restricted by the deep tissue controlled release, poor lymphocytic infiltration, and inherent immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a new type of nanovaccine is designed by integrating low dose soft X-ray-triggered CO releasing lanthanide scintillator nanoparticles (ScNPs: NaLuF 4 :Gd,Tb@NaLuF 4 ) with photo-responsive CO releasing moiety (PhotoCORM) for synergistic CO gas/immuno-therapy of tumors. The designed nanovaccine presents significantly boosted radioluminescence and enables deep tissue CO generation at unprecedented tissue depths of 5 cm under soft X-ray irradiation. Intriguingly, CO as a superior immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer further reverses the deep tissue immunosuppressive TME and concurrently activates adaptive anti-tumor immunity through efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. More importantly, the designed nanovaccine presents efficient growth inhibition of both local and distant tumors via a soft X-ray activated systemic anti-tumor immunoresponse. This work provides a new strategy of designing anti-tumor nanovaccines for synergistic deep tissue gas-therapy and remote soft X-ray photoactivation of the immune response.},

  abstract     = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infections can be notoriously difficult to treat and are often accompanied by the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) acting on PqsR (MvfR) – a crucial transcriptional regulator serving major functions in PA virulence – can enhance antibiotic efficacy and eventually prevent the AMR. An integrated drug discovery campaign including design, medicinal chemistry-driven hit-to-lead optimization and in-depth biological profiling of a new QSI generation is reported. The QSI possess excellent activity in inhibiting pyocyanin production and PqsR reporter-gene with IC 50 values as low as 200 and 11 × 10 −9 m , respectively. Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) as well as safety pharmacology studies especially highlight the promising translational properties of the lead QSI for pulmonary applications. Moreover, target engagement of the lead QSI is shown in a PA mucoid lung infection mouse model. Beyond that, a significant synergistic effect of a QSI-tobramycin (Tob) combination against PA biofilms using a tailor-made squalene-derived nanoparticle (NP) formulation, which enhance the minimum biofilm eradicating concentration (MBEC) of Tob more than 32-fold is demonstrated. The novel lead QSI and the accompanying NP formulation highlight the potential of adjunctive pathoblocker-mediated therapy against PA infections opening up avenues for preclinical development.},

However, additive manufacturing process normally introduces a high residue stress and textures due to the locally intense temperature. MIM is an excellent batch manufacturing process; nevertheless, it is not suitable for rapid screening and development of new metal compositions and structures due to the slow sintering process. Herein, an ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) process is reported that enables the rapid synthesis and sintering of bulk metals/alloys and intermetallic compounds. In this process, elemental powders are mixed and pressed into pellets, followed by UHS sintering in just seconds at a temperature between 1000 and 3000 °C. Three representative compositions, including pure metals, intermetallics, and multielement alloys, are demonstrated with a broad range of melting points. The UHS process for metal sintering is nonmaterials specific, in addition to being extremely rapid, which make it suitable for materials discovery. Furthermore, the sintering method does not apply pressure to the samples, making it compatible with 3D printing and other additive manufacturing processes of complex structures. This rapid sintering technique will greatly facilitate the development and manufacturing of metals and alloys.},

However, despite the success of machine learning in predicting discrete properties, challenges remain for continuous property prediction. The challenge is aggravated in crystalline solids due to crystallographic symmetry considerations and data scarcity. Here, the direct prediction of phonon density-of-states (DOS) is demonstrated using only atomic species and positions as input. Euclidean neural networks are applied, which by construction are equivariant to 3D rotations, translations, and inversion and thereby capture full crystal symmetry, and achieve high-quality prediction using a small training set of examples with over 64 atom types. The predictive model reproduces key features of experimental data and even generalizes to materials with unseen elements, and is naturally suited to efficiently predict alloy systems without additional computational cost. The potential of the network is demonstrated by predicting a broad number of high phononic specific heat capacity materials. The work indicates an efficient approach to explore materials&#39; phonon structure, and can further enable rapid screening for high-performance thermal storage materials and phonon-mediated superconductors.},

The tenacity of ALD-coated aramid fibers decreases only by ≈0.85% after exposure to intense UV light (4260 W m −2 ) under high temperature (&gt;200 ℃) for 90 min, which equals to continuous exposure to sunlight for about 17 500 days. The as-prepared aramid fibers also show excellent laundering durability, thermal and chemical stabilities. This work presents a green and damage-free approach to achieve the highly anti-UV aramid fibers without sacrificing their outstanding performance, which is expected to guide material design for future innovations in functional fibers and devices.},

Upon applying a voltage, the devices electrophoretically transport charged drug molecules across an ion-conducting membrane out to the local implanted area. This solvent-flow-free “dry” delivery enables controlled drug release with minimal pressure increase at the outlet. However, a major challenge these devices face is limiting drug leakage in their idle state. Here, a method of reducing passive drug leakage through the choice of the drug co-ion is presented. By switching acetylcholine&#39;s associated co-ion from chloride to carboxylate co-ions as well as sulfopropyl acrylate-based polyanions, steady-state drug leakage rate is reduced up to sevenfold with minimal effect on the active drug delivery rate. Numerical simulations further illustrate the potential of this method and offer guidance for new material systems to suppress passive drug leakage in electrophoretic drug delivery devices.},

The phase transition is induced by the light interaction with both electron and phonon subsystems in the material. The mechanism of such a phase transition is formulated by thermodynamics theory: the Gibbs free energy landscape can be effectively modulated under light, and the relative stability between different (meta-)stable phases can be switched. This mechanism is applied to TMDs and reversible phase transitions between the topologically trivial 2H and nontrivial 1T′ phases are predicted, providing appropriate light frequency, polarization, and intensity are applied. The large energy barrier on the martensitic transformation path can be significantly reduced, yielding a small energy barrier phase transition with fast kinetics. Compared with other phase transition schemes, light illumination has great advantages, such as its non-contact nature and easy tunability. The reversible topological phase transition can be applicable in high-resolution fast data storage and in-memory computing devices.},

  abstract     = {Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) function as a formidable regulator of inflammation and tissue homeostasis and expanded MSCs are shown to be effective in treating various inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic effects require the existence of certain inflammatory cytokines. However, in the absence of sufficient proinflammatory stimuli or in the presence of anti-inflammatory medications, MSCs are animated to promote immune responses and unable to alleviate inflammatory disorders. In this study, it is demonstrated that steroid co-administration interferes the efficacy of MSCs in treating acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). Molecular analysis reveals that vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) is highly induced in MSCs by steroids and TNF α and VEGF-C in turn promotes CD8 + T cell response. This immune promoting effect is abolished by blockade or specific genetic ablation of VEGFR3 in CD8 + T cells. Additionally, administration of VEGF-C alone exacerbates aGvHD progression through eliciting more vigorous CD8 + T cell activation and proliferation. Further studies demonstrate that VEGF-C augments the PI3K/AKT signaling process and the expression of downstream genes, such as Cyclin D1. Thus, the data demonstrate that steroids can reverse the immunosuppressive effect of MSCs via promoting VEGF-C-augmented CD8 + T cell response and provide novel information for designing efficacious MSC-based therapies.},

  abstract     = {The ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics is threatening one of the pillars of modern medicine. It was recently understood that bacteria can develop resistance even to silver nanoparticles by starting to produce flagellin, a protein which induces their aggregation and deactivation. This study shows that silver covalently bound to cyanographene (GCN/Ag) kills silver-nanoparticle-resistant bacteria at concentrations 30 times lower than silver nanoparticles, a challenge which has been so far unmet. Tested also against multidrug resistant strains, the antibacterial activity of GCN/Ag is systematically found as potent as that of free ionic silver or 10 nm colloidal silver nanoparticles. Owing to the strong and multiple dative bonds between the nitrile groups of cyanographene and silver, as theory and experiments confirm, there is marginal silver ion leaching, even after six months of storage, and thus very high cytocompatibility to human cells. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest strong interaction of GCN/Ag with the bacterial membrane, and as corroborated by experiments, the antibacterial activity does not rely on the release of silver nanoparticles or ions. Endowed with these properties, GCN/Ag shows that rigid supports selectively and densely functionalized with potent silver-binding ligands, such as cyanographene, may open new avenues against microbial resistance.},

  abstract     = {Neighboring carbon and sandwiched between non-metals and metals in the periodic table of the elements, boron is one of the most chemically and physically versatile elements, and can be manipulated to form dimensionally low planar structures (borophene) with intriguing properties. Herein, the theoretical research and experimental developments in the synthesis of borophene, as well as its excellent properties and application in many fields, are reviewed. The decade-long effort toward understanding the size-dependent structures of boron clusters and the theory-directed synthesis of borophene, including bottom-up approaches based on different foundations, as well as up-down approaches with different exfoliation modes, and the key factors influencing the synthetic effects, are comprehensively summarized. Owing to its excellent chemical, electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties, borophene has shown great promise in supercapacitor, battery, hydrogen-storage, and biomedical applications. Furthermore, borophene nanoplatforms used in various biomedical applications, such as bioimaging, drug delivery, and photonic therapy, are highlighted. Finally, research progress, challenges, and perspectives for the future development of borophene in large-scale production and other prospective applications are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous rechargeable zinc-metal-based batteries are an attractive alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy-storage systems because of their high specific capacity, low cost, eco-friendliness, and nonflammability. However, uncontrollable zinc dendrite growth limits the cycle life by piercing the separator, resulting in low zinc utilization in both alkaline and mild/neutral electrolytes. Herein, a polyacrylonitrile coating layer on a zinc anode produced by a simple drop coating approach to address the dendrite issue is reported. The coating layer not only improves the hydrophilicity of the zinc anode but also regulates zinc-ion transport, consequently facilitating the uniform deposition of zinc ions to avoid dendrite formation. A symmetrical cell with the polymer-coating-layer-modified Zn anode displays dendrite-free plating/stripping with a long cycle lifespan (&gt;1100 h), much better than that of the bare Zn anode. The modified zinc anode coupled with a Mn-doped V 2 O 5 cathode forms a stable rechargeable full battery. This method is a facile and feasible way to solve the zinc dendrite problem for rechargeable aqueous zinc-metal batteries, providing a solid basis for application of aqueous rechargeable Zn batteries.},

However, majority of the body&#39;s bones form via cartilaginous intermediates by endochondral ossification (EO), a process that has not been well mimicked by engineered scaffolds, thus limiting their clinical utility in treating large segmental bone defects. Here, by entrapping corticosteroid dexamethasone within biomimetic recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-loaded porous mesoporous bioglass scaffolds and regulating their release kinetics, significant degree of ectopic bone formation through endochondral ossification is achieved. By regulating the recruitment and polarization of immune suppressive macrophage phenotypes, the scaffold promotes rapid chondrogenesis by activating Hif-3 α signaling pathway in mesenchymal stem cells, which upregulates the expression of downstream chondrogenic genes. Inhibition of Hif-3 α signaling reverses the endochondral ossification phenotype. Together, these results reveal a strategy to facilitate developmental bone growth process using immune modulating biomimetic scaffolds, thus providing new opportunities for developing biomaterials capable of inducing natural tissue regeneration.},

The microstructure is then investigated by spherical aberration-corrected electron microscopy on an atomic scale, which reveals an all-scale hierarchical structure that can scatter the phonons in a wide frequency range. There exist a large quantity of CaAgSb nanometer precipitates as well as quite a lot of edge dislocations close to these nanometer precipitates, thus releasing the stress caused by the mismatch between the precipitates and the parent phase. Many twin boundaries also exist around the CaAgSb precipitates. High-density point defects contain the randomly dispersed Ag vacancies and Zn atoms substituted for the Ag atoms.

In this study, n-type tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) single atomic layer to improve the Ohmic contacts of the p-type molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe 2 ) material is covered. The Ohmic properties, based on the lowering of Schottky barrier height (SBH) owing to the tunneling barrier effect of the WS 2 monolayer, are found to be unexpectedly excellent at room temperature and even at 100 K. The improved SBH and contact resistances are 3 meV and 1 MΩ µm, respectively. The reduction in SBH and contact resistance is confirmed with temperature-dependent transport measurements. This study further demonstrates the selective carrier transport across the MoTe 2 and WS 2 layers by modulating the applied gate voltage. This WS 2 /MoTe 2 heterostructure exhibits excellent gate control over the currents of both channels (n-type and p-type). The on/off ratios for both the electron and hole channels are calculated as 10 7 and 10 6 , respectively, indicating good carrier type modulation by the electric field of the gate electrode.

A sustainable alternative is target-specific, on-demand drug delivery by polymeric nanocarriers. Trunk injections of aqueous nanocarrier dispersions can overcome the biological size barriers of roots and leaves and allow distributing the nanocarriers through the plant. To date, the fate of polymeric nanocarriers inside a plant is widely unknown. Here, the in planta conditions in grapevine plants are simulated and the colloidal stability of a systematic series of nanocarriers composed of polystyrene (well-defined model) and biodegradable lignin and polylactic- co -glycolic acid by a combination of different techniques is studied. Despite the adsorption of carbohydrates and other biomolecules onto the nanocarriers’ surface, they remain colloidally stable after incubation in biological fluids (wood sap), suggesting a potential transport via the xylem. The transport is tracked by fluorine- and ruthenium-labeled nanocarriers inside of grapevines by 19 F-magnetic resonance imaging or induced coupled plasma – optical emission spectroscopy. Both methods show that the nanocarriers are transported inside of the plant and proved to be powerful tools to localize nanomaterials in plants. This study provides essential information to design nanocarriers for agrochemical delivery in plants to sustainable crop protection.},

Here, metal-organic fragments with adhesive excipient to realize high activity with good durability in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are developed. First, a leaf-like zeolitic–imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) is synthesized. Then, ionized species in hydrogen plasma attack preferentially the organic linkers of ZIF-L to derive cobalt–imidazole fragments (CIFs) as adhesive excipient, while they are designed to retain the coordinated cobalt nodes. Moreover, the vacant coordination sites at cobalt nodes and the unbound nitrogen at organic linkers induce high porosity and conductivity. The CIFs serve to stably impregnate trimetallic FeNiMo electrocatalysts (CIF:FeNiMo), and CIF:FeNiMo containing Fe contents of 22% and hexavalent Mo contents show to enable high activity with low overpotentials (203 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 238 mV at 100 mA cm −2 ) in OER. The near O K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure proves further that high activity for OER originates from the partially filled e g orbitals. Additionally, CIF:FeNiMo exhibit good durability, as demonstrated by high activity retention during at least 45 days in OER.},

Depending on the boiling point of solvents, the selective evaporation of the solvents induces both macrophase separation via spinodal decomposition and mesophase separation via self-assembly of inorganic precursors and amphiphilic block copolymers, leading to the formation of hierarchically porous structures. The resulting hierarchically porous Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 possessing large specific surface area (≈77 m 2 g −1 ) and pore volume (≈0.272 cm 3 g −1 ) shows a high specific capacity of 117.6 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C achieving the theoretical value and a long cycling life with 77% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 5 C. This method presented here can open a facile avenue to synthesize other hierarchically porous polyanion-type materials.},

Adsorptive separation using C 2 H 6 -selective adsorbents is beneficial because it directly produces high-purity C 2 H 4 in a single step. Herein, Ni(IN) 2 (HIN = isonicotinic acid) is computationally discovered as a promising adsorbent with the assistance of the multiscale high-throughput computational screening workflow and Computation-Ready, Experimental (CoRE) metal–organic framework (MOF) 2019 database. Ni(IN) 2 is subsequently synthesized and tested to show the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity of 2.45 at 1 bar for a C 2 H 6 /C 2 H 4 mixture (1:15), which is one of the top-performing selectivity values reported for C 2 H 6 -selective MOFs as well as excellent recyclability, suggesting that this material is a promising C 2 H 6 -selective adsorbent. Process-level simulation results based on experimental isotherms demonstrate that the material is one of the top materials reported to date for ethane/ethylene separation under the conditions considered in this work.},

Despite the advances of spheroid models in pharmaceutical screening applications, variations in spheroid size and consequential altered cell responses often lead to nonreproducible and unpredictable results. Here, a microfluidic multisize spheroid array is established and characterized using liver, lung, colon, and skin cells as well as a triple-culture model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to assess the effects of spheroid size on (a) anticancer drug toxicity and (b) compound penetration across an advanced BBB model. The reproducible on-chip generation of 360 spheroids of five dimensions on a well-plate format using an integrated microlens technology is demonstrated. While spheroid size-related IC 50 values vary up to 160% using the anticancer drugs cisplatin (CIS) or doxorubicin (DOX), reduced CIS:DOX drug dose combinations eliminate all lung microtumors independent of their sizes. A further application includes optimizing cell seeding ratios and size-dependent compound uptake studies in a perfused BBB model. Generally, smaller BBB-spheroids reveal an 80% higher compound penetration than larger spheroids while verifying the BBB opening effect of mannitol and a spheroid size-related modulation on paracellular transport properties.},

Terahertz (THz) sensing, an emerging technology for next-generation laser photonics, has been developed with unique photonic features, including label-free, non-destructive, and molecular-specific spectral characteristics. Recently, metasurface-based sensing platforms have helped trace biomolecules by overcoming low THz absorption cross-sectional limits. However, the direct probing of THz signals in aqueous environments remains difficult. Here, the authors report that vertically aligned nanogap-hybridized metasurfaces can efficiently trap traveling NPs in the sensing region, thus enabling us to monitor the real-time kinetic evolution of NP assemblies in liquids. The THz photonics approach, together with an electric tweezing technique via spatially matching optical hotspots to particle trapping sites with a nanoscale spatial resolution, is highly promising for underwater THz analysis, forging a route toward unraveling the physicochemical events of nature within an ultra-broadband wavelength regime.},

A variational autoencoder model is devised and applied to a magnetic system to generate energetically stable magnetic states with low local deformation. The spin structure stabilization is made possible by taking the explicit magnetic Hamiltonian into account to minimize energy in the training process. A significant advantage of the model is that the generator can create a long-range ordered ground state of spin configuration by increasing the role of stabilization even if the ground states are not necessarily included in the training process.

The acetic acid bacterium Gluconacetobacter hansenii is cocultured with engineered E. coli in droplets of glucose-rich media to produce robust cellulose capsules, which are then colonized by the E. coli upon transfer to selective lysogeny broth media. It is shown that the encapsulated E. coli can produce engineered protein nanofibers within the cellulose matrix, yielding hybrid capsules capable of sequestering specific biomolecules from the environment and enzymatic catalysis. Furthermore, capsules are produced which can alter their own bulk physical properties through enzyme-induced biomineralization. This novel system uses a simple fabrication process, based on the autonomous activity of two bacteria, to significantly expand the functionality of BC-based living materials.},

  abstract     = {Droplet vitrification has emerged as a promising ice-free cryopreservation approach to provide a supply chain for off-the-shelf cell products in cell therapy and regenerative medicine applications. Translation of this approach requires the use of low concentration (i.e., low toxicity) permeable cryoprotectant agents (CPA) and high post cryopreservation viability (&gt;90%), thereby demanding fast cooling and warming rates. Unfortunately, with traditional approaches using convective heat transfer, the droplet volumes that can be successfully vitrified and rewarmed are impractically small (i.e., 180 picoliter) for &lt;2.5 m permeable CPA. Herein, a novel approach to achieve 90–95% viability in micro-liter size droplets with 2 m permeable CPA, is presented. Droplets with plasmonic gold nanorods (GNRs) are printed onto a cryogenic copper substrate for improved cooling rates via conduction, while plasmonic laser heating yields &gt;400-fold improvement in warming rates over traditional convective approach. High viability cryopreservation is then demonstrated in a model cell line (human dermal fibroblasts) and an important regenerative medicine cell line (human umbilical cord blood stem cells). This approach opens a new paradigm for cryopreservation and rewarming of dramatically larger volume droplets at lower CPA concentration for cell therapy and other regenerative medicine applications.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial epigenetics is rising as intriguing notion for its potential involvement in aging and diseases, while the details remain largely unexplored. Here it is shown that among the 13 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded genes, NADH-dehydrogenase 6 ( ND6 ) transcript is primarily decreased in obese and type 2 diabetes populations, which negatively correlates with its distinctive hypermethylation. Hepatic mtDNA sequencing in mice unveils that ND6 presents the highest methylation level, which dramatically increases under diabetic condition due to enhanced mitochondrial translocation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) promoted by free fatty acid through adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Hepatic knockdown of ND6 or overexpression of Dnmt1 similarly impairs mitochondrial function and induces systemic insulin resistance both in vivo and in vitro. Genetic or chemical targeting hepatic DNMT1 shows significant benefits against insulin resistance associated metabolic disorders. These findings highlight the pivotal role of ND6 epigenetic network in regulating mitochondrial function and onset of insulin resistance, shedding light on potential preventive and therapeutic strategies of insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders from a perspective of mitochondrial epigenetics.},

In addition to peptide-ligand-functionalized nanomaterials, passivation on 2D nanomaterials has emerged as a new regulatory factor for integrin activation. However, the mechanisms underlying such ligand-independent processes are poorly understood. Here, using graphene oxide passivated with polyethylene glycol (GO-PEG) as a test bed, a ternary simulation model is constructed that also includes a membrane and both subunits of integrin α v β 8 to characterize GO-PEG-mediated integrin activation on the cell membrane in a ligand-independent manner. Combined with the experimental findings, production simulations of the ternary model show a three-phase mechanotransduction process in the vertical interaction mode. Specifically, GO-PEG first induces lipid aggregation-mediated integrin proximity, followed by transmembrane domain rotation and separation, leading to the extension and activation of extracellular domains. Thus, this study presents a complete picture of the interaction between passivated 2D nanomaterials and cell membranes to mediate integrin activation, and provides insights into the potential de novo design and rational use of novel desirable nanomaterials at diverse bio–nano interfaces.},

In this work, a fundamentally new phenomenon of optically induced magnetization achieved by coupling photoexcited orbital magnetic dipoles with magnetic spins at perovskite/ferromagnetic interface is discovered. The depth-sensitive polarized neutron reflectometry combined with in situ photoexcitation setup, constitutes key evidence of this novel effect. It is demonstrated that a circularly polarized photoexcitation induces a stable magnetization signal within the depth up to 7.5 nm into the surface of high-quality perovskite (MAPbBr 3 ) film underneath a ferromagnetic cobalt layer at room temperature. In contrast, a linearly polarized light does not induce any detectable magnetization in the MAPbBr 3 . The observation reveals that photoexcited orbital magnetic dipoles at the surface of perovskite are coupled with the spins of the ferromagnetic atoms at the interface, leading to an optically induced magnetization within the perovskite’s surface. The finding demonstrates that perovskite semiconductor can be bridged with magnetism through optically controllable method at room temperature in this heterojunction design. This provides the new concept of utilizing spin and orbital degrees of freedom in new-generation spin-related optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with unique electrical properties are fascinating materials used for future electronics. However, the strong Fermi level pinning effect at the interface of TMDCs and metal electrodes always leads to high contact resistance, which seriously hinders their application in 2D electronics. One effective way to overcome this is to use metallic TMDCs or transferred metal electrodes as van der Waals (vdW) contacts. Alternatively, using highly conductive doped TMDCs will have a profound impact on the contact engineering of 2D electronics. Here, a novel chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using mixed molten salts is established for vapor–liquid–solid growth of high-quality rhenium (Re) and vanadium (V) doped TMDC monolayers with high controllability and reproducibility. A tunable semiconductor to metal transition is observed in the Re- and V-doped TMDCs. Electrical conductivity increases up to a factor of 10 8 in the degenerate V-doped WS 2 and WSe 2 . Using V-doped WSe 2 as vdW contact, the on-state current and on/off ratio of WSe 2 -based field-effect transistors have been substantially improved (from ≈10 –8 to 10 –5 A; ≈10 4 to 10 8 ), compared to metal contacts. Future studies on lateral contacts and interconnects using doped TMDCs will pave the way for 2D integrated circuits and flexible electronics.},

By implementing “flexible joints,” “mechanical stoppers,” and “buckling zones,” structures are engineered to be not only load-bearing and durable, but also impact-resistant. To practice the performance of the design concept in real-life applications, the developed structures are integrated into 3D printed airplane wing models that withstood collisions without failure.

  abstract     = {Tin (Sn)-based perovskites with favorable optoelectronic properties and ideal bandgaps have emerged as promising alternatives to toxic lead (Pb)-based perovskites for photovoltaic applications. However, it is challenging to obtain high-quality Sn-based perovskite films by solution process. Here, liquid-exfoliated 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (i.e., MoS 2 , WS 2 , and WSe 2 ) with smooth and defect-free surfaces are applied as growth templates for spin-coated FASnI 3 perovskite films, leading to van der Waals epitaxial growth of perovskite grains with a growth orientation along (100). The authors find that WSe 2 has better energy alignment with FASnI 3 than MoS 2 and WS 2 and results in a cascade band structure in resultant perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which can facilitate hole extraction and suppress interfacial charge recombination in the devices. The WSe 2 -modified PSCs show a power conversion efficiency up to 10.47%, which is among the highest efficiency of FASnI 3 -based PSCs. The appealing solution phase epitaxial growth of FASnI 3 perovskite on 2D WSe 2 flakes is expected to find broad applications in optoelectronic devices.},

Here, a novel photo-crosslinked and pH-responsive polymersome (Psome B) with 2-( N , N ′-diisopropylamino)ethyl units in the membrane and its respective Avidin-Psome B hybrids, are reported as good candidates for artificial organelles. Biotinylated (macro)molecules are able to dock and diffuse into Avidin-Psome B to carry out biological activity in a pH- and size-dependent manner. Combined with another polymersome (Psome A) with 2-( N , N ′-diethylamino)ethyl units in the membrane, two different pH-responsive polymersomes for mimicking different organelles in one protocell system are reported. The different intrinsic docking and diffusion processes of cargo (macro)molecules through the membranes of coexisting Psome A and B are pH-dependent as confirmed using pH titration–dynamic light scattering (DLS). Psome A and B show separated “open”, “closing/opening”, and “closed” states at various pH ranges with different membrane permeability. The results pave the way for the construction of multicompartmentalized protocells with controlled communications between different artificial organelles.},

  abstract     = {Lithium is considered to be the ultimate anode material for high energy-density rechargeable batteries. Recent emerging technologies of all solid-state batteries based on sulfide-based electrolytes raise hope for the practical use of lithium, as it is likely to suppress lithium dendrite growth. However, such devices suffer from undesirable side reactions and a degradation of electrochemical performance. In this work, nanostructured Li 2 Se epitaxially grown on Li metal by chemical vapor deposition are investigated as a protective layer. By adjusting reaction time and cooling rate, a morphology of as-prepared Li 2 Se is controlled, resulting in nanoparticles, nanorods, or nanowalls with a dominant (220) plane parallel to the (110) plane of the Li metal substrate. Uniaxial pressing the layers under a pressure of 50 MPa for a cell preparation transforms more compact and denser. Dual compatibility of the Li 2 Se layers with strong chemical bonds to Li metal and uniform physical contact to a Li 6 PS 5 Csulfide electrolyte prevents undesirable side reactions and enables a homogeneous charge transfer at the interface upon cycling. As a result, a full cell coupled with a LiCoO 2 -based cathode shows significantly enhanced electrochemical performance and demonstrates the practical use of Li anodes with Li 2 Se layers for all solid-state battery applications.},

Interventions that restore metabolic homeostasis reduce FGF21. Whether abnormalities in FGF21 secretion or resistance in peripheral tissues is the initiating factor in altering FGF21 levels and function in humans is unknown. A genetic approach is used to help resolve this paradox. The authors demonstrate that the primary event in dysmetabolic phenotypes is the elevation of FGF21 secretion. The latter is regulated by translational reprogramming in a genotype- and context-dependent manner. To relate the findings to tissues outcomes, the minor (A) allele of rs838133 is shown to be associated with increased hepatic inflammation in patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease. The results here highlight a dominant role for translation of the FGF21 protein to explain variations in blood levels that is at least partially inherited. These results provide a framework for translational reprogramming of FGF21 to treat metabolic diseases.},

The systematic understanding of the TCO is limited by the difficulty of properly identifying the proton movement in the TCO. Herein, the isotope exchange diffusion profile (IEDP) method is employed via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to evaluate kinetic properties of proton in the layered perovskite-type TCOs, PrBa 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1.5 Fe 0.5 O 5+ δ (PBSCF).Within the strategy, the PBSCF shows two orders of magnitude higher proton tracer diffusion coefficient ( D * H , 1.04 × 10 −6 cm 2 s −1 at 550 °C) than its oxygen tracer diffusion coefficient at even higher temperature range ( D * O, 1.9 × 10 −8 cm 2 s −1 at 590 °C). Also, the surface exchange coefficient of a proton ( k * H ) is successfully obtained in the value of 2.60 × 10 −7 cm s −1 at 550 °C. In this research, an innovative way is provided to quantify the proton kinetic properties ( D * H and k * H ) of TCOs being a crucial indicator for characterizing the electrochemical behavior of proton and the mechanism of electrode reactions.},

  abstract     = {Resealing of membrane pores is crucial for cell survival. Membrane surface charge and medium composition are studied as defining regulators of membrane stability. Pores are generated by electric field or detergents. Giant vesicles composed of zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids mixed at varying ratios are subjected to a strong electric pulse. Interestingly, charged vesicles appear prone to catastrophic collapse transforming them into tubular structures. The spectrum of destabilization responses includes the generation of long-living submicroscopic pores and partial vesicle bursting. The origin of these phenomena is related to the membrane edge tension, which governs pore closure. This edge tension significantly decreases as a function of the fraction of charged lipids. Destabilization of charged vesicles upon pore formation is universal—it is also observed with other poration stimuli. Disruption propensity is enhanced for membranes made of lipids with higher degree of unsaturation. It can be reversed by screening membrane charge in the presence of calcium ions. The observed findings in light of theories of stability and curvature generation are interpreted and mechanisms acting in cells to prevent total membrane collapse upon poration are discussed. Enhanced membrane stability is crucial for the success of electroporation-based technologies for cancer treatment and gene transfer.},

Safe Mn 2+ dosing is confirmed by measuring in vitro beating rates, calcium transients, and action potentials in cardiomyocytes, and in vivo heart rates and cardiac contractility in mice. Quantitative T1 mapping-manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) reveals elevated and increasing Mn 2+ uptake in viable myocardium remote from the infarct, suggesting MEMRI offers a quantitative biomarker of cardiac inotropy. MEMRI evaluation of infarct size at 1 h, 1 and 14 days after MI quantifies myocardial viability earlier than the current gold-standard technique, late-gadolinium-enhanced MRI. These data, coupled with the re-emergence of clinical Mn 2+ -based contrast agents open the possibility of using MEMRI for direct evaluation of myocardial viability early after ischemic onset in patients.},

TRME, in which a stably transfected, doxycycline-inducible dCas13a is fused to the catalytic domain of ALKBH5, can precisely and reversibly demethylate the targeted m 6 A site of mRNA and increase mRNA stability with limited off-target effects. It is further demonstrated that temporal m 6 A erasure on a single site of SOX2 is sufficient to control the differentiation of hESCs.

Here, seven hepatobiliary tumor organoids are generated to explore heterogeneity and evolution via single-cell RNA sequencing. HCC272 with high status of epithelia-mesenchymal transition proves broad-spectrum drug resistance. By examining the expression pattern of cancer stem cells markers (e.g., PROM1, CD44, and EPCAM), it is found that CD44 positive population may render drug resistance in HCC272. UMAP and pseudo-time analysis identify the intratumoral heterogeneity and distinct evolutionary trajectories, of which catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) advantage expression clusters are commonly shared across hepatobiliary organoids. CellphoneDB analysis further implies that metabolism advantage organoids with enrichment of hypoxia signal upregulate NEAT1 expression in CD44 subgroup and mediate drug resistance that relies on Jak-STAT pathway. Moreover, metabolism advantage clusters shared in several organoids have similar characteristic genes (GAPDH, NDRG1 (N-Myc downstream regulated 1), ALDOA, and CA9). The combination of GAPDH and NDRG1 is an independent risk factor and predictor for patient survival. This study delineates heterogeneity of hepatobiliary tumor organoids and proposes that the collaboration of intratumoral heterogenic subpopulations renders malignant phenotypes and drug resistance.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis has increased drastically in recent years. However, all applications use individual solutions, highly specialized for a particular task. Here, an easy-to-use, adaptable, and open source software, called AIDeveloper (AID) to train neural nets (NN) for image classification without the need for programming is presented. AID provides a variety of NN-architectures, allowing to apply trained models on new data, obtain performance metrics, and export final models to different formats. AID is benchmarked on large image datasets (CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST). Furthermore, models are trained to distinguish areas of differentiated stem cells in images of cell culture. A conventional blood cell count and a blood count obtained using an NN are compared, trained on &gt;1.2 million images, and demonstrated how AID can be used for label-free classification of B- and T-cells. All models are generated by non-programmers on generic computers, allowing for an interdisciplinary use.},

  abstract     = {There has been tremendous interest in the development of different innovative wear-resistant materials, which can help to reduce energy losses resulted from friction and wear by ≈40% over the next 10–15 years. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on designs, properties, and applications of wear-resistant materials, starting with an introduction of various advanced technologies for the fabrication of wear-resistant materials and anti-wear structures with their wear mechanisms. Typical strategies of surface engineering and matrix strengthening for the development of wear-resistant materials are then analyzed, focusing on the development of coatings, surface texturing, surface hardening, architecture, and the exploration of matrix compositions, microstructures, and reinforcements. Afterward, the relationship between the wear resistance of a material and its intrinsic properties including hardness, stiffness, strength, and cyclic plasticity is discussed with underlying mechanisms, such as the lattice distortion effect, bonding strength effect, grain size effect, precipitation effect, grain boundary effect, dislocation or twinning effect. A wide range of fundamental applications, specifically in aerospace components, automobile parts, wind turbines, micro-/nano-electromechanical systems, atomic force microscopes, and biomedical devices are highlighted. This review is concluded with prospects on challenges and future directions in this critical field.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular glutamine represents an important energy source for many cancer cells and its metabolism is intimately involved in maintaining redox homeostasis. The heightened metabolic activity within tumor tissues can result in glutamine deficiency, necessitating metabolic reprogramming responses. Here, dual mechanisms involving the stress-responsive transcription factor DDIT3 (DNA damage induced transcript 3) that establishes an interrelationship between glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration are revealed. DDIT3 is induced during glutamine deprivation to promote glycolysis and adenosine triphosphate production via suppression of the negative glycolytic regulator TIGAR. In concert, a proportion of the DDIT3 pool translocates to the mitochondria and suppresses oxidative phosphorylation through LONP1-mediated down-regulation of COQ9 and COX4. This in turn dampens the sustained levels of reactive oxygen species that follow glutamine withdrawal. Together these mechanisms constitute an adaptive survival mechanism permitting tumor cells to survive metabolic stress induced by glutamine starvation.},

  abstract     = {Development of liver fibrosis results in drastic changes in the liver microenvironment, which in turn accelerates disease progression. Although the pathological function of various hepatic cells in fibrogenesis is identified, the crosstalk between them remains obscure. The present study demonstrates that hepatic expression of adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is induced especially in the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in mice after bile duct ligation (BDL). Genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of A-FABP attenuate BDL- or carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in mice associating with reduced collagen accumulation, LSEC capillarization, and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Mechanistically, elevated A-FABP promotes LSEC capillarization by activating Hedgehog signaling, thus impairs the gatekeeper function of LSEC on HSC activation. LSEC-derived A-FABP also acts on HSCs in paracrine manner to potentiate the transactivation of transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF β 1) by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling. Elevated TGF β 1 subsequently exaggerates liver fibrosis. These findings uncover a novel pathological mechanism of liver fibrosis in which LSEC-derived A-FABP is a key regulator modulating the onset and progression of the disease. Targeting A-FABP may represent a potential approach against liver fibrosis.},

Herein, a novel vdWH field-effect transistor (FET) composed of molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe 2 ) and palladium diselenide (PdSe 2 ) is studied for highly sensitive photodetection performance in the broad visible and near-infrared (VNIR) region. A high rectification ratio of 6.3 × 10 5 is obtained, stemming from the sharp interface and low Schottky barriers of the MoTe 2 /PdSe 2 vdWHs. It is also successfully demonstrated that the vdWH FET exhibits highly sensitive photo-detecting abilities, such as noticeably high photoresponsivity (1.24 × 10 5 A W −1 ), specific detectivity (2.42 × 10 14 Jones), and good external quantum efficiency (3.5 × 10 6 ), not only due to the intra-TMD band-to-band transition but also due to the inter-TMD charge transfer (CT) transition. Further, rapid rise (16.1 µs) and decay (31.1 µs) times are obtained under incident light with a wavelength of 2000 nm due to the CT transition, representing an outcome one order of magnitude faster than values currently in the literature. Such TMD-based vdWH FETs would improve the photo-gating characteristics and provide a platform for the realization of a highly sensitive photodetector in the broad VNIR region.},

This study reports the first inhibitor of DR6/APP interaction as a novel class of anti-hematogenous metastatic agent. By rationally utilizing three combined strategies including selection based on phage display library, d -retro-inverso modification, and multiple conjugation of screened peptidomimetic with 4-arm PEG, the polymer–peptidomimetic conjugate PEG-tAHP-DRI (tetra-(D-retro-inverso isomer of AHP-12) substitued 4-arm PEG 5k ) is obtained as the most promising agent with the strongest binding potency ( K D = 51.12 × 10 −9 m ) and excellent pharmacokinetic properties. Importantly, PEG-tAHP-DRI provides efficient protection against TC-induced ECs necroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, this ligand exhibits prominent anti-hematogenous metastatic activity in serval different metastatic mouse models (B16F10, 4T1, CT26, and spontaneous lung metastasis of 4T1 orthotopic tumor model) and displays no apparent detrimental effects in preliminary safety evaluation. Collectively, this study demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting DR6/APP interaction to regulate hematogenous tumor cells transendothelial migration and provides PEG-tAHP-DRI as a novel and promising inhibitor of DR6/APP interaction for developments of anti-hematogenous metastatic therapies.},

However, it remains quite challenging because conventional CT can only identify the difference in density instead of X-ray attenuation characteristics. Spectral CT can generate monochromatic imaging to specify X-ray attenuation characteristics of the scanned matter. Herein, an X-ray energy-dependent attenuation strategy originated from bismuth (Bi)-based nanoprobes (BiF 3 @PDA@HA) is proposed for the accurate diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Bi element in BiF 3 @PDA@HA can exhibit characteristic attenuation depending on different levels of X-ray energy via spectral CT, and that is challenging for conventional CT. In this study, selectively accumulating BiF 3 @PDA@HA nanoprobes in the hepatic fibrosis areas can significantly elevate CT value for 40 Hounsfield units on 70 keV monochromatic images, successfully differentiating from healthy livers and achieving the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Furthermore, the enhancement produced by the BiF 3 @PDA@HA nanoprobes in vivo increases as the monochromatic energy decreases from 70 to 40 keV, optimizing the conspicuity of the diseased areas. As a proof of concept, the strategically designed nanoprobes with energy-dependent attenuation characteristics not only expand the scope of CT application, but also hold excellent potential for precise imaging-based disease diagnosis.},

The treatment of brain diseases is challenging partly due to the inaccessibility of therapeutic agents to the brain. An increasingly important observation is that the physiology of the brain alters during many brain diseases, and aging adds even more to the complexity of the disease. There is a notion that the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) increases with aging or disease, however, the body has a defense mechanism that still retains the separation of the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood. This makes drug delivery to the diseased brain, even more challenging and complex task. Here, the physiological changes to the diseased brain and aged brain are covered in the context of drug delivery to the brain using nanoparticles. Also, recent and novel approaches are discussed for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the diseased brain using nanoparticle based or magnetic resonance imaging guided systems.

Integration of plasmonic optical switching devices with optical fibers is a breakthrough for realizing practical applications in long-range optical data transmission or communication techniques. Here, the incorporation of plasmonic optical switch devices onto the end facets of optical fibers is reported, so that the switched optical signals are generated by interaction between femtosecond laser pulses and plasmonic nanostructures on one end of the fiber, and are delivered via the fiber waveguide to the other end for detection or decoding. “Quenching” of localized surface plasmon in the gold nanowires by its interaction with band-edge modulation in gold through strong optical excitation is the responsible photophysics. This work accomplishes for the first time the implementation of ultrafast plasmonic optical switch device on optical fiber tips for logic data transmission.},

In this paper, a 3D alveolar barrier model fabricated by printing four human alveolar cell lines, namely, type I and II alveolar cells (NCI-H1703 and NCI-H441), lung fibroblasts (MRC5), and lung microvascular endothelial cells (HULEC-5a) is presented. Automated high-resolution deposition of alveolar cells by drop-on-demand inkjet printing enables to fabricate a three-layered alveolar barrier model with an unprecedented thickness of ≈10 µm. The results show that the 3D structured model better recapitulate the structure, morphologies, and functions of the lung tissue, compared not only to a conventional 2D cell culture model, as expected, but also a 3D non-structured model of a homogeneous mixture of the alveolar cells and collagen. Finally, it is demonstrated that this thin multilayered model reproduce practical tissue-level responses to influenza infection. Drop-on-demand inkjet-printing is an enabling technology for customization, scalable manufacturing, and standardization of their size and growth, and it is believed that this 3D alveolar barrier model can be used as an alternative to traditional test models for pathological and pharmaceutical applications.},

However, outdoor solar energy gain has restricted the efficiency of some wearable devices like oximeters. Herein, wireless/battery-free and thermally regulated patch-type tissue oximeter (PTO) with radiative cooling structures are presented, which can measure tissue oxygenation under sunlight in reliable manner and will benefit athlete training. To maximize the radiative cooling performance, a nano/microvoids polymer (NMVP) is introduced by combining two perforated polymers to both reduce sunlight absorption and maximize thermal radiation. The optimized NMVP exhibits sub-ambient cooling of 6 °C in daytime under various conditions such as scattered/overcast clouds, high humidity, and clear weather. The NMVP-integrated PTO enables maintaining temperature within ≈1 °C on the skin under sunlight relative to indoor measurement, whereas the normally used, black encapsulated PTO shows over 40 °C owing to solar absorption. The heated PTO exhibits an inaccurate tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) value of ≈67% compared with StO 2 in a normal state (i.e., ≈80%). However, the thermally protected PTO presents reliable StO 2 of ≈80%. This successful demonstration provides a feasible strategy of thermal management in wearable devices for outdoor applications.},

  abstract     = {Human intestinal organoids from primary human tissues have the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine and preclinical gastrointestinal disease models. A tunable, fully defined, designer matrix, termed hyaluronan elastin-like protein (HELP) is reported, which enables the formation, differentiation, and passaging of adult primary tissue-derived, epithelial-only intestinal organoids. HELP enables the encapsulation of dissociated patient-derived cells, which then undergo proliferation and formation of enteroids, spherical structures with polarized internal lumens. After 12 rounds of passaging, enteroid growth in HELP materials is found to be statistically similar to that in animal-derived matrices. HELP materials also support the differentiation of human enteroids into mature intestinal cell subtypes. HELP matrices allow stiffness, stress relaxation rate, and integrin-ligand concentration to be independently and quantitatively specified, enabling fundamental studies of organoid–matrix interactions and potential patient-specific optimization. Organoid formation in HELP materials is most robust in gels with stiffer moduli ( G’ ≈ 1 kPa), slower stress relaxation rate ( t 1/2 ≈ 18 h), and higher integrin ligand concentration (0.5 × 10 −3 –1 × 10 −3 m RGD peptide). This material provides a promising in vitro model for further understanding intestinal development and disease in humans and a reproducible, biodegradable, minimal matrix with no animal-derived products or synthetic polyethylene glycol for potential clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS) is a group of severe inherited disorders caused by mutations in genes, such as deoxyribonucleoside kinase (DGUOK). A great majority of DGUOK mutant MDS patients develop iron overload progressing to severe liver failure. However, the pathological mechanisms connecting iron overload and hepatic damage remains uncovered. Here, two patients’ skin fibroblasts are reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then corrected by CRISPR/Cas9. Patient-specific iPSCs and corrected iPSCs-derived high purity hepatocyte organoids (iHep-Orgs) and hepatocyte-like cells (iHep) are generated as cellular models for studying hepatic pathology. DGUOK mutant iHep and iHep-Orgs, but not control and corrected one, are more sensitive to iron overload-induced ferroptosis, which can be rescued by N-Acetylcysteine (NAC). Mechanically, this ferroptosis is a process mediated by nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4)-dependent degradation of ferritin in lysosome and cellular labile iron release. This study reveals the underlying pathological mechanisms and the viable therapeutic strategies of this syndrome, and is the first pure iHep-Orgs model in hereditary liver diseases.},

  abstract     = {Low-temperature solution-processed TiO 2 nanocrystals (LT-TiO 2 ) have been extensively applied as electron transport layer (ETL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the low electron mobility, high density of electronic trap states, and considerable photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 result in undesirable charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface and notorious instability of PSCs under ultraviolet (UV) light. Herein, LT-TiO 2 nanocrystals are in situ fluorinated via a simple nonhydrolytic method, affording formation of Ti─F bonds, and consequently increase electron mobility, decrease density of electronic trap states, and inhibit photocatalytic activity. Upon applying fluorinated TiO 2 nanocrystals (F-TiO 2 ) as ETL, regular-structure planar heterojunction PSC (PHJ-PSC) achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.68%, which is among the highest PCEs for PHJ-PSCs based on LT-TiO 2 ETLs. Flexible PHJ-PSC devices based on F-TiO 2 ETL exhibit the best PCE of 18.26%, which is the highest value for TiO 2 -based flexible devices. The bonded F atoms on the surface of TiO 2 promote the formation of Pb─F bonds and hydrogen bonds between F − and FA/MA organic cations, reinforcing interface binding of perovskite layer with TiO 2 ETL. This contributes to effective passivation of the surface trap states of perovskite film, resulting in enhancements of device efficiency and stability especially under UV light.},

  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One of the risk factors for HF is cardiac hypertrophy (CH), which is frequently accompanied by cardiac fibrosis (CF). CH and CF are controlled by master regulators mTORC1 and TGF- β , respectively. Type-2-phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate-4-kinase-gamma (Pip4k2c) is a known mTORC1 regulator. It is shown that Pip4k2c is significantly downregulated in the hearts of CH and HF patients as compared to non-injured hearts. The role of Pip4k2c in the heart during development and disease is unknown. It is shown that deleting Pip4k2c does not affect normal embryonic cardiac development; however, three weeks after TAC, adult Pip4k2c −/− mice has higher rates of CH, CF, and sudden death than wild-type mice. In a gain-of-function study using a TAC mouse model, Pip4k2c is transiently upregulated using a modified mRNA (modRNA) gene delivery platform, which significantly improve heart function, reverse CH and CF, and lead to increased survival. Mechanistically, it is shown that Pip4k2c inhibits TGF β 1 via its N-terminal motif, Pip5k1 α , phospho-AKT 1/2/3, and phospho-Smad3. In sum, loss-and-gain-of-function studies in a TAC mouse model are used to identify Pip4k2c as a potential therapeutic target for CF, CH, and HF, for which modRNA is a highly translatable gene therapy approach.},

  abstract     = {Spin-torque memristors are proposed in 2009, and can provide fast, low-power, and infinite memristive behavior for neuromorphic computing and large-density non-volatile memory. However, the strict requirements of combining high magnetoresistance, stable domain wall pinning and current-induced switching in a single device pose difficulties in physical implementation. Here, a nanoscale spin-torque memristor based on a perpendicular-anisotropy magnetic tunnel junction with a CoFeB/W/CoFeB composite free layer structure is experimentally demonstrated. Its tunneling magnetoresistance is higher than 200%, and memristive behavior can be realized by spin-transfer torque switching. Memristive states are retained by strong domain wall pinning effects in the free layer. Experiments and simulations suggest that nanoscale vertical chiral spin textures can form around clusters of W atoms under the combined effect of opposite Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions and the Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida interaction between the two CoFeB free layers. Energy fluctuation caused by these textures may be the main reason for the strong pinning effect. With the experimentally demonstrated memristive behavior and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a spiking neural network to perform handwritten pattern recognition in an unsupervised manner is simulated. Due to advantages such as long endurance and high speed, the spin-torque memristors are competitive in the future applications for neuromorphic computing.},

Droplets are created in a specially designed nanopipette and propelled by gas through the capillary to the microfluidic chip where a passive valve mechanism separates liquid from gas, allowing their delivery. By adjusting the driving pressure and microfluidic geometry, both partial and full delivery of 10 nanoliter droplets with 0.4 nanoliter maximum error, as well as sampling from the environment are demonstrated. This system will enable drug delivery and sampling with minimally invasive probes, facilitating continuous liquid biopsy for disease monitoring and in vivo drug screening.},

  abstract     = {Despite rapid improvements in efficiency, long-term stability remains a challenge limiting the future up-scaling of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although several approaches have been developed to improve the stability of PSCs, applying ammonium passivation materials in bilayer configuration PSCs has drawn intensive research interest due to the potential of simultaneously improving long-term stability and boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE). This review focuses on the recent advances of improving n- i -p PSCs photovoltaic performance by employing ammonium halide-based molecular modulators. The first section briefly summarizes the challenges of perovskite materials by introducing the degradation mechanisms associated with the hygroscopic nature and ion migration issues. Then, recent reports regarding the roles of overlayers formed from ammonium-based passivation agents are discussed on the basis of ligand and halide effects. This includes both the formation of 2D perovskite films as well as purely organic passivating layers. Finally, the last section provides future perspectives on the use of organic ammonium halides within bilayer-architecture PSCs to improve the photovoltaic performances. Overall, this review provides a roadmap on current demands and future research directions of molecular modulators to address the critical limitations of PSCs, to mitigate the major barriers on the pathway toward future up-scaling applications.},

In this study, the transcriptomic and immunopathological changes associated with airway exposure to a total of 28 engineered nanomaterials (ENM) are investigated. The ENM are selected to have different core (Ag, Au, TiO 2 , CuO, nanodiamond, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes) and surface chemistries (COOH, NH 2 , or polyethylene glycosylation (PEG)). Additionally, ENM with variations in either size (Au) or shape (TiO 2 ) are included. Mice are exposed to 10 µg of ENM by oropharyngeal aspiration for 4 consecutive days, followed by extensive histological/cytological analyses and transcriptomic characterization of lung tissue. The results demonstrate that transcriptomic alterations are correlated with the inflammatory cell infiltrate in the lungs. Surface modification has varying effects on the airways with amination rendering the strongest inflammatory response, while PEGylation suppresses toxicity. However, toxicological responses are also dependent on ENM core chemistry. In addition to ENM-specific transcriptional changes, a subset of 50 shared differentially expressed genes is also highlighted that cluster these ENM according to their toxicity. This study provides the largest in vivo data set currently available and as such provides valuable information to be utilized in developing predictive models for ENM toxicity.},

To repolarize their phenotype into a tumoricidal state, the Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist imidazoquinoline IMDQ is site-specifically and quantitatively coupled to single chain antibody fragments, so-called nanobodies, targeting the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) on TAMs. Intravenous injection of these conjugates result in a tumor- and cell-specific delivery of IMDQ into MMR high TAMs, causing a significant decline in tumor growth. This is accompanied by a repolarization of TAMs towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype and an increase in anti-tumor T cell responses. Therefore, the therapeutic benefit of such nanobody-drug conjugates may pave the road towards effective macrophage re-educating cancer immunotherapies.},

  abstract     = {This work reports a novel approach for the synthesis of FeCo alloy nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in the N,P-codoped carbon coated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NPC/FeCo@NCNTs). Specifically, the synthesis of NCNT is achieved by the calcination of graphene oxide-coated polystyrene spheres with Fe 3+ , Co 2+ and melamine adsorbed, during which graphene oxide is transformed into carbon nanotubes and simultaneously nitrogen is doped into the graphitic structure. The NPC/FeCo@NCNT is demonstrated to be an efficient and durable bifunctional catalyst for oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It only needs an overpotential of 339.5 mV to deliver 10 mA cm −2 for OER and an onset potential of 0.92 V to drive ORR. Its bifunctional catalytic activities outperform those of the composite catalyst Pt/C + RuO 2 and most bifunctional catalysts reported. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations have demonstrated that the interplay between FeCo NPs and NCNT and the presence of N,P-codoped carbon structure play important roles in increasing the catalytic activities of the NPC/FeCo@NCNT. More impressively, the NPC/FeCo@NCNT can be used as the air-electrode catalyst, improving the performance of rechargeable liquid and flexible all-solid-state zinc–air batteries.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide, is often accompanied by uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells. Dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1 (DKC1), screened using the genome-wide RNAi strategy, is a previously unidentified key regulator that promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation. Enforced expression of DKC1, but not its catalytically inactive mutant D125A, accelerates cell growth in vitro and in vivo. DKC1 knockdown or its inhibitor pyrazofurin attenuates cell proliferation. Proteomics, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-seq, and RNA decay analyses reveal that DKC1 binds to and stabilizes the mRNA of several ribosomal proteins (RPs), including RPL10A , RPL22L1 , RPL34 , and RPS3 . DKC1 depletion significantly accelerates mRNA decay of these RPs, which mediates the oncogenic function of DKC1. Interestingly, these DKC1-regulated RPs also interact with HRAS and suppress the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Pyrazofurin and trametinib combination synergistically restrains colorectal cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, DKC1 is markedly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Colorectal cancer patients with higher DKC1 expression has consistently poorer overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes. Taken together, these data suggest that DKC1 is an essential gene and candidate therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.},

Based on the central sensitization mechanism, the MMPPS can switch between different working modes and thus offers a smarter protection mechanism to human body. Accordingly, before injury MMPPS can offer warning of excessive pressure with normal pressure threshold. After injury, extra care on the periphery of damage will be activated by decreasing the pressure threshold. Furthermore, the MMPPS will gradually recover back to a normal state as damage heals. Although current devices can realize basic functions like damage localization and nociceptor signal imitating, the development of a human-like MMPPS is still a great challenge. Here, a bio-inspired MMPPS is developed for prosthetics protection, in which all working modes is realized and controlled by mimicking the central sensitization mechanism. Accordingly, the system warns one of a potential injury, identifies the damaged area, and subsequently offers extra care. The proposed system can open new avenues for designing next-generation prosthetics, especially make other smart sensing systems operate under complete protection against injuries.},

Stretchable and flexible form factors are essential in biointegrated electronic applications for conformal integration with soft and expandable skins, tissues, and organs. Here a fully biodegradable MgZnCa metallic glass (MG) film is proposed for intrinsically stretchable electrodes with a high yield limit exploiting the advantages of amorphous phases with no crystalline defects. The irregular dissolution behavior of this amorphous alloy regarding electrical conductivity and morphology is investigated in aqueous solutions with different ion species. The MgZnCa MG nanofilm shows high elastic strain (≈2.6% in the nano-tensile test) and offers enhanced stretchability (≈115% when combined with serpentine geometry). The fatigue resistance in repeatable stretching also improves owing to the wide range of the elastic strain limit. Electronic components including the capacitor, inductor, diode, and transistor using the MgZnCa MG electrode support its integrability to transient electronic devices. The biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator of MgZnCa MG operates stably over 50 000 cycles and its fatigue resistant applications in mechanical energy harvesting are verified. In vitro cell toxicity and in vivo inflammation tests demonstrate the biocompatibility in biointegrated use.},

  abstract     = {Tissue spreading represents a key morphogenetic feature of embryonic development and regenerative medicine. However, how molecular signaling orchestrates the spreading dynamics and cell fate commitment of multicellular tissue remains poorly understood. Here, it is demonstrated that the dynamic counterbalance between RAC1–YAP and OB-cadherin plays a key role in coordinating heterogeneous spreading dynamics with distinct cell fate patterning during collective spreading. The spatiotemporal evolution of individual stem cells in spheroids during collective spreading is mapped. Time-lapse cell migratory trajectory analysis combined with in situ cellular biomechanics detection reveal heterogeneous patterns of collective spreading characteristics, where the cells at the periphery are faster, stiffer, and directional compared to those in the center of the spheroid. Single-cell sequencing shows that the divergent spreading result in distinct cell fate patterning, where differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism are enhanced in peripheral cells. Molecular analysis demonstrates that the increased expression of RAC1–YAP rather than OB-cadherin facilitated cell spreading and induced differentiation, and vice versa. The in vivo wound healing experiment confirms the functional role of RAC1–YAP signaling in tissue spreading. These findings shed light on the mechanism of tissue morphogenesis in the progression of development and provide a practical strategy for desirable regenerative therapies.},

In particular, polymeric nanoparticles have shown enormous potentials owing to their unique properties, such as high tunability, ease of synthesis, and control over drug release profile. However, careful analysis of their performance in effective drug transport across the BBB should be performed using clinically relevant testing models. In this review, polymeric nanoparticle systems for drug delivery to the central nervous system are discussed with an emphasis on the effects of particle size, shape, and surface modifications on BBB penetration. Moreover, the authors critically analyze the current in vitro and in vivo models used to evaluate BBB penetration efficacy, including the latest developments in the BBB-on-a-chip models.

In this multicenter study, plasma samples are collected from patients with stable angina after PCI, and these patients are followed-up for 9 months for angina recurrence. Broad-spectrum metabolomic profiling with LC-MS/MS followed by multiple machine learning algorithms is conducted to identify the metabolic signatures associated with future risk of angina recurrence in two large cohorts ( n = 750 for discovery set, and n = 775 for additional independent discovery cohort). The metabolic predictors are further validated in a third cohort from another center ( n = 130) using a clinically-sound quantitative approach. Compared to angina-free patients, the remitted patients with future RA demonstrates a unique chemical endophenotype dominated by abnormalities in chemical communication across lipid membranes and mitochondrial function. A novel multi-metabolite predictive model constructed from these latent signatures can stratify remitted patients at high-risk for angina recurrence with over 89% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity across three independent cohorts. Our findings revealed reproducible plasma metabolic signatures to predict patients with a latent future risk of RA during post-PCI remission, allowing them to be treated in advance before an event.},

  abstract     = {The boom of plant phenotype highlights the need to measure the physiological characteristics of an individual plant. However, continuous real-time monitoring of a plant&#39;s internal physiological status remains challenging using traditional silicon-based sensor technology, due to the fundamental mismatch between rigid sensors and soft and curved plant surfaces. Here, the first flexible electronic sensing device is reported that can harmlessly cohabitate with the plant and continuously monitor its stem sap flow, a critical plant physiological characteristic for analyzing plant health, water consumption, and nutrient distribution. Due to a special design and the materials chosen, the realized plant-wearable sensor is thin, soft, lightweight, air/water/light-permeable, and shows excellent biocompatibility, therefore enabling the sap flow detection in a continuous and non-destructive manner. The sensor can serve as a noninvasive, high-throughput, low-cost toolbox, and holds excellent potentials in phenotyping. Furthermore, the real-time investigation on stem flow insides watermelon reveals a previously unknown day/night shift pattern of water allocation between fruit and its adjacent branch, which has not been reported before.},

  abstract     = {The CCR4-NOT complex is a major mRNA deadenylase in eukaryotes, comprising the catalytic subunits CNOT6/6L and CNOT7/8, as well as CNOT4, a regulatory subunit with previously undetermined functions. These subunits have been hypothesized to play synergistic biochemical functions during development. Cnot7 knockout male mice have been reported to be infertile. In this study, viable Cnot6 / 6l double knockout mice are constructed, and the males are fertile. These results indicate that CNOT7 has CNOT6/6L-independent functions in vivo. It is also demonstrated that CNOT4 is required for post-implantation embryo development and meiosis progression during spermatogenesis. Conditional knockout of Cnot4 in male germ cells leads to defective DNA damage repair and homologous crossover between X and Y chromosomes. CNOT4 functions as a previously unrecognized mRNA adaptor of CCR4-NOT by targeting mRNAs to CNOT7 for deadenylation of poly(A) tails, thereby mediating the degradation of a subset of transcripts from the zygotene to pachytene stage. The mRNA removal promoted by the CNOT4-regulated CCR4-NOT complex during the zygotene-to-pachytene transition is crucial for the appropriate expression of genes involved in the subsequent events of spermatogenesis, normal DNA double-strand break repair during meiosis, efficient crossover between X and Y chromosomes, and ultimately, male fertility.},

  abstract     = {The two cultivated allopolyploid cottons, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense , represent a remarkable example of parallel independent domestication, both involving dramatic morphological transformations under selection from wild perennial plants to annualized row crops. Deep resequencing of 643 newly sampled accessions spanning the wild-to-domesticated continuum of both species, and their allopolyploid relatives, are combined with existing data to resolve species relationships and elucidate multiple aspects of their parallel domestication. It is confirmed that wild G. hirsutum and G. barbadense were initially domesticated in the Yucatan Peninsula and NW South America, respectively, and subsequently spread under domestication over 4000–8000 years to encompass most of the American tropics. A robust phylogenomic analysis of infraspecific relationships in each species is presented, quantify genetic diversity in both, and describe genetic bottlenecks associated with domestication and subsequent diffusion. As these species became sympatric over the last several millennia, pervasive genome-wide bidirectional introgression occurred, often with striking asymmetries involving the two co-resident genomes of these allopolyploids. Diversity scans revealed genomic regions and genes unknowingly targeted during domestication and additional subgenomic asymmetries. These analyses provide a comprehensive depiction of the origin, divergence, and adaptation of cotton, and serve as a rich resource for cotton improvement.},

Nap-G d F d F d Y, a tetrapeptide hydrogel that has been previously reported to exhibit adjuvant effect, is inadvertently found to contain conserved peptide sequence for insulin, proinsulin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase, 3 major autoantigens for the autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D). At present, despite being managed clinically with insulin replacement therapy, T1D remains a major health threat with rapidly increasing incidences, especially in children and young adults, and antigen-specific immune tolerance induction has been proposed as a feasible approach to prevent or delay T1D progression at an early stage. Here, it is reported that innoculation of Nap-G d F d F d Y leads to complete protection of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice from T1D development till the age of 36 weeks. Better maintenance of pancreatic islet morphology with minimal immune cell infiltration is also observed from mice exposed to Nap-G d F d F d Y. This beneficial impact is mainly due to its facilitative role on enhancing peripheral T regulatory cell (Treg) population, shown as increased splenic Treg percentage, and function, demonstrated by maintenance of circulating TGF- β 1 level. Serum cytokine microarray data further implicate a “buffering” role of Nap-G d F d F d Y on systemic inflammatory tone in NOD mice. Thus, with its versatility, applicability, and excellent potency, Nap-G d F d F d Y is posited as a novel therapeutic intervention for T1D.},

There is an urgent medical need to elucidate how cancer cells evade immune response and to develop novel means to boost the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, alcohol induces ligand programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-L1) expression of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Alcohol exposure is shown to induce aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) expression that is a crucial enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism, and low level of lymphocytes infiltration in the murine CRC model and patients. Intriguingly, ALDH2 and PD-L1 protein expression are positively correlated in tumor tissues from the CRC patients. Mechanistically, ALDH2 stabilizes PD-L1 protein expression by physically interacting with the intracellular segment of PD-L1 and inhibiting its proteasome-dependent degradation mediated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase Speckle Type POZ Protein (SPOP). Importantly, inhibition of ALDH2 reduces PD-L1 protein in CRC cells and promotes tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) infiltration, presumably leading to the significant potentiation of anti-PD-1 antibody efficacy in a mouse CT26 CRC model. The findings highlight a crucial role played by ALDH2 to facilitate alcohol-mediated tumor escape from immunity surveillance and promote tumor progression.},

Gas plasma technology capable of generating an unmatched variety of ROS/RNS is deployed to mimic inflammation and study the significance of ROS/RNS modifications using the model protein chicken ovalbumin (Ova vs oxOva). Dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism spectroscopy reveal structural modifications in oxOva compared to Ova. T cells from Ova-specific OT-II but not from C57BL/6 or SKH-1 wild type mice presents enhanced activation after Ova addition. OxOva exacerbates this activation when administered ex vivo or in vivo, along with an increased interferon-gamma production, a known anti-melanoma agent. OxOva vaccination of wild type mice followed by inoculation of syngeneic B16F10 Ova-expressing melanoma cells shows enhanced T cell number and activation, decreased tumor burden, and elevated numbers of antigen-presenting cells when compared to their Ova-vaccinated counterparts. Analysis of oxOva using mass spectrometry identifies three hot spots regions rich in oxidative modifications that are associated with the increased T cell activation. Using Ova as a model protein, the findings suggest an immunomodulating role of multi-ROS/RNS modifications that may spur novel research lines in inflammation research and for vaccination strategies in oncology.},

Here, a dimension reduction approach of landscape (DRL) for complex dynamical systems is proposed, by mapping a high-dimensional system on a low-dimensional energy landscape. The DRL approach is applied to three biological networks, which validates that new reduced dimensions preserve the major information of stability and transition of original high-dimensional systems. The consistency of barrier heights calculated from the low-dimensional landscape and transition actions calculated from the high-dimensional system further shows that the landscape after dimension reduction can quantify the global stability of the system. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and abnormal metabolism are two hallmarks of cancer. With the DRL approach, a quadrastable landscape for metabolism-EMT network is identified, including epithelial (E), abnormal metabolic (A), hybrid E/M (H), and mesenchymal (M) cell states. The quantified energy landscape and kinetic transition paths suggest that for the EMT process, the cells at E state need to first change their metabolism, then enter the M state. The work proposes a general framework for the dimension reduction of a stochastic dynamical system, and advances the mechanistic understanding of the underlying relationship between EMT and cellular metabolism.},

Emerging evidence reveals that PRMT5 is involved in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation and cancer development. However, the exact role of PRMT5 in human lung cancer cell proliferation and the underlying molecular mechanism remain largely elusive. Here, it is shown that PRMT5 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation through the Smad7-STAT3 axis. Depletion or inhibition of PRMT5 dramatically dampens STAT3 activation and thus suppresses the proliferation of human lung cancer cells. Furthermore, depletion of Smad7 blocks PRMT5-mediated STAT3 activation. Mechanistically, PRMT5 binds to and methylates Smad7 on Arg-57, enhances Smad7 binding to IL-6 co-receptor gp130, and consequently ensures robust STAT3 activation. The findings position PRMT5 as a critical regulator of STAT3 activation, and suggest it as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human lung cancer.},

However, most of the nanomedicines based on ROS-responsive nanocarriers still suffer from serious ROS consumption during the triggered drug release process. Herein, a photodynamic-chemodynamic cascade strategy for the design of drug delivery nanosystem is proposed. A doxorubicin hydrochloride-loaded ROS-responsive polymersome (DOX-RPS) is prepared via the self-assembly of amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(linoleic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol)-(2-(1-hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-α)-iron chelate (PEG-HPPH-Fe). The RPS can effectively deliver a drug to tumor site through passive targeting effect. Upon laser irradiation, the photosensitizer HPPH can efficiently generate ROS, which further causes in situ oxidation of linoleic acid chain and subsequent RPS structural destruction, permitting triggered drug release. Intriguingly, catalyzed by HPPH-Fe, ROS will be regenerated from linoleic acid peroxide through a chemodynamic process. Therefore, ROS-triggered drug release can be achieved without ROS over-consumption. The in vitro and in vivo results confirmed ROS generation, triggered drug release behavior, and potent antitumor effect of the DOX-RPS. This photodynamic-chemodynamic cascade strategy provides a promising approach for enhanced combination therapy.},

  abstract     = {Neurological diseases are a prevalent cause of global mortality and are of growing concern when considering an ageing global population. Traditional treatments are accompanied by serious side effects including repeated treatment sessions, invasive surgeries, or infections. For example, in the case of deep brain stimulation, large, stiff, and battery powered neural probes recruit thousands of neurons with each pulse, and can invoke a vigorous immune response. This paper presents challenges in engineering and neuroscience in developing miniaturized and biointegrated alternatives, in the form of microelectrode probes. Progress in design and topology of neural implants has shifted the goal post toward highly specific recording and stimulation, targeting small groups of neurons and reducing the foreign body response with biomimetic design principles. Implantable device design recommendations, fabrication techniques, and clinical evaluation of the impact flexible, integrated probes will have on the treatment of neurological disorders are provided in this report. The choice of biocompatible material dictates fabrication techniques as novel methods reduce the complexity of manufacture. Wireless power, the final hurdle to truly implantable neural interfaces, is discussed. These aspects are the driving force behind continued research: significant breakthroughs in any one of these areas will revolutionize the treatment of neurological disorders.},

A special class of 2D layered material refers to materials exhibiting phase transition based on environment variables. Among these materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) act as a promising alternative for their unique combination of atomic-scale thickness, direct bandgap, significant spin–orbit coupling and prominent electronic and mechanical properties, enabling them to be applied for fundamental studies as catalyst materials. Metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPTs), as another potential catalytic 2D phase transition material, have been employed for their unusual intercalation behavior and electrochemical properties, which act as a secondary electrode in lithium batteries. The preparation of 2D TMD and MPT materials has been extensively conducted by engineering their intrinsic structures at the atomic scale. In this study, advanced synthesis methods of preparing 2D TMD and MPT materials are tested, and their properties are investigated, with stress placed on their phase transition. The surge of this type of report is associated with water-splitting catalysis and other catalytic purposes. This study aims to be a guideline to explore the mentioned 2D TMD and MPT materials for their catalytic applications.},

The effectiveness and feasibility of SDT are regarded to rely on not only the development of stable and flexible SDT apparatus, but also the screening of sonosensitizers with good specificity and safety. To give an outlook of the development of SDT equipment, the key technologies are discussed according to five aspects including ultrasonic dose settings, sonosensitizer screening, tumor positioning, temperature monitoring, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection. In addition, some state-of-the-art SDT multifunctional equipment integrating diagnosis and treatment for accurate SDT are introduced. Further, an overview of the development of sonosensitizers is provided from small molecular sensitizers to nano/microenhanced sensitizers. Several types of nanomaterial-augmented SDT are in discussion, including porphyrin-based nanomaterials, porphyrin-like nanomaterials, inorganic nanomaterials, and organic–inorganic hybrid nanomaterials with different strategies to improve SDT therapeutic efficacy. There is no doubt that the rapid development and clinical translation of sonodynamic therapy will be promoted by advanced equipment, smart nanomaterial-based sonosensitizer, and multidisciplinary collaboration.},

  abstract     = {Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) remains an attractive alternative for controlling locally advanced cervical cancer. However, approximately 15–34% of women do not respond to induction therapy. To develop a risk stratification tool, 56 patients with stage IB-IIB cervical cancer are included in 2 research centers from the discovery cohort. Patient-specific somatic mutations led to NACT non-responsiveness are identified by whole-exome sequencing. Next, CRISPR/Cas9-based library screenings are performed based on these genes to confirm their biological contribution to drug resistance. A 15-gene classifier is developed by generalized linear regression analysis combined with the logistic regression model. In an independent validation cohort of 102 patients, the classifier showed good predictive ability with an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69–0.91). Furthermore, the 15-gene classifier is significantly associated with patient responsiveness to NACT in both univariate (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% CI, 3.55–32.86; p = 2.8 × 10 −5 ) and multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 17.34; 95% CI, 4.04–74.40; p = 1.23 × 10 −4 ) in the validation set. In conclusion, the 15-gene classifier can accurately predict the clinical response to NACT before treatment, representing a promising approach for guiding the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for locally advanced cervical cancer.},

  abstract     = {Lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease with varying clinical manifestations and outcomes. Many subtypes of lymphoma, such as Burkitt′s lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, are highly aggressive with dismal prognosis even after conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As such, exploring specific biomarkers for lymphoma is of high clinical significance. Herein, a potential marker, CD38, is investigated for differentiating lymphoma. A CD38-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb, daratumumab) is then radiolabeled with Zr-89 and Lu-177 for theranostic applications. As the diagnostic component, the Zr-89-labeled mAb is highly specific in delineating CD38-positive lymphoma via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, while the Lu-177-labeled mAb serves well as the therapeutic component to suppress tumor growth after a one-time administration. These results strongly suggest that CD38 is a lymphoma-specific marker and prove that 89 Zr/ 177 Lu-labeled daratumumab facilitates immunoPET imaging and radioimmunotherapy of lymphoma in preclinical models. Further clinical evaluation and translation of this CD38-targeted theranostics may be of significant help in lymphoma patient stratification and management.},

Neuromorphic devices and sensors with low conductance for low power consumption and high conductance for low-impedance sensing are desired. However, it has been a struggle to find materials and fabrication methods that satisfy both of these properties simultaneously in a single substrate. Here, nanofiber channels with a self-formed ion-blocking layer are fabricated to create organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) that can be tailored to achieve low-power neuromorphic computing and fast-response sensing by transferring different amounts of electrospun nanofibers to each device. With their nanofiber architecture, the OECTs exhibit a low switching energy of 113 fJ and operate within a wide bandwidth (cut-off frequency of 13.5 kHz), opening a new paradigm for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing/sensing platforms in a biological environment without the leakage of personal information.},

  abstract     = {Cullin4B (CUL4B) is a scaffold protein of the CUL4B-Ring E3 ligase (CRL4B) complex. However, the role of CUL4B in the development of breast cancer remains poorly understood. Here it is shown that CRL4B interacts with multiple histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing corepressor complexes, including MTA1/NuRD, SIN3A, CoREST, and NcoR/SMRT complexes. It is demonstrated that CRL4B/NuRD(MTA1) complexes cooccupy the E-cadherin and AXIN2 promoters, and could be recruited by transcription factors including Snail and ZEB2 to promote cell invasion and tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, CUL4B responded to transformation and migration/invasion stimuli and is essential for multiple epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathways such as hypoxia. Furthermore, the transcription of CUL4B is directedly activated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF1 α ) and repressed by the ER α -GATA3 axis. Overexpressing of CUL4B successfully induced CSC-like properties. Strikingly, CUL4B expression is markedly upregulated during breast cancer progression and correlated with poor prognosis. The results suggest that CUL4B lies at a critical crossroads between EMT and stem cell properties, supporting CUL4B as a potential novel target for the development of anti-breast cancer therapy.},

Using the curated benchmark integration data of three viruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV), human herpesvirus (HPV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), DeepVISP achieves high accuracy and robust performance for all three viruses through automatically learning informative features and essential genomic positions only from the DNA sequences. In comparison, DeepVISP outperforms conventional machine learning methods by 8.43–34.33% measured by area under curve (AUC) value enhancement in three viruses. Moreover, DeepVISP can decode cis -regulatory factors that are potentially involved in virus integration and tumorigenesis, such as HOXB7, IKZF1, and LHX6. These findings are supported by multiple lines of evidence in literature. The clustering analysis of the informative motifs reveales that the representative k-mers in clusters could help guide virus recognition of the host genes. A user-friendly web server is developed for predicting putative oncogenic VISs in the human genome using DeepVISP.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the structure–property relationships in Zero-dimensional (0D) organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites ( OMHP s) is essential for their use in optoelectronic applications. Moreover, increasing the emission intensity, particularly for blue emission, is considerably a challenge. Here, intriguing pressure-induced emission ( PIE ) is successfully achieved from an initially nonluminous 0D OMHP [(C 6 H 11 NH 3 ) 4 BiBr 6 ]Br·CH 3 CN ( Cy 4 BiBr 7 ) upon compression. The emission intensity increases significantly, even reaching high-efficiency blue luminescence, as the external pressure is increased to 4.9 GPa. Analyses of the in situ high-pressure experiments and first-principle calculations indicate that the observed PIE can be attributed to the enhanced exciton binding energy associated with [BiBr 6 ] 3– octahedron distortion under pressure. This study of Cy 4 BiBr 7 sheds light on the relationship between the structure and optical properties of OMHP s. The results may improve potential applications of such materials in the fields of pressure sensing and trademark security.},

Here, it is found that colonization with GM from children (CGM) but not from the elderly (EGM) prevents decreases in bone mass and bone strength in conventionally raised, ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing reveals that CGM reverses the OVX-induced reduction of Akkermansia muciniphila ( Akk ). Direct replenishment of Akk is sufficient to correct the OVX-induced imbalanced bone metabolism and protect against osteoporosis. Mechanistic studies show that the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is required for the CGM- and Akk -induced bone protective effects and these nanovesicles can enter and accumulate into bone tissues to attenuate the OVX-induced osteoporotic phenotypes by augmenting osteogenic activity and inhibiting osteoclast formation. The study identifies that gut bacterium Akk mediates the CGM-induced anti-osteoporotic effects and presents a novel mechanism underlying the exchange of signals between GM and host bone.},

However, how these dual activities are regulated and coordinated in specific cellular contexts remains elusive. Here, it is reported that KDM5C, a repressive histone demethylase, unexpectedly activates estrogen receptor alpha (ER α )-target genes, and meanwhile suppresses type I interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to promote ER α -positive breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis. KDM5C-interacting protein, ZMYND8, is found to be involved in both processes. Mechanistically, KDM5C binds to active enhancers and recruits the P-TEFb complex to activate ER α -target genes, while inhibits TBK1 phosphorylation in the cytosol to repress type I IFNs and ISGs. Pharmacological inhibition of both ER α and KDM5C is effective in inhibiting cell growth and tumorigenesis. Taken together, it is revealed that the dual activator and repressor nature of an epigenetic regulator together contributes to cancer development.},

To date, only two de novo biosynthetic routes to NAD + are described, both of which start from a proteinogenic amino acid and are tightly controlled. Here, a de novo quinolinic acid pathway starting from chorismate, which provides an alternative route (named as the C3N pathway) to NAD + biosynthesis, is established. Significantly, the C3N pathway yields extremely high cellular concentrations of NAD(H) in E. coli . Its utility in cofactor engineering is demonstrated by introducing the four-gene C3N module to cell factories to achieve higher production of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and develop an efficient C3N-based whole-cell bioconversion system for preparing chiral amines. The wide distribution and abundance of chorismate in most kingdoms of life implies a general utility of the C3N pathway for modulating cellular levels of NAD(H) in versatile organisms.},

Inspired by natural skin, an ultra-conformable, adhesive multi-functional ionic skin (MiS) with multi-modal sensing capability is devised for smart and expedited wound care. The base of MiS is a unique skin-like, conductive and self-adaptive adhesive polyacrylamide/starch double-network hydrogel (PSH) and self-powered, flexible, triboelectric sensor(s) is integrated on top of PSH for multi-tactile sensing. MiS could enhance wound contraction, collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and epidermis formation in a full-thickness skin defect wound model in vivo , while significantly inhibiting the biofilm formation of a wide range of microorganisms. MiS also exhibits multi-modal sensing capability for smart and instant therapeutics and diagnostics, including skin displacement or joint motion, temperature, pressure and tissue exudate changes of wound bed, and locally releasing drugs in a pH-responsive manner. More importantly, MiS could restore the skin-mimicking tactile sensing function of both touch location and intensity, and thus could be used as a human-machine interface for accurate external robotic control. MiS demonstrates a new comprehensive paradigm of combining wound diagnosis and healing, broad-spectrum anti-microbial capability and restoration of multi-tactile sensing for the reparation of severe wound.},

Here, the neuroprotective effects of DMC are demonstrated in PD. Specifically, RVG-nDMC penetrates the blood brain barrier with enhanced brain-targeted delivery efficiency and is internalized by DA neurons and microglia. In vivo studies demonstrate that RVG-nDMC ameliorates motor deficits and nigral DA neuron death in PD mice without causing overt adverse effects in the brain or other major organs. Moreover, RVG-nDMC reverses tyrosine hydroxylase ubiquitination and degradation, alleviates oxidative stress in DA neurons, and exerts antiinflammatory effects in microglia. The “Trojan horse” strategy for targeted delivery of DMC thus provides a potentially powerful and clinically feasible approach for PD intervention.},

At a current density of 2 C, 67% of the initial discharge capacity is retained after 800 cycles (70% at 20 C), much improved than the undoped Na 0.44 MnO 2 . The improvement is attribute to the enhanced Na + diffusion kinetics and the lowered desodiation energy after Mg doping. Highly reversible charge compensation and structure evolution are proved by synchrotron-based X-ray techniques. Differential charge density and atom population analysis of the average electron number of Mn indicate that Na 0.44 Mn 0.95 Mg 0.05 O 2 is more electron-abundant in Mn 3d orbits near the Fermi level than that in Na 0.44 MnO 2 , leading to higher redox participation of Mn ions.},

  abstract     = {Recent research has built a consensus that the binder plays a key role in the performance of high-capacity silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries. These anodes necessitate the use of a binder to maintain the electrode integrity during the immense volume change of silicon during cycling. Here, Zn 2+ –imidazole coordination crosslinks that are formed to carboxymethyl cellulose backbones in situ during electrode fabrication are reported. The recoverable nature of Zn 2+ –imidazole coordination bonds and the flexibility of the poly(ethylene glycol) chains are jointly responsible for the high elasticity of the binder network. The high elasticity tightens interparticle contacts and sustains the electrode integrity, both of which are beneficial for long-term cyclability. These electrodes, with their commercial levels of areal capacities, exhibit superior cycle life in full-cells paired with LiNi 0.8 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2 cathodes. The present study underlines the importance of highly reversible metal ion-ligand coordination chemistries for binders intended for high capacity alloying-based electrodes.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit exciting properties and versatile material chemistry that are promising for device miniaturization, energy, quantum information science, and optoelectronics. Their outstanding structural stability permits the introduction of various foreign dopants that can modulate their optical and electronic properties and induce phase transitions, thereby adding new functionalities such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, and quantum states. To accelerate their technological readiness, it is essential to develop controllable synthesis and processing techniques to precisely engineer the compositions and phases of 2D TMDs. While most reviews emphasize properties and applications of doped TMDs, here, recent progress on thin-film synthesis and processing techniques that show excellent controllability for substitutional doping of 2D TMDs are reported. These techniques are categorized into bottom–up methods that grow doped samples on substrates directly and top–down methods that use energetic sources to implant dopants into existing 2D crystals. The doped and alloyed variants from Group VI TMDs will be at the center of technical discussions, as they are expected to play essential roles in next-generation optoelectronic applications. Theoretical backgrounds based on first principles calculations will precede the technical discussions to help the reader understand each element&#39;s likelihood of substitutional doping and the expected impact on the material properties.},

  abstract     = {The importance of allopolyploidy in plant evolution has been widely recognized. The genetic changes triggered by allopolyploidy, however, are not yet fully understood due to inconsistent phenomena reported across diverse species. The construction of synthetic polyploids offers a controlled approach to systematically reveal genomic changes that occur during the process of polyploidy. This study reports the first fully sequenced synthetic allopolyploid constructed from a cross between Cucumis sativus and C. hystrix , with high-quality assembly. The two subgenomes are confidently partitioned and the C. sativus -originated subgenome predominates over the C. hystrix -originated subgenome, retaining more sequences and showing higher homeologous gene expression. Most of the genomic changes emerge immediately after interspecific hybridization. Analysis of a series of genome sequences from several generations (S 0 , S 4 –S 13 ) of C . × hytivus confirms that genomic changes occurred in the very first generations, subsequently slowing down as the process of diploidization is initiated. The duplicated genome of the allopolyploid with double genes from both parents broadens the genetic base of C . × hytivus , resulting in enhanced phenotypic plasticity. This study provides novel insights into plant polyploid genome evolution and demonstrates a promising strategy for the development of a wide array of novel plant species and varieties through artificial polyploidization.},

It is shown that the hybrid system can withstand continuous physical deformations as those taking place in the contracting myocardium. The electronic patch is flexible, stretchable, and soft, and the electrodes within the printed patch are able to monitor the function of the engineered tissue by providing extracellular potentials. Furthermore, the system allowed controlling tissue function by providing electrical stimulation for pacing.

  abstract     = {The past decades have witnessed great progress in nanoparticle (NP)-based brain-targeting drug delivery systems, while their therapeutic potentials are yet to be fully exploited given that the majority of them are lost during the delivery process. Rational design of brain-targeting drug delivery systems requires a deep understanding of the entire delivery process along with the issues that they may encounter. Herein, this review first analyzes the typical delivery process of a systemically administrated NPs-based brain-targeting drug delivery system and proposes a six-step CRITID delivery cascade: circulation in systemic blood, recognizing receptor on blood-brain barrier (BBB), intracellular transport, diseased cell targeting after entering into parenchyma, internalization by diseased cells, and finally intracellular drug release. By dissecting the entire delivery process into six steps, this review seeks to provide a deep understanding of the issues that may restrict the delivery efficiency of brain-targeting drug delivery systems as well as the specific requirements that may guarantee minimal loss at each step. Currently developed strategies used for troubleshooting these issues are reviewed and some state-of-the-art design features meeting these requirements are highlighted. The CRITID delivery cascade can serve as a guideline for designing more efficient and specific brain-targeting drug delivery systems.},

Driven by the high clinical potential, a new generation of synthetic-biologically engineered AAV vectors is on the rise. Concepts from synthetic biology enable the control and fine-tuning of vector function at different stages of cellular transduction and gene expression.

Radical lymphadenectomy is crucial for a successful surgery. However, iatrogenic normal organ injury during lymphadenectomy is a troublesome complication. Here, this paper reports a kind of organic nanoprobes (IDSe-IC2F nanoparticles (NPs)) with excellent second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence and photothermal properties. IDSe-IC2F NPs can effectively label lymph nodes and helped achieve high-contrast lymphatic imaging. More importantly, by jointly using IDSe-IC2F nanoparticles and other kinds of nanoparticles with different excitation/emission properties, a multichannel NIR-II fluorescence imaging modality and imaging-guided lymphadenectomy is proposed. With the help of this navigation system, the iatrogenic injury can be largely avoided. In addition, NIR-II fluorescence imaging-guided photothermal treatment (“hot” strategy) can ablate those metastatic lymph nodes which are difficult to deal with during resection (“cold” strategy). Nanoprobes-assisted and multichannel NIR-II fluorescence imaging-guided “cold” and “hot” treatment strategy provides a general new basis for the future precision surgery.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state lithium battery promises highly safe electrochemical energy storage. Conductivity of solid electrolyte and compatibility of electrolyte/electrode interface are two keys to dominate the electrochemical performance of all solid-state battery. By in situ polymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate within self-supported three-dimensional porous Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 framework, the as-assembled solid-state battery employing 4.5 V LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 cathode and Li metal anode demonstrates a high Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99% at room temperature. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance results reveal that Li + migrates fast along the continuous Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 phase and Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 /polymer interfacial phase to generate a fantastic conductivity of 2.0 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at room temperature, which is 56 times higher than that of pristine poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate. Meanwhile, the in situ polymerized poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate can not only integrate the loose interfacial contact but also protect Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 from being reduced by lithium metal. As a consequence of the compatible solid-solid contact, the interfacial resistance decreases significantly by a factor of 40 times, resolving the notorious interfacial issue effectively. The integrated strategy proposed by this work can thereby guide both the preparation of highly conductive solid electrolyte and compatible interface design to boost practical high energy density all solid-state lithium metal battery.},

  abstract     = {Luminescent nano-thermometry is a fast-developing technique with great potential for in vivo sensing, diagnosis, and therapy. Unfortunately, it presents serious limitations. The luminescence generated by nanothermometers, from which thermal readout is obtained, is strongly distorted by the attenuation induced by tissues. Such distortions lead to low signal levels and entangle absolute and reliable thermal monitoring of internal organs. Overcoming both limitations requires the use of high-brightness luminescent nanothermometers and adopting more complex approaches for temperature estimation. In this work, it is demonstrated how superbright Ag 2 S nanothermometers can provide in vivo, reliable, and absolute thermal reading of the liver during laser-induced hyperthermia. For that, a new procedure is designed in which thermal readout is obtained from the combination of in vivo transient thermometry measurements and in silico simulations. The synergy between in vivo and in silico measurements has made it possible to assess relevant numbers such as the efficiency of hyperthermia processes, the total heat energy deposited in the liver, and the relative contribution of Ag 2 S nanoparticles to liver heating. This work provides a new way for absolute thermal sensing of internal organs with potential application not only to hyperthermia processes but also to advanced diagnosis and therapy.},

  abstract     = {Thermionic energy converters are solid-state heat engines that have the potential to produce electricity with efficiencies of over 30% and area-specific power densities of 100 Wcm −2 . Despite this prospect, no prototypes reported in the literature have achieved true efficiencies close to this target, and many of the most recent investigations report power densities on the order of mWcm −2 or less. These discrepancies stem in part from the low-temperature (&lt;1300 K) test conditions used to evaluate these devices, the large vacuum gap distances (25–100 µm) employed by these devices, and material challenges related to these devices&#39; electrodes. This review will argue that, for feasible electrode work functions available today, efficient performance requires generating output power densities of &gt;1 Wcm −2 and employing emitter temperatures of 1300 K or higher. With this result in mind, this review provides an overview of historical and current design architectures and comments on their capacity to realize the efficiency and power potential of thermionic energy converters. Also emphasized is the importance of using standardized efficiency metrics to report thermionic energy converter performance data.},

Current clinical ECoG grids come in evenly spaced, millimeter-sized electrodes embedded in silicone rubber. Their mechanical rigidity and fixed electrode spatial resolution are common shortcomings reported by the surgical teams. Here, advances in soft neurotechnology are leveraged to manufacture conformable subdural, thin-film ECoG grids, and evaluate their suitability for translational research. Soft grids with 0.2 to 10 mm electrode pitch and diameter are embedded in 150 µm silicone membranes. The soft grids are compatible with surgical handling and can be folded to safely interface hidden cerebral surface such as the Sylvian fold in human cadaveric models. It is found that the thin-film conductor grids do not generate diagnostic-impeding imaging artefacts (&lt;1 mm) nor adverse local heating within a standard 3T clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Next, the ability of the soft grids to record subdural neural activity in minipigs acutely and two weeks postimplantation is validated. Taken together, these results suggest a promising future alternative to current stiff electrodes and may enable the future adoption of soft ECoG grids in translational research and ultimately in clinical settings.},

Specifically, such commercial graphite anodes exhibit a long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles at 100 mA g −1 (a reversible capacity of around 260 mAh g −1 ) and a high average CE (around 99.9%) in traditional carbonate electrolytes with no discernable decay in capacity. More importantly, the commercial graphite anodes with the artificial inorganic SEI film in traditional carbonate electrolytes can deliver a high ICE of 93% (the highest ICE ever reported for PIBs anodes until now), which improves the performance of the PIB full cell. Considering the high ICE and long cycle stability performance, this study can promote the rapid deployment of PIBs on a commercial scale.},

  abstract     = {The molecular mechanisms and forces involved in the translocation of bacterial toxins into host cells are still a matter of intense research. The adenylate cyclase (CyaA) toxin from Bordetella pertussis displays a unique intoxication pathway in which its catalytic domain is directly translocated across target cell membranes. The CyaA translocation region contains a segment, P454 (residues 454–484), which exhibits membrane-active properties related to antimicrobial peptides. Herein, the results show that this peptide is able to translocate across membranes and to interact with calmodulin (CaM). Structural and biophysical analyses reveal the key residues of P454 involved in membrane destabilization and calmodulin binding. Mutational analysis demonstrates that these residues play a crucial role in CyaA translocation into target cells. In addition, calmidazolium, a calmodulin inhibitor, efficiently blocks CyaA internalization. It is proposed that after CyaA binding to target cells, the P454 segment destabilizes the plasma membrane, translocates across the lipid bilayer and binds calmodulin. Trapping of CyaA by the CaM:P454 interaction in the cytosol may assist the entry of the N-terminal catalytic domain by converting the stochastic motion of the polypeptide chain through the membrane into an efficient vectorial chain translocation into host cells.},

Active site identification in the CO 2 RR is vital for the understanding of the reaction mechanism and the rational development of new electrocatalysts with both high selectivity and stability. Herein, in situ characterization monitoring of active sites during the reaction is summarized and a general understanding of active sites on the various catalysts in the CO 2 RR, including metal-based catalysts, carbon-based catalysts, and metal-organic frameworks-based electrocatalysts is updated. For each type of electrocatalysts, the reaction pathway and real active sites are proposed based on in situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations. Finally, the key limitations and challenges observed for the electrochemical fixation of CO 2 is presented.

  abstract     = {Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an indispensable bioactive protein that sustains self-renewal and pluripotency in stem cells, is vital for mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) culture. Extensive research is conducted on reliable alternatives for LIF as its clinical application in stable culture and large-scale expansion of ESCs is limited by its instability and high cost. However, few studies have sought to replace LIF with nanoparticles to provide a xeno-free culture condition. MgAl-LDH (layered double hydroxide) nanoparticles can partially replace LIF in maintaining pluripotency of mESCs; however, the requirement and tolerance for aluminum ions in mice are far lesser than those of iron ions. Hence, MgFe-LDH nanoparticles are selected for this study. MgFe-LDH is superior to MgAl-LDH in maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs, in the absence of LIF and mouse embryonic fibroblast. Furthermore, combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis confirms that MgFe-LDH can activate the LIF receptor (LIFR)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B(AKT), LIFR/JAK/janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3), and phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(p-STAT3)/ten-eleven translocation (TET) signaling pathways, while the extra Fe 2+ provided by MgFe-LDH would also enhance TET1/2 abundance thus affecting the TET1/2 regulated pluripotency related marker expression and TET1/2 meditated DNA demethylation. These results suggest that MgFe-LDH nanoparticles can thus be used as an affordable and efficient replacement for LIF in mESC cultivation.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause acute cardiovascular events. Activation of the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome enhances atherogenesis, which links lipid metabolism to sterile inflammation. This study examines the impact of an endogenous metabolite, namely ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), on a mouse model of atherosclerosis. It is found that daily oral administration of 3-HB can significantly ameliorate atherosclerosis. Mechanistically, 3-HB is found to reduce the M1 macrophage proportion and promote cholesterol efflux by acting on macrophages through its receptor G-protein-coupled receptor 109a (Gpr109a). 3-HB–Gpr109a signaling promotes extracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) influx. The elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ level reduces the release of Ca 2+ from the endothelium reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, thus inhibits ER stress triggered by ER Ca 2+ store depletion. As NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by ER stress, 3-HB can inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which triggers the increase of M1 macrophage proportion and the inhibition of cholesterol efflux. It is concluded that daily nutritional supplementation of 3-HB attenuates atherosclerosis in mice.},

As novel fields like high-entropy alloys emerge, understanding these effects on the atomic structure level is paramount: What atoms near the binding site determine the reactivity of the alloy surface? By statistical analysis of 2000 density functional theory calculations and subsequent host/guest calculations, it is shown that three atomic positions in the third layer of an fcc(111) metallic structure fourth-nearest to the adsorption site display significantly increased influence on reactivity over any second or third nearest atomic positions. Subsequently observed in multiple facets and host metals, the effect cannot be explained simply through the d-band model or a valence configuration model but rather by favorable directions of interaction determined by lattice geometry and the valence difference between host and guest elements. These results advance the general understanding of how the electronic interaction of different elements affect adsorbate–surface interactions and will contribute to design principles for rational catalyst discovery of better, more stable and energy efficient catalysts to be employed in energy conversion, fuel cell technologies, and industrial processes.},

Multi-Organoid Aggregates (MOAs) undergo accelerated fusion in a matrix-depleted, free-floating environment, possess a continuous lumen, and maintain prescribed shapes without an exogenous scaffold interface. MOAs in the floating culture exhibit a well-defined three-stage process of inter-organoid surface integration, luminal material clearance, and lumina connection. The observed shape stability of patterned MOAs is confirmed by theoretical modelling based on organoid morphology and the physical forces involved in organoid fusion. Immunofluorescent characterization shows that fused MOA tubes possess an unstratified epithelium consisting mainly of tracheal basal stem cells. By generating large, shape-controllable organ tubes, MOrPF enables upscaled organoid engineering towards integrated organoid devices and structurally complex organ tubes.},

The negatively charged liposome outer-layer of the nanomedicine enables much-prolonged blood circulation for significantly enhanced tumoral accumulation, while the positively charged Fenton-like catalyst Cu-LDH released from the liposome under the US stimulation demonstrates much enhanced intratumoral penetration via transcytosis. In the meantime, the co-released sonosensitizer hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) catalyze the singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generation upon the US irradiation, and deep-tumoral infiltrated Cu-LDH catalyzes the H 2 O 2 decomposition to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (·OH) specifically within the mildly acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). The efficient intratumoral accumulation and penetration via the dual size/charge switching mechanism, and the ROS generations by both sonosensitization and Fenton-like reactions, ensures the high therapeutic efficacy for the deep tumor therapy by the nanocatalytic medicine.},

The study demonstrates that chemical vapor deposition-grown MoS 2 monolayers contain intrinsic MoO x and are quickly oxidized at 100 °C (3 vol% O 2 /He), in contrast to previously reported oxidation thresholds (e.g., 250 °C, t ≤ 1 h in the air).

Here, the first approach to achieving a stretchable multimodal device is reported, that operates on the basis of various electrical properties of piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, and piezoresistivity and that exceeds the capabilities of human tactile perception. The prepared E-skin is composed of a wrinkle-patterned silicon elastomer, hybrid nanomaterials of silver nanowires and zinc oxide nanowires, and a thin elastomeric dielectric layer covering the hybrid nanomaterials, where the dielectric layer exhibits high surface roughness mimicking human fingerprints. This versatile device can identify and distinguish not only mechanical stress from a single stimulus such as pressure, tensile strain, or vibration but also that from a combination of multiple stimuli.

Compared with human hands, some plants like Drosera do not have rigid frames, so they can bend at arbitrary points of the body to capture their prey. Furthermore, many muscular hydrostat animals and plant tendrils can implement more complex twisting motions in 3D space. Recently, inspired by the flexible grasping methods present in nature, increasingly more bio-inspired soft grippers have been fabricated with compliant and soft materials. Based on this, the present review focuses on the recent research progress of bio-inspired soft grippers based on impactive gripping. According to their types of movement and a classification model inspired by biological “grippers”, soft grippers are classified into three types, namely, non-continuum bending-type grippers, continuum bending-type grippers, and continuum twisting-type grippers. An exhaustive and updated analysis of each type of gripper is provided. Moreover, this review offers an overview of the different stiffness-controllable strategies developed in recent years.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria infected cells acting as “Trojan horses” not only protect bacteria from antibiotic therapies and immune clearance, but also increase the dissemination of pathogens from the initial sites of infection. Antibiotics are hard and insufficient to treat such hidden internalized bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Herein, aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) such as N , N -diphenyl-4-(7-(pyridin-4-yl) benzo [ c ] [1,2,5] thiadiazol-4-yl) aniline functionalized with 1-bromoethane (TBP-1) and (3-bromopropyl) trimethylammonium bromide (TBP-2) (TBPs) show potent broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both extracellular and internalized Gram-positive pathogens. TBPs trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated membrane damage to kill bacteria, regardless of light irradiation. TBPs effectively kill bacteria without the development of resistance. Additionally, such AIEgens activate mitochondria dependent autophagy to eliminate internalized bacteria in host cells. Compared to the routinely used vancomycin in clinic, TBPs demonstrate comparable efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vivo. The studies suggest that AIEgens are promising new agents for the treatment of MDR bacteria associated infections.},

  abstract     = {Phase change materials (PCMs) can alleviate concerns over energy to some extent by reversibly storing a tremendous amount of renewable and sustainable thermal energy. However, the low thermal conductivity, low electrical conductivity, and weak photoabsorption of pure PCMs hinder their wider applicability and development. To overcome these deficiencies and improve the utilization efficiency of thermal energy, versatile carbon materials have been increasingly considered as supporting materials to construct shape-stabilized composite PCMs. Despite some carbon-based composite PCMs reviews regarding thermal conductivity enhancement, a comprehensive review of carbon-based composite PCMs does not exist. Herein, a systematic overview of recent carbon-based composite PCMs for thermal storage, transfer, conversion (solar-to-thermal, electro-to-thermal and magnetic-to-thermal), and advanced multifunctional applications, including novel metal organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon materials are provided. The current challenges and future opportunities are also highlighted. The authors hope this review can provide in-depth insights and serve as a useful guide for the targeted design of high-performance carbon-based composite PCMs.},

  abstract     = {The plasma proteins around nanoparticles (NPs) form an outer protein corona, significantly influencing the subsequent immune response. However, it was uncertain whether the protein corona around NPs influences immune response. This study clarified that the immune response mediated by the protein corona is greatly dependent on the type of plasma proteins surrounding the NPs. Structural changes in the unfolded protein corona elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and induced major proinflammatory cytokine release in both murine and human macrophage cell lines. In contrast, negligible structural changes in the protein corona provoke neither ROS production nor proinflammatory cytokine release. Furthermore, in vivo analysis confirms that a stimulated immune response by an unfolded protein corona triggers selective activation of innate and adaptive immunity in the spleen. Specifically, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and CD8 + T cells are overpopulated by unfolded protein corona structures surrounding nanotubes, whereas innate and adaptive immunologic responses are not triggered by a normal protein corona. In conclusion, highly unfolded protein corona structures are strongly correlated with subsequent activation of proinflammatory cytokines and innate immune responses; thus, the protein corona can be used in immune-enhancing therapy.},

The development of robust methods to fabricate micro/nano surface structures has been a long pursuit. Herein, an approach based on molecular self-assembling of liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) is presented to directly translate 2D molecular director profiles obtained by a photoalignment procedure into 3D topographies, without involving further multi-step lithographic processes. The principle of surface deformation from a flat morphology into complex topographies is based on the coupling between electrostatic interactions and the anisotropic flow in LCPs. When activated by an electric field, the LCP melts and is driven by electrohydrodynamic instabilities to connect the electrode plates of a capacitor, inducing topographies governed by the director profile of the LCP. Upon switching off the electric field, the formed structures vitrify as the temperature decreases below the glass transition. When heated, the process is reversible as the formed topographies disappear. By pre-programming the molecular director a variety of structures could be made with increasing complexity. The height, pitch, and the aspect ratio of the textures are further regulated by the conditions of the applied electric field. The proposed approach will open new opportunities for optical and electrical applications.},

Here the defect induced dielectric loss dominant mechanism in virtue of multi-shelled spinel hollow sphere for the first time is demonstrated. The unique but identical morphology design as well as suitable composition modulation for serial spinels can exclude the disturbance of EM wave dissipation from dipolar/interfacial polarization and conduction loss. In temperature-regulated defect in NiCo 2 O 4 serial materials, two kinds of defects, defect in spinel structure and oxygen vacancy are detected. Defect in spinel structure played more profound role on determining materials’ EM wave dissipation than that of oxygen vacancy. When evaluated serial Co-based materials as absorbers, defect induced polarization loss is responsible for the superior absorption performance of NiCo 2 O 4 -based material due to its more defect sites in spinel structure. It is discovered that electron spin resonance test may be adopted as a novel approach to directly probe EM wave absorption capacities of materials. This work not only provides a strategy to prepare lightweight, efficient EM wave absorber but also illustrates the importance of defect engineering on regulation of materials’ dielectric loss capacity.},

In this investigation, a potassium sodium niobite/poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (KNN/PVDF-TrFE)-based nanocomposite is fabricated, and the flexoelectric effect is used to enhance the photovoltaic current ( I pv ) in the nanocomposite. It is found that both a pyroelectric current and photovoltaic current can be generated simultaneously in a light illumination process. However, the photovoltaic current ( I pv ) in this process contributes ≈85% of the total current. When assessing the effect of flexoelectricity with a curvature of 1/20, the I pv of the curved KNN/PVDF-TrFE (20%) (K/P-20) composite increased by ≈13.9% compared to that of the flat K/P-20 nanocomposite. Similarly, at a curvature of 1/20, the I pv of the K/P-20 nanocomposite is 71.6% higher than that of the PVDF-TrFE film. However, the photovoltaic effect induced by flexoelectricity is much higher than the increased polarization from flexoelectricity, so this effect is called as the flexophotovoltaic effect. Furthermore, the calculated energy conversion efficiency of the K/P-20 film is 0.017%, which is comparable to the previous research result. This investigation shows great promise for PVDF-based nanocomposites in ferroelectric memory device applications.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the movement of bacteria and other microorganisms, researchers have developed artificial helical micro- and nanorobots that can perform corkscrew locomotion or helical path swimming under external energy actuation. In this paper, for the first time the locomotion of nonhelical multifunctional nanorobots that can swim in helical klinotactic trajectories, similarly to rod-shaped bacteria, under rotating magnetic fields is investigated. These nanorobots consist of a rigid ferromagnetic nickel head connected to a rhodium tail by a flexible hydrogel-based hollow hinge composed of chemically responsive chitosan and alginate multilayers. This design allows nanoswimmers switching between different dynamic behaviors—from in-plane tumbling to helical klinotactic swimming—by varying the rotating magnetic field frequency and strength. It also adds a rich spectrum of swimming capabilities that can be adjusted by varying the type of applied magnetic fields and/or frequencies. A theoretical model is developed to analyze the propulsion mechanisms and predict the swimming behavior at distinct rotating magnetic frequencies. The model shows good agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, the biomedical capabilities of the nanoswimmers as drug delivery platforms are demonstrated. Unlike previous designs constitute metallic segments, the proposed nanoswimmers can encapsulate drugs into their hollow hinge and successfully release them to cells.},

  abstract     = {Nuclei and mitochondria are the only cellular organelles containing genes, which are specific targets for efficient cancer therapy. So far, several photosensitizers have been reported for mitochondria targeting, and another few have been reported for nuclei targeting. However, none have been reported for photosensitization in both mitochondria and nucleus, especially in cascade mode, which can significantly reduce the photosensitizers needed for maximal treatment effect. Herein, a light-driven, mitochondria-to-nucleus cascade dual organelle cancer cell ablation strategy is reported. A functionalized iridium complex, named BT-Ir, is designed as a photosensitizer, which targets mitochondria first for photosensitization and subsequently is translocated to a cell nucleus for continuous photodynamic cancer cell ablation. This strategy opens new opportunities for efficient photodynamic therapy.},

  abstract     = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) presumably contribute to tumor progression and drug resistance, yet their definitive features have remained elusive. Here, simultaneous measurement of telomere length and transcriptome in the same cells enables systematic assessment of CSCs in primary colorectal cancer (CRC). The in-depth transcriptome profiled by SMART-seq2 is independently validated by high-throughput scRNA-seq using 10 × Genomics. It is found that rare CSCs exist in dormant state and display plasticity toward cancer epithelial cells (EPCs) that essentially are presumptive tumor-initiating cells (TICs), while both retaining the prominent signaling pathways including WNT, TGF- β , and HIPPO/YAP. Moreover, CSCs exhibit chromosome copy number variation (CNV) pattern resembling cancer EPCs but distinct from normal stem cells, suggesting the phylogenetic relationship between CSCs and cancer EPCs. Notably, CSCs maintain shorter telomeres and possess minimal telomerase activity consistent with their nonproliferative nature, unlike cancer EPCs. Additionally, the specific signature of CSCs particularly NOTUM , SMOC2 , BAMBI , PHLDA1 , and TNFRSF19 correlates with the prognosis of CRC. These findings characterize the heterogeneity of CSCs and their linkage to cancer EPCs/TICs, some of which are conventionally regarded as CSCs.},

Herein, an asymmetric Y6-like acceptor, BTP-FCl-FCl, is designed and synthesized to match the recently reported high performance small molecule donor BTR-Cl, and a record efficiency of 15.3% for single-junction binary ASM OSCs is achieved. BTP-FCl-FCl features a F,Cl disubstitution on the same end group affording locally asymmetric structures, and so has a lower total dipole moment, larger average electronic static potential, and lower distribution disorder than those of the globally asymmetric isomer BTP-2F-2Cl, resulting in improved charge generation and extraction. In addition, BTP-FCl-FCl based active layer presents more favorable domain size and finer phase separation contributing to the faster charge extraction, longer charge carrier lifetime, and much lower recombination rate. Therefore, compared with BTP-2F-2Cl, BTP-FCl-FCl based devices provide better performance with FF enhanced from 71.41% to 75.36% and J sc increased from 22.35 to 24.58 mA cm −2 , leading to a higher PCE of 15.3%. The locally asymmetric F, Cl disubstitution on the same end group is a new strategy to achieve high performance ASM OSCs.},

Embryo models can be generated in large numbers, provide accessibility to a variety of experimental tools such as genetic and chemical manipulation, and confer compatibility with automated readouts, which permits exciting experimental avenues for exploring the genetic and molecular principles of self-organization, development, and disease. However, the current embryo models recapitulate only snapshots within the continuum of embryonic development, allowing the progression of the embryonic tissues along a specific direction. Hence, to fully exploit the potential of stem cell-based embryo models, multiple important gaps in the developmental landscape need to be covered. These include recapitulating the lesser-explored interactions between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues such as the yolk sac, placenta, and the umbilical cord; spatial and temporal organization of tissues; and the anterior patterning of embryonic development. Here, it is detailed how combinations of stem cells and versatile bioengineering technologies can help in addressing these gaps and thereby extend the implications of embryo models in the fields of cell biology, development, and regenerative medicine.},

  abstract     = {Stimuli-responsive materials have been lately employed in soft robotics enabling new classes of robots that can emulate biological systems. The untethered operation of soft materials with high power light, magnetic field, and electric field has been previously demonstrated. While electric and magnetic fields can be stimulants for untethered actuation, their rapid decay as a function of distance limits their efficacy for long-range operations. In contrast, light—in the form of sunlight or collimated from an artificial source (e.g., laser, Xenon lamps)—does not decay rapidly, making it suitable for long-range excitation of untethered soft robots. In this work, an approach to harnessing sunlight for the untethered operation of soft robots is presented. By employing a selective solar absorber film and a low-boiling point (34 °C) fluid, light-operated soft robotic grippers are demonstrated, grasping and lifting objects almost 25 times the mass of the fluid in a controllable fashion. The method addresses one of the salient challenges in the field of untethered soft robotics. It precludes the use of bulky peripheral components (e.g., compressors, valves, or pressurized gas tank) and enables the untethered long-range operation of soft robots.},

As the mismatch in the mechanical stiffness between materials, layers, and device units is the major challenge for stretchable electronics, interface control in varying scales determines the device characteristics and the level of stretchability. This article reviews the recent advances in interface control for stretchable electronic devices. It summarizes the design principles and covers the representative approaches for solving the technological issues related to interfaces at different scales: i) nano- and microscale interfaces between materials, ii) mesoscale interfaces between layers or microstructures, and iii) macroscale interfaces between unit devices, substrates, or electrical connections.

Inspired by the plaque-binding ability of platelets, a biomimic photodynamic therapeutic system is designed to mitigate the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. This system is composed of photosensitizer-loaded upconversion nanoparticle cores entrapped in the platelet membrane. The platelet membrane coating facilitates specific targeting of the therapeutic system to macrophage-derived foam cells, the hallmark, and main component of early stage atherosclerotic plaques, which is firmly confirmed by in vivo fluorescent and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) radionuclide imaging. Importantly, in vivo phototherapy guided by SPECT/CT imaging alleviates plaque progression. Further immunofluorescence analysis reveals foam cell apoptosis and ameliorated inflammation. This biomimic system, which combines plaque-binding with radionuclide imaging guidance, is a novel, noninvasive, and potent strategy to mitigate the progression of atherosclerotic plaque.},

Prophylactic stabilization of MCs is regarded as a practical approach to prevent allergic diseases. However, most of the existing small molecular MC stabilizers exhibit a narrow therapeutic time window, failing to provide long-term prevention of allergic diseases. Herein, ceria nanoparticle (CeNP-) based phosphatase-mimetic nano-stabilizers (PMNSs) with a long-term therapeutic time window are developed for allergic disease prevention. By virtue of the regenerable catalytic hotspots of oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeNPs, PMNSs exhibit sustainable phosphatase-mimetic activity to dephosphorylate phosphoproteins in allergen-stimulated MCs. Consequently, PMNSs constantly modulate intracellular phospho-signaling cascades of MCs to inhibit the degranulation of allergic mediators, which prevents the initiation of allergic mediator-associated pathological responses, eventually providing protection against allergic diseases with a long-term therapeutic time window.},

The surface topographical inversion is accomplished by the anisotropic deformation of the fingerprint-configured liquid crystal network (LCN) coating upon light-controlled order parameter modulation. Adhesive and nonadhesive polymers are spatial-selectively arranged on top of the LCN coating following the alternating homeotropic and planar domains, respectively, where liquid crystal mesogens are orthogonally aligned. The adhesive part is composed of a water-tolerant adhesive polymer with 3,4-dihydroxy- l -phenylalanine (catechol) groups inspired by mussel byssus.

Luminescent transition metal complexes particularly those based on iridium and ruthenium have shown remarkable potentials for constructing sensitive oxygen-sensing probes due to their unique oxygen quenching pathway. However, the low aqueous solubility of these complexes largely retards their sensing applications in biological media. Moreover, it remains difficult so far to use the existing complexes typically possessing only one luminescent domain to quantitatively detect the intratumoral hypoxia degree. Herein, an Ir(III) complex showing red emissions is designed and synthesized, and innovatively encapsulated within a hydrophobic pocket of Cyanine7-modified cyclodextrin. The Ir(III) complex enables the oxygen detection, while the cyclodextrin is used not only for improving the water solubility and suppressing the luminescence quenching effect of the surrounding aqueous media, but also for carrying Cyanine7 to establish a ratiometric oxygen fluorescence probe. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance is carried out to confirm the host–guest structure. The oxygen-responsive ability of the resulting ratiometric probe is evaluated through in vitro cell and multicellular experiments. Further animal studies about tumor oxygen level mapping demonstrate that the probe can be successfully used for quantitatively visualizing tumor hypoxia in vivo.},

  abstract     = {There is a critical need to transition research level flexible polymer bioelectronics toward the clinic by demonstrating both reliability in fabrication and stable device performance. Conductive elastomers (CEs) are composites of conductive polymers in elastomeric matrices that provide both flexibility and enhanced electrochemical properties compared to conventional metallic electrodes. This work focuses on the development of nerve cuff devices and the assessment of the device functionality at each development stage, from CE material to fully polymeric electrode arrays. Two device types are fabricated by laser machining of a thick and thin CE sheet variant on an insulative polydimethylsiloxane substrate and lamination into tubing to produce pre-curled cuffs. Device performance and stability following sterilization and mechanical loading are compared to a state-of-the-art stretchable metallic nerve cuff. The CE cuffs are found to be electrically and mechanically stable with improved charge transfer properties compared to the commercial cuff. All devices are applied to an ex vivo whole sciatic nerve and shown to be functional, with the CE cuffs demonstrating superior charge transfer and electrochemical safety in the biological environment.},

The effectiveness of conventional locally-administered medications against diseases affecting these oral milieus may be compromised by constant salivary flow. For systemically-administered medications, drug resistance and adverse side-effects are issues that need to be resolved. New strategies for drug delivery have been investigated over the last decade to overcome these obstacles. Synthesis of nanoparticle-containing agents that promote healing represents a quantum leap in ensuring safe, efficient drug delivery to the affected tissues. Micro/nanoencapsulants with unique structures and properties function as more favorable drug-release platforms than conventional treatment approaches.

  abstract     = {Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), as a powerful nanoscale characterization technique, has been extensively utilized to elucidate diverse underlying physics of ferroelectricity. However, intensive studies of conventional PFM have revealed a growing number of concerns and limitations which are largely challenging its validity and applications. In this study, an advanced PFM technique is reported, namely heterodyne megasonic piezoresponse force microscopy (HM-PFM), which uses 10 6 to 10 8 Hz high-frequency excitation and heterodyne method to measure the piezoelectric strain at nanoscale. It is found that HM-PFM can unambiguously provide standard ferroelectric domain and hysteresis loop measurements, and an effective domain characterization with excitation frequency up to ≈110 MHz is demonstrated. Most importantly, owing to the high-frequency and heterodyne scheme, the contributions from both electrostatic force and electrochemical strain can be significantly minimized in HM-PFM. Furthermore, a special measurement of difference-frequency piezoresponse frequency spectrum (DFPFS) is developed on HM-PFM and a distinct DFPFS characteristic is observed on the materials with piezoelectricity. By performing DFPFS measurement, a truly existed but very weak electromechanical coupling in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite is revealed. It is believed that HM-PFM can be an excellent candidate for the ferroelectric or piezoelectric studies where conventional PFM results are highly controversial.},

Here, taking advantage of the micro optical sectioning tomography system, the high-precision cross-scale visualization of entire lung anatomy is obtained. Then, co-localized lung-wide datasets of both cyto-architectures and fluorescent particles are collected at full scale with the resolution down to individual particles. The precise spatial distribution pattern reveals the region-specific distribution and structure-associated deposition of the inhalable particles in lungs, which is undetected by previous methods.

However, the cytotoxic activity of nano-Pt is not comprehensively considered in the existing methods to exert their multifunctional antitumor effects. Here, nano-Pt are loaded into liposomes via reverse phase evaporation. The clinical photosensitizer verteporfin (VP) is loaded in the lipid bilayer to confer PDT activity. Murine macrophage cell membranes are hybridized into the liposomal membrane to confer biomimetic and targeting features. The resulting liposomal system, termed “nano-Pt/VP@MLipo,” is investigated for chemophototherapy in vitro and in vivo in mouse tumor models. At the tumor site, oxygen produced by nano-Pt catalyzation improves the VP-mediated PDT, which in turn triggers the release of nano-Pt via membrane permeabilization. The ultrasmall 3–5 nm nano-Pt enables better penetration in tumors, which is also facilitated by the generated oxygen gas, for enhanced chemotherapy. Chemophototherapy with a single injection of nano-Pt/VP@MLipo and light irradiation inhibits the growth of aggressive 4T1 tumors and their lung metastasis, and prolongs animal survival without overt toxicity.},

Common cotton gauze suffers from incomplete joint surface coverage, confinement of joint movement, lack of antibacterial function, and frequent replacements. Hydrogels have been considered as good candidates for wound dressing because of their good flexibility and biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the adhesive, mechanical, and antibacterial properties of conventional hydrogels are not satisfactory. Herein, cationic polyelectrolyte brushes grafted from bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibers are introduced into polydopamine/polyacrylamide hydrogels. The 1D polymer brushes have rigid BC backbones to enhance mechanical property of hydrogels, realizing high tensile strength (21–51 kPa), large tensile strain (899–1047%), and ideal compressive property. Positively charged quaternary ammonium groups of tethered polymer brushes provide long-lasting antibacterial property to hydrogels and promote crawling and proliferation of negatively charged epidermis cells. Moreover, the hydrogels are rich in catechol groups and capable of adhering to various surfaces, meeting adhesive demand of large movement for special areas. With the above merits, the hydrogels demonstrate less inflammatory response and faster healing speed for in vivo wound healing on rats. Therefore, the multifunctional hydrogels show stable covering, little displacement, long-lasting antibacteria, and fast wound healing, demonstrating promise in wound dressing.},

Here a practical and universal method to achieve highly strained phases with large tetragonal distortions in Pb-based ferroelectric films through synergetic effects of moderately (≈1.0%) misfit strains and laser fluences during pulsed laser deposition process is demonstrated. The phase possesses unexpectedly large Poisson&#39;s ratio and negative thermal expansion, and concomitant enhancements of spontaneous polarization (≈100 µC cm −2 ) and Curie temperature (≈800 °C), 40% and 75% larger than that of bulk counterparts, respectively.

  abstract     = {Despite the huge importance of friction in regulating movement in all natural and technological processes, the mechanisms underlying dissipation at a sliding contact are still a matter of debate. Attempts to explain the dependence of measured frictional losses at nanoscale contacts on the electronic degrees of freedom of the surrounding materials have so far been controversial. Here, it is proposed that friction can be explained by considering the damping of stick-slip pulses in a sliding contact. Based on friction force microscopy studies of La (1− x ) Sr x MnO 3 films at the ferromagnetic-metallic to a paramagnetic-polaronic conductor phase transition, it is confirmed that the sliding contact generates thermally-activated slip pulses in the nanoscale contact, and argued that these are damped by direct coupling into the phonon bath. Electron-phonon coupling leads to the formation of Jahn–Teller polarons and to a clear increase in friction in the high-temperature phase. There is neither evidence for direct electronic drag on the atomic force microscope tip nor any indication of contributions from electrostatic forces. This intuitive scenario, that friction is governed by the damping of surface vibrational excitations, provides a basis for reconciling controversies in literature studies as well as suggesting possible tactics for controlling friction.},

However, the complex nature of these devices requires specialized, time consuming, and expensive fabrication methodologies. Alternatives that reduce design-to-prototype time are needed, in order to fulfill the potential of these devices. Here, a streamlined approach is proposed for the fabrication of organ-on-a-chip devices with incorporated microactuators, by using an adaptation of xurography. This method can generate multilayered, membrane-integrated biochips in a matter of hours, using low-cost benchtop equipment. These devices are capable of withstanding considerable pressure without delamination. Furthermore, this method is suitable for the integration of flexible membranes, required for organ-on-a-chip applications, such as mechanical actuation or the establishment of biological barrier function. The devices are compatible with cell culture applications and present no cytotoxic effects or observable alterations on cellular homeostasis. This fabrication method can rapidly generate organ-on-a-chip prototypes for a fraction of cost and time, in comparison to conventional soft lithography, constituting an interesting alternative to the current fabrication methods.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalysis is one potential solution to the energy and environmental crisis and greatly relies on the development of the catalysts. Niobium pentoxide (Nb 2 O 5 ), a typically nontoxic metal oxide, is eco-friendly and exhibits strong oxidation ability, and has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Furthermore, unique Lewis acid sites (LASs) and Brønsted acid sites (BASs) are observed on Nb 2 O 5 prepared by different methods. Herein, the recent advances in the synthesis and application of Nb 2 O 5 -based photocatalysts, including the pure Nb 2 O 5 , doped Nb 2 O 5 , metal species supported on Nb 2 O 5 , and other composited Nb 2 O 5 catalysts, are summarized. An overview is provided for the role of size and crystalline phase, unsaturated Nb sites and oxygen vacancies, LASs and BASs, dopants and surface metal species, and heterojunction structure on the Nb 2 O 5 -based catalysts in photocatalysis. Finally, the challenges are also presented, which are possibly overcome by integrating the synthetic methodology, developing novel photoelectric characterization techniques, and a profound understanding of the local structure of Nb 2 O 5 .},

  abstract     = {Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) plays a dual role in regulating cell survival and apoptosis, acting as a prosurvival factor in mitochondria via its NADH oxidoreductase activity and activating the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway (i.e., parthanatos) after nuclear translocation. However, whether one factor conjunctively controls the separated functions of AIF is not clear. Here, it is shown that OTU deubiquitinase 1 (OTUD1) acts as a link between the two functions of AIF via deubiquitination events. Deubiquitination of AIF at K244 disrupts the normal mitochondrial structure and compromises oxidative phosphorylation, and deubiquitination of AIF at K255 enhances its DNA-binding ability to promote parthanatos. Moreover, OTUD1 stabilizes DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 10 (DCAF10) and recruits the cullin 4A (CUL4A)-damage specific DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) complex to promote myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) degradation, thereby activating caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling. Collectively, these results reveal the central role of OTUD1 in activating both caspase-independent and caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling and propose decreased OTUD1 expression as a key event promoting chemoresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.},

  abstract     = {Enhancement of mechanical properties in self-assembled superstructures of magnetic nanoparticles is a new emerging aspect of their remarkable collective behavior. However, how magnetic interactions modulate mechanical properties is, to date, not fully understood. Through a comprehensive Monte Carlo investigation, this study demonstrates how the mechanical properties of self-assembled magnetic nanocubes can be controlled intrinsically by the nanoparticle magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MA), as well as by the superstructure shape anisotropy, without any need for changes in structural design (i.e., nanoparticle size, shape, and packing arrangement). A low MA-to-dipolar energy ratio, as found in iron oxide and permalloy systems, favors isotropic mechanical superstructure stabilization, whereas a high ratio yields magnetically blocked nanoparticle macrospins which can give rise to metastable superferromagnetism , as expected in cobalt ferrite simple cubic supercrystals. Such full parallel alignment of the particle moments is shown to induce mechanical anisotropy, where the superior high-strength axis can be remotely reconfigured by means of an applied magnetic field. The new concepts developed here pave the way for the experimental realization of smart magneto-micromechanical systems (based, e.g., on the permanent super-magnetostriction effect illustrated here) and inspire new design rules for applied functional materials.},

  abstract     = {Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in adults and has a low survival rate following metastasis; it is derived from melanocytes susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Carbon dot (Cdot) nanoparticles are a promising tool in cancer detection and therapy due to their unique photophysical properties, low cytotoxicity, and efficient ROS productivity. However, the effects of Cdots on tumor metabolism and growth are not well characterized. Here, the effects of Cdots on UM cell metabolomics, growth, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity are investigated in vitro and in vivo zebrafish and nude mouse xenograft model. Cdots dose-dependently increase ROS levels in UM cells. At Cdots concentrations below 100 µg mL −1 , Cdot-induced ROS promote UM cell growth, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity; at 200 µg mL −1 , UM cells undergo apoptosis. The addition of antioxidants reverses the protumorigenic effects of Cdots. Cdots at 25–100 µg mL −1 activate Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and enhance glutamine metabolism, generating a cascade that promotes UM cell growth. These results demonstrate that moderate, subapoptotic doses of Cdots can promote UM cell tumorigenicity. This study lays the foundation for the rational application of ROS-producing nanoparticles in tumor imaging and therapy.},

According to existing studies, the supramolecular chirality transfer process combined with hierarchical self-assembly plays a vital role in the fabrication of multiscale chiral structures. This progress report focuses on the hierarchical self-assembly of chiral or achiral molecules that aggregate with asymmetric spatial structures such as twisted bands, helices, and superhelices in different environments. Herein, recent studies on the chirality transfer induced self-assembly based on a variety of supramolecular interactions are summarized. In addition, the influence of different environments and the states of systems including solutions, condensed states, gel systems, interfaces on the asymmetric hierarchical self-assembly, and the expression of chirality are explored. Moreover, both the driving forces that facilitate chiral bias and the supramolecular interactions that play an important role in the expression, transfer, and amplification of the chiral sense are correspondingly discussed.},

Here, a proof-of-principle study of atomic-scale visualization and quantification of configurational entropy in relation to thermal conductivity in single crystalline trigonal GeSb 2 Te 4 (aka t -GeSb 2 Te 4 ) with native atomic site disorder is reported. A concerted effort of large t -GeSb 2 Te 4 single crystal growth, in-lab developed analysis procedure of atomic column intensity, the visualization and quantification of configurational entropy including corresponding modulation, and thermal transport measurements enable an entropic “bottom-up” perspective to the lattice thermal conductivity of t -GeSb 2 Te 4 . It is uncovered that the configurational entropy increases phonon scattering and reduces phonon mean free path as well as promotes anharmonicity, thereby giving rise to low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance. The current study sheds lights on an atomic scale bottom-up configurational entropy design in diverse regimes of structural and functional materials research and applications.},

The one-pot reaction features no metals as a building block or reagent, hence facilitating the structural purity and industrial scalability of the design. Through a single-crystal study on a model compound, the double Schiff base formation is found to follow syn addition, a kinetically favored product, suggesting that reactivity of the amine and carbonyls dictate the order and geometry of the framework building. The highly porous pyrazole polymer COP-214 is chemically resistant in reactive conditions for over two weeks and thermally stable up to 425 °C in air. COP-214 shows well-pronounced gas capture and selectivities, and a high CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 102. The strongly coordinating pyrazole sites show rapid uptake and quantitative selectivity of Pd (II) over several coordinating metals (especially Pt (II)) at all pH points that are tested, a remarkably rare feature that is best explained by detailed analysis as the size-selective strong coordination of Pd onto pyrazoles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show energetically favorable Pd binding between the metal and N-sites of COP-214. The polymer is reusable multiple times without loss of activity, providing great incentives for an industrial prospect.},

  abstract     = {Hybridization with conductive nanospecies has attracted intense research interest as a general effective means to improve the photocatalytic functionalities of nanostructured materials. To establish universal design rules for high-performance hybrid photocatalysts, correlations between versatile roles of conductive species and interfacial interaction between hybridized species are systematically investigated through fine-control of intersheet distance between photocatalytically active TiO 2 and metallic reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/RuO 2 nanosheets. Molecular-level tailoring of intersheet distance and electronic coupling between 2D nanosheets can be successfully achieved by restacking of colloidal nanosheet mixture with variable-sized organic intercalants. While the shortest intersheet distance between restacked TiO 2 and rGO nanosheets leads to the highest visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity, the best UV–vis photocatalyst performance occurs for moderate intersheet spacing. These results highlight the greater sensitivity of photoinduced electronic excitation to the intersheet distance than that of interfacial charge transfer. The rGO nanosheet can function as effective charge transport pathway and cocatalyst within ≈1.7 nm distance from the semiconducting nanosheet, and as efficient stabilizer for hybridized photocatalyst within ≈1.8 nm. The present study underscores that the intercalative restacking of colloidal nanosheet mixture with intercalants enables molecular-level control of distance between 2D inorganic/graphene nanosheets, which provides a rational design strategy for high-performance hybrid photocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NITRR) offers a promising alternative toward nitrogen recycling and ammonia production under ambient conditions, for which highly active and selective electrocatalyst is desired. In this study, metallic cobalt nanoarrays as facilely prepared from the electrochemical reduction of Co(OH) 2 nanoarrays (NAs) are demonstrated to exhibit unprecedented NH 3 producing capability from catalyzing NITRR. Benefitting from the high intrinsic activity of Co 0 , intimate contact between active species and conductive substrate and the nanostructure which exposes large number of active sites, the Co-NAs electrode exhibits current density of −2.2 A cm −2 and NH 3 production rate of 10.4 mmol h −1 cm −2 at −0.24 V versus RHE under alkaline condition and significantly surpasses reported counterparts. Moreover, the close-to-unity (≥96%) Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward NH 3 is achieved over wide application range (potential, NO 3 − concentration and pH). Density function theory calculation reveals the optimized adsorption energy of NITRR intermediates on Co surface over Co(OH) 2 . Furthermore, it is proposed that despite the sluggish kinetics of Volmer step (H 2 O → *H + *OH) which provides protons in conventional hydrogenation mechanism, the proton-supplying water dissociation process on Co surface is drastically facilitated following a concerted water dissociation–hydrogenation pathway.},

However, the underlying mechanism is still inexplicable. Herein, the luminescence behavior of two series of simple, heteroatom-containing small molecules without aromatic rings, i.e., maleimide and succinimide derivatives, are studied to gain further mechanistic insight into the nonconventional luminescence process. It has been unveiled that all the molecules exhibit bright and visible luminescence in concentrated solution and solid state and the formation of clusters is the root cause for such behaviors, which can effectively increase the possibility of both the nonradiative n– π * and favorable π – π * transitions and stabilize the excitons formed in the excited state. The distinctive luminescent phenomena and intriguing mechanism presented in this work will be significant for understanding the mechanism of clusteroluminescence and provide new strategies for the rational design of novel luminescent materials.},

Current collagen-polyester composite hydrogels consisting of pre-formed polymeric particles encapsulated within a low concentrated collagen hydrogel suffer from poor physical properties and low drug loading. Herein, an amphiphilic composite platform associating dense collagen hydrogels and up to 50 wt% polyesters with different hydrophobicity and chain length is developed. An original method of fabrication is disclosed based on in situ nanoprecipitation of polyesters impregnated in a pre-formed 3D dense collagen network. Composites made of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) but not polycaprolactone (PCL) exhibit improved mechanical properties compared to those of pure collagen dense hydrogels while keeping a high degree of hydration. Release kinetics of spironolactone, a lipophilic steroid used as a drug model, can be tuned over one month. No cytotoxicity of the composites is observed on fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Unlike the incorporation of pre-formed particles, the new process allows for both improved physical properties of collagen hydrogels and controlled drug delivery. The ease of fabrication, wide range of accessible compositions, and positive preliminary safety evaluations of these collagen-polyesters will favor their translation into clinics in wide areas such as drug delivery and tissue engineering.},

Compared with conventional fabrication methods, the present strategy shows stability and controllability of the product. Benefiting from their uniform hollow structure, the resultant microbubbles present the same behavior of the Cheerios and can float in the gastric juice, adhere and remain to the stomach wall, which thus enhance the duration and absorption of the loaded drugs. Based on these, it is demonstrated as a proof of concept that the dexamethasone-loaded hollow microbubbles can be applied to oral administration and remain suspended and adhered to the stomach of murine for more than 1 d, showing good therapeutic effect in treating lupus erythematosus.

  abstract     = {Size engineering is deemed to be an adoptable method to boost the electrochemical properties of potassium-ion storage; however, it remains a critical challenge to significantly reduce the nanoparticle size without compromising the uniformity. In this work, a series of MoP nanoparticle splotched nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (MoP@NC) is synthesized. Due to the coordinate and hydrogen bonds in the water-soluble polyacrylamide hydrogel, MoP is uniformly confined in a 3D porous NC to form ultrafine nanoparticles which facilitate the extreme exposure of abundant three-phase boundaries (MoP, NC, and electrolyte) for ionic binding and storage. Consequently, MoP@NC-1 delivers an excellent capacity performance (256.1 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 ) and long-term cycling durability (89.9% capacitance retention after 800 cycles). It is further confirmed via density functional theory calculations that the smaller the MoP nanoparticle, the larger the three-phase boundary achieved for favoring competitive binding energy toward potassium ions. Finally, MoP@NC-1 is applied as highly electroactive additive for 3D printing ink to fabricate 3D-printed potassium-ion hybrid capacitors, which delivers high gravimetric energy/power density of 69.7 Wh kg −1 /2041.6 W kg −1 , as well as favorable areal energy/power density of 0.34 mWh cm −2 /9.97 mW cm −2 .},

The foldable device technology is distinct from flexible technology, as foldable devices have to withstand severe mechanical stresses such as those caused by an extremely small bending radius of 0.5 mm. To realize foldable devices, transparent conductors must exhibit outstanding mechanical resilience, for which they must be micrometer-thin, and the conducting material must be embedded into a substrate. Here, single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs)–polyimide (PI) composite film with a thickness of 7 µm is synthesized and used as a foldable transparent conductor in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). During the high-temperature curing of the CNTs-embedded PI conductor, the CNTs are stably and strongly p -doped using MoO x , resulting in enhanced conductivity and hole transportability. The ultrathin foldable transparent conductor exhibits a sheet resistance of 82 Ω sq. −1 and transmittance of 80% at 700 nm, with a maximum-power-point-tracking-output of 15.2% when made into a foldable solar cell. The foldable solar cells can withstand more than 10 000 folding cycles with a folding radius of 0.5 mm. Such mechanically resilient PSCs are unprecedented; further, they exhibit the best performance among the carbon-nanotube-transparent-electrode-based flexible solar cells.},

Here, a multiscale structural modulation strategy for obtaining highly ordered structure of graphene framework and simultaneously reducing the junction thermal resistance is demonstrated. The resultant anisotropic framework contributes to the polymer composites with a record-high thermal conductivity of 56.8–62.4 W m −1 K −1 at the graphene loading of ≈13.3 vol%, giving an ultrahigh TCE per 1 vol% graphene over 2400%. Furthermore, thermal energy management applications of the composites as phase change materials for solar-thermal energy conversion and as thermal interface materials for electronic device cooling are demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Smart electronics and wearable devices require batteries with increased energy density, enhanced safety, and improved mechanical flexibility. However, current state-of-the-art Li-based rechargeable batteries (LBRBs) use highly reactive and flowable liquid electrolytes, severely limiting their ability to meet the above requirements. Therefore, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are introduced to tackle the issues of liquid electrolytes. Nevertheless, due to their low Li + conductivity and Li + transference number (LITN) (around 10 −5 S cm −1 and 0.5, respectively), SPE-based room temperature LBRBs are still in their early stages of development. This paper reviews the principles of Li + conduction inside SPEs and the corresponding strategies to improve the Li + conductivity and LITN of SPEs. Some representative applications of SPEs in high-energy density, safe, and flexible LBRBs are then introduced and prospected.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, bacteria-based cancer immunotherapy has attracted much attention in the academic circle due to its unique mechanism and abundant applications in triggering the host anti-tumor immunity. One advantage of bacteria lies in their capability in targeting tumors and preferentially colonizing the core area of the tumor. Because bacteria are abundant in pathogen-associated molecular patterns that can effectively activate the immune cells even in the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, they are capable of enhancing the specific immune recognition and elimination of tumor cells. More attractively, during the rapid development of synthetic biology, using gene technology to enable bacteria to be an efficient producer of immunotherapeutic agents has led to many creative immunotherapy paradigms. The combination of bacteria and nanomaterials also displays infinite imagination in the multifunctional endowment for cancer immunotherapy. The current progress report summarizes the recent advances in bacteria-based cancer immunotherapy with specific foci on the applications of naive bacteria-, engineered bacteria-, and bacterial components-based cancer immunotherapy, and at the same time discusses future directions in this field of research based on the present developments.},

Here, asymmetric cell division (ACD) at the early stage of induced neuronal (iN) reprogramming is shown to play a deterministic role in generating elite cells for reprogramming. Within one day, fibroblasts underwent ACD, with one daughter cell being converted into an iN precursor and the other one remaining as a fibroblast. Inhibition of ACD significantly inhibited iN conversion. Moreover, the daughter cells showed asymmetric DNA segregation and histone marks during cytokinesis, and the cells inheriting newly replicated DNA strands during ACD became iN precursors. These results unravel a deterministic step at the early phase of cell reprogramming and demonstrate a novel role of ACD in cell phenotype change. This work also supports a novel hypothesis that daughter cells with newly replicated DNA strands are elite cells for reprogramming, which remains to be tested in various reprogramming processes.},

  abstract     = {Rational construction of sulfur electrodes is essential in pursuit of practically viable lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Herein, bimetallic NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) with a unique hierarchical micro-nano architecture is developed as an advanced sulfur reservoir for Li–S batteries. Compared with the monometallic Co-layered double hydroxide (Co-LDH) counterpart, the bimetallic configuration realizes much enriched, miniaturized, and vertically aligned LDH nanosheets assembled in hollow polyhedral nanoarchitecture, which geometrically benefits the interface exposure for host–guest interactions. Beyond that, the introduction of secondary metal intensifies the chemical interactions between layered double hydroxide (LDH) and sulfur species, which implements strong sulfur immobilization and catalyzation for rapid and durable sulfur electrochemistry. Furthermore, the favorable NiCo-LDH is architecturally upgraded into closely packed micro-nano clusters with facilitated long-range electron/ion conduction and robust structural integrity. Due to these attributes, the corresponding Li–S cells realize excellent cyclability over 800 cycles with a minimum capacity fading of 0.04% per cycle and good rate capability up to 2 C. Moreover, highly reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mAh cm −2 can be achieved under a raised sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm −2 . This work provides not only an effective architectural design but also a deepened understanding on bimetallic LDH sulfur reservoir for high-performance Li–S batteries.},

  abstract     = {Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has contributed to improving breast cancer outcomes, and it would ideally reduce the need for definitive breast surgery in patients who have no residual cancer after NAC treatment. However, there is no reliable noninvasive imaging modality accepted as the routine method to assess response to NAC. Because of the inability to detect complete response, post-NAC surgery remains the standard of care. To overcome this limitation, a single-breath-hold photoacoustic computed tomography (SBH-PACT) system is developed to provide contrast similar to that of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, but with much higher spatial and temporal resolution and without injection of contrast chemicals. SBH-PACT images breast cancer patients at three time points: before, during, and after NAC. The analysis of tumor size, blood vascular density, and irregularity in the distribution and morphology of the blood vessels on SBH-PACT accurately identifies response to NAC as confirmed by the histopathological diagnosis. SBH-PACT shows its near-term potential as a diagnostic tool for assessing breast cancer response to systemic treatment by noninvasively measuring the changes in cancer-associated angiogenesis. Further development of SBH-PACT may also enable serial imaging, rather than the use of current invasive biopsies, to diagnose and follow indeterminate breast lesions.},

In the present review, the possible crosstalk between bone and intrabony peripheral nerves will be comprehensively analyzed. Peripheral nerves participate in bone development and repair via a host of signals generated through the secretion of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, axon guidance factors and neurotrophins, with additional contribution from nerve-resident cells. In return, bone contributes to this microenvironmental rendezvous by housing the nerves within its internal milieu to provide mechanical support and a protective shelf. A large ensemble of chemical, mechanical, and electrical cues works in harmony with bone marrow stromal cells in the regulation of intrabony nerves. The crosstalk between bone and nerves is not limited to the physiological state, but also involved in various bone diseases including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, heterotopic ossification, psychological stress-related bone abnormalities, and bone related tumors. This crosstalk may be harnessed in the design of tissue engineering scaffolds for repair of bone defects or be targeted for treatment of diseases related to bone and peripheral nerves.},

The gold standard therapies such as bypass and endovascular surgery aim at the removal of the blockage. These therapies are not suitable for the so-called “no option patients” which present multiple artery occlusions with a likelihood of significant limb amputation. Therefore, CLTI represents a significant clinical challenge, and the efforts of developing new treatments have been focused on stimulating angiogenesis in the ischemic muscle. The delivery of pro-angiogenic nucleic acid, protein, and stem cell-based interventions have limited efficacy due to their short survival. Engineered biomaterials have emerged as a promising method to improve the effectiveness of these latter strategies. Several synthetic and natural biomaterials are tested in different formulations aiming to incorporate nucleic acid, proteins, stem cells, macrophages, or endothelial cells in supportive matrices. In this review, an overview of the biomaterials used alone and in combination with growth factors, nucleic acid, and cells in preclinical models is provided and their potential to induce revascularization and regeneration for CLTI applications is discussed.},

Herein, a block copolymer (BCP) composed of robust and electrolyte-affinitive polysulfone (PSF) and Li + -affinitive polyethylene glycol (PEG) is rationally designed to prepare a new type of LIB separator. The copolymer is subjected to selective swelling, producing nanoporous membranes with PEG chains enriched along the pore walls. Intriguingly, when used as LIB separators, thus-produced BCP membranes efficiently integrate the merits of both PSF and PEG chains, endowing the separators thermal resistance as high as 150 °C and excellent wettability. Importantly, the nanoporous separator is able to close the pores with a temperature of 125 °C, offering the battery a thermal shutdown function. The membrane exhibits ultrahigh electrolyte uptake up to 501% and a prominent ionic conductivity of 10.1 mS cm −1 at room temperature. Batteries assembled with these membranes show excellent discharge capacity and C -rate performance, outperforming batteries assembled from other separators including the extensively used Celgard 2400. This study demonstrates a facile strategy, selective swelling of block copolymer, to engineer high-performance and safer LIB separators, which is also applicable to produce advanced copolymer-based separators for other types of batteries.},

The authors found a novel lnc-APUE ( lnc RNA a ccelerating p roliferation by u pregulating E2F1) that is upregulated in different cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and high lnc-APUE level is associated with short recurrence-free survival (RFS) of HCC patients. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses showed that lnc-APUE accelerated G1/S transition and tumor cell growth in vitro and allows hepatoma xenografts to grow faster in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-APUE binds to miR-20b and relieves its repression on E2F1 expression, resulting in increased E2F1 level and accelerated G1/S phase transition and cell proliferation. Consistently, lnc-APUE level is positively associated with the expression of E2F1 and its downstream target genes in HCC tissues. Further investigations disclose that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 α ) binds to the lnc-APUE promoter, represses lnc-APUE transcription, then diminishes E2F1 expression and cell proliferation. HNF4 α expression is reduced in HCC tissues and low HNF4 α level is correlated with high lnc-APUE expression. Collectively, a HNF4 α /lnc-APUE/miR-20b/E2F1 axis in which HNF4 α represses lnc-APUE expression and keeps E2F1 at a low level is identified. In tumor cells, HNF4 α downregulation leads to lnc-APUE upregulation, which prevents the inhibition of miR-20b on E2F1 expression and thereby promotes cell cycle progression and tumor growth.},

After reviewing current growth kinetics, various representative works involving CVD growth of different sp 2 nanocarbons are analyzed, to reveal their bandgap-coupled kinetics and resulting selective synthesis.

Though significant advancements have been made in development of FW-resistant Upland cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ) in resistance screening programs, the precise resistance genes and the corresponding molecular mechanisms for resistance to Fov remain unclear. Herein it is reported that Fov7 , a gene unlike canonical plant disease-resistance ( R ) genes, putatively encoding a GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) protein, confers resistance to Fov race 7 in Upland cotton. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C/A) in GhGLR4.8 , resulting in an amino acid change (L/I), is associated with Fov resistance. A PCR-based DNA marker ( GhGLR4.8 SNP(A/C) ) is developed and shown to cosegregate with the Fov resistance. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Fov7 results in cotton lines extremely susceptible to Fov race 7 with a loss of the ability to induce calcium influx in response to total secreted proteins (SEPs) of Fov . Furthermore, coinfiltration of SEPs with GhGLR4.8 A results in a hypersensitive response. This first report of a GLR-encoding gene that functions as an R gene provides a new insight into plant–pathogen interactions and a new handle to develop cotton cultivars with resistance to Fov race 7.},

  abstract     = {Graphene oxide (GO) membranes with unique nanolayer structure have demonstrated excellent separation capability based on their size-selective effect, but there are few reports on achieving ion–ion separation, because it is difficult to inhibit the swelling effect of GO nano sheets as well as to precisely control the interlayer spacing d to a specific value between the sizes of different metal ions. Here, selective separation of uranium from acidic radioactive waste containing multication is achieved through a precise dual-adjustment strategy on d . It is found that GO swelling is greatly restricted in highly acidic solution due to protonation effect. Then the interlayer spacing is further precisely reduced to below the diameter of uranyl ion by increasing the oxidation degree of GO. Sieving uranyl ions from other nuclide ions is successfully realized in pH =3–3 mol L −1 nitric acid solutions.},

  abstract     = {The rise of metabolic disorders in modern times is mainly attributed to the environment. However, heritable effects of environmental chemicals on mammalian offsprings&#39; metabolic health are unclear. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is the top chemical on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry priority list of hazardous substances. Here, we assess cross-generational effects of iAs in an exclusive male-lineage transmission paradigm. The exposure of male mice to 250 ppb iAs causes glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance in F1 females, but not males, without affecting body weight. Hepatic expression of glucose metabolic genes, glucose output, and insulin signaling are disrupted in F1 females. Inhibition of the glucose 6-phosphatase complex masks the intergenerational effect of iAs, demonstrating a causative role of hepatic glucose production. F2 offspring from grandpaternal iAs exposure show temporary growth retardation at an early age, which diminishes in adults. However, reduced adiposity persists into middle age and is associated with altered gut microbiome and increased brown adipose thermogenesis. In contrast, F3 offspring of the male-lineage iAs exposure show increased adiposity, especially on a high-calorie diet. These findings have unveiled sex- and generation-specific heritable effects of iAs on metabolic physiology, which has broad implications in understanding gene-environment interactions.},

To improve their performance, single-crystalline and defect-free nanoparticles have thus far been aspired. However, in several recent studies, defect-rich nanoparticles outperform their defect-free counterparts in magnetic hyperthermia and magnetic particle imaging (MPI). Here, an overview on the state-of-the-art of design and characterization of defects and resulting spin disorder in magnetic nanoparticles is presented with a focus on iron oxide nanoparticles. The beneficial impact of defects and disorder on intracellular magnetic hyperthermia performance of magnetic nanoparticles for drug delivery and cancer therapy is emphasized. Defect-engineering in iron oxide nanoparticles emerges to become an alternative approach to tailor their magnetic properties for biomedicine, as it is already common practice in established systems such as semiconductors and emerging fields including perovskite solar cells. Finally, perspectives and thoughts are given on how to deliberately induce defects in iron oxide nanoparticles and their potential implications for magnetic tracers to monitor cell therapy and immunotherapy by MPI.},

  abstract     = {Iodine-125 ( 125 I) brachytherapy, a promising form of radiotherapy, is increasingly applied in the clinical treatment of a wide range of solid tumors. However, the extremely hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors can cause hypoxia-induced radioresistance to 125 I brachytherapy, resulting in therapeutic inefficacy. In this study, the aim is to sensitize hypoxic areas in solid tumors using ultrasound-activated oxygen microbubbles for 125 I brachytherapy. A modified emulsion freeze-drying method is developed to prepare microbubbles that can be lyophilized for storage and easily reconstituted in situ before administration. The filling gas of the microbubbles is modified by the addition of sulfur hexafluoride to oxygen such that the obtained O 2 /SF 6 microbubbles (OS MBs) achieve a much longer half-life (&gt;3×) than that of oxygen microbubbles. The OS MBs are tested in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (CNE2) tumor-bearing mice and oxygen delivery by the OS MBs induced by ultrasound irradiation relieve hypoxia instantly. The post-treatment results of brachytherapy combined with the ultrasound-triggered OS MBs show a greatly improved therapeutic efficacy compared with brachytherapy alone, illustrating ultrasound-mediated oxygen delivery with the developed OS MBs as a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic outcome of 125 I brachytherapy in hypoxic tumors.},

In recent decades, nanomaterials have received increasing attention for diagnosis and therapy of PDAC. However, these designs are mainly focused on the macroscopic tumor therapeutic effect, while the crucial nano–bio interactions in the heterogeneous microenvironment of PDAC remain poorly understood. As a result, the majority of potent nanomedicines show limited performance in ameliorating PDAC in clinical translation. Therefore, exploiting the unique nature of the PDAC by detecting potential biomarkers together with a deep understanding of nano–bio interactions that occur in the tumor microenvironment is pivotal to the design of PDAC-tailored effective nanomedicine. This review will introduce tailor-made nanomaterials-enabled laboratory tests and advanced noninvasive imaging technologies for early and accurate diagnosis of PDAC. Moreover, the fabrication of a myriad of tailor-made nanomaterials for various PDAC therapeutic modalities will be reviewed. Furthermore, much preferred theranostic multifunctional nanomaterials for imaging-guided therapies of PDAC will be elaborated. Lastly, the prospects of these nanomaterials in terms of clinical translation and potential breakthroughs will be briefly discussed.},

Although great progress has been achieved in improving evaporation rate and energy efficiency, it&#39;s still challenging to fully eliminate the energy loss to the surrounding environment during solar steam generation. To achieve this, a novel heatsink-like evaporator (HSE) is developed herein. During solar evaporation, the temperature on the top solar evaporation surface can be regulated by the fin structures of the HSE. For the evaporators with 5 to 7 heatsink fins, the temperature of the solar evaporation surface is decreased to be lower than the ambient temperature, which fully eliminates the radiation, convection, and conduction heat losses, leading to the absolute cold evaporation over the entire evaporator under 1.0 sun irradiation. As a result, massive energy (4.26 W), which is over 170% of the received light energy, is harvested from the environment due to the temperature deficit, significantly enhancing the energy efficiency of solar steam generation. An extremely high evaporation rate of 4.10 kg m −2 h −1 is realized with a 6-fin photothermal HSE, corresponding to an energy conversion efficiency far beyond the theoretical limit, assuming 100% light-to-vapor energy conversion.},

For artificial tactile cognition, the tactile feeling of humans to various tactile materials ranging from smooth/soft to rough are assessed and found variation among participants. Because tactile responses vary among humans, a deep learning structure is designed to allow personalization through training based on individualized histograms of human tactile cognition and recording physical tactile information. The decision error in each avatar system is less than 2% when 42 materials are used to measure the tactile data with 100 trials for each material under 1.2N of contact force with 4cm s −1 of sliding velocity. As a tactile avatar, the machine categorizes newly experienced materials based on the tactile knowledge obtained from training data. The tactile sensation showed a high correlation with the specific user&#39;s tendency. This approach can be applied to electronic devices with tactile emotional exchange capabilities, as well as advanced digital experiences.},

Here, a conductive graphene scaffold (CGS) to modulate mechanical and electrical signals to promote human iPSC-derived neurons is presented. The soft CGS with cortex-like stiffness (≈3 kPa) and electrical stimulation (±800 mV/100 Hz for 1 h) incurs a fivefold improvement in the rate (14d) of generating iPSC-derived neurons over some traditional protocols, with an increase in mature cellular markers and electrophysiological characteristics. Consistent with other culture conditions, it is found that the pro-neurogenic effects of mechanical and electrical stimuli rely on RhoA/ROCK signaling and de novo ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) production respectively. Thus, the CGS system creates a combined physical and continuously modifiable, electrical niche to efficiently and quickly generate iPSC-derived neurons.},

In situ etching of PBA particles induces nucleation and growth of TiO 2 nanoflakes onto the concave surface of PBA particles, and thus enhances the interlayer interaction. The anisotropic PBA–TiO 2 Janus nanoreactor demonstrates enhanced photocatalytic activities for both water reduction and oxidation reactions compared with TiO 2 and PBA alone. As far as it is known, this is the first PBA-based composite that serves as a bifunctional photocatalyst for solar water splitting. The interfacial structure between two materials is vital for charge separation and transfer based on the spectroscopic studies. These results shed light on the elaborate construction of Janus nanoreactor, highlighting the important role of interfacial design at the microscale level.},

  abstract     = {Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is distinguished by the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This cell death has been studied in the field of cancer immunotherapy due to the ability of ICD to induce antitumor immunity. Herein, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated ICD inducing fluorinated mitochondria-disrupting helical polypeptides (MDHPs) are reported. The fluorination of the polypeptide provides a high helical structure and potent anticancer ability. This helical polypeptide destabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane, leading to the overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. In addition, this oxidative stress triggers ER stress-mediated ICD. The in vivo results show that cotreatment of fluorinated MDHP and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 antibodies ( α PD-L1) significantly regresses tumor growth and prevents metastasis to the lungs by activating the cytotoxic T cell response and alleviating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These results indicate that fluorinated MDHP synergizes with the immune checkpoint blockade therapy to eliminate established tumors and to elicit antitumor immune responses.},

  abstract     = {A quantum magnetic state due to magnetic charges is never observed, even though they are treated as quantum mechanical variables in theoretical calculations. Here, the occurrence of a novel quantum disordered state of magnetic charges in a nanoengineered magnetic honeycomb lattice of ultra-small connecting elements is demonstrated. The experimental research, performed using spin resolved neutron scattering, reveals a massively degenerate ground state, comprised of low integer and energetically forbidden high integer magnetic charges, that manifests cooperative paramagnetism at low temperature. The system tends to preserve the degenerate configuration even under large magnetic field application. It exemplifies the robustness of disordered correlation of magnetic charges in a 2D honeycomb lattice. The realization of quantum disordered ground state elucidates the dominance of exchange energy, which is enabled due to the nanoscopic magnetic element size in nanoengineered honeycomb. Consequently, an archetypal platform is envisaged to study quantum mechanical phenomena due to emergent magnetic charges.},

An array of 0.5Rh-, 1Rh-, and 2Rh-TiO 2 /SnO 2 sensors exhibits discrimination and composition analyses of aromatic compounds. The conversion of gases into more active species at moderate catalytic activation and the complete oxidation of gases into non-reactive forms by excessive catalytic promotion are proposed as the reasons behind the enhancement and suppression of analyte gases, respectively. Analysis using proton transfer reaction-quadrupole mass spectrometer (PTR-QMS) is performed to verify the above proposals. Although the sensing characteristics exhibit mild moisture interference, bilayer sensors with systematic and tailored control of gas selectivity and response provide new pathways for monitoring aromatic air pollutants and evaluating their health impacts.},

  abstract     = {Obesity and its related complications pose an increasing threat to human health; however, targetable obesity-related membrane receptors are not yet elucidated. Here, the membrane receptor CD146 is demonstrated to play an essential role in obesity. In particular, CD146 acts as a new adipose receptor for angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), which is thought to act on endothelial cells to activate adipose inflammation. ANGPTL2 binds to CD146 to activate cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which then upregulates CD146 during adipogenesis and adipose inflammation. CD146 is present in preadipocytes and mature adipocytes, where it is mediated by its ligands ANGPTL2 and galectin-1. In preadipocytes, CD146 ablation suppresses adipogenesis, whereas the loss of CD146 in mature adipocytes suppresses lipid accumulation and enhances energy expenditure. Moreover, anti-CD146 antibodies inhibit obesity by disrupting the interactions between CD146 and its ligands. Together, these findings demonstrate that ANGPTL2 directly affects adipocytes via CD146 to promote obesity, suggesting that CD146 can be a potential target for treating obesity.},

  abstract     = {Implant-associated infections (IAIs) are a common cause of orthopedic surgery failure due to microbial biofilm-induced antibiotic-resistance and innate immune inactivation. Thus, the destruction of microbial biofilm plays a key role in reducing IAIs. Herein, first, a magneto-based synergetic therapy (MST) is proposed and demonstrated against IAIs based on biofilm destruction. Under an alternating magnetic field (AMF), CoFe 2 O 4 @MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles (MNPs), with a rather strong magnetic hyperthermal capacity, can generate sufficient thermal effect to cause dense biofilm dispersal. Loosened biofilms provide channels through which nitrosothiol-coated MNPs (MNP-SNOs) can penetrate. Subsequently, thermosensitive nitrosothiols rapidly release nitric oxide (NO) inside biofilms, thus efficiently killing sessile bacteria under the magnetothermal effect of MNPs. More importantly, MNP-SNOs can trigger macrophage-related immunity to prevent the relapse of IAIs by exposing the infected foci to a consistent innate immunomodulatory effect. The notable anti-infection effect of this nanoplatform is also confirmed in a rat IAI model. This work presents the promising potential of combining magnetothermal therapy with immunotherapy, for the effective and durable control and elimination of IAIs.},

The high efficiency and energy saving mainly come from the deployed super hygroscopic complex (SHC), which exhibits high water uptake (4.64 g g −1 ) and facile regeneration. Machine-learning-assisted in-house developed low cost and high precision hygrometers enable the autonomous operation of the humidity management system. The dehumidifier can reduce the relative humidity (RH) of a confined room from 75% to 60% in 15 minutes with energy consumption of 0.05 kWh, saving more than 60% of energy compared with the commercial desiccant dehumidifiers, and harvest 10 L of atmospheric water in 24 h. Moreover, the reduction in RH from 80% to 60% at 32 °C results in the reduction of apparent temperature by about 7 °C, thus effectively improving the thermal comfort of the inhabitants.},

  abstract     = {As the recognition between natural killer (NK) cells and cancer cells does not require antigen presentation, NK cells are being actively studied for use in adoptive cell therapies in the rapidly evolving armamentarium of cancer immunotherapy. In addition to utilizing NK cells, recent studies have shown that exosomes derived from NK cells also exhibit antitumor properties. Furthermore, these NK cell-derived exosomes exhibit higher stability, greater modification potentials and less immunogenicity compared to NK cells. Therefore, technologies that allow highly sensitive and specific isolation of NK cells and NK cell-derived exosomes can enable personalized NK-mediated cancer therapeutics in the future. Here, a novel microfluidic system to collect patient-specific NK cells and on-chip biogenesis of NK-exosomes is proposed. In a small cohort of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, both NK cells and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were isolated, and it is found NSCLC patients have high numbers of NK and NK-exosomes compared with healthy donors, and these concentrations show a trend of positive and negative correlations with bloodborne CTC numbers, respectively. It is further demonstrated that the NK-exosomes harvested from NK-graphene oxide chip exhibit cytotoxic effect on CTCs. This versatile system is expected to be used for patient-specific NK-based immunotherapies along with CTCs for potential prognostic/diagnostic applications.},

  abstract     = {Mild-acid Zn-MnO 2 batteries have been considered a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries for large scale energy storage systems because of their high safety. There have been remarkable improvements in the electrochemical performance of Zn-MnO 2 batteries, although the reaction mechanism of the MnO 2 cathode is not fully understood and still remains controversial. Herein, the reversible dissolution/deposition (Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ ) mechanism of the MnO 2 cathode through a 2e − reaction is directly evidenced using solution-based analyses, including electron spin resonance spectroscopy and the designed electrochemical experiments. Solid MnO 2 (Mn 4+ ) is reduced into Mn 2+ (aq) dissolved in the electrolyte during discharge. Mn 2+ ions are then deposited on the cathode surface in the form of the mixture of the poorly crystalline Zn-containing MnO 2 compounds through two-step reactions during charge. Moreover, the failure mechanism of mild-acid Zn-MnO 2 batteries is elucidated in terms of the loss of electrochemically active Mn 2+ . In this regard, a porous carbon interlayer is introduced to entrap the dissolved Mn 2+ ions. The carbon interlayer suppresses the loss of Mn 2+ during cycling, resulting in the excellent electrochemical performance of pouch-type Zn-MnO 2 cells, such as negligible capacity fading over 100 cycles. These findings provide fundamental insights into strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of aqueous Zn-MnO 2 batteries.},

  abstract     = {Solar-powered N 2 reduction in aqueous solution is becoming a research hotspot for ammonia production. Schottky junctions at the metal/semiconductor interface have been effective to build up a one-way channel for the delivery of photogenerated electrons toward photoredox reactions. However, their applications for enhancing the aqueous phase reduction of N 2 to ammonia have been bottlenecked by the difficulty of N 2 activation and the competing H 2 evolution reaction (HER) at the metal surface. Herein, the application of Bi with low HER activity as a robust cocatalyst for constructing Schottky-junction photocatalysts toward N 2 reduction to ammonia is reported. The introduction of Bi not only boosts the interfacial electron transfer from excited photocatalysts due to the built-in Schottky-junction effect at the Bi/semiconductor interface but also synchronously facilitates the on-site N 2 adsorption and activation toward solar ammonia production. The unidirectional charge transfer to the active site of Bi significantly promotes the photocatalytic N 2 -to-ammonia conversion efficiency by 65 times for BiOBr. In addition, utilizing Bi to enhance the photocatalytic ammonia production can be extended to other semiconductor systems. This work is expected to unlock the promise of engineering Schottky junctions toward high-efficiency solar N 2 -to-ammonia conversion in aqueous phase.},

Gibbs free energy analysis suggests that the hairpin-spacer crRNAs (hs-crRNAs) suppress Cas13a&#39;s affinity to off-target RNA. A hepatitis B virus DNA genotyping platform is established to further validate the high-specificity of hs-CRISPR/Cas13a system.

  abstract     = {The correlation between structure and function lies at the heart of materials science and engineering. Especially, modern functional materials usually contain inhomogeneities at an atomic level, endowing them with interesting properties regarding electrons, phonons, and magnetic moments. Over the past few decades, many of the key developments in functional materials have been driven by the rapid advances in short-range crystallographic techniques. Among them, pair distribution function (PDF) technique, capable of utilizing the entire Bragg and diffuse scattering signals, stands out as a powerful tool for detecting local structure away from average. With the advent of synchrotron X-rays, spallation neutrons, and advanced computing power, the PDF can quantitatively encode a local structure and in turn guide atomic-scale engineering in the functional materials. Here, the PDF investigations in a range of functional materials are reviewed, including ferroelectrics/thermoelectrics, colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) magnets, high-temperature superconductors (HTSC), quantum dots (QDs), nano-catalysts, and energy storage materials, where the links between functions and structural inhomogeneities are prominent. For each application, a brief description of the structure-function coupling will be given, followed by selected cases of PDF investigations. Before that, an overview of the theory, methodology, and unique power of the PDF method will be also presented.},

  abstract     = {Today&#39;s organic electronic devices, such as the highly successful OLED displays, are based on disordered films, with carrier mobilities orders of magnitude below those of inorganic semiconductors like silicon or GaAs. For organic devices such as diodes and transistors, higher charge carrier mobilities are paramount to achieve high performance. Organic single crystals have been shown to offer these required high mobilities. However, manufacturing and processing of these crystals are complex, rendering their use outside of laboratory-scale applications negligible. Furthermore, doping cannot be easily integrated into these systems, which is particularly problematic for devices mandating high mobility materials. Here, it is demonstrated for the model system rubrene that highly ordered, doped thin films can be prepared, allowing high-performance organic devices on almost any substrate. Specifically, triclinic rubrene crystals are created by abrupt heating of amorphous layers and can be electrically doped during the epitaxial growth process to achieve hole or electron conduction. Analysis of the space charge limited current in these films reveals record vertical mobilities of 10.3(49) cm 2 V −1 s −1 . To demonstrate the performance of this materials system, monolithic pin-diodes aimed for rectification are built. The f 3 d b of these diodes is over 1 GHz and thus higher than any other organic semiconductor-based device shown so far. It is believed that this work will pave the way for future high-performance organic devices based on highly crystalline thin films.},

Herein, a thiolated nano-vaccine allowing direct cytosolic delivery of neoantigen and Toll like receptor 9 agonist CpG-ODN is developed. This approach is capable of bypassing the endo-/lysosome degradation, increasing uptake and local concentration of neoantigen and CpG-ODN to activate antigen-presenting cells, significantly strengthening the anti-cancer T-cell immunity. In vivo immunization with thiolated nano-vaccine enhanced the lymph organ homing and promoted the antigen presentation on dendritic cells, effectively inhibited tumor growth, and significantly prolonged the survival of H22-bearing mice. Strikingly, further combination of the thiolated nano-vaccine with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 antibody ( α PD-1) could efficiently reverse immunosuppression and enhance response rate of tumors, which led to enhanced tumor elimination, complete prevention of tumor re-challenge, and long-term survival above 150 d. Collectively, a versatile methodology to design cancer vaccines for strengthening anti-cancer T-cell immunity in solid tumors is presented, which could be further remarkably enhanced by combining with immune checkpoint inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {Optical multiplexing attracts considerable attention in the field of information encryption, optical probe, and time-resolved bioimaging. However, the optical multiplexing based on rare-earth nanoparticles suffers from heavy metal elements and relatively short lifetimes; sophisticated facilities are thus needed. Herein, time division duplexing based on eco-friendly carbon nanodots (CNDs) with manipulative luminescence lifetimes is demonstrated. In a single green color emission channel, the luminescence lifetimes of the CNDs can be manipulated from nanosecond level to second level by introducing water, while the lifetime of the CNDs confined by a silica shell stays. Time division duplexing based on the CNDs and CNDs@silica with distinct lifetimes is realized and spatio-temporal overlapping information is thus resolved. High-level information encryption using the time division duplexing technology is realized. This work may promise the potential applications of CNDs in multi-lifetime channels biological imaging, high-density information storage, and anti-counterfeiting.},

Clinical adoption of evidence-based treatments necessitates rapid diagnostic methods for pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) with minimal sample preparation. In response, a microfluidic droplet-based platform is developed for achieving both ID and AST from urine samples within 30 min. In this platform, fluorogenic hybridization probes are utilized to detect 16S rRNA from single bacterial cells encapsulated in picoliter droplets, enabling molecular identification of uropathogenic bacteria directly from urine in as little as 16 min. Moreover, in-droplet single-bacterial measurements of 16S rRNA provide a surrogate for AST, shortening the exposure time to 10 min for gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. A fully integrated device and screening workflow were developed to test urine specimens for one of seven unique diagnostic outcomes including the presence/absence of Gram-negative bacteria, molecular ID of the bacteriaas Escherichia coli , an Enterobacterales , or other organism, and assessment of bacterial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. In a 50-specimen clinical comparison study, the platform demonstrates excellent performance compared to clinical standard methods (areas-under-curves, AUCs &gt;0.95), within a small fraction of the turnaround time, highlighting its clinical utility.},

Herein, tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 )-polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized through one-step solvothermal route. The WSe 2 -PVP NPs show synergetic ice regulation ability both in the freezing and thawing processes. Molecularly speaking, PVP containing amides group can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. At a macro level, the WSe 2 -PVP NPs show adsorption-inhibition and photothermal conversation effects to synergistically restrict ice growth. Meanwhile, WSe 2 -PVP NPs are for the first time used for the cryopreservation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)-laden constructs based on rapid freezing with low concentrations of cryoprotectants (CPAs), the experimental results indicate that a minimal concentration (0.5 mg mL −1 ) of WSe 2 -PVP NPs can increase the viabilities of HUVECs in the constructs post cryopreservation (from 55.8% to 83.4%) and the cryopreserved constructs can also keep good condition in vivo within 7 days. Therefore, this work provides a novel strategy to synergistically suppress the formation and growth of the ice crystalsfor the cryopreservation of cells, tissues, or organs.},

For this purpose, colloidal quantum dot (QD) graphene phototransistors offer a viable alternative to traditional technologies owing to inexpensive synthesis and processing of QDs. However, the spectral range of QD/graphene phototransistors is thus far limited to 1.6 µm. Here, HgTe QD/graphene phototransistors with spectral sensitivity up to 3 µm are presented, with specific detectivities of 6 × 10 8 Jones at a wavelength of 2.5 µm and a temperature of 80 K. Even at kHz light modulation frequencies, specific detectivities exceed 10 8 Jones making them suitable for fast video imaging.

However, devices fabricated by blade coating techniques are inferior to state-of-the-art spin-coated devices because the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) is highly dependent on the morphology and crystallization kinetics in the controlled environment and the delicate solvent system engineering. In this study, based on the widely studied perovskite solution system dimethylformamide–dimethyl sulfoxide, air-knife-assisted ambient fabrication of PSCs at a high relative humidity of 55 ± 5% is reported. In-depth time-resolved UV–vis spectrometry is carried out to investigate the impact of solvent removal and crystallization rate, which are critical factors influencing the crystallization kinetics and morphology because of adventitious moisture. UV–vis spectrometry enables accurate determination of the thickness of the wet precursor film. Anti-solvent-free, high-humidity ambient coatings of hysteresis-free PSCs with PCE s of 21.1% and 18.0% are demonstrated for 0.06 and 1 cm 2 devices, respectively. These PSCs exhibit comparable stability to those fabricated in a glovebox, thus demonstrating their high potential.},

The networking state Yb 3+ shows both distinct Stark splitting peak ratios and lifetime dynamics, which allows quantitative investigations of quenching and thermal activation of luminescence, as the high-dimensional spectroscopy signatures can be correlated to the attaching and de-attaching status of surface molecules. By in-situ surface characterizations, it is proved that the Yb-O coordination associated with coordinated water molecules has significantly contributed to this reversible effect.

Here, a novel strategy is presented, cooperatively (thermodynamically and kinetically) controlled crystallization for the highly selective separation of intermediate-size anionic pollutants from their analogs in water through one-pot construction of cationic metal-organic frameworks (CMOFs) with higher stabilities and faster crystallization, which are based on the target anions as charge-balancing anions. 4,4′-azo-triazole and Cu 2+ are chosen as suitable ligand and metal ion for CMOF construction because they can form stronger intermolecular interaction with p -toluenesulfonate anion (Tsˉ) compared to its analogs. For this combination, a condition is established, under which the crystallization rate of a Tsˉ-based CMOF is remarkably high while those of analog-based CMOFs are almost zero. As a result, the faster crystallization and higher stability cooperatively endow the cationic framework with a close-to-100% selectivity for Tsˉ over its analogs in two-component mixtures, and this preference is retained in a practical mixture containing more than seven competing (analogs and inorganic) anions. The nature of the free Tsˉ anion in the cationic framework also allows the resultant CMOF to be recyclable via anion exchange.},

  abstract     = {Cells are able to perceive complex mechanical cues from their microenvironment, which in turn influences their development. Although the understanding of these intricate mechanotransductive signals is evolving, the precise roles of substrate microtopography in directing cell fate is still poorly understood. Here, UV nanoimprint lithography is used to generate micropillar arrays ranging from 1 to 10 µm in height, width, and spacing to investigate the impact of microtopography on mechanotransduction. Using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a model, stark pattern-specific changes in nuclear architecture, lamin A/C accumulation, chromatin positioning, and DNA methyltransferase expression, are demonstrated. MSC osteogenesis is also enhanced specifically on micropillars with 5 µm width/spacing and 5 µm height. Intriguingly, the highest degree of osteogenesis correlates with patterns that stimulated maximal nuclear deformation which is shown to be dependent on myosin-II-generated tension. The outcomes determine new insights into nuclear mechanotransduction by demonstrating that force transmission across the nuclear envelope can be modulated by substrate topography, and that this can alter chromatin organisation and impact upon cell fate. These findings have potential to inform the development of microstructured cell culture substrates that can direct cell mechanotransduction and fate for therapeutic applications in both research and clinical sectors.},

  abstract     = {The demand for face masks is increasing exponentially due to the coronavirus pandemic and issues associated with airborne particulate matter (PM). However, both conventional electrostatic- and nanosieve-based mask filters are single-use and are not degradable or recyclable, which creates serious waste problems. In addition, the former loses function under humid conditions, while the latter operates with a significant air-pressure drop and suffers from relatively fast pore blockage. Herein, a biodegradable, moisture-resistant, highly breathable, and high-performance fibrous mask filter is developed. Briefly, two biodegradable microfiber and nanofiber mats are integrated into a Janus membrane filter and then coated by cationically charged chitosan nanowhiskers. This filter is as efficient as the commercial N95 filter and removes 98.3% of 2.5 µm PM. The nanofiber physically sieves fine PM and the microfiber provides a low pressure differential of 59 Pa, which is comfortable for human breathing. In contrast to the dramatic performance decline of the commercial N95 filter when exposed to moisture, this filter exhibits negligible performance loss and is therefore multi-usable because the permanent dipoles of the chitosan adsorb ultrafine PM (e.g., nitrogen and sulfur oxides). Importantly, this filter completely decomposes within 4 weeks in composting soil.},

However, normal tissues with low expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can be mistargeted, resulting in severe side effects. An approach using a collection of T cells expressing a diverse, 10 6 -member combinatorial cellular library of CARs, in which members can be specifically enriched based on avidity for cell membrane antigens, is reported. Using CD38 as the target antigen, an efficient and effective selection of CARs specifically recognizing CD38 + tumor cells is demonstrated. These selected CAR-T&#39;s produce cytokines known to be associated with T cell activation in a CD38 expression-dependent manner. This avidity-based selection endows the engineered T cells with minimal off-tumor effects, while retaining robust antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. The described method may facilitate the application of CAR-T therapy to TAAs previously considered undruggable.},

  abstract     = {Li-excess layered cathode (LLC) materials have a high theoretical specific capacity of 250 mAh g −1 induced by transition metal (cationic) and oxygen (anionic) redox activity. Especially, the oxygen redox reaction related to the activation of the Li 2 MnO 3 domain plays the crucial role of providing a high specific capacity. However, it also induces an irreversible oxygen release and accelerates the layered-to-spinel phase transformation and capacity fading. Here, it is shown that surface doping of vanadium (V 5+ ) cations into LLC material suppresses both the irreversible oxygen release and undesirable phase transformation, resulting in the improvement of capacity retention. The V-doped LLC shows a high discharge capacity of 244.3 ± 0.8 mAh g −1 with 92% retention after 100 cycles, whereas LLC delivers 233.6 ± 1.1 mAh g −1 with 74% retention. Furthermore, the average discharge voltage of V-doped LLC drops by only 0.33 V after 100 cycles, while LLC exhibits 0.43 V of average discharge voltage drop. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that doped V-doping increase the transition metal–oxygen (TM  O) covalency and affect the oxidation state of peroxo-like (O 2 ) n − species during the delithiation process. The role of V-doping to make the oxygen redox reversible in LLC materials for high-energy density Li-ion batteries is illustrated here.},

Among these disorders, glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness globally, usually results in irreversible blindness. Continuous intraocular pressure (IOP) monitoring is considered as an effective measure, which provides a comprehensive view of IOP changes that is beyond reach for the “snapshots” measurements by clinical tonometry. However, to satisfy the applications in ophthalmology, the development of IOP sensors are required to be prepared with biocompatible, miniature, transparent, wireless and battery-free features, which are still challenging with many current fabrication processes. In this work, the recent advances in this field are reviewed by categorizing these devices into wearable and implantable IOP sensors. The materials and structures exploited for engineering these IOP devices are presented. Additionally, their working principle, performance, and the potential risk that materials and device architectures may pose to ocular tissue are discussed. This review should be valuable for preferable structure design, device fabrication, performance optimization, and reducing potential risk of these devices. It is significant for the development of future practical IOP sensors.},

  abstract     = {Peptidylarginine deiminase II (PADI2) converts positively charged arginine residues to neutrally charged citrulline, and this activity has been associated with the onset and progression of multiple cancers. However, a role for PADI2 in endometrial cancer (EC) has not been previously explored. This study demonstrates that PADI2 is positively associated with EC proregression. Mechanistically, PADI2 interacting and catalyzing MEK1 citrullination at arginine 113/189 facilitates MEK1 on extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, which activates insulin-like growth factor-II binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) expression. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA stability analyses reveal that IGF2BP1 binds to the m 6 A sites in SOX2 -3′UTR to prevent SOX2 mRNA degradation. Dysregulation of IGF2BP1 by PADI2/MEK1/ERK signaling results in abnormal accumulation of oncogenic SOX2 expression, therefore supporting the malignant state of EC. Finally, PADI2 gene silencing, inhibiting MEK1 citrullination by PADI2 inhibitor, or mutation of MEK1 R113/189 equally inhibits EC progression. These data demonstrate that PADI2-catalyzed MEK1 R113/189 citrullination is a critical diver for EC malignancies and suggest that targeting PADI2/MEK1 can be a potential therapeutic approach in patients with EC.},

  abstract     = {Altering the balance between energy intake and expenditure is a major strategy for treating obesity. Nonetheless, despite the progression in antiobesity drugs on appetite suppression, therapies aimed at increasing energy expenditure are limited. Here, knockout of AKAP1 , a signaling hub on outer mitochondrial membrane, renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. AKAP1 knockout significantly enhances energy expenditure and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissues (BATs) of obese mice. Restoring AKAP1 expression in BAT clearly reverses the beneficial antiobesity effect in AKAP1 −/− mice. Mechanistically, AKAP1 remarkably decreases fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) by phosphorylating ACSL1 to inhibit its activity in a protein-kinase-A-dependent manner and thus inhibits thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Importantly, AKAP1 peptide inhibitor effectively alleviates diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Altogether, the findings demonstrate that AKAP1 functions as a brake of FAO to promote diet-induced obesity, which may be used as a potential therapeutic target for obesity.},

In this paper, monodispersed nanodroplets are prepared and their directed motions are realized through conducting the formation of nonuniform structures via altering the ionic distribution within; all these dynamics have been observed by using in situ transmission electron microscopy liquid cell technology. It has been found that their transformation from random motion to directed motion is reversible. Moreover, combining multiple directed motions enables long-distance travel with directed motion taking up 95% of the total time. The results here also prove that aqueous nanodroplets can slide directionally on the hydrophilic surface like droplets sliding on hydrophobic surface. Furthermore, the authors successfully achieve the unidirectional transportation of in situ prepared Ag nanoparticles by using the nanodroplets as nanoreactor, carrier, and transporter. The size and number of as-prepared Ag nanoparticles can be quantitatively controlled. In summary, this research provides a new strategy for real-time generation and precise manipulation of aqueous nanodroplets.

  abstract     = {There is an urgent need to develop new life-prolonging therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is demonstrated that improved irinotecan delivery by a lipid bilayer coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle, also known as a silicasome, can improve PDAC survival through a chemo-immunotherapy response in an orthotopic Kras-dependent pancreatic cancer model. This discovery is premised on the weak-basic properties of irinotecan, which neutralizes the acidic lysosomal pH in PDAC cells. This effect triggers a linked downstream cascade of events that include autophagy inhibition, endoplasmic reticulum stress, immunogenic cell death (ICD), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. ICD is characterized by calreticulin expression and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release in dying Kras-induced pancreatic cancer (KPC) cells, which is demonstrated in a vaccination experiment to prevent KPC tumor growth on the contralateral site. The improved delivery of irinotecan by the silicasome is accompanied by robust antitumor immunity, which can be synergistically enhanced by anti-PD-1 in the orthotopic model. Immunophenotyping confirms the expression of calreticulin, HMGB1, PD-L1, and an autophagy marker, in addition to perforin and granzyme B deposition. The chemo-immunotherapy response elicited by the silicasome is more robust than free or a liposomal drug, Onivyde. The silicasome plus anti-PD-1 leads to significantly enhanced survival improvement, and is far superior to anti-PD-1 plus either free irinotecan or Onivyde.},

A dielectric-elastomer aorta is used to augment the physiological role of the aorta in the human circulatory system. To this end, the authors developed a tubular dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) able to assist the heart by easing the deformation of the aorta in the systole and by increasing its recoil force in the diastole. In vitro experiments using a pulsatile flow-loop, replicating human physiological flow and pressure conditions, show a reduction of 5.5% (47 mJ per cycle) of the heart energy with this device. Here, the controlled stiffness of the DEA graft, which is usually difficult to exploit for actuators, is perfectly matching the assistance principle. At the same time, the physiological aortic pressure is exploited to offer a prestretch to the DEA which otherwise would require an additional bulky pre-stretching system to reach high performances.},

  abstract     = {2D organic–inorganic hybrid Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (RPPs) have recently attracted increasing attention due to their excellent environmental stability, high degree of electronic tunability, and natural multiquantum-well structures. Although there is a rapid development of photoelectronic applications in solar cells, photodetectors, light emitting diodes (LEDs), and lasers based on 2D RPPs, the state-of-the-art performance is far inferior to that of the existing devices because of the limited understanding on fundamental physics, especially special photophysics in carrier dynamics, excitonic fine structures, excitonic quasiparticles, and spin-related effect. Thus, there is still plenty of room to improve the performances of photoelectronic devices based on 2D RPPs by enhancing knowledge on fundamental photophysics. This review highlights the special photophysics of 2D RPPs that is fundamentally different from the conventional 3D congeners. It also provides the most recent progress, debates, challenges, prospects, and in-depth understanding of photophysics in 2D perovskites, which is significant for not only boosting performance of solar cells, LEDs, photodetectors, but also future development of applications in lasers, spintronics, quantum information, and integrated photonic chips.},

  abstract     = {Jumping spiders ( Phidippus regius ) are known for their ability to traverse various terrains and have targeted jumps within the fraction of a second to catch flying preys. Different from humans and insects, spiders use muscles to flex their legs, and hydraulic actuation for extension. By pressurizing their inner body fluid, they can achieve fast leg extensions for running and jumping. Here, the working principle of the articular membrane covering the spider leg joint pit is investigated. This membrane is highly involved in walking, grasping, and jumping motions. Hardness and stiffness of the articular membrane is studied using nanoindentation tests and preparation methods for scanning electron microscopy and histology are developed to give detailed information about the inner and outer structure of the leg joint and its membrane. Inspired by the stroller umbrella-like folding mechanism of the articular membrane, a robust thermoplastic polyurethane-based rotary semifluidic actuator is demonstrated, which shows increased durability, achieves working angles over 120°, produces high torques which allows lifts over 100 times of its own weight and jumping abilities. The developed actuator can be used for future grasping tasks, safe human–robot interactions and multilocomotion ground robot applications, and it can shed light into spider locomotion-related questions.},

  abstract     = {There exists a critical need in biomedical molecular imaging and diagnostics for molecular sensors that report on slight changes to their local microenvironment with high spatial fidelity. Herein, a modular fluorescent probe, termed StyPy, is rationally designed which features i) an enormous and tunable Stokes shift based on twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) processes with no overlap, a broad emission in the far-red/near-infrared (NIR) region of light and extraordinary quantum yields of fluorescence, ii) a modular applicability via facile para -fluoro-thiol reaction (PFTR), and iii) a polarity- and viscosity-dependent emission. This renders StyPy as a particularly promising molecular sensor. Based on the thorough characterization on the molecular level, StyPy reports on the viscosity change in all-DNA microspheres and indicates the hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments of hybrid DNA-based mesostructures consisting of latex beads embedded in DNA microspheres. Moreover, the enormous Stokes shift of StyPy enables one to detect multiple fluorophores, while using only a single laser line for excitation in DNA protocells. The authors anticipate that the presented results for multiplexing information are of direct importance for advanced imaging in complex soft matter and biological systems.},

  abstract     = {Left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis are major risk factors for heart failure, which require timely and effective treatment. Genetic therapy has been shown to ameliorate hypertrophic cardiac damage. In this study, it is found that in mice, the dopamine D5 receptor (D5R) expression in the left ventricle (LV) progressively decreases with worsening of transverse aortic constriction-induced left ventricular hypertrophy. Then, a reversible treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy with Drd5 nucleic acids delivered by tobramycin-based hyperbranched polyaminoglycoside (SS-HPT) is studied. The heart-specific increase in D5R expression by SS-HPT/ Drd5 plasmid in the early stage of left ventricular hypertrophy attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by preventing oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ameliorating autophagic dysregulation. By contrast, SS-HPT/ Drd5 siRNA promotes the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy and accelerates the deterioration of myocardial function into heart failure. The reduction in cardiac D5R expression and dysregulated autophagy are observed in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The data show a cardiac-specific beneficial effect of SS-HPT/ Drd5 plasmid on myocardial remodeling and dysfunction, which may provide an effective therapy of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.},

  abstract     = {3D printing has changed the fabrication of advanced materials as it can provide customized and on-demand 3D networks. However, 3D printing of polymer materials with the capacity to be transformed after printing remains a great challenge for engineers, material, and polymer scientists. Radical polymerization has been conventionally used in photopolymerization-based 3D printing, as in the broader context of crosslinked polymer networks. Although this reaction pathway has shown great promise, it offers limited control over chain growth, chain architecture, and thus the final properties of the polymer networks. More fundamentally, radical polymerization produces dead polymer chains incapable of postpolymerization transformations. Alternatively, the application of reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) to polymer networks allows the tuning of network homogeneity and more importantly, enables the production of advanced materials containing dormant reactivatable species that can be used for subsequent processes in a postsynthetic stage. Consequently, the opportunities that (photoactivated) RDRP-based networks offer have been leveraged through the novel concepts of structurally tailored and engineered macromolecular gels, living additive manufacturing and photoexpandable/transformable-polymer networks. Herein, the advantages of RDRP-based networks over irreversibly formed conventional networks are discussed.},

Thus motivated, the first digital CRISPR/Cas-assisted assay—coined d igitization- e nhanced C RISPR/Cas-assisted o ne-pot vi rus d etection (deCOViD)—is developed and applied toward SARS-CoV-2 detection. deCOViD is realized through tuning and discretizing a one-step, fluorescence-based, CRISPR/Cas12a-assisted reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay into sub-nanoliter reaction wells within commercially available microfluidic digital chips. The uniformly elevated digital concentrations enable deCOViD to achieve qualitative detection in &lt;15 min and quantitative detection in 30 min with high signal-to-background ratio, broad dynamic range, and high sensitivity—down to 1 genome equivalent (GE) µL −1 of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 20 GE µL −1 of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2, which outstrips its benchtop-based counterpart and represents one of the fastest and most sensitive CRISPR/Cas-assisted SARS-CoV-2 detection to date. Moreover, deCOViD can detect RNA extracts from clinical samples. Taken together, deCOViD opens a new avenue for advancing CRISPR/Cas-assisted assays and combating the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.},

Application of calorimetry to microscale biological samples, however, is hampered by insufficient sensitivity and the difficulty of handling liquid samples at this scale. Here, a micromachined calorimeter sensor that is capable of resolving picowatt levels of power is described. The sensor consists of low-noise thermopiles on a thin silicon nitride membrane that allow direct differential temperature measurements between a sample and four coplanar references, which significantly reduces thermal drift. The partial pressure of water in the ambient around the sample is maintained at saturation level using a small hydrogel-lined enclosure. The materials used in the sensor and its geometry are optimized to minimize the noise equivalent power generated by the sensor in response to the temperature field that develops around a typical sample. The experimental response of the sensor is characterized as a function of thermopile dimensions and sample volume, and its capability is demonstrated by measuring the heat dissipated during an enzymatically catalyzed biochemical reaction in a microliter-sized liquid droplet. The sensor offers particular promise for quantitative measurements on biological systems.},

  abstract     = {Due to an ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity of 3860 mAh g −1 , lithium (Li) is regarded as the ultimate anode for high-energy-density batteries. However, the practical application of Li metal anode is hindered by safety concerns and low Coulombic efficiency both of which are resulted fromunavoidable dendrite growth during electrodeposition. This study focuses on a critical parameter for electrodeposition, the exchange current density, which has attracted only little attention in research on Li metal batteries. A phase-field model is presented to show the effect of exchange current density on electrodeposition behavior of Li. The results show that a uniform distribution of cathodic current density, hence uniform electrodeposition, on electrode is obtained with lower exchange current density. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that lower exchange current density contributes to form a larger critical radius of nucleation in the initial electrocrystallization that results in a dense deposition of Li, which is a foundation for improved Coulombic efficiency and dendrite-free morphology. The findings not only pave the way to practical rechargeable Li metal batteries but can also be translated to the design of stable metal anodes, e.g., for sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and zinc (Zn) batteries.},

  abstract     = {Achieving efficient passivating carrier-selective contacts (PCSCs) plays a critical role in high-performance photovoltaic devices. However, it is still challenging to achieve both an efficient carrier selectivity and high-level passivation in a sole interlayer due to the thickness dependence of contact resistivity and passivation quality. Herein, a light-promoted adsorption method is demonstrated to establish high-density Lewis base polyethylenimine (PEI) monolayers as promising PCSCs. The promoted adsorption is attributed to the enhanced electrostatic interaction between PEI and semiconductor induced by the photo-generated carriers. The derived angstrom-scale PEI monolayer is demonstrated to simultaneously provide a low-resistance electrical contact for electrons, a high-level field-effect passivation to semiconductor surface and an enhanced interfacial dipole formation at contact interface. By implementing this light-promoted adsorbed PEI as a single-layered PCSC for n- type silicon solar cell, an efficiency of 19.5% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.641 V and a high fill factor of 80.7% is achieved, which is one of the best results for devices with solution-processed electron-selective contacts. This work not only demonstrates a generic method to develop efficient PCSCs for solar cells but also provides a convenient strategy for the deposition of highly uniform, dense, and ultra-thin coatings for diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {In the last two decades, metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted overwhelming attention. With readily tunable structures and functionalities, MOFs offer an unprecedentedly vast degree of design flexibility from enormous number of inorganic and organic building blocks or via postsynthetic modification to produce functional nanoporous materials. A large extent of experimental and computational studies of MOFs have been focused on gas phase applications, particularly the storage of low-carbon footprint energy carriers and the separation of CO 2 -containing gas mixtures. With progressive success in the synthesis of water- and solvent-resistant MOFs over the past several years, the increasingly active exploration of MOFs has been witnessed for widespread liquid phase applications such as liquid fuel purification, aromatics separation, water treatment, solvent recovery, chemical sensing, chiral separation, drug delivery, biomolecule encapsulation and separation. At this juncture, the recent experimental and computational studies are summarized herein for these multifaceted liquid phase applications to demonstrate the rapid advance in this burgeoning field. The challenges and opportunities moving from laboratory scale towards practical applications are discussed.},

How nucleic acid chirality naturally comes into play in a diverse array of situations is considered first, at length scales ranging from an individual nucleotide to entire chromosomes. Thereafter, chiral liquid crystal phases formed by dense DNA mixtures are discussed, including the ongoing efforts to understand their origins. The report then summarizes recent efforts directed toward building chiral structures, and other structures of complex topology, using the principle of DNA self-assembly. Discussed last are existing and proposed functional man-made nanostructures designed to either probe or harness DNA&#39;s chirality, from plasmonics and spintronics to biosensing.},

In the current work, a copolymer of phenylene and thiophene is designed, where the phenylene ring lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the polymer of visible-light-harvesting thiophene entities and works as a robust catalytic site for the O 2 reduction to H 2 O 2 production. The very high onset potential of the copolymer for O 2 reduction (+1.53 V vs RHE, pH 12) allows a H 2 O 2 production setup with a traditional water-oxidation catalyst, manganese oxide (MnO x ), as the anode. MnO x is deposited on one face of a conducting plate, and visible-light illumination of the copolymer layer formed on the other face aids steady O 2 reduction to H 2 O 2 with no bias assistance and a complete photocatalytic conversion rate of 14 000 mg (H 2 O 2 ) g photocat −1 h −1 or ≈0.2 mg (H 2 O 2 ) cm −2 h −1 .},

  abstract     = {Resistance to sorafenib severely hinders its effectiveness against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer stemness is closely connected with resistance to sorafenib. Methods for reversing the cancer stemness remains one of the largest concerns in research and the lack of such methods obstructs current HCC therapeutics. Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) is reported to play a pivotal role in HCC stemness and multidrug resistance (MDR). Herein, a galactose-decorated lipopolyplex (Gal-SLP) is developed as an HCC-targeting self-activated cascade-responsive nanoplatform to co-delivery sorafenib and USP22 shRNA (shUSP22) for synergetic HCC therapy. Sorafenib, entrapped in the Gal-SLPs, induced a reactive oxygen species (ROS) cascade and triggered rapid shUSP22 release. Thus, Gal-SLPs dramatically suppressed the expression of USP22. The downregulation of USP22 suppresses multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) to induce intracellular sorafenib accumulation and hampers glycolysis of HCC cells. As a result, Gal-SLPs efficiently inhibit the viability, proliferation, and colony formation of HCC cells. A sorafenib-insensitive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model is established and adopted to evaluate in vivo antitumor effect of Gal-SLPs. Gal-SLPs exhibit potent antitumor efficiency and biosafety. Therefore, Gal-SLPs are expected to have great potential in the clinical treatment of HCC.},

Traditional therapy is more or less faced with certain defects, such as poor targeting, easy degradation, high side effects, etc. Therefore, in order to improve the treatment efficiency of drugs, an intelligent drug delivery system (DDS) is considered as a promising solution strategy. Due to their special structure and large specific surface area, 2D materials are considered to be a good platform for drug delivery. Black phosphorus (BP), as a new star of the 2D family, is recommended to have the potential to construct DDS by virtue of its outstanding photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and biodegradable properties. This tutorial review is intended to provide an introduction of the current advances in BP-based DDSs for cancer therapy, which covers topics from its construction, classified by the types of platforms, to the stimuli-responsive controlled drug release. Moreover, their cancer therapy applications including mono-, bi-, and multi-modal synergistic cancer therapy as well as the research of biocompatibility are also discussed. Finally, the current status and future prospects of BP-based DDSs for cancer therapy are summarized.},

Individual functional peptide sequences that specifically bind to two overexpressed EBV-specific oncoproteins, EBNA1 (a latent cellular protein) and LMP1 (a transmembrane protein), are engineered in three different ways and incorporated with a pH-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME)-cleavable linker onto the upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) NaGdF 4 :Yb 3+ , Er 3+ @NaGdF 4 (UCNP-P n , n = 5, 6, and 7). A synergistic combination of the transmembrane LMP1 targeting ability and the pH responsiveness of UCNP-P n is found to give specific cancer differentiation with higher cellular uptake and accumulation in EBV-infected cells, thus a lower dose is needed and the side effects and health risks from treatment would be greatly reduced. It also gives responsive UC signal enhancement upon targeted dual-protein binding and shows efficacious EBV cancer inhibition in vitro and in vivo. This is the first example of simultaneous imaging and inhibition of two EBV latent proteins, and serves as a blueprint for next-generation peptide-guided precision delivery nanosystem for the safe monitoring and treatment against one specific cancer.},

Impressively, RDX-based propellants with the addition of PDA-Pb catalyst exhibit substantially enhanced burning rates (14.98 mm s −1 at 2 MPa), which is 4.8 times faster than that without PDA-Pb and represents the best catalytic performance among Pb-based catalysts. Moreover, it also possesses low-pressure exponents in broad pressure ranges, which can enable more stable and safer combustion in solid rocket engines. Theoretical calculation unravels the efficient catalytic activity is stemmed from the enhanced interfacial electronic coupling between RDX and PDA-Pb via orbital level engineering. More importantly, PDA-Pb also presents similar catalytic behavior toward the decomposition of nitrocellulose, suggesting its broad catalytic generality.

  abstract     = {Surgical resection is commonly used for therapeutic management of different solid tumors and is regarded as a primary standard of care procedure, but precise localization of tumor margins is a major intraoperative challenge. Herein, a generalized method by optimizing gold nanoparticles for intraoperative detection and photothermal ablation of tumor margins is introduced. These nanoparticles are detectable by highly sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering imaging. This non-invasive technique assists in delineating the two surgically challenged tumors in live mice with orthotopic colon or ovarian tumors. Any remaining residual tumors are also ablated by using post-surgical adjuvant photothermaltherapy (aPTT), which results in microscale heat generation due to interaction of these nanoparticles with near-infrared laser. Ablation of these post-operative residual micro-tumors prolongs the survival of mice significantly and delays tumor recurrence by 15 days. To validate clinical translatability of this method, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, Raman contrast, aPTT efficiency, and toxicity of these nanoparticles are also investigated. The nanoparticles have long blood circulation time (≈24 h), high tumor accumulation (4.87 ± 1.73%ID g −1 ) and no toxicity. This high-resolution and sensitive intraoperative approach is versatile and can be potentially used for targeted ablation of residual tumor after resection within different organs.},

  abstract     = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis progression and high incidence of cardiovascular events, hinting that atherosclerotic plaques in CKD may be vulnerable. However, its cause and mechanism remain obscure. Here, it is shown that apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE −/− ) mouse with CKD (CKD/ApoE −/− mouse) is a useful model for investigating the pathogenesis of plaque vulnerability, and premature senescence and phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes to CKD-associated plaque vulnerability. Subsequently, VSMC phenotypes in patients with CKD and CKD/ApoE −/− mice are comprehensively investigated. Using multi-omics analysis and targeted and VSMC-specific gene knockout mice, VSMCs are identified as both type-I-interferon (IFN-I)-responsive and IFN-I-productive cells. Mechanistically, mitochondrial damage resulting from CKD-induced oxidative stress primes the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway to trigger IFN-I response in VSMCs. Enhanced IFN-I response then induces VSMC premature senescence and phenotypic switching in an autocrine/paracrine manner, resulting in the loss of fibrous cap VSMCs and fibrous cap thinning. Conversely, blocking IFN-I response remarkably attenuates CKD-associated plaque vulnerability. These findings reveal that IFN-I response in VSMCs through immune sensing of mitochondrial damage is essential for the pathogenesis of CKD-associated plaque vulnerability. Mitigating IFN-I response may hold promise for the treatment of CKD-associated cardiovascular diseases.},

In particular, the self-assembly approach facilitates the P3HT-COOH molecules to form an ordered and homogeneous monolayer on top of the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode facilitate the perovskite crystalline film growth with high quality and preferred orientations. After detailed spectroscopy and device characterizations, it is found that the carboxylic acid anchoring groups can down-shift the work function and passivate the ITO surface, retarding the interface carrier recombination. As a result, the device made with the self-assembled HTM show high open-circuit voltage over 1.10 V and extend the lifetime over 4,300 h when storing at 30% relative humidity. Moreover, the cell works efficiently under much reduced light power, making it useful as power source under dim-light conditions.

  abstract     = {High-performance microwave absorbers with special features are desired to meet the requirements of more complex modern service environments, especially corrosive environments. Therefore, high-efficiency microwave absorbers with corrosion resistance should be developed urgently. Herein, a 3D NiAl-layered double hydroxide/graphene (NiAl-LDH/G) composite synthesized by atomic-layer-deposition-assisted in situ growth is presented as an anticorrosive microwave absorber. The content of NiAl-LDH in the composite is optimized to achieve impedance matching. Furthermore, under the cooperative effects of the interface polarization loss, conduction loss, and 3D porous sandwich-like structure, the optimal NiAl-LDH/G shows excellent microwave absorption performance with a minimum reflection loss of −41.5 dB and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth of 4.4 GHz at a loading of only 7 wt% in epoxy. Remarkably, the encapsulation effect of NiAl-LDH can restrain the galvanic corrosion owing to graphene. The epoxy coating with the NiAl-LDH/G microwave absorber on carbon steel exhibits long-term corrosion resistance, owing to the synergetic effect of the superior impermeability of graphene and the chloridion-capture capacity of the NiAl-LDH. The NiAl-LDH/G composite is a promising anticorrosive microwave absorber, and the findings of this study may motivate the development of functional microwave absorbers that meet the demands of anticorrosive performance of coatings.},

  abstract     = {The point-of-care detection of tumor markers in saliva with high sensitivity and specificity remains a daunting challenge in biomedical research and clinical applications. Herein, a facile and ultrasensitive detection of tumor marker in saliva based on luminescence-amplification strategy of lanthanide nanoprobes is proposed. Eu 2 O 3 nanocrystals are employed as bioprobes, which can be easily dissolved in acidic enhancer solution and transform into a large number of highly luminescent Eu 3+ micelles. Meanwhile, disposable syringe filter equipped with nitrocellulose membrane is used as bioassay platform, which facilitates the accomplishment of detection process within 10 min. The rational integration of dissolution enhanced luminescent bioassay strategy and miniaturized detection device enables the unique lab-in-syringe assay of tumor marker like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, an important tumor marker in clinic diagnosis and prognosis of cancer) with a detection limit down to 1.47 pg mL −1 (7.35 × 10 −15 m ). Upon illumination with a portable UV flashlight, the photoluminescence intensity change above 0.1 ng mL −1 (0.5 × 10 −12 m ) of CEA can be visually detected by naked eyes, which allows one to qualitatively evaluate the CEA level. Moreover, we confirm the reliability of using the amplified luminescence of Eu 2 O 3 nanoprobes for direct quantitation of CEA in patient saliva samples, thus validates the practicality of the proposed strategy for both clinical diagnosis and home self-monitoring of tumor marker in human saliva.},

  abstract     = {Nanoparticles (NPs) can serve as a promising vaccine delivery platform for improving pharmacological property and codelivery of antigens and adjuvants. However, NP-based vaccines are generally associated with complex synthesis and postmodification procedures, which pose technical and manufacturing challenges for tailor-made vaccine production. Here, modularly programmed, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-based NP vaccines are reported for simple production of personalized cancer vaccines. Briefly, PEI is conjugated with neoantigens by facile coupling chemistry, followed by electrostatic assembly with CpG adjuvants, leading to the self-assembly of nontoxic, sub-50 nm PEI NPs. Importantly, PEI NPs promote activation and antigen cross-presentation of antigen-presenting cells and cross-priming of neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Surprisingly, after only a single intratumoral injection, PEI NPs with optimal PEGylation elicit as high as ≈30% neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cell response in the systemic circulation and sustain elevated CD8 + T cell response over 3 weeks. PEI-based nanovaccines exert potent antitumor efficacy against pre-established local tumors as well as highly aggressive metastatic tumors. PEI engineering for modular incorporation of neoantigens and adjuvants offers a promising strategy for rapid and facile production of personalized cancer vaccines.},

  abstract     = {The physical microenvironment is a critical mediator of tumor behavior. However, detailed biological and mechanistic insight is lacking. The present study reveals the role of chemotherapy-enriched CD133+ liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) with THBS2 deficiency. This subpopulation of cells contributes to a more aggressive cancer and functional stemness phenotype in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) through the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, collagen degradation, and matrix stiffness. The local soft spots created by these liver CSCs can enhance stemness and drug resistance and provide a route of escape to facilitate HCC metastasis. Interestingly, a positive feed-forward loop is identified where a local soft spot microenvironment in the HCC tumor is enriched with CD133 expressing cells that secrete markedly less ECM-modifying THBS2 upon histone H3 modification at its promoter region, allowing the maintenance of a localized soft spot matrix. Clinically, THBS2 deficiency is also correlated with low HCC survival, where high levels of CSCs with low THBS2 expression in HCC are associated with decreased collagen fiber deposits and an invasive tumor front. The findings have implications for the treatment of cancer stemness and for the prevention of tumor outgrowth through disseminated tumor cells.},

  abstract     = {Atomically dispersed transition metal-N x sites have emerged as a frontier for electrocatalysis because of the maximized atom utilization. However, there is still the problem that the reactant is difficult to reach active sites inside the catalytic layer in the practical proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) testing, resulting in the ineffective utilization of the deeply hided active sites. In the device manner, the favorite structure of electrocatalysts for good mass transfer is vital for PEMFC. Herein, a facile one-step approach to synthesize atomically dispersed Fe-N x species on hierarchically porous carbon nanostructures as a high-efficient and stable atomically dispersed catalyst for oxygen reduction in acidic media is reported, which is achieved by a predesigned hierarchical covalent organic polymer (COP) with iron anchored. COP materials with well-defined building blocks can stabilize the dopants and provide efficient mass transport. The appropriate hierarchical pore structure is proved to facilitate the mass transport of reactants to the active sites, ensuring the utilization of active sites in devices. Particularly, the structurally optimized HSAC/Fe-3 displays a maximum power density of up to 824 mW cm −2 , higher than other samples with fewer mesopores. Accordingly, this work will offer inspirations for designing efficient atomically dispersed electrocatalyst in PEMFC device.},

  abstract     = {TGF- β -activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a serine/threonine kinase, is a key intermediate in several signaling pathways. However, its role in tumorigenesis is still not understood well. In this study, it is found that TAK1 expression decreases in esophageal tumor tissues and cell lines. In vitro experiments demonstrate that proliferation of esophageal tumor cells is enhanced by knockdown of TAK1 expression and attenuated by elevated expression of TAK1. Using a subcutaneous tumor model, these observations are confirmed in vivo. Based on the results from co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, Ras association domain family 9 (RASSF9) is identified as a downstream target of TAK1. TAK1 phosphorylates RASSF9 at S284, which leads to reduced RAS dimerization, thereby blocking RAF/MEK/ERK signal transduction. Clinical survey reveals that TAK1 expression is inversely correlated with survival in esophageal cancer patients. Taken together, the data reveal that TAK1-mediated phosphorylation of RASSF9 at Ser284 negatively regulates esophageal tumor cell proliferation via inhibition of the RAS/MEK/ERK axis.},

  abstract     = {So far, most techniques for modifying perovskite solar cells (PSCs) focus on either the perovskite or electron transport layer (ETL). For the sake of comprehensively improving device performance, a dual-functional method of simultaneously passivating trap defects in both the perovskite and ETL films is proposed that utilizes guidable transfer of Eu 3+ in SnO 2 to perovskite. Europium ions are distributed throughout the SnO 2 film during the formation process of SnO 2 , and they can diffuse directionally through the SnO 2 /perovskite interface into the perovskite, while most of the europium ions remain at the interface. Under the synergistic effect of distributed Eu 3+ in the SnO 2 and aggregated Eu 3+ at the interface, the electron mobilities of ETLs are evidently improved. Meanwhile, diffused Eu 3+ ions passivate the perovskite to reduce trap densities at the grain boundaries, which can dramatically elevate the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of PSCs. Finally, the mainly PSCs coated on SnO 2 :Eu 3+ ETL achieve a power conversion efficiency of 20.14%. Moreover, an unsealed device degrades by only 13% after exposure to ambient atmosphere for 84 days.},

Current neural patterning systems have so far focused on directing cell fate specification spatio-temporally but not morphogenetic processes. Here, the formation of a structurally reproducible and highly-organized neuroepithelium (NE) tissue is directed from hPSCs, which recapitulates morphogenetic cellular processes relevant to early neurulation. These include having a continuous, polarized epithelium and a distinct invagination-like folding, where primitive ectodermal cells undergo E-to-N-cadherin switching and apical constriction as they acquire a NE fate. This is accomplished by spatio-temporal patterning of the mesoendoderm, which guides the development and self-organization of the adjacent primitive ectoderm into the NE. It is uncovered that TGF β signaling emanating from endodermal cells support tissue folding of the prospective NE. Evaluation of NE tissue structural dysmorphia, which is uniquely achievable in the model, enables the detection of apical constriction and cell adhesion dysfunctions in patient-derived hPSCs as well as differentiating between different classes of neural tube defect-inducing drugs.},

  abstract     = {Tremendous progress in the development of single molecule magnets (SMMs) raises the question of their device integration. On this route, understanding the properties of low-dimensional assemblies of SMMs, in particular in contact with electrodes, is a necessary but difficult step. Here, it is shown that fullerene SMM self-assembled on metal substrate from solution retains magnetic hysteresis up to 10 K. Fullerene-SMM DySc 2 N@C 80 and Dy 2 ScN@C 80 are derivatized to introduce a thioacetate group, which is used to graft SMMs on gold. Magnetic properties of grafted SMMs are studied by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and compared to the films of nonderivatized fullerenes prepared by sublimation. In self-assembled films, the magnetic moments of the Dy ions are preferentially aligned parallel to the surface, which is different from the disordered orientation of endohedral clusters in nonfunctionalized fullerenes. Whereas chemical derivatization reduces the blocking temperature of magnetization and narrows the hysteresis of Dy 2 ScN@C 80 , for DySc 2 N@C 80 equally broad hysteresis is observed as in the fullerene multilayer. Magnetic bistability in the DySc 2 N@C 80 grafted on gold is sustained up to 10 K. This study demonstrates that self-assembly of fullerene-SMM derivatives offers a facile solution-based procedure for the preparation of functional magnetic sub-monolayers with excellent SMM performance.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the effects that sterilization methods have on the surface of a biomaterial is a prerequisite for clinical deployment. Sterilization causes alterations in a material&#39;s surface chemistry and surface structures that can result in significant changes to its cellular response. Here we compare surfaces resulting from the application of the industry standard autoclave sterilisation to that of surfaces resulting from the use of low-pressure Argon glow discharge within a novel gas permeable packaging method in order to explore a potential new biomaterial sterilisation method. Material surfaces are assessed by applying secondary electron hyperspectral imaging (SEHI). SEHI is a novel low-voltage scanning electron microscopy based characterization technique that, in addition to capturing topographical images, also provides nanoscale resolution chemical maps by utilizing the energy distribution of emitted secondary electrons. Here, SEHI maps are exploited to assess the lateral distributions of diverse functional groups that are effected by the sterilization treatments. This information combined with a range of conventional surface analysis techniques and a cellular metabolic activity assay reveals persuasive reasons as to why low-pressure argon glow discharge should be considered for further optimization as a potential terminal sterilization method for PGS-M, a functionalized form of poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS).},

  abstract     = {The position of a chlorine atom in a charge carrier of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is important to boost their photovoltaic performance. Herein, two chlorinated D-A conjugated polymers PBBD-Cl-α and PBBD-Cl-β are synthesized based on two new building blocks (TTO-Cl-α and TTO-Cl-β) respectively by introducing the chlorine atom into α or β position of the upper thiophene of the highly electron-deficient benzo[1,2-b:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione moiety. Single-crystal analysis demonstrates that the chlorine-free TTO shows a π-π stacking distance ( d π-π ) of 3.55 Å. When H atom at the α position of thiophene of TTO is replaced by Cl, both π-π stacking distance ( d π-π = 3.48 Å) and Cl···S distance ( d Cl-S = 4.4 Å) are simultaneously reduced for TTO-Cl-α compared with TTO. TTO-Cl-β then showed the Cl···S non-covalent interaction can further shorten the intermolecular π-π stacking separation to 3.23 Å, much smaller than that of TTO-Cl-α and TTO. After blending with BTP-eC9, PBBD-Cl-β:BTP-eC9-based PSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.20%, much higher than PBBD:BTP-eC9 (10.06%) and PBBD-Cl-α:BTP-eC9 (13.35%) based devices. These results provide an effective strategy for design and synthesis of highly efficient donor polymers by precise positioning of the chlorine substitution.},

  abstract     = {Compared to organic emitters, perovskite materials generally have a small Stokes shift and correspondingly large re-absorption of dipole emission. Classical optical modelling methods ignoring re-absorption do not provide an adequate description of the observed light emission properties. Here, optical modelling methods and design rules for perovskite light-emitting diodes are presented. The transfer-matrix formalism is used to quantify the Poynting vectors generated by a dipole radiating inside a perovskite optoelectronic device. A strategy is presented to deal with non-radiative coupling to nearby emissive material that can otherwise lead to non-physical divergence in the calculation. Stability issues are also investigated regarding coherence of the light propagating in the substrate and the absence of a light absorber in the system. The benefit of the photon recycling effect is taken into account by recursive calculation of the dipole generation profile. The simulation results predict that a high external quantum efficiency of ≈40% is achievable in formamidinium lead triiodide-based perovskite light-emitting diodes, by optimization of microcavity, dipole orientation, and photon recycling effects. Contrary to conventional device structures currently reported, this work highlights the benefits of thick charge transport layers and thick perovskite with small Stokes shift.},

  abstract     = {In celiac disease (CeD), gluten activates adaptive immune cells that cause damage to the small intestinal mucosa. Histological evaluation of intestinal biopsies allows for grading of disease severity. CeD can effectively be treated with a life-long gluten-free diet. Gluten challenge of treated CeD patients is used to confirm diagnosis and to test drug efficacy in clinical trials, but patients respond with different magnitudes to the same gluten challenge. In this study of 19 well-treated CeD patients, proteome analysis of total tissue or isolated epithelial cell compartment from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded biopsies collected before and after 14-day gluten challenge demonstrates that patients with strong mucosal response to challenge have signs of ongoing tissue inflammation already before challenge. This low-level tissue inflammation at baseline is paralleled by increased gluten specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies in the gut and presence of a low-level blood inflammatory profile. Thus, apparently well-treated CeD is frequently not entirely quiescent, with presence of low-grade inflammation and antigluten immunity in the gut mucosa. Histology assessment alone appears insufficient to judge full recovery and gut mucosal healing of CeD patients. The findings raise a concern whether a seemingly proper gluten-free diet is able to curb gut inflammation in all CeD patients.},

Here, single-pulsed, maskless light interference and imprinting technique is utilized to fabricate reconfigurable, flexible metalenses on a large-scale and demonstrate its strain-multiplex tunable focusing. Experiments, in accordance with the theory, show that applied stretch on the flexible-template reconfigurable diffractive metalenses (FDMLs) accurately mapped focused wavefront, bandwidth, and focal length. The surface relief metastructures consisted of metal-coated hemispherical cavities in a hexagonal close-packed arrangement to enhance tunable focal length, numerical aperture, and fill factor, FF ≈ 100% through normal and angular light illumination with external stretch.

However, high dose-dependent induced toxicity to tissues, non-selectivity, and radioresistance greatly limit the application of RT. Herein, an oxygen-enriched X-ray nanoprocessor Hb@Hf-Ce6 nanoparticle is developed for improving the therapeutic effect of RT-radiodynamic therapy (RDT), enhancing modulation of hypoxia tumor microenvironment (TME) and promoting antitumor immune response in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade. All functional molecules are integrated into the nanoparticle based on metal-phenolic coordination, wherein one high-Z radiosensitizer (hafnium, Hf) coordinated with chlorin e6 (Ce6) modified polyphenols and a promising oxygen carrier (hemoglobin, Hb) is encapsulated for modulation of oxygen balance in the hypoxia TME. Specifically, under single X-ray irradiation, radioluminescence excited by Hf can activate photosensitizer Ce6 for ROS generation by RDT. Therefore, this combinatory strategy induces comprehensive antitumor immune response for cancer eradication and metastasis inhibition. This work presents a multifunctional metal-phenolic nanoplatform for efficient X-ray mediated RT-RDT in combination with immunotherapy and may provide a new therapeutic option for cancer treatment.},

Hence, exploiting lead-free halide perovskite materials with superior properties is urgent and necessary. In this review, the deep-seated reasons that benefit light emission for halide perovskites, which help to develop lead-free halide perovskites with excellent performance, are first emphasized. Recent advances in lead-free halide perovskite materials (single crystals, thin films, and nanocrystals with different dimensionalities) from synthesis, crystal structures, optical and optoelectronic properties to applications are then systematically summarized. In particular, phosphor-converted LEDs and electroluminescent LEDs using lead-free halide perovskites are fully examined. Ultimately, based on current development of lead-free halide perovskites, the future directions of lead-free halide perovskites in terms of materials and light-emitting devices are discussed.},

Limited biomarkers for evaluation exist and as a result histology represents an empiric tool to guide therapeutic decision making. In this study, molecular signatures associated with response and long-term survival of lung cancer patients receiving first-line chemotherapy are discovered. Whole-exome sequencing is performed on pretherapeutic tissue samples of 186 patients [145 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 41 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)]. On the basis of genomic alteration characteristics, NSCLC patients can be classified into four subtypes (C1–C4). The long-term survival is similar among different subtypes. SCLC patients are also divided into four subtypes and significant difference in their progression free survival is revealed ( P &lt; 0.001). NSCLC patients can be divided into three subtypes (S1–S3) based on TMB. A trend of worse survival associated with higher TMB in subtype S3 than in S1+S2 is found. In contrast, no significant correlations between molecular subtype and therapeutic response are observed. In conclusion, this study identifies several molecular signatures associated with response and survival to first-line chemotherapy in lung cancer.},

Surprisingly, the formation of metal is not detected when manganese triazolate is pyrolyzed in an oxygen-free environment. Instead, a direct transformation into nanoparticles of manganese nitride, Mn 2 N x embedded in N-doped graphitic carbon took place. The electrically conductive Mn 2 N x nanoparticles show much better air stability than bulk samples and exhibit promising electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction.

Clusterin (CLU) is implicated to play important oncogenic roles in cancer via promoting various downstream oncogenic pathways. Here, protein kinase D3 (PRKD3) is defined to be a key regulator of CLU in promoting TNBC tumor growth. Mechanically, PRKD3 with kinase activity binding to CLU is critical for CLU protein stability via inhibiting CLU&#39;s lysosomal distribution and degradation. CLU and PRKD3 protein level are significantly elevated and positively correlated in collected TNBC tumor samples. CLU silencer (OGX-011) and PRKDs inhibitor (CRT0066101) can both result in impressive tumor growth suppression in vitro and in vivo, suggesting targeting CLU and its key regulator-PRKD3 are promisingly efficient against TNBC. Finally, secreted CLU (sCLU) is found to be elevated in serums from TNBC patients and reduced in serum from TNBC murine models post OGX-011 and/or CRT0066101 treatment, suggesting serum sCLU is a promising blood-based biomarker for clinical management of TNBC. Taken together, this study provides a thorough molecular basis as well as preclinical evidences for targeting CLU pathway as a new promising strategy against TNBC via revealing PRKD3 as the key regulator of CLU in TNBC.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondria are highly involved in the metastasis of cancer cells. However, low permeability of mitochondria impedes the entry of anti-cancer drugs. Here, a self-assembled nanoparticle platform is designed that not only targets the DNA-intercalating agent doxorubicin to mitochondria but also enhances the specific penetration by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs). With drastic improvement in mitochondrial uptake, the drug delivery system results in substantial mitochondrial impairment leading to amplified induction of apoptosis, depletion of energy supply, and inhibition of numerous metastasis-associated proteins. As a consequence, the drug delivery system significantly inhibits the orthotopic tumor growth, and suppressed the metastasis of cancer cells detached from primary tumors. Additionally, the nanoparticle exhibits a potent effect on eradicating the metastasis of disseminated tumor cell from blood to lung. The results show that strategies of targeting mitochondria and unlocking MPTP are feasible and beneficial to mitigate both tumorigenesis and metastasis.},

When the dimension of CEMs decreases, exposing extremely high specific surface area and enhancing electronic correlation, the surface states are equally important to the bulk phase. Therefore, surface/interface chemical interactions provide an alternative route to regulate the intrinsic properties of low-dimensional CEMs. Here, recent achievements in surface/interface chemistry engineering of low-dimensional CEMs are reviewed, using surface modification, molecule−solid interaction, and interface electronic coupling, toward modulation of conducting solids, phase transitions including MIT, CDW, superconductivity, and magnetism transition, as well as external-field response. Surface/interface chemistry engineering provides a promising strategy for exploring novel properties and functional applications in low-dimensional CEMs. Finally, the current challenge and outlook of the surface/interface engineering are also pointed out for future research development.},

  abstract     = {The low immunogenicity, insufficient infiltration of T lymphocytes, and dismal response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy pose major difficulties in immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer. Photoimmunotherapy by photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce an antitumor immune response by triggering immunogenic cell death in the tumor cells. Notwithstanding, PDT-driven oxygen consumption and microvascular damage can further aggravate hypoxia to exaggerates glycolysis, leading to lactate accumulation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a supramolecular prodrug nanoplatform codelivering a photosensitizer and a prodrug of bromodomain-containing protein 4 inhibitor (BRD4i) JQ1 for combinatory photoimmunotherapy of pancreatic cancer are demonstrated. The nanoparticles are fabricated by host–guest complexation between cyclodextrin-grafted hyaluronic acid (HA-CD) and adamantine-conjugated heterodimers of pyropheophorbide a (PPa) and JQ1, respectively. HA can achieve active tumor targeting by recognizing highly expressed CD44 on the surface of pancreatic tumors. PPa-mediated PDT can enhance the immunogenicity of the tumor cells and promote intratumoral infiltration of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Meanwhile, JQ1 combats PDT-mediated immune evasion through inhibiting expression of c-Myc and PD-L1, which are key regulators of tumor glycolysis and immune evasion. Collectively, this study presents a novel strategy to enhance photoimmunotherapy of the pancreatic cancer by provoking T cells activation and overcoming adaptive immune resistance.},

Here, the stereotype of the subsidiary role of MnO 2 nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy is challenged. This study unravels an intrinsic immunomodulatory property of MnO 2 nanoparticles as a unique nutrient-responsive immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer, capable of directly modulating immunosurveillance toward tumor cells. MnO 2 nanoflowers (MNFs) constructed via a one pot self-assembly approach selectively induce ICD to nutrient-deprived but not nutrient-replete cancer cells, which is confirmed by the upregulated damage associated molecular patterns in vitro and a prophylactic vaccination in vivo. The underlying mechanism of the MNFs-mediated selective ICD induction is likely associated with the concurrently upregulated oxidative stress and autophagy. Built on their unique immunomodulatory properties, an innovative nanomaterials orchestrated cancer starvation-immunotherapy is successfully developed, which is realized by the in situ vaccination with MNFs and vascular disrupting agents that cut off intratumoral nutrient supply, eliciting potent efficacy for suppressing local and distant tumors. These findings open up a new avenue toward biomedical applications of MnO 2 materials, enabling an innovative therapeutics paradigm with great clinical significance.},

A novel in situ generated Mn-deficient ZnMn 2 O 4 @C (Mn-d-ZMO@C) nanoarchitecture cathode material from self-assembly of ZnO-MnO@C for rechargeable AZIBs is reported. Analytical techniques confirm the porous and crystalline structure of ZnO-MnO@C and the in situ growth of Mn deficient ZnMn 2 O 4 @C. The Zn/Mn-d-ZMO@C cell displays a promising capacity of 194 mAh g −1 at a current density of 100 mA g −1 with 84% of capacity retained after 2000 cycles (at 3000 mA g −1 rate). The improved performance of this cathode originates from in situ orientation, porosity, and carbon coating. Additionally, first-principles calculations confirm the high electronic conductivity of Mn-d-ZMO@C cathode. Importantly, a good capacity retention (86%) is obtained with a year-old cell (after 150 cycles) at 100 mA g −1 current density. This study, therefore, indicates that the in situ grown Mn-d-ZMO@C nanoarchitecture cathode is a promising material to prepare a durable AZIB.},

A hybridized local and an intramolecular charge-transfer excited state is demonstrated to afford high photoluminescence efficiency of these D–A molecules in solution (≈100%). The twisted molecular structure and bulky alkyl chains effectively suppress π – π and dipole–dipole interactions, enabling high luminescence efficiency of 1 and 2 in the solid state (≈94% and 100%). Furthermore, two D–A aggregates exhibit high photostability as evidenced by 4% and 8% of the fluorescence decreasing after 6 h of continuous irradiation in air, which is in sharp contrast to ≈95% of fluorescence decreasing in a reference compound.

  abstract     = {Cellular senescence can either support or inhibit cancer progression. Here, it is shown that intratumoral infiltration of CD8 + T cells is negatively associated with the proportion of senescent tumor cells in colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene expression analysis reveals increased expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in senescent tumor cells. Senescent tumor cells inhibit CD8 + T cell infiltration by secreting a high concentration of CXCL12, which induces a loss of CXCR4 in T cells that result in impaired directional migration. CSF1 from senescent tumor cells enhance monocyte differentiation into M2 macrophages, which inhibit CD8 + T cell activation. Neutralization of CXCL12/CSF1 increases the effect of anti-PD1 antibody in allograft tumors. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCL12 from senescent tumor cells enhances T cell infiltration and results in reducing the number and size of tumors in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC. These findings suggest senescent tumor cells generate a cytokine barrier protecting nonsenescent tumor cells from immune attack and provide a new target for overcoming the immunotherapy resistance of CRC.},

However, whether interactions between endothelial cells and platelets induce endothelial permeability in HCC after insufficient RFA remains unclear. Here, significantly increased CD62P-positive platelets and sP-selectin in plasma are observed in HCC patients after RFA, and tumor-associated endothelial cells (TAECs) activate platelets and are susceptible to permeability after heat treatment in the presence of platelets in vitro. In addition, tumors exhibit enhanced vascular permeability after insufficient RFA in mice; heat treatment promotes platelets-induced endothelial permeability through vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and ICAM-1 upregulation in TAECs after heat treatment results in platelet activation and increased endothelial permeability in vitro. Moreover, the binding interaction between upregulated ICAM-1 and Ezrin downregulates VE-cadherin expression. Furthermore, platelet depletion or ICAM-1 inhibition suppresses tumor growth and metastasis after insufficient RFA in an orthotopic tumor mouse model, and vascular permeability decreases in ICAM-1 −/− mouse tumor after insufficient RFA. The findings suggest that ICAM-1 activates platelets and promotes endothelial permeability in TAECs through VE-cadherin after insufficient RFA, and anti-platelet and anti-ICAM-1 therapy can be used to prevent progression of HCC after insufficient RFA.},

Additonally, their nanometer size provides more opportunity for post-functionalization and hybridization. In this review, recent progress on the preparation of NMOFs is summarized, primarily through bottom-up strategies including reaction parameter- and coordination-assisted synthesis, and top-down strategies such as liquid exfoliation and salt-template confinement.

However, the mechanisms underlying HCC bone-metastasis remain largely unknown. In the current study, HCC-secreted lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 (LGALS3) is found to be significantly upregulated and correlates with shorter bone-metastasis-free survival of HCC patients. Overexpression of LGALS3 enhances the metastatic capability of HCC cells to bone and induces skeletal-related events by forming a bone pre-metastatic niche via promoting osteoclast fusion and podosome formation. Mechanically, ubiquitin ligaseRNF219-meidated α -catenin degradation prompts YAP1/ β -catenin complex-dependent epigenetic modifications of LGALS3 promoter, resulting in LGALS3 upregulation and metastatic bone diseases. Importantly, treatment with verteporfin, a clinical drug for macular degeneration, decreases LGALS3 expression and effectively inhibits skeletal complications of HCC. These findings unveil a plausible role for HCC-secreted LGALS3 in pre-metastatic niche and can suggest a promising strategy for clinical intervention in HCC bone-metastasis.},

However, translating the theranostic potential of AuNPs into clinical applications still remains a challenge due to the difficulty to improve the efficiency and specificity of tumor delivery in vivo as well as the clearance from liver and spleen to avoid off target toxicity. In this study, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) are exploited as vehicles to deliver AuNPs to tumors. It is first demonstrated that ECFCs display a great capability to intake AuNPs without losing viability, and exert antitumor activity per se. Using a human melanoma xenograft mouse model, it is next demonstrated that AuNP-loaded ECFCs retain their capacity to migrate to tumor sites in vivo 1 day after injection and stay in the tumor mass for more than 1 week. In addition, it is demonstrated that ECFC-loaded AuNPs are efficiently cleared by the liver over time and do not elicit any sign of damage to healthy tissue.},

  abstract     = {Organic printed electronics has proven its potential as an essential enabler for applications related to healthcare, entertainment, energy, and distributed intelligent objects. The possibility of exploiting solution-based and direct-writing production schemes further boosts the benefits offered by such technology, facilitating the implementation of cheap, conformable, bio-compatible electronic applications. The result shown in this work challenges the widespread assumption that such class of electronic devices is relegated to low-frequency operation, owing to the limited charge mobility of the materials and to the low spatial resolution achievable with conventional printing techniques. Here, it is shown that solution-processed and direct-written organic field-effect transistors can be carefully designed and fabricated so to achieve a maximum transition frequency of 160 MHz, unlocking an operational range that was not available before for organics. Such range was believed to be only accessible with more performing classes of semiconductor materials and/or more expensive fabrication schemes. The present achievement opens a route for cost- and energy-efficient manufacturability of flexible and conformable electronics with wireless-communication capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Intraoperative diagnosis of metastatic tumors is of significant importance to the treatment of ovarian cancer. NIR-II fluorescence imaging holds great promise for facile detection of tumor in situ with high sensitivity and resolution. Herein, a kind of NIR-II fluorescent polymer dots (NIR-II Pdots) with high brightness is developed for real-time detection of metastatic ovarian cancer via NIR-II fluorescence imaging. The NIR-II Pdots are constructed via the self-assembly of NIR-II emissive aggregation induced emission luminogens (NIR-II AIEgens) and poly (styrene)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) in water. Such NIR-II Pdots show very high fluorophore contents of nearly 30% and high quantum yield of 5.4% at emission maximum near 1020 nm. Further modification of the NIR-II Pdots with targeting peptides yields NIR-II Pdots-GnRH, which can afford enhanced affinity of NIR-II Pdots to ovarian cancer. Upon intravenous injection of the NIR-II Pdots, whole-body organs and vessels, peritoneal and lymphatic metastases of ovarian cancer are clearly visualized by NIR-II fluorescence imaging. Under the guidance of NIR-II fluorescence imaging, the metastatic foci with the diameter down to ≈2 mm can be facilely eliminated. The results indicate preclinical potential value of the NIR-II Pdots for metastatic ovarian cancer detection.},

  abstract     = {Cell elongation along the division axis, or mitotic elongation, mediates proper segregation of chromosomes and other intracellular materials, and is required for completion of cell division. In three-dimensionally confining extracellular matrices, such as dense collagen gels, dividing cells must generate space to allow mitotic elongation to occur. In principle, cells can generate space for mitotic elongation during cell spreading, prior to mitosis, or via extracellular force generation or matrix degradation during mitosis. However, the processes by which cells drive mitotic elongation in collagen-rich extracellular matrices remains unclear. Here, it is shown that single cancer cells generate substantial pushing forces on the surrounding collagen extracellular matrix to drive cell division in confining collagen gels and allow mitotic elongation to proceed. Neither cell spreading, prior to mitosis, nor matrix degradation, during spreading or mitotic elongation, are found to be required for mitotic elongation. Mechanistically, laser ablation studies, pharmacological inhibition studies, and computational modeling establish that pushing forces generated during mitosis in collagen gels arise from a combination of interpolar spindle elongation and cytokinetic ring contraction. These results reveal a fundamental mechanism mediating cell division in confining extracellular matrices, providing insight into how tumor cells are able to proliferate in dense collagen-rich tissues.},

  abstract     = {2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) offer tremendous opportunities in designing multifunctional electronic devices. Due to the ultrathin nature of 2D materials, the gate-induced change in charge density makes amplitude control possible, creating a new programmable unilateral rectifier. The study of 2D vdWHs-based reversible unilateral rectifier is lacking, although it can give rise to a new degree of freedom for modulating the output state. Here, a InSe/GeSe vdWH-FET is constructed as a gate-controllable half wave rectifier. The device exhibits stepless adjustment from forward to backward rectifying performance, leading to multiple operation states of output level. Near-broken band alignment in the InSe/GeSe vdWH-FET is a crucial feature for high-performance reversible rectifier, which is shown to have backward and forward rectification ratio of 1:38 and 963:1, respectively. Being further explored as a new bridge rectifier, the InSe/GeSe device has great potential in future gate-controllable alternating current/direct current convertor. These results indicate that 2D vdWHs with near-broken band alignment can offer a pathway to simplify the commutating circuit and regulating speed circuit.},

Applications of these high color purity emitters, however, are hampered by the rather low photoluminescence quantum yields reported for cyanine J-aggregates, even when formed in solution. Here, it is demonstrated that cyanine J-aggregates can reach an order of magnitude higher photoluminescence quantum yield (increase from 5% to 60%) in blend solutions of water and alkylamines at room temperature. By means of time-resolved photoluminescence studies, an increase in the exciton lifetime as a result of the suppression of non-radiative processes is shown. Small-angle neutron scattering studies suggest a necessary condition for the formation of such highly emissive J-aggregates: the presence of a sharp water/amine interface for J-aggregate assembly and the coexistence of nanoscale-sized water and amine domains to restrict the J-aggregate size and solubilize monomers, respectively.},

Herein, Ti 3 C 2 T z MXene is mixed with MoO 3 nanobelts in various mass ratios and the mixture is used to vacuum filter binder free, open, flexible, and free-standing films. The conductive Ti 3 C 2 T z flakes bridge the nanobelts, facilitating electron transfer; the randomly oriented, and interconnected, MoO 3 nanobelts, in turn, prevent the restacking of the Ti 3 C 2 T z nanosheets. Benefitting from these advantages, a MoO 3 /Ti 3 C 2 T z film with a 8:2 mass ratio exhibits high gravimetric/volumetric capacities with good cyclability, namely, 837 C g −1 and 1836 C cm −3 at 1 A g −1 for an ≈ 10 µm thick film; and 767 C g −1 and 1664 C cm −3 at 1 A g −1 for ≈ 50 µm thick film. To further increase the energy density, hybrid capacitors are fabricated with MoO 3 /Ti 3 C 2 T z films as the negative electrodes and nitrogen-doped activated carbon as the positive electrodes. This device delivers maximum gravimetric/volumetric energy densities of 31.2 Wh kg −1 and 39.2 Wh L −1 , respectively. The cycling stability of 94.2% retention ratio after 10 000 continuous charge/discharge cycles is also noteworthy. The high energy density achieved in this work can pave the way for practical applications of MXene-containing materials in energy storage devices.},

Here, gp41 is demonstrated to directly interact with chol in the viral membrane via residues 751–854 in the cytoplasmic tail (CT 751–854 ). Super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy analysis of Env distribution further demonstrates that both truncation of gp41 CT 751–854 and depletion of chol leads to dispersion of Env clusters in the viral membrane and inhibition of virus entry. This work reveals a direct interaction of gp41 CT with chol and indicates that this interaction is an important orchestrator of Env clustering.},

Here, an approach involving a single-cell coating of surface-anchored nanogel to regulate stem cell fate with anti-apoptosis capacity in the hypoxic and ischemic environment of infarcted hearts is developed for the first time. A polysialic acid-based system is used to anchor microbial transglutaminase to the external surface of the cell membrane, where it catalyzes the crosslinking of gelatin. The single-cell coating with surface-anchored nanogel endows mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with stress resistance by blocking the activity of apoptotic cytokines including the binding of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) to tumor necrosis factor receptor, which in turn maintains mitochondrial integrity, function and protects MSCs from TNF α -induces apoptosis. The administration of surface engineered MSCs to hearts results in significant improvements in engraftment, cardiac function, infarct size, and vascularity compared with using uncoated MSCs in treating myocardial infarction. The surface-anchored, biocompatible cell surface engineering with nanogel armor provides a new way to produce robust therapeutic stem cells and may explore immense potentials in cell-based therapy.},

  abstract     = {Compact and entirely soft optics with tunable and adaptive properties drive the development of life-like soft robotic systems. Yet, existing approaches are either slow, require rigid components, or use high operating voltages of several kilovolts. Here, soft focus-tunable lenses are introduced, which operate at practical voltages, cover a high range of adjustable focal lengths, and feature response times in the milliseconds range. The nature-inspired design comprises a liquid-filled elastomeric lens membrane, which is inflated by zipping electroactive polymers to tune the focal length. An analytic description of the tunable lens supports optimized designs and accurate prediction of the lens characteristics. Focal length changes between 22 and 550 mm (numerical aperture 0.14–0.005) within 260 ms, equal in performance to human eyes, are demonstrated for a lens with 3 mm aperture radius, while applying voltages below 500 V. The presented model, design rules, and fabrication methods address central challenges of soft electrostatic actuators and optical systems, and pave the way toward autonomous bio-inspired robots and machines.},

  abstract     = {Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is an excellent modality for in vivo biomedical imaging as it noninvasively provides high-resolution morphologic and functional information without the need for exogenous contrast agents. However, the high excitation laser dosage, limited imaging speed, and imperfect image quality still hinder the use of OR-PAM in clinical applications. The laser dosage, imaging speed, and image quality are mutually restrained by each other, and thus far, no methods have been proposed to resolve this challenge. Here, a deep learning method called the multitask residual dense network is proposed to overcome this challenge. This method utilizes an innovative strategy of integrating multisupervised learning, dual-channel sample collection, and a reasonable weight distribution. The proposed deep learning method is combined with an application-targeted modified OR-PAM system. Superior images under ultralow laser dosage (32-fold reduced dosage) are obtained for the first time in this study. Using this new technique, a high-quality, high-speed OR-PAM system that meets clinical requirements is now conceivable.},

Currently, there are no effective druggable targets and advanced preclinical models of the human disease. Here, a unique mouse model ( MMTV-R26 Met mice) of mammary tumors driven by a subtle increase in the expression of the wild-type MET receptor is generated. MMTV-R26 Met mice develop spontaneous, exclusive TNBC tumors, recapitulating primary resistance to treatment of patients. Proteomic profiling of MMTV-R26 Met tumors and machine learning approach show that the model faithfully recapitulates intertumoral heterogeneity of human TNBC. Further signaling network analysis highlights potential druggable targets, of which cotargeting of WEE1 and BCL-XL synergistically kills TNBC cells and efficiently induces tumor regression. Mechanistically, BCL-XL inhibition exacerbates the dependency of TNBC cells on WEE1 function, leading to Histone H3 and phosphoS 33 RPA32 upregulation, RRM2 downregulation, cell cycle perturbation, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis. This study introduces a unique, powerful mouse model for studying TNBC formation and evolution, its heterogeneity, and for identifying efficient therapeutic targets.},

The models that can accurately resemble human-relevant responses to viral infection are lacking. Here, a biomimetic human disease model on chip that allows to recapitulate lung injury and immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at organ level is created. This human alveolar chip reproduce the key features of alveolar-capillary barrier by coculture of human alveolar epithelium, microvascular endothelium, and circulating immune cells under fluidic flow in normal and disease. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, the epithelium exhibits higher susceptibility to virus than endothelium. Transcriptional analyses show activated innate immune responses in epithelium and cytokine-dependent pathways in endothelium at day 3 post-infection, revealing the distinctive responses in different cell types. Notably, viral infection causes the immune cell recruitment, endothelium detachment, and increased inflammatory cytokines release, suggesting the crucial role of immune cells involved in alveolar barrier injury and exacerbated inflammation. Treatment with remdesivir can inhibit viral replication and alleviate barrier disruption on chip. This organ chip model can closely mirror human-relevant responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is difficult to be achieved by in vitro models, providing a unique platform for COVID-19 research and drug development.},

A significant portion of the energy of transmitted electrons is transferred to the material under study through inelastic scattering, causing inadvertent damage via ionization, radiolysis, and heating. In particular, heat generation complicates TEM observations as the local temperature can affect material properties. Here, the heat generation due to electron irradiation is quantified using both top-down and bottom-up approaches: direct temperature measurements using nanowatt calorimeters as well as the quantification of energy loss due to inelastic scattering events using electron energy loss spectroscopy. Combining both techniques, a microscopic model is developed for beam-induced heating and to identify the primary electron-to-heat conversion mechanism to be associated with valence electrons. Building on these results, the model provides guidelines to estimate temperature rise for general materials with reasonable accuracy. This study extends the ability to quantify thermal impact on materials down to the atomic scale.},

  abstract     = {Given the inherent features of open tunnel-like pyrochlore crystal frameworks and pentavalent antimony species, polyantimonic acid (PAA) is an appealing conversion/alloying-type anode material with fast solid-phase ionic diffusion and multielectron reactions for lithium-ion batteries. Yet, enhancing the electronic conductivity and structural stability are two key issues in exploiting high-rate and long-life PAA-based electrodes. Herein, these challenges are addressed by engineering a novel multidimensional integrated architecture, which consists of 0D Mn-substituted PAA nanocrystals embedded in 1D tubular graphene scrolls that are co-assembled with 2D N-doped graphene sheets. The integrated advantages of each subunit synergistically establish a robust and conductive 3D electrode framework with omnidirectional electron/ion transport network. Computational simulations combined with experiments reveal that the partial-substitution of H 3 O + by Mn 2+ into the tunnel sites of PAA can regulate its electronic structure to narrow the bandgap with increased intrinsic electronic conductivity and reduce the Li + diffusion barrier. All above merits enable improved reaction kinetics, adaptive volume expansion, and relieved dissolution of active Mn 2+ /Sb 5+ species in the electrode materials, thus exhibiting ultrahigh rate capacity (238 mAh g −1 at 30.0 A g −1 ), superfast-charging capability (fully charged with 56% initial capacity for ≈17 s at 80.0 A g −1 ) and durable cycling performance (over 1000 cycles).},

The study of intercellular communication requires techniques that reduce the scale and complexity of in vivo biological networks while resolving the molecular heterogeneity in “omic” layers that contribute to cell state and function. Recent advances in microengineering and high-throughput genomics offer unprecedented spatiotemporal control over cellular interactions and the ability to study intercellular communication in a high-throughput and mechanistic manner.

Although different sensors have been described based on piezoresistivity, capacitance, and triboelectricity, and these devices are promising for tactile systems, there are few, if any, piezoelectric sensors to be able to distinguish diverse stimuli in real time. Here, a human skin-inspired piezoelectric tactile sensor array constructed with a multilayer structure and row+column electrodes is reported. Integrated with a signal processor and a logical algorithm, the tactile sensor array achieves to sense and distinguish the magnitude, positions, and modes of diverse external stimuli, including gentle slipping, touching, and bending, in real time. Besides, the unique design overcomes the crosstalk issues existing in other sensors. Pressure sensing and bending sensing tests show that the proposed tactile sensor array possesses the characteristics of high sensitivity (7.7 mV kPa −1 ), long-term durability (80 000 cycles), and rapid response time (10 ms) (less than human skin). The tactile sensor array also shows a superior scalability and ease of massive fabrication. Its ability of real-time detection and differentiation of diverse stimuli for health monitoring, detection of animal movements, and robots is demonstrated.},

Details in cell deformation and the restoration process are thoroughly studied on the platform, and cell behavior control at the microscale is successfully achieved by tuning the treating time, intensity, and wave form of the streaming. The application of this platform in cell membrane permeability modulation and analysis is also exploited. Based on the membrane reorganization during cell deformation, the effects of deformation extent and deformation patterns on membrane permeability to micro- and macromolecules are revealed. This technology has shown its unique superiorities in cell mechanical manipulation such as high flexibility, high accuracy, and pure fluid force operation, indicating its promising prospect as a reliable tool for cell property study and drug therapy development.},

  abstract     = {As a chronic inflammatory disease, diabetes mellitus creates a proinflammatory microenvironment around implants, resulting in a high rate of implant loosening or failure in osteological therapies. In this study, macroporous silk gel scaffolds are injected at the bone–implant interface for in situ release of sitagliptin that can regulate macrophage response to create a prohealing microenvironment in diabetes mellitus disease. Notably, it is discovered that sitagliptin induces macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype and alleviates the impaired behaviors of osteoblasts on titanium (Ti) implants under diabetic conditions in a dose-dependent manner. The silk gel scaffolds loaded with sitagliptin elicite a stronger recruitment of M2 macrophages to the sites of Ti implants and a significant promotion of osteointegration, as compared to oral sitagliptin administration. The results suggest that injectable silk/sitagliptin gel scaffolds can be utilized to modulate the immune responses at the bone–implant interface, thus enhancing bone regeneration required for successful implantation of orthopedic and dental devices in diabetic patients.},

  abstract     = {Supercritical fluid pseudo-boiling (PB), recently brought to the attention of the scientific community, is the phenomenon occurring when fluid changes its structure from liquid-like (LL) to gas-like (GL) states across the Widom line. This work provides the first quantitative analysis on the thermodynamics and the dynamics of water&#39;s PB, since the understanding of this phase transition is mandatory for the successful implementation of technologies using supercritical water (scH 2 O) for environmental, energy, and nanomaterial applications. The study combines computational techniques with in situ neutron imaging measurements. The results demonstrate that, during isobaric heating close to the critical point, while water density drops by a factor of three in the PB transitional region, the system needs &gt;16 times less energy to increase its temperature by 1 K than to change its structure from LL to GL phase. Above the PB-Widom line, the structure of LL water consists mainly of tetramers and trimers, while below the line mostly dimers and monomers form in the GL phase. At atomic level, the PB dynamics are similar to those of the subcritical water vaporization. This fundamental knowledge has great impact on water science, as it helps to establish the structure–properties relationship of scH 2 O.},

  abstract     = {Active-targeted nanoparticles are attractive carriers due to their potentials to facilitate specific delivery of drugs into tumor cells while sparing normal cells. However, the therapeutic outcomes of active-targeted nanomedicines are hampered by the multiple physiological barriers in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted ultra-pH-sensitive nanophotosensitizer is fabricated, and the regulation of the TME to augment the active targeting ability and therapeutic efficacy is pinpointed. The results reveal that tumor vasculature normalization with thalidomide indiscriminately enhance the tumor accumulation of passive and active targeted nanoparticles, both of which are sequestered in the stromal bed of tumor mass. Whereas, photoablation of stromal cells located in perivascular regions significantly improves the accessibility of antibody-modified nanophotosensitizer to receptor-overexpressed cancer cells. After sequential regulation of TME, the antitumor efficacy of antibody-modified nanophotosensitizer is drastically enhanced through synergistic enhancements of tumor accumulation and cancer cell accessibility of active-targeted nanoparticles. The study offers deep insights about the intratumoral barriers that hinder the active-targeted nanoparticles delivery, and provides a basis for developing more effective strategies to accelerate the clinical translation of active-targeted nanomedicines.},

  abstract     = {A genetically encoded caffeine-operated synthetic module (COSMO) is introduced herein as a robust chemically induced dimerization (CID) system. COSMO enables chemogenetic manipulation of biological processes by caffeine and its metabolites, as well as caffeinated beverages, including coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. This CID tool, evolved from an anti-caffeine nanobody via cell-based high-throughput screening, permits caffeine-inducible gating of calcium channels, tumor killing via necroptosis, growth factors-independent activation of tyrosine receptor kinase signaling, and enhancement of nanobody-mediated antigen recognition for the severe acute respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Further rationalized engineering of COSMO leads to 34–217-fold enhancement in caffeine sensitivity (EC 50 = 16.9 nanomolar), which makes it among the most potent CID systems like the FK506 binding protein (FKBP)–FKBP rapamycin binding domain (FRB)–rapamycin complex. Furthermore, bivalent COSMO (biCOMSO) connected with a long linker favors intramolecular dimerization and acts as a versatile precision switch when inserted in host proteins to achieve tailored function. Given the modularity and high transferability of COMSO and biCOSMO, these chemical biology tools are anticipated to greatly accelerate the development of therapeutic cells and biologics that can be switched on and off by caffeinated beverages commonly consumed in the daily life.},

While impurity doping is an effective chemical operation that can precisely tune the energy of an electronic system, it always faces an unavoidable difficulty in molecular crystals because the introduction of a relatively high density of dopants inevitably destroys the highly ordered molecular framework. In striking contrast, a versatile strategy is presented to create coherent 2D electronic carriers at the surface of organic semiconductor crystals with their precise molecular structures preserved perfectly. The formation of an assembly of redox-active molecular dopants via a simple one-shot solution process on a molecularly flat crystalline surface allows efficient chemical doping and results in a relatively high carrier density of 10 13 cm −2 at room temperature. Structural and magnetotransport analyses comprehensively reveal that excellent carrier transport and piezoresistive effects can be obtained that are similar to those in bulk crystals.},

  abstract     = {In order to solve the problems of receptor promiscuity and poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration in the treatment of glioblastomas (GBM), a novel dual-functional nanocomplex drug delivery system is developed based on the strategy of peptide-drug conjugates. In this study, SynB3-PVGLIG-PTX is designed and screened out by matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), to which it exhibits the best affinity. The MMP-2-sensitive peptide (PVGLIG) and a cell-penetration peptide (SynB3) are combined to form a dual-functional peptide. Moreover, as a drug-peptide nanocomplex, SynB3-PVGLIG-PTX exhibited a high potential to form an aggregation with good solubility that can release paclitaxel (PTX) through the cleavage of MMP-2. From a functional perspective, it is found that SynB3-PVGLIG-PTX can specifically inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells in vitro in the presence of MMP-2, in contrast to that observed in MMP-2 siRNA transfected cells. Further investigation in vivo shows that SynB3-PVGLIG-PTX easily enters the brain of U87MG xenograft nude mice and can generate a better suppressive effect on GBM through a controlled release of PTX from SynB3-PVGLIG-PTX compared with PTX and temozolomide. Thus, it is proposed that SynB3-PVGLIG-PTX can be used as a novel drug-loading delivery system to treat GBM due to its specificity and BBB permeability.},

  abstract     = {Nano-immunotherapy regimens have high potential to improve patient outcomes, as already demonstrated in advanced triple negative breast cancer with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel and the immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) atezolizumab. This regimen, however, does not lead to cures with median survival lasting less than two years. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of resistance to and development of strategies to enhance nano-immunotherapy in breast cancer are urgently needed. Here, in human tissue it is shown that blood vessels in breast cancer lung metastases are compressed leading to hypoxia. This pathophysiology exists in murine spontaneous models of triple negative breast cancer lung metastases, along with low levels of perfusion. Because this pathophysiology is consistent with elevated levels of solid stress, the mechanotherapeutic tranilast, which decompressed lung metastasis vessels, is administered to mice bearing metastases, thereby restoring perfusion and alleviating hypoxia. As a result, the nanomedicine Doxil causes cytotoxic effects into metastases more efficiently, stimulating anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, when combining tranilast with Doxil and ICBs, synergistic effects on efficacy, with all mice cured in one of the two ICB-insensitive tumor models investigated is resulted. These results suggest that strategies to treat breast cancer with nano-immunotherapy should also include a mechanotherapeutic to decompress vessels.},

The key parameters, such as the total 3D TiO 2 film and thin-shell thicknesses, are precisely optimized by finite element analysis. Collectively, this fundamental design leads to ultrahigh chemoresistive response to NO 2 with a theoretical detection limit of ≈200 ppt.

Contrary to early experimental studies that assumed bulk or hindered diffusion, measurements in this work indicate that the permeability of small ions through single-walled CNT channels is more than an order of magnitude higher than through the bulk. This flow enhancement scales with the ion free energy of transfer from bulk solutions to a nanoconfined, lower-dielectric environment.

Predictably, the dispersed Ru on pristine CTF carrier suffered severe sintering of the Ru nanoparticles (NPs) during heat treatment at 900 °C. However, the Ru-CTF-I-900 catalyst is composed of ultra-small Ru NPs and abundant Ru single atoms which may have resulted from much stronger Ru  N interactions. Through modification of the micro-environment within the CTF architecture, Ru precursor interacted on charged-modulated CTF framework shows electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance, thus contributing toward the high density of single Ru atoms and even smaller Ru NPs after pyrolysis.

  abstract     = {Influenza is one of the most widespread viral infections worldwide and represents a major public health problem. The risk that one of the next pandemics is caused by an influenza strain is high. It is important to develop broad-spectrum influenza antivirals to be ready for any possible vaccine shortcomings. Anti-influenza drugs are available but they are far from ideal. Arguably, an ideal antiviral should target conserved viral domains and be virucidal, that is, irreversibly inhibit viral infectivity. Here, a new class of broad-spectrum anti-influenza macromolecules is described that meets these criteria and display exceedingly low toxicity. These compounds are based on a cyclodextrin core modified on its primary face with long hydrophobic linkers terminated either in 6&#39;sialyl- N -acetyllactosamine (6’SLN) or in 3’SLN. SLN enables nanomolar inhibition of the viruses while the hydrophobic linkers confer irreversibility to the inhibition. The combination of these two properties allows for efficacy in vitro against several human or avian influenza strains, as well as against a 2009 pandemic influenza strain ex vivo. Importantly, it is shown that, in mice, one of the compounds provides therapeutic efficacy when administered 24 h post-infection allowing 90% survival as opposed to no survival for the placebo and oseltamivir.},

  abstract     = {Taking lessons from nature offers an increasing promise toward improved performance in man-made materials. Here new cement materials with unidirectionally porous architectures are developed by replicating the designs of natural wood using a simplified ice-templating technique in light of the retention of ice-templated architectures by utilizing the self-hardening nature of cement. The wood-like cement exhibits higher strengths at equal densities than other porous cement-based materials along with unique multifunctional properties, including effective thermal insulation at the transverse profile, controllable water permeability along the vertical direction, and the easy adjustment to be water repulsive by hydrophobic treatment. The strengths are quantitatively interpreted by discerning the effects of differing types of pores using an equivalent element approach. The simultaneous achievement of high strength and multifunctionality makes the wood-like cement promising for applications as new building materials, and verifies the effectiveness of wood-mimetic designs in creating new high-performance materials. The simple fabrication procedure by omitting the freeze-drying treatment can also promote a better efficiency of ice-templating technique for the mass production in engineering and may be extended to other material systems.},

  abstract     = {Morphogenesis is a tightly-regulated developmental process by which tissues acquire the morphology that is critical to their function. For example, epithelial cells exhibit different 2D and 3D morphologies, induced by distinct biochemical and biophysical cues from their environment. In this work, novel hybrid matrices composed of a Matrigel and synthetic oligo(ethylene glycol)-grafted polyisocyanides (PICs) hydrogels are used to form a highly tailorable environment. Through precise control of the stiffness and cell-matrix interactions, while keeping other properties constant, a broad range of morphologies induced in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells is observed. At relatively low matrix stiffness, a large morphological shift from round hollow cysts to 2D monolayers is observed, without concomitant translocation of the mechanotransduction protein Yes-associated protein (YAP). At higher stiffness levels and enhanced cell-matrix interactions, tuned by controlling the adhesive peptide density on PIC, the hybrid hydrogels induce a flattened cell morphology with simultaneous YAP translocation, suggesting activation. In 3D cultures, the latter matrices lead to the formation of tubular structures. Thus, mixed synthetic and natural gels, such as the hybrids presented here, are ideal platforms to dissect how external physical factors can be used to regulate morphogenesis in MDCK model system, and in the future, in more complex environments.},

Although metal oxynitrides with metal d 0 /d 10 -closed shell configuration are very promising candidates in terms of their visible light absorption, they usually suffer from serious photo-generated charge recombination and thus, little photoactivity. Here, by forming their solid solutions of LaTaON 2 and CaTaO 2 N, which are traditionally considered to be inorganic yellow-red pigments but have poor photocatalytic activity, a class of promising solar-driven photocatalysts La 1- x Ca x TaO 1+y N 2- y (0 ≤ x , y ≤ 1) are explored. In particular, the optimal photocatalyst with x = 0.9 has the ability of realizing overall water splitting with stoichiometric H 2 /O 2 ratio under the illumination of both AM1.5 simulated solar light and visible light. The modulated key parameters including band structure, Ta bonding environment, defects concentration, and band edge alignments revealed in La 0.1 Ca 0.9 TaO 1+ y N 2- y have substantially promoted the separation of photogenerated charge carriers with sufficient energetics for water oxidation and reduction reactions. The results obtained in this study provide an important candidate for designing efficient solar-driven photocatalysts for overall water splitting.},

  abstract     = {Sodium metal anodes combine low redox potential (−2.71 V versus SHE) and high theoretical capacity (1165 mAh g −1 ), becoming a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Due to the infinite volume change, unstable SEI films, and Na dendrite growth, it is arduous to achieve a long lifespan. Herein, an oxygen-doped carbon foam (OCF) derived from starch is reported. Heteroatom doping can significantly reduce the nucleation resistance of sodium metal; combined with its rich pore structure and large specific surface area, OCF provides abundant nucleation sites to effectively guide the nucleation and subsequent growth of sodium metal, and the nature of this foam can accommodate the deposited sodium. Furthermore, a more uniform, robust, and stable SEI layer is observed on the surface of OCF electrode, so it can maintain ultra-high reversibility and excellent integrity for a long time without dendritic growth. As a result, when the current density is 10 mA cm −2 , the electrode can maintain stable 2000 cycles and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.83%. Na@OCF||Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 full cell also has extremely high capacity retention of about 97.53% over 150 cycles. These results provide a simple but effective method for achieving the safety and commercialization of sodium metal anode.},

  abstract     = {The surface chemistry of colloidal quantum dots (CQD) play a crucial role in fabricating highly efficient and stable solar cells. However, as-synthesized PbS CQDs are significantly off-stoichiometric and contain inhomogeneously distributed S and Pb atoms at the surface, which results in undercharged Pb atoms, dangling bonds of S atoms and uncapped sites, thus causing surface trap states. Moreover, conventional ligand exchange processes cannot efficiently eliminate these undesired atom configurations and defect sites. Here, potassium triiodide (KI 3 ) additives are combined with conventional PbX 2 matrix ligands to simultaneously eliminate the undercharged Pb species and dangling S sites via reacting with molecular I 2 generated from the reversible reaction KI 3 ⇌ I 2 + KI. Meanwhile, high surface coverage shells on PbS CQDs are built via PbX 2 and KI ligands. The implementation of KI 3 additives remarkably suppresses the surface trap states and enhances the device stability due to the surface chemistry optimization. The resultant solar cells achieve the best power convention efficiency of 12.1% and retain 94% of its initial efficiency under 20 h continuous operation in air, while the control devices with KI additive deliver an efficiency of 11.0% and retains 87% of their initial efficiency under the same conditions.},

As a representative MPX 3 , FePSe 3 has the potential to be developed as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agents due to the composition of Fe and the previously revealed PA signal. Here, a FePSe 3 -based theranostic agent, FePSe 3 @APP@CCM, loaded with anti-PD-1 peptide (APP) as the inner component and CT26 cancer cell membrane (CCM) as the outer shell is reported, which acts as a multifunctional agent for MR and PA imaging and photothermal and immunotherapy against cancer. FePSe 3 @APP@CCM induces highly efficient tumor ablation and suppresses tumor growth by photothermal therapy under near-infrared laser excitation, which further activates immune responses. Moreover, APP blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway to activate cytotoxic T cells, causing strong anticancer immunity. The combined therapy significantly prolongs the lifespan of experimental mice. The multimodal imaging and synergistic therapeutic effects of PTT and its triggered immune responses and APP-related immunotherapy are clearly demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Lorentz force-based electromagnetic actuators can overcome these challenges with the help of very high, axial, and uniform magnetic fields (3–7 Tesla) of the scanners. Here, a miniature, MRI-compatible, and optically powered wireless Lorentz force actuator module consisting of a solar cell and a coil with a small volume of 2.5 × 2.5 × 3.0 mm 3 is proposed. Many of such actuator modules can be used to create various wireless active structures for future interventional MRI applications, such as positioning needles, markers, or other medical tools on the skin of a patient. As proof-of-concept prototypes toward such applications, a single actuator module that bends a flexible beam, four modules that rotate around an axis, and six modules that roll as a sphere are demonstrated inside a 7 Tesla preclinical MRI scanner.},

This study shows that autophagy and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 signaling pathways are both activated in AZD9291 resistant NSCLC, and inhibition of them, respectively, by chloroquine (CQ) and PD173074 can synergistically reverse AZD9291 resistance. Herein, a coloaded CQ and PD173074 pH-sensitive shell–core nanoparticles CP@NP-cRGD is developed to reverse AZD9291 resistance in NSCLC. CP@NP-cRGD has a high encapsulation rate and stability, and can effectively prevent the degradation of drugs in circulation process. CP@NP-cRGD can target tumor cells by enhanced permeability and retention effect and the cRGD peptide. The pH-sensitive CaP shell can realize lysosome escape and then release drugs successively. The combination of CP@NP-cRGD and AZD9291 significantly induces a higher rate of apoptosis, more G0/G1 phase arrest, and reduces proliferation of resistant cell lines by downregulation of p-ERK1/2 in vitro. CQ in CP@NP-cRGD can block protective autophagy induced by both AZD9291 and PD173074. CP@NP-cRGD combined with AZD9291 shows adequate tumor enrichment, low toxicity, and excellent antitumor effect in nude mice.

Here, a non-empirical and robustly applicable wear law for nanoscale contact situations is proposed. The proposed wear law successfully unveils why the nanoscale wear behaviors do not obey the description by Archard&#39;s law in all cases although still obey it in certain experiments. The robustness and applicability of the proposed wear law is validated by atomistic simulations. This work affords a way to calculate wear at nanoscale contact robustly and theoretically, and will contribute to developing design principles for wear reduction.},

The molecular design is contrary to that of other semiconductor-insulator copolymers, which typically combine a soft nonconjugated spacer with hard conjugated segments. Copolymerization of polar polythiophenes and urethane segments results in a ductile material that can be used as a free-standing solid. The copolymer displays a storage modulus of 25 MPa at room temperature, elongation at break of 95%, and a reduced degree of swelling due to hydrogen bonding.

  abstract     = {The electrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen is considered one of the most promising approaches to generate clean and sustainable energy. However, the low efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) acts as a bottleneck in the water splitting process. Herein, interface engineering heterojunctions between ZIF-67 and layered double hydroxide (LDH) are designed to enhance the catalytic activity of the OER and the stability of Co-LDH. The interface is built by the oxygen (O) of Co-LDH and nitrogen (N) of the 2-methylimidazole ligand in ZIF-67, which modulates the local electronic structure of the catalytic active site. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the interfacial interaction can enhance the strength of the Co  O out bond in Co-LDH, which makes it easier to break the H-O out bond and results in a lower free energy change in the potential-determining step at the heterointerface in the OER process. Therefore, the Co-LDH@ZIF-67 exhibits superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 187 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 and long-term electrochemical stability for more than 50 h. This finding provides a design direction for improving the catalytic activity of OER.},

  abstract     = {Morphological control is a fundamental challenge of nanomaterial development. Commonly, hierarchical nanostructures cannot be induced by a single driving force, but obtained through balancing multiple driving forces. Here, a feasible strategy is reported based on the synergistic effect of proton and acid anion, leading to the morphological variation of vanadium oxide from nanowire, bundle, to hierarchical nanoflower (HNF). Protons can only induce the formation of nanowire through reducing the pH value ≤ 2. However, acid anions with strong coordination ability, e.g., phosphate radicals, can also participate in morphological regulation at high concentration. Through coordinating with exposed vanadium ions, the enrichment of phosphate radicals at ledge and kink changes the growth directions, giving rise to the advanced structures of bundle and HNF. The lithium ion batteries using HNF as a cathode achieve a 30% improved initial discharge specific capacity of 436.23 mAh g −1 at a current density of 0.1 A g −1 , reaching the theoretical maximum value of vanadium oxide based on insertion/desertion of three lithium ions, in addition to strong cyclic stability at 1 A g −1 .},

Here, experiments and simulations are used to investigate the mechanical properties of a 2D diamond boron nitride (BN) phase induced by applying local pressure on atomically thin h-BN on a SiO 2 substrate, at room temperature, and without chemical functionalization. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show a metastable local rearrangement of the h-BN atoms into diamond crystal clusters when increasing the indentation pressure. Raman spectroscopy experiments confirm the presence of a pressure-induced cubic BN phase, and its metastability upon release of pressure. Å-indentation experiments and simulations show that at pressures of 2–4 GPa, the indentation stiffness of monolayer h-BN on SiO 2 is the same of bare SiO 2 , whereas for two- and three-layer-thick h-BN on SiO 2 the stiffness increases of up to 50% compared to bare SiO 2 , and then it decreases when increasing the number of layers. Up to 4 GPa, the reduced strain in the layers closer to the substrate decreases the probability of the sp 2 -to-sp 3 phase transition, explaining the lower stiffness observed in thicker h-BN.},

  abstract     = {Innate antiviral immunity is the first line of host defense against invading viral pathogens. Immunity activation primarily relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Viral proteins or nucleic acids mainly engage three classes of PRRs: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). These receptors initiate a series of signaling cascades that lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN-I) in response to viral infection. This system requires precise regulation to avoid aberrant activation. Emerging evidence has unveiled the crucial roles that the ubiquitin system, especially deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), play in controlling immune responses. In this review, an overview of the most current findings on the function of DUBs in the innate antiviral immune pathways is provided. Insights into the role of viral DUBs in counteracting host immune responses are also provided. Furthermore, the prospects and challenges of utilizing DUBs as therapeutic targets for infectious diseases are discussed.},

Also, it maintains steady hydrogen bubble evolution even after 30 000 potential cycles in acid media. Furthermore, the RuRh 2 bimetallene nanoring shows an outstanding activity in both alkaline and neutral media, outperforming that of Pt catalysts and other reported HER catalysts. A combination of atomic-scale structure observation and density functional theory calculations demonstrates that both the grain boundaries and symmetry breaking of RuRh 2 bimetallene cannot only weaken the adsorption strength of atomic hydrogen, but also facilitate the transfer of electrons and the adsorption of reactants, further boosting the HER electrocatalytic performance in all pH values.},

However, high-performance cathodes with stable capacity, good conductivity, and fast ions transport are needed, since many conventional cathodes possess a low performance and poor preparation controllability. Herein, a liquid-driven coaxial flow focusing (LDCFF) approach for preparing a novel microcapsule system with controllable size, high loading, and stable magnesium-storage performance is presented. Taking the MoS 2 -infilled microcapsule as a case study, the magnesium battery cathode based on the microcapsules displays a capacity of 100 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles. High capacity retention is achieved at both low and high temperatures of −10, ‒5, and 45 °C, and a stable rate-performance is also obtained. The influences of the liquid flow rates on the size and shell thickness of the microcapsules are investigated; and electron and ion diffusion properties are also studied by first-principle calculations. The presented LDCFF method is quite general, and the high performance of the microcapsules enables them to find broad applications for making emerging energy-storage materials and secondary battery systems.},

  abstract     = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the roots of cancer metastasis and recurrence (CSCs), due in part to their self-renewal and therapy resistance properties. However, the underlying mechanisms for the regulation of CSC stemness are poorly understood. Recently, increasing evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators for cancer cell function in various malignancies including breast cancer, but how lncRNAs regulate the function of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains to be determined. Herein, using lncRNA/mRNA microarray assays, a novel lncRNA (named lnc030) is identified, which is highly expressed in BCSCs in vitro and in vivo, as a pivotal regulator in maintaining BCSC stemness and promoting tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, lnc030 cooperates with poly(rC) binding protein 2(PCBP2) to stabilize squalene epoxidase (SQLE) mRNA, resulting in an increase of cholesterol synthesis. The increased cholesterol in turn actives PI3K/Akt signaling, which governs BCSC stemness. In summary, these findings demonstrate that a new, lnc030-based mechanism for regulating cholesterol synthesis and stemness properties of BCSCs. The lnc030-SQLE-cholesterol synthesis pathway may serve as an effective therapeutic target for BCSC elimination and breast cancer treatment.},

Advanced imaging methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) have unravelled the morphological and mechanical heterogeneity of amyloids, however a full understanding has been hampered by the limited resolution of conventional spectroscopic methods. Here, it is shown that single molecule nanomechanical mapping and infrared nanospectroscopy (AFM-IR) in combination with atomistic modelling enable unravelling at the single aggregate scale of the morphological, nanomechanical, chemical, and structural transition from amyloid fibrils to amyloid microcrystals in the hexapeptides, ILQINS, IFQINS, and TFQINS. Different morphologies have different Young&#39;s moduli, within 2–6 GPa, with amyloid fibrils exhibiting lower Young&#39;s moduli compared to amyloid microcrystals. The origins of this stiffening are unravelled and related to the increased content of intermolecular β -sheet and the increased lengthscale of cooperativity following the transition from twisted fibril to flat nanocrystal. Increased stiffness in Young&#39;s moduli is correlated with increased density of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and parallel β -sheet structure, which energetically stabilize crystals over the other polymorphs. These results offer additional evidence for the position of amyloid crystals in the minimum of the protein folding and aggregation landscape.},

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Current treatments use drugs or surgery to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). In this study, a drug-free, nonsurgical method is developed that lowers IOP for 4 months without requiring daily patient adherence. The approach involves expanding the suprachoroidal space (SCS) of the eye with an in situ-forming hydrogel injected using a microneedle. This study tests the hypothesis that SCS expansion increases the drainage of aqueous humor from the eye via the unconventional pathway, which thereby lowers IOP. SCS injection of a commercial hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel reduces the IOP of normotensive rabbits for more than 1 month and an optimized HA hydrogel formulation enables IOP reduction for 4 months. Safety assessment by clinical ophthalmic examinations indicate the treatment is well tolerated. Histopathology shows minor hemorrhage and fibrosis at the site of injection. Further analysis by ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrates a strong correlation of IOP reduction with SCS expansion. Outflow facility measurements show no difference in pressure-dependent outflow by the conventional pathway between treated and untreated eyes, supporting the hypothesis. In conclusion, SCS expansion with an in situ-forming hydrogel can enable extended IOP reduction for treating ocular hypertension and glaucoma without drugs or surgery.},

  abstract     = {Gamma-rays ( γ -rays), wherever present, e.g., in medicine, nuclear environment, or homeland security, due to their strong impact on biological matter, should be closely monitored. There is a need for simple, sensitive γ -ray detectors at affordable prices. Here, it is shown that γ -ray detectors based on crystals of methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr 3 ) ideally meet these requirements. Specifically, the γ -rays incident on a MAPbBr 3 crystal generates photocarriers with a high mobility-lifetime product, allowing radiation detection by photocurrent measurements at room temperatures. Moreover, the MAPbBr 3 crystal-based detectors, equipped with improved carbon electrodes, can operate at low bias (≈1.0 V), hence being suitable for applications in energy-sparse environments, including space. The γ -ray detectors reported herein are exposed to radiation from a 60 Co source at dose rates up to 2.3 Gy h −1 under ambient conditions for over 100 h, without any sign of degradation. The excellent radiation tolerance stems from the intrinsic structural plasticity of the organic–inorganic halide perovskites, which can be attributed to a defect-healing process by fast ion migration at the nanoscale level. The sensitivity of the γ -ray detection upon volume is tested for MAPbBr 3 crystals reaching up to 1000 cm 3 (3.3 kg in weight) grown by a unique crystal growth technique.},

  abstract     = {The development of an efficient electrocatalyst toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of significant importance in transforming renewable electricity to pure and clean hydrogen by water splitting. However, the construction of an active electrocatalyst with multiple sites that can promote the dissociation of water molecules still remains a great challenge. Herein, a partial-single-atom, partial-nanoparticle composite consisting of nanosized ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles (NPs) and individual Ru atoms as an energy-efficient HER catalyst in alkaline medium is reported. The formation of this unique composite mainly results from the dispersion of Ru NPs to small-size NPs and single atoms (SAs) on the Fe/N codoped carbon (Fe–N–C) substrate due to the thermodynamic stability. The optimal catalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an ultralow overpotential (9 mV) at 10 mA cm −2 ( η 10 ), a high turnover frequency (8.9 H 2 s −1 at 50 mV overpotential), and nearly 100% Faraday efficiency, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C and other reported HER electrocatalysts in alkaline condition. Both experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the coexistence of Ru NPs and SAs can improve the hydride coupling and water dissociation kinetics, thus synergistically enhancing alkaline hydrogen evolution performance.},

  abstract     = {LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathodes suffer from severe bulk structural and interfacial degradation during battery operation. To address these issues, a three in one strategy using ZrB 2 as the dopant is proposed for constructing a stable Ni-rich cathode. In this strategy, Zr and B are doped into the bulk of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 , respectively, which is beneficial to stabilize the crystal structure and mitigate the microcracks. Meanwhile, during the high-temperature calcination, some of the remaining Zr at the surface combined with the surface lithium source to form lithium zirconium coatings, which physically protect the surface and suppress the interfacial phase transition upon cycling. Thus, the 0.2 mol% ZrB 2 -LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 183.1 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles at 50 °C (1C, 3.0–4.3 V), with an outstanding capacity retention of 88.1%. The cycling stability improvement is more obvious when the cut-off voltage increased to 4.4 V. Density functional theory confirms that the superior structural stability and excellent thermal stability are attributed to the higher exchange energy of Li/Ni exchange and the higher formation energy of oxygen vacancies by ZrB 2 doping. The present work offers a three in one strategy to simultaneously stabilize the crystal structure and surface for the Ni-rich cathode via a facile preparation process.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoints blockades have shown promising clinical effects in various malignancies, but the overall response rate is low. Here, the immune features are comprehensively characterized in &gt;10 000 cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and significantly positive correlations are observed between targets of Sunitinib and inhibitory immune checkpoints and suppressive immune cells. It is further confirmed that Sunitinib treatment increases the antitumor immunity in a phase III trial. Mechanistically, it is discovered that Sunitinib regulates the stability of tumor PD-L1 via p62, that p62 can bind to PD-L1 and specifically promote its translocation into autophagic lysosome for degradation. Preclinically, Sunitinib shows a synergistic antitumor effect with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) in melanoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) immune competent mice by promoting the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes activity. Clinically, a higher PD-L1 level but a lower p62 level in the tumor region of responders as compared to those of nonresponders among anti-PD-1-treated NSCLC patients is observed. Taken together, by utilizing rigorous computational analysis, functional characterization in vitro and in vivo, and neoadjuvent clinical trial, a novel molecular mechanism is revealed regarding the regulation of PD-L1 via p62, thus providing a novel therapeutic strategy by the combination treatment of CTLA-4 with Sunitinib.},

The resulting material with chelating groups populated adjacently in a spatially locked manner displays up to two orders of magnitude improvement compared to a random and isolated manner using uranium sequestration as a model application. This adsorbent shows exceptional extraction efficiencies, capable of reducing the uranium concentration from 5 ppm to less than 1 ppb within 10 min, even though the system is permeated with high concentrations of competing ions. The efficiency is further supported by its ability to extract uranium from seawater with an uptake capability of 5.01 mg g −1 , placing it among the highest-capacity seawater uranium extraction materials described to date. The concept presented here uncovers a new paradigm in the design of efficient sorbent materials by manipulating the spatial distribution to amplify the cooperation of functions.},

However, coil embolization is associated with high rebleeding rates, unpredictable economics and, most importantly, they rely on the patient&#39;s ability to make a clot. These issues are exacerbated when the patient is anticoagulated or coagulopathic. A novel bioengineered tantalum-loaded nanocomposite hydrogel for gel embolic material (Ta-GEM) that can be rapidly delivered using clinical catheters for instant hemostasis regardless of the coagulopathic state is reported. Ta-GEM formulation is visible by most of the clinically available imaging modalities including ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fluoroscopy without significant artifact. In addition, Ta-GEM can be retrieved, allowing temporary vascular occlusion, and it can be used to rescue cases of failed coil embolization. Ta-GEM occlusion of first-order arteries such as the renal artery and iliac artery in a swine model is found to be safe and durable; by 28 days, 75% of the injected Ta-GEM in the arterial lumen is replaced by dense connective tissue. Altogether, this study demonstrates that Ta-GEM has many advantages over the current technologies and has potential applications in clinical practice.},

The impact of FP association is assessed by predicting dimerization sites in silico and stabilizing the dimers by bio-orthogonal covalent linkages. In each tested case dimerization changes inherent fluorescence, including FRET. GFP homodimers demonstrate synergistic behavior with the dimer being brighter than the sum of the monomers. The homodimer structure reveals the chromophores are close with favorable transition dipole alignments and a highly solvated interface. Heterodimerization (GFP with Venus) results in a complex with ≈87% FRET efficiency, significantly below the 99.7% efficiency predicted. A similar efficiency is observed when the wild-type FPs are fused to a naturally occurring protein–protein interface system. GFP complexation with mCherry results in loss of mCherry fluorescence. Thus, simple assumptions used when monitoring interactions between proteins via FP FRET may not always hold true, especially under conditions whereby the protein–protein interactions promote FP interaction.},

  abstract     = {Herein, we demonstrate how to predict and experimentally validate phase diagrams for multi-component systems from a high-dimensional virtual space of all possible phase diagrams involving several elements based on small existing experimental data. The experimental data for bulk phases for known systems represents a sampling from this space, and screening the space allows multi-component phase diagrams with given design criteria to be built. This approach uses machine learning methods to predict phase diagrams and Bayesian experimental design to minimize experiments for refinement and validation, all within an active learning loop. The approach is proven by predicting and synthesizing the ferroelectric ceramic system (1- ω )(Ba 0.61 Ca 0.28 Sr 0.11 TiO 3 )- ω (BaTi 0.888 Zr 0.0616 Sn 0.0028 Hf 0.0476 O 3 ) with a relatively high transition temperature and triple point, as well as the NiTi-based pseudo-binary phase diagram (1- ω )(Ti 0.309 Ni 0.485 Hf 0.20 Zr 0.006 )- ω (Ti 0.309 Ni 0.485 Hf 0.07 Zr 0.068 Nb 0.068 ) designed for high transition temperature ( ω ⩽ 1). Each phase diagram is validated and optimized through only three new experiments. The complexity of these compounds is beyond the reach of today&#39;s computational methods.},

  abstract     = {A novel quinoidal thienoisoindigo (TII)-containing small molecule family with dicyanomethylene end-capping units and various alkyl chains is synthesized as n-type organic small molecules for solution-processable organic field effect transistors (OFETs). The molecular structure of the 2-hexyldecyl substituted derivative, TIIQ-b16 , is determined via single-crystal X-ray diffraction and shows that the TIIQ core is planar and exhibits molecular layers stacked in a “face-to-face” arrangement with short core intermolecular distances of 3.28 Å. The very planar core structure, shortest intermolecular N···H distance (2.52 Å), existence of an intramolecular non-bonded contact between sulfur and oxygen atom (S···O) of 2.80 Å, and a very low-lying LUMO energy level of −4.16 eV suggest that TIIQ molecules should be electron transporting semiconductors. The physical, thermal, and electrochemical properties as well as OFET performance and thin film morphologies of these new TIIQ s are systematically studied. Thus, air-processed TIIQ-b16 OFETs exhibit an electron mobility up to 2.54 cm 2 V −1 s −1 with a current ON/OFF ratio of 10 5 –10 6 , which is the first demonstration of TII-based small molecules exhibiting unipolar electron transport characteristics and enhanced ambient stability. These results indicate that construction of quinoidal molecule from TII moiety is a successful approach to enhance n-type charge transport characteristics.},

Here, a new type of microscopy is introduced, which reveals the fine structure of an object through its far-field scattering pattern under illumination with light containing deeply subwavelength singularity features. The object is reconstructed by a neural network trained on a large number of scattering events. In numerical experiments on imaging of a dimer, resolving powers better than λ /200, i.e., two orders of magnitude beyond the conventional “diffraction limit” of λ /2, are demonstrated. It is shown that imaging is tolerant to noise and is achievable with low dynamic range light intensity detectors. Proof-of-principle experimental confirmation of DSTM is provided with a training set of small size, yet sufficient to achieve resolution five-fold better than the diffraction limit. In principle, deep learning reconstruction can be extended to objects of random shape and shall be particularly efficient in microscopy of a priori known shapes, such as those found in routine tasks of machine vision, smart manufacturing, and particle counting for life sciences applications.},

While much effort has been made on organic electrolyte batteries operating at low temperatures, the study on low-temperature ARMBs is still in its infancy. The challenge mainly comes from water freezing at subzero temperatures, resulting in dramatically retarded kinetics. Here, the freezing behavior of water and its effects on subzero performances of ARMBs are first discussed. Then all strategies used to enhance subzero temperature performances of ARMBs by associating them with battery kinetics are summarized. The subzero temperature performances of ARMBs and organic electrolyte batteries are compared.

First, the corresponding principles about O 2 evolution and some urgently encountered issues based on the fundamentals of photocatalytic water splitting are introduced. Then, several types of classical water oxidation photocatalysts, including TiO 2 , BiVO 4 , WO 3 , α -Fe 2 O 3 , and some newly developed ones, such as Sillén–Aurivillius perovskites, porphyrins, metal–organic frameworks, etc., are highlighted in detail, in terms of their crystal structures, synthetic approaches, and morphologies. Third, diverse strategies for O 2 evolution activity improvement via enhancing photoabsorption and charge separation are presented, including the cocatalysts loading, heterojunction construction, doping and vacancy formation, and other strategies. Finally, the key challenges and future prospects with regard to photocatalytic O 2 evolution are proposed.

  abstract     = {Strain induced by lattice distortion is one of the key factors that affect the photovoltaic performance via increasing defect densities. The unsatisfied power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solar cells based on antimony chalcogenides (Sb-Chs) are owing to their photoexcited carriers being self-trapped by the distortion of Sb 2 S 3 lattice. However, strain behavior in Sb-Chs-based solar cells has not been investigated. Here, strain tuning in Sb-Chs is demonstrated by simultaneously replacing Sb and S with larger Bi and I ions, respectively. Bi/I codoped Sb 2 S 3 cells are fabricated using poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b&#39;]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-enzothiadiazole)] as the hole-transporting layer. Codoping reduced the bandgap and rendered a bigger tension strain (1.76 × 10 −4 ) to a relatively smaller compression strain (−1.29 × 10 −4 ). The 2.5 mol% BiI3 doped Sb 2 S 3 cell presented lower trap state energy level than the Sb 2 S 3 cell; moreover, this doping amount effectively passivated the trap states. This codoping shows a similar trend even in the low bandgap Sb 2 (S x Se 1-x ) 3 cell, resulting in 7.05% PCE under the standard illumination conditions (100 mW cm −2 ), which is one of the top efficiencies in solution processing Sb 2 (S x Se 1-x ) 3 solar cells. Furthermore, the doped cells present higher humidity, thermal and photo stability. This study provides a new strategy for stable Pb-free solar cells.},

For enabling the practical application of Li-metal as an anode according to energy demands, suppressing dendrite growth by controlling the Li-ion (Li + ) is crucial. In this study, metal–organic frameworks comprising bipyridinic nitrogen linker (M-bpyN) are proposed as 3-dimensional (3D) Li guiding matrix. The proposed approach creates ordered electronegative functional sites that enable the preoccupied Li + in the ordered bipyridine sites to produce isotropic Li growth. The Li guiding matrix containing 3D ordered bipyridinic N sites introduces preoccupied Li + sites that attract the Li growth direction, thereby suppressing the dendrite growth during the electrodeposition of Li. After applying the M-bpyN layers, stable lifespan of up to 900 cycles in the Li|M-bpyN|Cu cell and over 1500 h of operation in the Li|M-bpyN|Li symmetric cell is achieved. Moreover, the Li|M-bpyN|LiFePO 4 configuration shows a long cycle retention of 350 cycles at 0.5 C. These results indicate that an M-bpyN Li guiding matrix, which enables a uniform Li + flux by 3D ordered Li + -chelating sites, serve as a suitable host for Li + and enhance the performance of Li-metal electrodes.},

Referred to as “organs in a dish,” organoids are invaluable biological models for disease modeling or drug screening. Currently, organoid culture commonly relies on an expensive and undefined tumor-derived reconstituted basal membrane which hinders its application in high-throughput screening, regenerative medicine, and diagnostics. Here, we introduce a novel engineered plant-based nanocellulose hydrogel is introduced as a well-defined and low-cost matrix that supports organoid growth. Gels containing 0.1% nanocellulose fibers (99.9% water) are ionically crosslinked and present mechanical properties similar to the standard animal-based matrix. The regulation of the osmotic pressure is performed by a salt-free strategy, offering conditions for cell survival and proliferation. Cellulose nanofibers are functionalized with fibronectin-derived adhesive sites to provide the required microenvironment for small intestinal organoid growth and budding. Comparative transcriptomic profiling reveals a good correlation with transcriptome-wide gene expression pattern between organoids cultured in both materials, while differences are observed in stem cells-specific marker genes. These hydrogels are tunable and can be combined with laminin-1 and supplemented with insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) to optimize the culture conditions. Nanocellulose hydrogel emerges as a promising matrix for the growth of organoids.},

  abstract     = {Stem cell therapy is a promising strategy for cardiac repair. However, clinical efficacy is hampered by poor cell engraftment and the elusive repair mechanisms of the transplanted stem cells. The lung is a reservoir of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and a major biogenesis site for platelets. A strategy is sought to redirect lung resident stem cells to the injured heart for therapeutic repair after myocardial infarction (MI). To achieve this goal, CD34-CD42b platelet-targeting bispecific antibodies (PT-BsAbs) are designed to simultaneously recognize HSCs (via CD34) and platelets (via CD42b). After inhalation delivery, PT-BsAbs reach the lungs and conjoined HSCs and platelets. Due to the innate injury-finding ability of platelets, PT-BsAbs guide lung HSCs to the injured heart after MI. The redirected HSCs promote endogenous repair, leading to increased cardiac function. The repair mechanism involves angiomyogenesis and inflammation modulation. In addition, the inhalation route is superior to the intravenous route to deliver PT-BsAbs in terms of the HSCs’ homing ability and therapeutic benefits. This work demonstrates that this novel inhalable antibody therapy, which harnesses platelets derived from the lungs, contributes to potent stem cell redirection and heart repair. This strategy is safe and effective in a mouse model of MI.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasound constitutes a powerful means for materials processing. Similarly, a new field has emerged demonstrating the possibility for harnessing sound energy sources at considerably higher frequencies (10 MHz to 1 GHz) compared to conventional ultrasound (⩽3 MHz) for synthesizing and manipulating a variety of bulk, nanoscale, and biological materials. At these frequencies and the typical acoustic intensities employed, cavitation—which underpins most sonochemical or, more broadly, ultrasound-mediated processes—is largely absent, suggesting that altogether fundamentally different mechanisms are at play. Examples include the crystallization of novel morphologies or highly oriented structures; exfoliation of 2D quantum dots and nanosheets; polymer nanoparticle synthesis and encapsulation; and the possibility for manipulating the bandgap of 2D semiconducting materials or the lipid structure that makes up the cell membrane, the latter resulting in the ability to enhance intracellular molecular uptake. These fascinating examples reveal how the highly nonlinear electromechanical coupling associated with such high-frequency surface vibration gives rise to a variety of static and dynamic charge generation and transfer effects, in addition to molecular ordering, polarization, and assembly—remarkably, given the vast dimensional separation between the acoustic wavelength and characteristic molecular length scales, or between the MHz-order excitation frequencies and typical THz-order molecular vibration frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) devices and electronics are achieving maturity and directly competing or surpassing devices that use conventional materials. CNTs have demonstrated ballistic conduction, minimal scaling effects, high current capacity, low power requirements, and excellent optical/photonic properties; making them the ideal candidate for a new material to replace conventional materials in next-generation electronic and photonic systems. CNTs also demonstrate high stability and flexibility, allowing them to be used in flexible, printable, and/or biocompatible electronics. However, a major challenge to fully commercialize these devices is the scalable placement of CNTs into desired micro/nanopatterns and architectures to translate the superior properties of CNTs into macroscale devices. Precise and high throughput patterning becomes increasingly difficult at nanoscale resolution, but it is essential to fully realize the benefits of CNTs. The relatively long, high aspect ratio structures of CNTs must be preserved to maintain their functionalities, consequently making them more difficult to pattern than conventional materials like metals and polymers. This review comprehensively explores the recent development of innovative CNT patterning techniques with nanoscale lateral resolution. Each technique is critically analyzed and applications for the nanoscale-resolution approaches are demonstrated. Promising techniques and the challenges ahead for future devices and applications are discussed.},

Herein, the synchronized generation of sound and color is demonstrated for a stretchable sound-in-display device with electrodes of strain-insensitive silver nanowires (AgNWs) and emissive layers of field-induced inorganic electroluminescent (EL) phosphors. In this device, EL phosphors embedded in a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) emit light under alternating-current bias, while audible sound waves are simultaneously generated via DEA actuation along with input sound signals. The electroluminescence and sound-generation performances of the fabricated device are highly robust and reliable, being insensitive to stretch-release cycling because of the presence of the AgNW stretchable electrodes. The presented principle of integrating light emission and acoustic systems in a single stretchable device can be further expanded to realize sound-in-display electronics for IoT and human–machine interface applications.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging building unit, carbon dots (CDs) have been igniting the revolutionaries in the fields of optoelectronics, biomedicine, and bioimaging. However, the difficulty of synthesizing CDs in aqueous solution with full-spectrum emission severely hinders further investigation of their emission mechanism and their extensive applications in white light emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, the full-color-emission CDs with a unique structure consisting of sp 3 -hybridized carbon cores with small domains of partially sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms are reported. First-principle calculations are initially used to predict that the transformation from sp 3 to sp 2 hybridization redshifts the emission of CDs. Guided by the theoretical predictions, a simple, convenient, and controllable route to hydrothermally prepare CDs in a single reaction system is developed. The prepared CDs have full-spectrum emission with an unprecedented two-photon emission across the whole visible color range. These full-color-emission CDs can be further nurtured by slight modifications of the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pH) to generate the emission color from blue to red. Finally a flexible LEDs with full-color emission by using epoxy CDs films is developed, indicating that the strategy affords an industry translational potential over traditional fluorophores.},

  abstract     = {Polymers shape human life but they also have been identified as pollutants in the oceans due to their long lifetime and low degradability. Recently, various researchers have studied the impact of (micro)plastics on marine life, biodiversity, and potential toxicity. Even if the consequences are still heavily discussed, prevention of unnecessary waste is desired. Especially, newly designed polymers that degrade in seawater are discussed as potential alternatives to commodity polymers in certain applications. Biodegradable polymers that degrade in vivo (used for biomedical applications) or during composting often exhibit too slow degradation rates in seawater. To date, no comprehensive summary for the degradation performance of polymers in seawater has been reported, nor are the studies for seawater-degradation following uniform standards. This review summarizes concepts, mechanisms, and other factors affecting the degradation process in seawater of several biodegradable polymers or polymer blends. As most of such materials cannot degrade or degrade too slowly, strategies and innovative routes for the preparation of seawater-degradable polymers with rapid degradation in natural environments are reviewed. It is believed that this selection will help to further understand and drive the development of seawater-degradable polymers.},

  abstract     = {Patients suffering from heart failure often require circulatory support using ventricular assist devices (VADs). However, most existing VADs provide nonpulsatile flow, involve direct contact between the blood flow and the device&#39;s lumen and moving components, and require a driveline to connect to an external power source. These design features often lead to complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, device thrombosis, and driveline infections. Here, a concept of magnetically active cardiac patches (MACPs) that can potentially function as non-blood contacting, untethered pulsatile VADs inside a magnetic actuationsystem is reported. The MACPs, which are composed of permanent magnets and 3D-printed patches, are attached to the epicardial surfaces, thus avoiding direct contact with the blood flow. They provide powerful actuation assisting native heart pumping inside a magnetic actuation system. In ex vivo experiments on a healthy pig&#39;s heart, it is shown that the ventricular ejection fractions are as high as 37% in the left ventricle and 63% in the right ventricle. Non-blood contacting, untethered VADs can eliminate the risk of serious complications associated with existing devices, and provide an alternative solution for myocardial training and therapy for patients with heart failure.},

Metal peroxide based nanoparticles, as one of the important but generally ignored categories of metal-involved nanosystems, can function as the solid precursors to produce oxygen (O 2 ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) through simple chemical reactions, both of which are the important chemical species for enhancing the therapeutic outcome of versatile modalities, accompanied with the unique bioactivity of metal ion based components. This progress report summarizes and discusses the most representative paradigms of metal peroxides in chemoreactive nanomedicine, including copper peroxide (CuO 2 ), calcium peroxide (CaO 2 ), magnesium peroxide (MgO 2 ), zinc peroxide (ZnO 2 ), barium peroxide (BaO 2 ), and titanium peroxide (TiO x ) nanosystems. Their reactions and corresponding products have been broadly explored in versatile disease treatments, including catalytic nanotherapeutics, photodynamic therapy, radiation therapy, antibacterial infection, tissue regeneration, and some synergistically therapeutic applications. This progress report particularly focuses on the underlying reaction mechanisms on enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of these modalities, accompanied with the discussion on their biological effects and biosafety. The existing gap between fundamental research and clinical translation of these metal peroxide based nanotherapeutic technologies is finally discussed in depth.},
