  abstract     = {Based on the Lie symmetry method and taking the generalized time-fractional Burgers equations involving the Riemann–Liouville derivative for example, we propose a new similarity transformation which converts the time-fractional Burgers equation into a fractional ordinary differential equation without containing the Erdélyi–Kober fractional differential operator. Such type of reduced equations facilitates us to study the properties as well as construct analytical solutions. Consequently, we obtain an exact solution and a new power series solution of the time-fractional Burgers equation via the reduced equation.},

We suppose that these layers display a cellular microstructure with thin varying thickness. We suppose that, within the layers, the diffusion, reaction, and velocity coefficients admit random large-scale structures. Under mixing properties of the diffusion, reaction, and velocity processes, we study the asymptotic behavior of the problem with respect to a vanishing parameter describing the thickness of the layers. We derive the effective flux boundary condition on the surface of the fixed region which coincides with the lower surface of the layers. This flux boundary condition consists in a generalized nonlinear Robin condition involving some nonlocal random effects which emerge asymptotically due to the random fluctuations of the reactive transport parameters in the layers.},

Increasing model flexibility is often sought as a means to better describe asymmetric and heavy tail distributions. Such extensions were pioneered by the beta-G family. However, efficient (GoF) measures for the beta-G distributions are sought. In this paper, we combine probability weighted moments (PWMs) and the Mellin transform (MT) in order to furnish new qualitative and quantitative GoF tools for model selection within the beta-G class. We derive PWMs for the Fréchet and Kumaraswamy distributions, and we provide expressions for the MT, and for the log-cumulants (LC) of the beta-Weibull, beta-Fréchet, beta-Kumaraswamy, and beta-log-logistic distributions. Subsequently, we construct LC diagrams and, based on the Hotelling&#39;s T 2 statistic, we derive confidence ellipses for the LCs. Finally, the proposed GoF measures are applied on five real data sets in order to demonstrate their applicability.},

Yet little literature exists on the computation of these points. In this study, we investigate the properties of the mock-Chebyshev nodes and propose a subsetting method for constructing mock-Chebyshev grids. Moreover, we provide a precise formula for the cardinality of a satisfactory uniform grid. Some numerical experiments using the points obtained by the method are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and numerical results are also provided.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study an SIRS epidemic model with ratio-dependent incidence rate function describing the mechanisms of infectious disease transmission. Impacts of vaccination and treatment on the transmission dynamics of the disease have been explored. The treatment rate is constant when the number of infected individuals is greater than the maximal capacity of treatment and proportional to the number of infected individuals when the number of infected individuals is less than the maximal capacity of treatment. Analysis shows that (1) the sufficiently large value of the preventive vaccination rate can control the spread of disease, and (2) a threshold level of the psychological (or inhibitory) effects in the incidence rate function is enough to decrease the infective population. It is also obtained that model undergoes transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations with respect to disease contact rate. Moreover, in the presence of treatment strategy, the model has multiple endemic equilibria and undergoes a backward bifurcation. The maximal capacity of treatment plays important roles on the disease dynamics of the model. The number of infected individuals decreases with respect to the maximal capacity of treatment, and the disease completely dies out from the system for the large capacity of the treatment when constant treatment strategy is applied. Further, it is also found that the spread of disease can be suppressed by increasing treatment rate. From sensitivity analysis, we have observed that the transmission and treatment rates are most sensitive parameters. The effects of different parameters on the disease dynamics have also been investigated via numerical simulation.},

Then, under some sufficient conditions expressed by linear matrix inequality, a linear boundary output feedback controller only using boundary measurement is proposed such that the closed-loop system satisfies GES in absence of external disturbance and satisfies an H ∞ performance index when disturbance exists.

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to generalize some important spectral properties of classical periodic Sturm–Liouville problems to two-linked periodic problems with additional transmission conditions at an interior point of interaction, which have not been studied previously. Although the classical periodic Sturm–Liouville problem has infinitely many real eigenvalues, there are two-linked periodic Sturm–Liouville problems that have only a finite number of real eigenvalues. To show this, we construct a simple example of two-linked periodic Sturm–Liouville problem with transmission conditions having only one real eigenvalue. Using our own approach, we define the characteristic determinant of a new type, find simple conditions on the coefficients of the transmission conditions that guarantee the existence of an infinite number of real eigenvalues, and derive an asymptotic formula for the eigenvalues.},

  abstract     = {Coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), denoted CBB, is the most important insect pest of coffee worldwide, with a high impact on the economy of coffee producing countries. The insect spends a great part of its life cycle inside the coffee berry and causes severe crop losses. Biological control based on the use of an entomopathogenic fungus is a major alternative to chemical pesticides in order to control CBB. The fungus is sprayed on the coffee berries to kill CBB when the insects drill holes to penetrate inside the berries. Our aim in this work is to optimise the fungus application, using a modelling approach. We first formulate a mathematical model describing the infestation dynamics of coffee berries by CBB. We analyse the model and show that the stability of the pest-free and coexistence equilibria depends on the basic reproduction number. To introduce a control variable corresponding to the application of an entomopathogenic fungus, we then extend the model and include the fungus dynamics. We formulate an optimal problem which consists in maximising the coffee yield, while minimising the control cost, as well as the CBB population for the next cropping season. The existence of the optimal control and the necessary optimality condition are established using Pontryagin&#39;s Maximum Principle. The optimal control problem is solved numerically using the BOCOP software and simulations are provided, showing that the use of entomopathogenic fungus effectively controls CBB.},

We then demonstrate numerically on a T -periodic Poincaré map of the flow that these solutions are generally locally stable with large “islands” of initial conditions around them, within which the pull-in stability is completely avoided. We also demonstrate graphically on the Poincaré map that stable periodic solutions with higher period n T , n &gt; 1 also exist, for wide parameter ranges, with large “islands” of bounded motion around them, within which all initial conditions avoid the pull-in instability, thus helping us significantly increase the domain of safe operation of these MEMS models.},

Then, we deduce the Bäcklund transformation and Hirota bilinear equations of the equation. Finally, taking the two-component case as an example, we solve the soliton solutions and the rogue wave solutions in detail. By considering the figures of the weakly coupled rogue wave solutions, we can see that the figure corresponding to first component u is eye shaped, while the figure corresponding to the second component u ^ is butterfly shaped.},

The quantitative analysis of the model has been done in which the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points of the model have been discussed. Furthermore, the Hopf bifurcation analysis of the model has been done under the impact of time delay. The stability of the model has been studied with the reproduction number less than or greater than 1. The analysis of the model has been done by using the Laplace transformation technique. The analysis shows that the fractional-order model with a time delay can adequately enhance the elements and fortify the results for either stable or unstable criteria. All unstable cases in the nonlinear financial system are converted to stable cases for fractional order under neighborhood points. The reproduction ranges of all parameters have been discussed. The paper examines the impact of time delay and the importance of determining essential parameters such as saving amount by using Hopf bifurcation. Finally, numerical simulations have been carried out by MATLAB to illustrate our derived results. The financial system is verified under the theoretical outcomes from parameter estimation.},

Introduce the artificial boundaries and find the appropriate absorbing boundary conditions for the original problem, which lead to a bounded computational domain. Constructing the local absorbing boundary conditions on the artificial boundaries, the original problem defined on unbounded domain is reduced to an initial boundary value problem on the bounded computational domain, which can be efficiently solved by the finite difference method. The stability of the reduced problem with the local absorbing boundary conditions is rigorously analyzed by introducing a series of auxiliary variables.

  abstract     = {In this current work, we main to find the abundant explicit solutions of the Benney–Luke equation by a novel approach, which is called the variational direct method (VDM). The VDM based on the variational theory and Ritz-like method can reduce the order of the differential equation to make the equation simpler and obtain the optimal solution by the stationary conditions. The explicit solutions in terms of dark solitary, dark-like solitary, kinky-dark solitary, and periodic wave solutions are presented through the numerical results in the form of 3-D plot, 2-D curve, and 2-D contour. The results show that the VDM is simple, straightforward, and powerful, which is expected to open new perspectives for the traveling wave theory.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with boundary conditions (BCs) for a linearized hyperbolic moment system of the Boltzmann equation in one dimension. We show that even if the usual relaxation stability conditions and the Kreiss condition hold, there exists an exponentially increasing solution to the initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP) of the moment system. To clarify this problem, we check the generalized Kreiss condition (GKC) for hyperbolic relaxation systems. With the GKC, the stability of the moment system is proved by using an energy estimate together with the Laplace transformation. Moreover, under the GKC, we derive the reduced boundary conditions for the corresponding equilibrium system. Numerical results verify the convergence of the solution of the moment system to that of the equilibrium system with the derived BCs in the relaxation limit. Our analysis indicates that special attention should be paid when imposing boundary conditions for moment systems and the GKC should be respected to ensure the zero relaxation limit of the IBVP.},

  abstract     = {We consider the scattering problem for locally perturbed periodic penetrable dielectric layers, which is formulated in terms of the full vector-valued time-harmonic Maxwell&#39;s equations. By assuming a non-periodic right-hand side, or, a perturbation in the permittivity, one cannot reduce the problem to one periodic cell in the classical way. In this article we present a method to solve such scattering problems. For that, we apply the Floquet-Bloch transform to derive a coupled family of quasi-periodic problems and solve the individual quasi-periodic problems by combining some standard methods with technical calculations. This approach works as long as we stay away from the singularities in the quasi-periodicity of the Calderon operator, which we use for the boundary condition. The challenge is to prove the unique existence of the solutions for the quasi-periodicities inside the one-dimensional set for which the quasi-periodic differential operator is singular. The idea to tackle this problem is to construct a limit solution by letting the quasi-periodicity converge to a singularity while decomposing the quasi-periodic differential operator using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. Additionally, we show regularity results of the Floquet-Bloch transformed solution to the perturbed problem on the unbounded domain with respect to the quasi-periodicity mode. These results, i.e., contribute to a numerical method to approximate the solution to the unbounded domain problem, which we will describe in a forthcoming work.},

A new approach for a predator–prey interaction in the presence of prey social behavior has been considered. Our main topic in this work is to study the influence of the prey&#39;s herd shape on the predator–prey interaction in the presence of Leslie–Gower term. First of all, we examine briefly the system without spatial diffusion. By analyzing the distribution of the eigenvalues associated with the constant equilibria, the local stability of the equilibrium points and the existence of Hopf bifurcation have been investigated. Then, the spatiotemporal dynamics introduced by self-diffusion was determined, where the existence of the positive solution, Hopf bifurcation, Turing-driven instability, and Turing–Hopf bifurcation point have been derived. Further, the effect of the prey&#39;s herd shape rate on the prey and predator equilibrium densities as well as on the Hopf bifurcating points has been discussed. Finally, by using the normal form theory on the center manifold, the direction and stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions have also been obtained.

  abstract     = {In this work, we present basic results and applications of Stepanov pseudo-almost periodic functions with measure. Using only the continuity assumption, we prove a new composition result of μ -pseudo-almost periodic functions in Stepanov sense. Moreover, we present different applications to semilinear differential equations and inclusions with weak regular forcing terms in Banach spaces. We prove the existence and uniqueness of μ -pseudo-almost periodic solutions (in the strong sense) to a class of semilinear fractional inclusions and semilinear evolution equations respectively, provided that the nonlinear forcing terms are only Stepanov μ -pseudo-almost periodic in the first variable and not a uniformly strict contraction with respect to the second argument. Our results are obtained using the Meir–Keeler principle and the Banach fixed point principle respectively. Some examples of fractional and nonautonomous partial differential equations illustrating our theoretical results are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Variational method is important since it can reduce the order of the differential equation to make the equation simpler and obtain the optimal solution by the stationary condition. In this paper, we mainly study the complex nonlinear Fokas–Lenells equation (CNFLE), which is used to describe the propagation of short pulses in optical fibers. The traveling wave transformation is used to convert the CNFLE into the ODE, and the variational principle of the solution is obtained by the semi-inverse method. Based on the variational principle, the extended He′s variational method, which is based on the Ritz-like method, is employed to investigate the bright soliton, bright-like soliton, bright–dark soliton, and periodic wave solution. The absolute, real, and imaginary parts of the novel computational solutions are plotted through one example in the form of 3-D and 2-D contours. In addition, the physical explanation of the solutions is elaborated in detail. The results reveal that the variational method is straightforward, simple, and effective, which is expected to bring a light to the study of the traveling wave theory.},

Here, we give a survey of the available existence and asymptotic decays results for the resulting boundary value problem, the latter being a direct estimate of the scintillation decay time. We also show how to recover various approximated models which encompass also the two most used phenomenological models for scintillators, namely, the kinetic and diffusive ones. Also for these cases, we show, whenever it is possible, which existence and asymptotic decays estimate results are known to date.},

The novelty of the work lies in the application of these suggested schemes which were never used to solve the local fractional Laplace equation. The Laplace equation mainly contributes to electrostatistics, mechanical engineering, and theoretical physics. This equation also helps in formulation of the electrostatic problem of a rod under a torsion load. Moreover, it helps in handling potential field problems also. These aspects enhance the significance of getting a solution of the local fractional Laplace equation in fractal media. The suggested methods are copulation of local fractional homotopy perturbation method and local fractional homotopy analysis method with the local fractional Sumudu transform, respectively. The computational process indicates that the schemes are very efficient to obtain nondifferentiable solutions for given equations in a smooth way. Moreover, the solution analysis depicts that both the local fractional hybrid homotopy schemes are in a good agreement with each other. These methods depict the accuracy and efficiency of the implemented methods in view of correspondence with solutions obtained with other methods in previous works. The numerical simulations for obtained results are discussed for various values of order of a local fractional derivative. The 3D graphs on the Cantor set are constructed with the help of Matlab software.},

The quarantine strategy is one of the important intervention measures to control the spread of an epidemic by greatly minimizing the likelihood of contact between infected and susceptible individuals. In this study, we analyze the impact of various stochastic disturbances on the epidemic dynamics during the quarantine period. For this purpose, we present an SIQS epidemic model that incorporates the stochastic transmission and the Lévy noise in order to simulate both small and massive perturbations. Under appropriate conditions, some interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely, ergodicity, persistence in the mean, and extinction of the disease. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the stochastic noises. Our work improves many existing studies in the field of mathematical epidemiology and provides new techniques to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of epidemics.},

In this work, we have constructed two sets of nonlinear differential equations. One is representing the growth of three vital immune cells (T helper cells (type I and II) and activated NK cells) along with keratinocyte and the other set is for cytokines&#39; ( IL − 21 and IFN − γ ) dynamics. The hazardous effects of these cytokines, preconditions for disease persistence and validation of the stability criteria of endemic equilibrium have been studied analytically. We have also observed the effect of the combined biologic therapy (anti IFN − γ and IL − 21 inhibitor) by considering an optimal control problem. Analytical and numerical results reveal that the impact of activated NK cells on excessive formation of keratinocytes is mostly regulated by the effects of IL − 21 and IFN − γ .},

The solutions obtained by these mechanisms can be divided into solitary, singular, kink, single wave, combine behavior as well as hyperbolic, plane wave, and trigonometric solutions with arbitrary parameters. Some solutions have been exemplified by graphics to understand the physical meaning of the DNA model. The accomplished solutions seem with all essential constraint conditions, which are obligatory for them to subsist.

  abstract     = {The stability analysis of dynamic continuous structural system (DCSS) has often been investigated by discretizing it into several low-dimensional elements. The integrated results of all elements are employed to describe the whole dynamic behavior of DCSS. In this paper, DCSS is regarded as the complex dynamic network with the discretized elements as the dynamic nodes and the time-varying stiffness as the dynamic link relations between them, by which the DCSS can be regarded to be the large-scale system composed of the node subsystem (NS) and link subsystem (LS). Therefore, the dynamic model of DCSS is proposed as the combination of dynamic equations of NS and LS, in which their state variables are coupled mutually. By using the model, this paper investigates the stability of DCSS. The research results show that the state variables of NS and LS are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) associated with the synthesized coupling terms in LS. Finally, the simulation example is utilized to demonstrate the validity of method in this paper.},

Two types of boundary data are considered, that is, L p - and W 2 − 1/ p , p -data. It is shown in particular that the L p -norm of the velocity outside a vicinity of the boundary, after subtraction of the gradient of a certain harmonic function, is bounded by a constant times | λ | −1 ‖ b ‖ p .

  abstract     = {This article investigates game-theoretic approaches in a competitive supply chain model with imperfect production and a two-tier credit facility under the environment of carbon emissions. In this environment, we incorporate a manufacturer and two rival retailers who compete against one another for selling price and advertisement of a product, where the members offer trade credit facilities to the downstream players. We consider that the manufacturer invests in green technology to curtail the emission during the production and rework process. The retailers provide advertisements to expand their businesses, where market demands are dependent on their selling prices, advertisement frequencies, and the green innovation level. Here, we analyze the model under the cap-and-trade policy for various subcases of the centralized and decentralized systems and discuss a solution algorithm for the optimal results. For the practical feasibility test of the model, numerical analysis is examined, and the impact of variations of the critical parameters is studied. The study&#39;s primary motive is to figure out the optimal operative strategies and collaborative actions on the decision variables, which leads to the profits of the supply chain to a lofty extent. We observe that the offered credit periods are highly responsive to the profit functions so that the chain members have to be more careful and draw a compact plan for credit policy. Moreover, the manufacturer has to invest in green technology up to a certain level, as, after that level, high investment costs will hamper the optimal profit. Besides, the retailers must have adequate policies for selling prices and advertisement frequencies to acquire a higher yield.},

We will start with the one-dimensional case (in space). We point out that we may not apply in a straightforward way Duhamel&#39;s principle to deal with the source term since the coefficients of lower order terms make our model not invariant by time translation. On the contrary, we shall begin with the representation formula for the inhomogeneous equation with vanishing data by using a revised Duhamel&#39;s principle. Then, we will derive the representation of the solution in the homogeneous case with nontrivial data. After deriving the formula in the one-dimensional case, the classical approach by spherical means is used in order to deal with the odd-dimensional case. Finally, using the method of descent, the representation formula in the even-dimensional case is proved.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many authors studied the numerical solution of the classical Darboux problem in its integral form via two-dimensional nonlinear Volterra–Fredholm integral equation. In the present article, a numerical technique based on the Chebyshev wavelet is proposed to solve the Darboux problem directly without converting into a nonlinear Volterra–Fredholm integral equation. The proposed technique is different from the techniques discussed in the literature. The proposed approach produces higher accuracy than its counterpart techniques. The proposed scheme is illustrated with suitable examples to show the advantages in terms of its accuracy with a lesser grid size.},

This system describes the flow of a two-phase immiscible heat-conducting viscous compressible mixture. The phases are allowed to shrink or grow due to changes of density in the fluid and incorporates their transport with the current. We established the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for this system in 1D, which means no phase separation, vacuum, shock wave, mass, or heat or phase concentration will be developed in finite time, although the motion of the two-phase immiscible flow has large oscillations and the interaction between the hydrodynamic and phase-field effects is complex. Our result can be regarded as a natural generalization of the Kazhikhov–Shelukhin&#39;s result (Kazhikhov and Shelukhin, 1977) for the compressible single-phase flow with constant heat conductivity to the non-isentropic compressible immiscible two-phase flow with degenerate and nonlinear heat conductivity.},

The stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) is driven by additive Wiener process.

Using the linear functional of the noise, we construct two accelerated numerical methods, which achieve higher convergence orders. In particular, we achieve convergence rates approximately 1 for trace class noise and 1 2 for space-time white noise. These convergence orders are obtained under less regularity assumptions on the nonlinear drift function than those used in the literature for stochastic reaction–diffusion equations.

In both cases, we approximate R 0 by the largest eigenvalue R 0, n of a next-generation matrix, and we show the convergence of R 0, n to R 0 as the discretization index n increases to infinity.

Then, we have solved the extracted nonrelativistic equation for a charged particle with a PDM in quantum system under the magnetic and Aharonov–Bohm (AB) flux fields and Yukawa-like potential using the Frobenius series method. It is interesting that the obtained analytical solutions of the nonrelativistic equation have been expressed in terms of the biconfluent Heun function (BHF). Then, we have expanded the BHF as the power series and obtained a three-term recurrence relation between the successive coefficients of the power expansion. To investigate the nontrivial solution of the power expansion, we need to apply an explicit continued fraction equation for the coefficients of the recurrence relation. This relation must be satisfied in order to assure the series convergence. At the continuation, we have found two different conditions using the submitted lemmas. Then, using the obtained conditions, we have calculated the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the particle in the arbitrary point of the manifold. Finally, the canonical formalism is applied to compute different thermodynamic variables for the case of the higher temperatures. Also, we have discussed the special states on the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {A two-dimensional tumor-immune model with the time delay of the adaptive immune response is considered in this paper. The model is designed to account for the interaction between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and cancer cells on the surface of a solid tumor. The model considers the surface growth as a major growth pattern of solid tumors in order to describe the existence of necrotic kernels. The qualitative analysis shows that the immune-free equilibrium is unstable, and the behavior of positive equilibrium is closely related to the ratio of the immune killing rate to tumor volume growth rate. The positive equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the ratio is smaller than a critical value. Otherwise, the occurrence of the delay-driven Hopf bifurcation at the positive equilibrium is proved. Applying the center manifold reduction and normal form method, we obtain explicit formulas to determine the properties of the Hopf bifurcation. The global continuation of a local Hopf bifurcation is investigated based on the coincidence degree theory. The results reveal that the time of the adaptive immune system taken to response to tumors can lead to oscillation dynamics. We also carry out detailed numerical analysis for parameters and numerical simulations to illustrate our qualitative analysis. Numerically, we find that shorter immune response time can lead to longer patient survival time, and the period and amplitude of a stable periodic solution increase with the increasing immune response time. When CTLs recruitment rate and death rate vary, we show how the ratio of the immune killing rate to tumor volume growth rate and the first bifurcation value change numerically, which yields further insights to the tumor-immune dynamics.},

It is assumed that the composite shell is reinforced in the longitudinal axis and is also made from a polymeric matrix. Mechanical features of the constituents are obtained based on the modified rule of mixture, and they are considered to be temperature dependent (TD). Using the first-order shear deformation shell theory (FSDT) as well as von Kármán type of geometrical nonlinearity, the equilibrium mathematical relations are derived. Utilizing the dynamic relaxation (DR) procedure combined with the central finite difference method, these mathematical relations are solved in diverse boundary conditions. Finally, roles of carbon nanotube (CNT) distributions, boundary conditions, shell radius, thickness-to-radius ratios, volume fraction of CNTs, mechanical loads, thermal gradient, and temperature dependency are examined on the results. From the numerical results, it can be inferred that in the shell with the CC boundary condition, the FG-O distribution of nanotubes has the maximum deflection, and the lowest deflection belongs to the uniform distribution. However, in the SS boundary condition, the highest and lowest values of deflections are related to V and uniform distributions, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The finite element method (FEM), despite being a very powerful tool for solving partial differential equations, has never been used to compute the probability of ruin, nor it has been applied to other kinds of ruin-related problems, at least to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, in order to explore possible applications of the FEM in insurance mathematics, a high-order FEM is proposed to solve problems related to ruin. Specifically, a FEM based on either quadratic, cubic, or quartic polynomials is developed to compute the probability of ruin and the (discounted) expected value of the assets of a firm in two previously published ruin models. Moreover, when dealing with the calculation of the probability of ruin, a suitable operator splitting technique is employed, such that the FEM variational formulation is used to approximate only spatial derivatives. Numerical experiments are presented showing that the FEM performs extraordinarily well. In fact, the solutions of the two problems considered can be obtained with an error (in the maximum norm) of order 10 −5 or even smaller in a time smaller than a second. Finally, in accordance with already established theoretical results, the FEM reveals to be superconvergent at the boundaries of the finite elements.},

  abstract     = {Human behavior has always been played a crucial role in spread of emerging infectious diseases. To make changes in human behavior toward epidemic is very important step for controlling the infectious diseases. In this regard, many efforts have been done so far by media to aware the human population during disease outbreak. To understand the impact of media on vector-borne diseases, a vector-host model has been proposed. The model incorporates the effect of media in transmission rate, which is depending on the case number and its rate of change. This transforms the model into two switching subsystems with the switching surface, which is the function of susceptible human and infected mosquito population. The qualitative analysis of the two subsystems has been performed. The basic reproduction number has been computed. The cross validation (CV) has been performed to evaluate the model performance for the weekly Zika cases of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, USA. By using k -fold CV technique, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) has been computed to find the prediction accuracy of the model. Again, partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) of the parameters associated with switching surface ( S q ) have been computed that reveal the parameters associated with change in case numbers have more impact on S q than the case numbers only. Also, the parameters associated with mosquitoes dynamics are drawing more effect on S q than the parameters associated with human dynamics. Further, by numerical simulation, it is found that consideration of change in case numbers in transmission rate is more significant as it reduces the epidemic peak at the beginning of disease outbreak. However, the weights associated with mosquito dynamics is more important to consider as in absence of them, the infection level gets increased.},

The Raviart-Thomas mixed finite element method is one of the most prominent techniques to discretize the second-order wave equations; therefore, we apply this scheme for space discretization. Furthermore, an L 2 -in-space error estimate is presented for this mixed finite element approximation. Finally, the efficiency of the method is verified by a numerical example.},

The NLSE which models the light in single-mode nonlinear optical fibers propagation when the wave packet drift and attenuation are neglected has been studied. A stable implicit scheme is developed to solve this equation. The accuracy of this method is second order over both the space and time. By using von-Neumann stability analysis, we have proven that our scheme is unconditionally stable. Numerically, many tests have been proceeded to present the scheme robustness. It is proven that the mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. The interaction between solitons with different directions has been studied. The effects of the factors of chromatic dispersion and self-phase modulation on the solitons movement and conserved quantities as well as the relation between the factors have been discussed. It has been found that the physical parameters of self-phase modulation and chromatic dispersion impacts are beneficial especially for fiber optical investigations.},

Nevertheless, there exists another, which are transmitted from the mothers to offspring (vertical transmission). In this paper, the dynamics of an suceptible-infectious (SI) epidemic model are analyzed considering a linear (bilinear or standard) incidence in the deterministic and stochastic regimes, assuming that the newborns are infected from their own mothers. A long-term behavior of the proportion of infected individuals depending on the system parameters and initial conditions is established. Then, we consider the case where this linear transmission rate, not previously used for this model, has a stochastic component described by a white noise which leads to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the SDE is proved. The extinction of the disease is characterized, and an exponential decay to extinction is obtained under certain restrictions of the parameters. By assuming time-independent solutions of the Fokker-Plank equation, we determine a stationary measure of the probability density, and some of its properties are provided. Numerical simulations are performed to show the dynamics of the system in different regimes and to illustrate some differences between deterministic and stochastic effects.},

This signature is an array that includes information about the cycles of the map and the noncyclic elements, called transients, besides data about the insertion of the transients in the cycle. The transient elements form several tree shape graphs. Our characterization is a generalization of the known fact that two permutations are conjugated if and only if they have the same cycle structure. We use elementary facts about finite dynamical systems and about the canonical labeling of unordered trees.

The results agree with the intuitive expectation that extremely high heating rates followed by short equilibration time lead to a superheating and partial melting of the solid phase. The fraction of the remained crystalline clusters in the superheated phase depends on the superheating temperature T s and the equilibration time, as long as T s is below the maximal superheating. A subsequent fast cooling facilitates a substantial undercooling of the molten phase. The achieved undercooling ∆ T below the steady-state melting temperature T m depends on the size and the concentration of the crystalline clusters remained in the liquid phase, and thus on the initial superheating temperature T s . Based on the simulated results, a model was proposed for describing the relationship of Δ T and T s , with which simulated data are well fitted and the maximal undercooling for metals can be predicted.},

The presence of this parameter leads to boundary layer phenomena. These problems are also known as singularly perturbed problems. For these problems, it is well-known that one cannot achieve a convergent solution to maintain the boundary layer dynamics, on a fixed number of uniform meshes irrespective of the arbitrary magnitude of perturbation parameter. Here, we consider an adaptive graded mesh generation algorithm, which is based on an entropy function in conjunction with the classical difference schemes, to resolve the layer behavior. The advantage of the present algorithm is that it does not require to have any information about the location of the layer. Several examples are presented to show the high performance of the proposed algorithm.},

The conditions for obtaining periodic oscillations for the two cases were discussed, and results were simulated for small- and large-amplitude nonlinear oscillations. The results also cover periodic responses with bistable oscillations, which indicate the existence of bifurcation in phase transition. Furthermore, the error of the numerical solution and other published approximate analytical solutions were analyzed and discussed.

To explore translation-invariant generalized p -adic Gibbs measures, we describe the set of fixed points of the Ising-Potts mapping which appears by means of renormalization group. This description allows us to establish the phase transition. In the real setting, the phase transition yields the singularity of the limiting Gibbs measures. However, we show that the generalized p -adic Gibbs measures do not exhibit the mentioned type of singularity; this phenomena is called a strong phase transition.},

Considering the gyroscopic effect and nonlinear oil film force, the equations of motion are derived by employing the Lagrange equation. Then, the modal synthesis method and the Runge-Kutta method are adopted to obtain forced vibration responses of the spinning assembly.

  abstract     = {The developed model of diffusion-limited and diffusionless solidification of a eutectic alloy describes the relation “undercooling (Δ T )-velocity ( V )-interlamellar spacing (λ)” for two cases. Namely, when the solidification front velocity V is smaller than the solute diffusion speed in bulk liquid V D , V &lt; V D , the model predicts a regime of eutectic solidification similarly to known classical models. If the solidification front velocity V is higher than the diffusion speed, V &gt; V D , the solidification is mainly controlled by kinetic and thermal undercoolings. New expressions for the solute distribution coefficient and slope of the liquidus lines are supplied. The influence of the model parameters on the growth kinetics during eutectic solidification is discussed. Model predictions are compared with experimental data for the solidification of an Fe–B alloy with eutectic composition. Computational results show that the model agrees well with experimental data especially for low and high undercoolings, extending the undercooling range that can be covered by sharp interface modeling.},

Within the framework of the current paper, we present the analysis of the problem of directional crystallization of binary solutions or melts in the presence of a mushy layer, based on the consideration of field data under the prism of a modified formulation, which made it possible to obtain such characteristics of the behavior of the mushy zone as the thickness and growth rate of the solid phase, temperature distribution, and also to determine heat-conducting and latent heat flows. The simulation results are presented, including in the form of illustrative material; a good agreement was noted between the predicted values of the growth rates and temperature profiles of the mushy zone and the area of solid matter with the existing observations of young sea ice dynamics.},

The deformable double-well energy landscape is modeled by a parameterized double-well potential possessing two fixed degenerate minima and a constant barrier height, but a tunable shape of its walls which affects the confinement of the two wells. It is found that unlike bistable models involving the standard ϕ 4 -field model for which the transition in quantum tunneling is predicted to be strictly of second order, a parameterization of the double-well potential also favors a first-order transition occurring above a universal critical value of the shape deformability parameter. The partition function of the model is constructed within the framework of the transfer integral formalism, with emphasis on low-lying eigenstates of the transfer integral operator. Criteria for quasi-exact integrability of the partition function were formulated, in terms of the condition for possible existence of exact eigenstates of the transfer integral operator. The quasi-exact solvability condition is obtained analytically, and from this, some exact eigenstates are derived at several temperatures. The exact probability densities obtained from the analytical expressions of the ground state wavefunctions at different temperatures are found to be in excellent agreement with the probability density obtained from numerical simulations of the Fokker–Planck equation.},

This fact is explained by suppression of eutectic decomposition due to diffusionless (chemically partitionless) solidification beginning at a high but a finite growth velocity of crystals. A model considering the diffusionless growth is developed in the present work to analyze the atomic diffusion ahead of lamellar eutectic couples growing into supercooled liquid. A general solution of the model is presented from which two regimes are followed. The first presents a diffusion-limited regime with the existence of eutectic decomposition if the solid–liquid interface velocity is smaller than the characteristic diffusion speed in the bulk liquid. The second shows suppression of eutectic decomposition under diffusionless transformation from liquid to one-phase solid if the solid–liquid interface velocity overcomes characteristic diffusion speed in the bulk liquid.},

The model corresponds to a system undergoing phase transformation described with a partial differential equation of hyperbolic type. Such a model covers slow and rapid regimes of interface propagation at small and large driving forces during melting and solidification. The analysis is done for the evolution of atomic crystal lattices appearing from a metastable homogeneous liquid for the chemically pure system supercooled below its critical temperature. Numerical simulation of the system “Liquid - Body Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal lattice” allows us to formulate the hypothesis about the formation of metastable periodic solutions (atomic configurations which are not in the thermodynamic equilibrium) during the relaxation of atomic configurations to the stable equilibrium. These metastable states may be destroyed (or even avoided) due to the action of colored noise. Namely, considering spatiotemporal correlations of the atomic flux fluctuations, we have found that the temporal correlations promote selecting long-range atomic lattices, whereas the spatial correlations corresponding to the periodic structure scales decelerate such processes.},

A linear morphological stability analysis determining the marginal wavenumber is carried out. The new stability criterion is derived from the solvability theory and stability analysis. This selection criterion takes place in the regions of small undercooling. To describe a broader undercooling diapason, the obtained selection criterion, which describes the case of intense convection, is stitched together with the previously known selection criterion for the conductive-type boundary conditions. It is demonstrated that the stitched selection criterion well describes a broad diapason of experimental undercoolings.},

Since the PFC model describes transitions of the first and second order, we present a description of both transitions in a unified manner. We show how phase transitions of each order can be treated using specific analytical transformations. To justify the unified approach to description of the first- and second-order transformations, we provide results of numerical simulation of phase changes between homogeneous structure and Body Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal lattice.

We found an exact parametric solution to this problem using a modified time variable and the Laplace integral transform method. The distribution function of vaporizing drops as well as its moments, the temperature dynamics in gas, and the unvaporized mass of drops are found. The initial particle-radius distribution shifts to smaller particle radii with increasing the vaporization time. As this takes place, the temperature difference between the drops and gas decreases with time. It is shown that the heat of vaporization and initial total number of particles in the system substantially influence the dynamics of a polydisperse ensemble of liquid drops.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to present a unified mathematical modeling and description of the kinetics of magnetic nanoparticles phase condensation (conducting to the appearance of bulk elongated aggregates) under homogeneous permanent or alternating magnetic field. For such case, the aggregate growth rate usually takes the form dV / dt = G ( V ) ∆ ( t ), with V and t being the aggregate&#39;s volume and time, respectively, ∆ ( t )—the supersaturation of the nanoparticle suspension, and with the function G ( V ) depending on the precise configuration of the applied field. The Liouville equation for the aggregate size distribution function is solved by the method of characteristics. The solution is obtained in parametric form for an arbitrary function G ( V ), providing a general framework for any type of the applied magnetic field. In the particular case of low-frequency rotating magnetic field ( G ( V )~ V 2/3 ), an explicit expression of the distribution function is obtained, while the dimensionless average aggregate volume 〈 V 〉 is found by the method of moments allowing a complete decoupling of the system of equations for the statistical moments 〈 V n 〉 of the distribution function. Numerical examples are provided for the cases of permanent and low- or medium-frequency rotating fields. It is shown that in all cases, the average volume 〈 V 〉 only slightly depends on the relative width of the initial size distribution. Nevertheless, at any times, t &gt; 0, the size distribution shows a significant spreading around the average value 〈 V 〉, which increases progressively with time and achieves a final plateau at long times. This model can be helpful for several biomedical or environmental applications of magnetic nanoparticles in which the nanoparticle suspension undergoes a field-induced phase condensation.},

The nouvelle phenomena of noise-induced transitions from the equilibrium to the cycle in the bistability parametric zone and noise-induced excitement with the generation of spike oscillations in the monostability zone are found in the presence of N-shaped friction force. To study these phenomena numerically, we used the computations of random solutions, the phase trajectories and time series, the statistics of interspike intervals, and the mean square variations. To study these phenomena analytically, we applied the stochastic sensitivity function technique and the confidence domains method. This approach is used to predict the noise-induced transition from a “dormant volcano” state to the “active volcano” mode. From the physical point of view, the volcano is capable to become active under the influence of external noises in the friction force, which model various compositions and properties of volcanic rocks. What is more, the volcanic plug can pop out when its slipping becomes heavy, and the volcano can erupt.},

  abstract     = {The paper is devoted to investigating a Cauchy problem governed by nonclassical heat equation with involution. The problem is severely ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard by violating the continuous dependence upon the input Cauchy data. Therefore, in order to obtain a stable solution, we shall use a modified Pseudo-Parabolic Regularization Method. The main idea is to add a correction term by introducing a third-order derivation operator to formulate a sequence of well-posed problems that depend on a regularization parameter ε . Further, we show that the approximate problems are well posed, and we prove some convergence results.},

We replace the discontinuous nonlinearity by its multivalued convexification and obtain the corresponding Volterra–Hammerstein integral inclusion. We investigate the solvability of this inclusion using the properties of upper semicontinuous multivalued mappings with convex closed values. Based on these results, we study the solvability of an initial-prehistory problem for the former neural field equation with the Heaviside-type activation function. The application of multivalued analysis techniques allowed us to avoid some restrictive assumptions standardly used in the investigations of the solutions to neural field equations involving Heaviside-type activation functions.},

Then, we consider the same boundary value problem for the fractional hyperbolic heat equation. The fractional problem is solved using three different definitions of the fractional derivative: the Caputo fractional derivative and two recently defined alternative versions of this derivative, the Caputo–Fabrizio and the Atangana–Baleanu. A closed form of the solution is provided for each case. Finally, we compare the solutions of the fractional and the standard problem and show numerically that the solution of the standard hyperbolic heat equation can be retrieved from the solution of the fractional equation in the limit γ →2, where γ represents the exponent of the fractional derivative.},

  abstract     = {The variability of the data and the incomplete knowledge of the true physics require the incorporation of randomness into the formulation of mathematical models. In this setting, the deterministic numerical methods cannot capture the propagation of the uncertainty from the inputs to the model output. For some problems, such as the Burgers&#39; equation (simplification to understand properties of the Navier–Stokes equations), a small variation in the parameters causes nonnegligible changes in the output. Thus, suitable techniques for uncertainty quantification must be used. The generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method has been successfully applied to compute the location of the transition layer of the steady-state solution, when a small uncertainty is incorporated into the boundary. On the contrary, the classical perturbation method does not give reliable results, due to the uncertainty magnitude of the output. We propose a modification of the perturbation method that converges and is comparable with the gPC approach in terms of efficiency and rate of convergence. The method is even applicable when the input random parameters are dependent random variables.},

The sampling involves errors on the knowledge of the continuous signal due to the loss of information in the sampling procedure. In the present study, an analytical formulation of the L1-norm and L2-norm sampling error of a periodic signal is provided, which embodies the amplitude, phase, bias, and periodicity of the sampling error. According to the tests, the formulation was found to be stable for instability of the sampling rate up to ±10%. The analysis is then subsequently applied for case studies. (1) For the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow-On (GRACE-FO) monthly solutions the annual component was found to be affected by 2.49% of the signal content due to the sampling error. (2) For different realizations of the Hungarian Gravimetric Network, where it was found that with a spatial resolution of approximately 10 km, reliable features of the gravity up to 100 km cannot properly be described.},

We find that in the most general case the dynamical system of hyperbolic equations is invariant under the action of a four-dimensional Lie algebra, while the larger number of admitted Lie symmetries is 6. For each admitted Lie algebra the one-dimensional optimal system is derived which is applied for the determination of all the unique similarity transformations which lead to similarity solutions. Our results are compared with that of previous studies from where we see that most of the solutions presented in this study have not been found before in the literature.},

To consider the different fractional order transmission process, the two-compartmental fractional model has been proposed and studied. And it will be of great significance to find out a simple and efficient numerical method to solve the model and estimate model parameters. This work investigates two numerical methods of the two-compartmental fractional model using finite difference schemes, which are based on the shifted Grünwald–Letnikov approximate formula and L 1 formula, respectively. The hybrid Nelder–Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimization, denoted as NMSS–PSO, is provided to estimate the fractional model parameters. Comparison between the numerical solution and the solution by the numerical inverse Laplace transform method establishes the validity of the developed numerical algorithms. Then the influence of the order of fractional derivative on the drug amount in human body is also discussed. Finally, the two-compartmental fractional model is applied to fit the amiodarone pharmacokinetics data based on the NMSS–PSO algorithms. This work will be of importance for the development of fractional pharmacokinetics.},

The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.},

  abstract     = {We show in this paper a Lipschitz stability result for a crack inverse problem in half space. The direct problem is a Laplace equation with zero Neumann condition on the top boundary. The forcing term is a discontinuity across the crack. This formulation can be related to geological faults in elastic media or to irrotational incompressible flows in a half space minus an inner wall. The direct problem is well posed in an appropriate functional space. We study the related inverse problem where the jump across the crack is unknown, and more importantly, the geometry and the location of the crack are unknown. The data for the inverse problem are of Dirichlet type over a portion of the top boundary. We prove that this inverse problem is uniquely solvable under some assumptions on the geometry of the crack. The highlight of this paper is showing a stability result for this inverse problem. Assuming that the crack is planar, we show that reconstructing the plane containing the crack is Lipschitz stable despite the fact that the forcing term for the underlying PDE is unknown. This uniform stability result holds under the assumption that the forcing term is bounded above and the Dirichlet data are bounded below away from zero in appropriate norms.},

To understand the spatiotemporal dynamics in the vicinity of the Turing–Hopf bifurcation point, we calculate and analyze the normal form on the center manifold by analytical methods. A wealth of complex spatiotemporal dynamics near the degenerate point are obtained. It is proved that the system undergoes a codimension-2 Turing–Hopf bifurcation.

Secondly, we investigate the existence and attractivity of the positive ω -periodic solution for the dengue fever model. We also investigate the stability of ω -periodic solution. The theoretical results indicate that vertical transmission can enhance the persistence of dengue virus in spatially heterogeneous environments with time periodic when R 0 &gt; 1.

Motivated by this work, we introduce the Fourier–Bessel matrix transform (FBMT) containing Bessel matrix function of the first kind as a kernel. The corresponding inversion formula and several illustrative examples of this transform have been presented. A relation between the Laplace transform and the FBMT has been obtained. Furthermore, a convolution of the FBMT is constructed with some properties. In addition, some applications are proposed in the present research.

This is done by taking suitable linear combinations of the classical Gaussian hypergeometric function and its derivatives up to third-order and applying the Hadamard product (or convolution) formula for power series. The complex velocity potential and the stream function of two-dimensional potential flow problems over a circular cylinder using both sources with sink and two sources are treated by the methods developed in the present paper. We further determine the fluid flow produced by a single source and construct a univalent function so that the image of source/sink is also source/sink for a given complex potential. Finally, some plot simulations are provided to illustrate the different results of this work.},

Applying the umbral calculus convention method and the shift operator to these functions, these generating functions are investigated in many different aspects such as applications related to the finite calculus, combinatorial analysis, the chordal graph, number theory, and complex analysis especially partial fraction decomposition of rational functions associated with Laurent expansion. By using the falling factorial function and the Stirling numbers of the first kind, we also construct new families of generating functions for certain classes of higher order Apostol-type numbers and polynomials, the Bernoulli numbers and polynomials, the Fubini numbers, and others. Many different relations among these generating functions, difference equation including the Eulerian numbers, the shift operator, minimal polynomial, polynomial of the chordal graph, and other applications are given. Moreover, further remarks and comments on the results of this paper are presented.},

For the robust multiobjective fractional programming problem constructed in the robust approach, In fact, in the parametric Dinkelbach approach. We define for the given multiobjective fractional programming problem its corresponding parametric robust vector optimization problem. Then, we establish both necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for a feasible solution to be an -efficient solution (an approximate efficient solution) of the parametric robust vector optimization problem. Also we prove the relationship between ɛ-efficiency of the robust multiobjective fractional programming problem (and thus ɛ-efficiency of the considered uncertain multiobjective fractional programming problem) and -efficiency of its corresponding parametric robust vector optimization problem constructed in the Dinkelbach approach. In order to prove this result, we also use a scalarization method.

Several researchers have examined this family of functions, but no study has been conducted dealing with the fractional kinetic equation. A new representation proves useful to solve the fractional kinetic equation involving an extended k -gamma function. Particular cases involving the original gamma function are discussed as corollaries. Such an application of the gamma function is not possible by using known representations; nevertheless, using this representation, new fractional transform formulae are evaluated. A new representation is also worthwhile to compute new integrals of products of the extended k -gamma functions, proving to be reliable with known identities. Several distributional properties of the extended k -gamma function are also discussed using Fourier transform.},

The main purpose of this paper is to study the asymptotic stability of the stationary solutions under large initial perturbations. First, for the outflow problem, we show that the stationary solutions are asymptotically stable, provided that only the L 2 norm of initial perturbation is small. Next, for the inflow problem, we show asymptotic stability under a large initial perturbation in the H 1 norm. The main ingredient in the proofs is a careful analysis in order to control the growth induced by nonlinearities of the system in a priori estimates.},

In particular, the global stability of the steady-state solutions is described in weak competition case.},

The obtained unified dispersion relation is investigated taking into account the recently analyzed material contrast for layered plates with mixed stiff-soft layers of different material properties. The asymptotic formulae for the respective fields in addition to the determination of approximate equations of motions have also been presented. A comparative study with the symmetric plate is made; being a special case of the asymmetric plate under consideration. In the end, we provide some deductions and concluding remarks.},

This system was originally proposed by Keller and Segel to describe the aggregation phase of Dictyostelium discoideum cells in response to the secreted chemical signal cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), but the available analytical results are very limited by far. Considering system in a bounded smooth domain with Neumann boundary conditions, we establish the global boundedness of solutions in any dimensions with suitable general conditions on the signal-dependent motility functions, which are applicable to a wide class of motility functions. The existence/nonexistence of non-constant steady states is studied and abundant stationary profiles are found. Some open questions are outlined for further pursues. Our results demonstrate that the global boundedness and profile of stationary solutions to the Keller–Segel system with signal-dependent motilities depend on the decay rates of motility functions, space dimensions and the relation between the diffusive and chemotactic motilities, which makes the dynamics immensely wealthy.},

On the other hand, theoretical and numerical results are given for the model created for phytoplankton, which is of great importance in preventing global warming, and the biological model. Existence and uniqueness are discussed for the solutions of both models with the help of the fixed-point theorem under the Caputo operator. Additionally, the first-order convergent numerical technique which is accurate, conditionally stable, and convergent in obtaining the solution of fractional-order nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations is utilized to simulate the two governing models. Numerical simulations including different values of arbitrary order ρ indicate the righteousness of the conditions for phytoplankton, Jancor, Murrot, and Vekton populations to develop.},

We show that the solution asymptotically blows up in a thin region attached to the boundary and establishes the refined “near-field” and “far-field” expansions for the solutions with respect to the parameter. Moreover, we obtain the boundary concentration phenomenon of the net charge density, which mathematically confirms the physical description that the non-neutral phenomenon occurs near the charged surface. In addition, we revisit a charge-conserving Poisson-Boltzmann model for monovalent binary ions and establish a novel comparison for these two models.},

Secondly, we prove the global stability of traveling waves based on spectral analysis method, which reveals that the solutions of the initial values and the traveling waves are exponentially close. Thirdly, we obtain that the wave speed is unique by choosing suitable parameters to construct new upper and lower solutions, which shows that the bistable waves keep the uniqueness of the wave speeds in the case of nonlocal delays.

The stability and uniform convergence of the algorithm are investigated in detail. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical findings. Meanwhile, this method is also applicable to the nonlinear Volterra integral equations. Test problems which have non-smooth solutions are also considered, and our proposed method is efficient as some recent Krylov subspace methods such as LSQR and LSMR.},

The persons arrive one by one to the department and the balking and the retention of reneged person approaches are considered. There exists one server presents the service to these persons according to first-come, first-served (FCFS) discipline. An efficient and novel algorithm is presented to get the exact value of the probability of n persons in the department at any time interval. This algorithm depends on the Laplace transform to solve a probabilistic dynamical system of differential equations. By considering the exponential detection function and if the probability of the infected person in the department is equal to the probability of each one, then this algorithm is useful to obtain the detection probability of the infected one. Under steady state, the detection probability of the infected person is described. The usefulness of this model is illustrated for different capacities by using a numerical example to describe the behavior of probabilities of the persons in the department, the detection probabilities of the infected person as functions in time, and the mean time to detection.},

The model considered consists of two bonded elastic solids. The adhesive elastic layer between them is a thin interphase that is approximated, by asymptotic analysis, as an interface. The resulting interface model is in turn characterized by a typical spring-type linear elastic behavior. In this context and on a 1D configuration, we investigate a Carleman-type estimate that relates to a unique continuation principle. The proof is based on the construction of suitable weight functions: their gradients are non-zero, the jumps of the derivatives are positive across the interface, and the averages of the derivatives vanish. The design of such weight functions enables the control of the interface terms in the estimates. With this at hand, we establish a Lipschitz stability estimate for the inverse problem of identifying an interface stiffness parameter from measurements that are available on both sides of the external boundary.},

Because the numerical computations for this problem result in triple solutions, stability analysis is carried out to ascertain the stability and significance of these solutions.

Unlike the traditional domain decomposition algorithm, the coupled semilinear elliptic equation doesn&#39;t need to be solved directly. The strategy is to construct a set of nested finite element spaces, and subsequently solve some decoupled linear elliptic equations by using the domain decomposition method in each level space. Additionally, a small-scale coupled semilinear elliptic equation in a specially designed correction space will be solved. As the large-scale coupled semilinear elliptic equation doesn&#39;t need to be solved directly, there will be an improved efficiency as compared to the traditional domain decomposition method. Furthermore, as the domain decomposition method is only used to solve decoupled linear elliptic equations, any efficient algorithms designed for the associated linear elliptic equations can be incorporated in the proposed algorithm framework. Thus, the algorithm is highly flexible. Additionally, it can be theoretically proven that the proposed algorithm has very low requirements for the smoothness of nonlinear terms.},

There has been a great deal of research on sampling expansions of bandlimited signals in the LCT domain. However, results on error estimation and convergence analysis appear to be relatively rare, especially for multi-dimensional sampling series associated with the LCT. In this paper, we present error estimation and convergence analysis for two-dimensional (2D) sampling series in the LCT domain. Specifically, we first prove the absolute convergence and uniform convergence of 2D LCT sampling series. Then, we analyze truncation error estimates for uniformly sampling 2D bandlimited signals in the LCT domain, as well as deriving three truncation error bounds. Finally, our theoretical results are demonstrated by numerical examples.},

The fractional model of Bratu&#39;s equation plays an important role in electrospinning and vibration-electrospinning process. We have discussed the error analysis of proposed scheme. We have also provided the convergence of suggested approximate method. Numerical results are demonstrated for various order of fractional derivative. Error tables reveal the accuracy of the suggested scheme. The outcomes of the present investigation are compared with some known studied and detected that our approach is more efficient and accurate.},

For robust stability analysis of the closed loop system by the zero exclusion principle, the distance between the origin and the value set of the characteristic function needs to be checked. It is known that the outer vertices of this value set may change at some switching frequencies and the repetitive calculation of these vertices at switching frequencies leads to additional calculations. In this study initially, new necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed to check the robust stability of a delayed fractional order closed loop system. Then, a novel robust stability testing function is presented based on some vertices, which are fixed for all positive frequencies. Therefore, no additional calculation is needed to obtain the outer vertices of the characteristic function value set for any pair of the switching frequencies. Also, a finite frequency range is presented to reduce the computational cost noticeably. Eventually, three numerical examples are given to verify the efficiency of the results of this paper.},

  abstract     = {Biexponential time-series models commonly find use in biophysics, biochemistry and pharmacokinetics. Indeed, reactions that are described by biexponential functions are typical for many biological processes. The kinetics of these reactions are modelled by transcendental irrational equations interconnecting the reagent concentrations, time and rate constants. The biexponential is apparently a case of nonlinear regression, and as such, very often the estimate of its parameters is obtained with methods and software tools performing nonlinear fits. The first problem that the user encounters when using these techniques consists in having to provide the software with a not too inaccurate estimate of the intervals within which the parameters can vary. Providing arbitrary initial guesses on the parameter ranges to the nonlinear fit procedure causes its nonconvergence. The second problem is the need to obtain an estimate of the parameters with an error interval due to the propagation of the experimental error that affects the measurements of the dependent variable. In this study, we propose an extension of a well-established mathematical method based on linearization techniques of integral equations for the efficient and unsupervised estimation of the parameters of a biexponential function. Our extension consists in the integration of a model of error propagation from the measurements of the dependent variable to the parameter estimates. There are three main innovative contributions of this work: (1) having made the unsupervised regression method available in experimental practical applications; (2) having provided methods for error propagation in complex operations, such as integration, matrix inversion and multiplication; (3) the calibration of the biexponential dynamics of (i) water desorption of a small ligand from a surface where two types of binding sites are present and (ii) of the decrease of a determinant of viability of organs sustaining ischaemic injury before transplantation.},

The problem arises from the study of an idealized electrically actuated MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) device, when the ends of the device are attached or pinned to a cantilever. Initially, the steady-state problem is investigated estimates of the pull-in voltage are derived. In particular, a Pohožaev&#39;s type identity is also obtained, which then facilitates the derivation of an estimate of the pull-in voltage for radially symmetric N -dimensional domains. Next a detailed study of the time-dependent problem is delivered and global-in-time as well as quenching results are obtained for generic and radially symmetric domains. The current work closes with a numerical investigation of the presented nonlocal model via an adaptive numerical method. Various numerical experiments are presented, verifying the previously derived analytical results as well as providing new insights on the qualitative behavior of the studied nonlocal model.},

This point can be assumed as a clear proof of the importance of studying such problems from various aspects such as computational mathematical models. In this contribution, we examine a mathematical model to investigate the prevalence of an infectious disease in a prey and predator system, including three subpopulations through a fractional system of nonlinear equations. The model characterizes a possible interaction between predator and prey where infectious disease outbreaks in a community. Further, the prey population is divided into two: susceptible and the infected population. This model involves the Caputo-Fabrizio derivative. One of the basic features of this type of derivative is the use of a non-singular (exponential) kernel, which increases its ability to describe phenomena compared to other existing operators. To the best of the author&#39;s knowledge, the use of fractional derivative operators for this model has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the presented results can be considered as new and interesting results for this model. In some of the acquired simulations, the chaotic behaviors are clearly detectable.},

The local stability conditions of positive equilibrium point is established by using Routh–Hurwitz criterion. Then, the conditions for generating Hopf bifurcation are studied. In the end, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.},

To do this, we explore equivalent mixed variational formulations and prove the well-posedness of some transmission problems for the anisotropic Stokes system in Lipschitz domains of ℝ n , with the given data in L 2 -based weighted Sobolev spaces. These results are used to define the volume (Newtonian) and layer potentials and to obtain their properties. Then, we analyze the well-posedness of the exterior Dirichlet and Neumann problems for the anisotropic Stokes system with L ∞ symmetrically elliptic tensor coefficient by representing their solutions in terms of the obtained volume and layer potentials.},

Also, based upon our proposed concepts, we state and prove a set of new Korovkin-type approximation theorems for a martingale sequence over a Banach space. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approximation theorems effectively extend and improve most (if not all) of the previously existing results (both in statistical and classical versions). Finally, by using the generalized Bernstein polynomials, we present an illustrative example of a martingale sequence in order to demonstrate that our established theorems are quite stronger than the traditional and statistical versions of different theorems existing in the literature. We also suggest a direction for future researches on this subject, which are based upon the basic (or q -) calculus, but not upon the trivial and inconsequential variations involving the so-called ( p , q )-calculus.},

Secondly, the locally and globally asymptotical stability of the disease-free equilibrium point and the endemic equilibrium point are investigated by using Lyapunov functions and Kirchhoff&#39;s matrix tree theorem. If ℛ 0 &lt; 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease will die out. If ℛ 0 &gt; 1 , the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.

Meanwhile, the interface between two flows is a smooth free interface, which is determined uniquely by the mass fluxes of incoming flows. Second, by using the blowup argument, we establish the asymptotic behaviors for the stream function. Finally, we prove that the position of free interface can be determined uniquely by the mass fluxes of incoming flows.

First, we derive a sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of this problem based on the maximum norm. It is observed that the condition depends on the domain of definition of the problem. Thereafter, we show that this condition will be independent of the domain of definition based on an equivalent weighted maximum norm. In addition, we have also provided a procedure to extend the existence and uniqueness of the solution in its domain of definition by partitioning it. We also derive a sufficient condition under which the model problem will provide an analytic solution. Next, we introduce an operator-based parameterized method to generate an approximate solution of this problem. Convergence analysis of this approach is established here. Next, we have optimized this solution based on least square method. For this, residual minimization is used to obtain the optimal values of the auxiliary parameter. In addition, we have also provided an error bound based on this technique. Several numerical examples are produced to clarify the effective behavior of the convergence of the present method. Comparison of the standard method and optimized method based on residual minimization signify the better accuracy of modified one.

One of the most typical treatments for COVID-19 is social distancing, which includes lockdown; it will help to decrease the number of contacts for undiagnosed individuals. The main aim of this article is to construct and evaluate a fractional-order COVID-19 epidemic model with quarantine and social distancing. Laplace homotopy analysis method is used for a system of fractional differential equation (FDEs) with Caputo and Atangana–Baleanu–Caputo (ABC) fractional derivative. By applying the ABC and Caputo derivative, the numerical solution for fractional-order COVID-19 epidemic model is achieved. The uniqueness and existence of the solution is checked by Picard–Lindelof&#39;s method. The proposed fractional model is demonstrated by numerical simulation which is useful for the government to control the spread of disease in a practical way.},

In particular, the presented existence results are implied by choosing sufficient small time steps locally. Furthermore, the established existence results are independent of the local approximation order. Moreover, we will see that the proposed solution scheme is able to significantly reduce the number of iterations.

The objective is to force the state to be as close as possible to a desired state. Considering that the cost functional is discontinuous, which along with state constraint, we apply a new penalty functional to approximate the cost functional, in this case, so we first prove the existence of optimal control. Then we derive the necessary optimality conditions for the approximating optimal control problem. Finally, the necessary optimality conditions is obtained by considering the limits of the results for the approximating optimal control problem.},

Currently, there is no vaccine for this disease, and because of this, containing COVID-19 is not an easy task. It is noticed that elderly people got severely affected by this disease specially in Europe. In the present paper, we propose and analyze a mathematical model for COVID-19 virus transmission by dividing whole population in old and young groups. We find disease-free equilibrium and the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ). We estimate the parameter corresponding to rate of transmission and rate of detection of COVID-19 using real data from Italy and Spain by least square method. We also perform sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters which influence the basic reproduction number and hence regulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Finally, we extend our proposed model to optimal control problem to explore the best cost-effective and time-dependent control strategies that can reduce the number of infectives in a specified interval of time.},

Here we demonstrate this approach as it applies to the operators with three-parameter Mittag-Leffler kernels defined by Prabhakar in 1971. By considering the general such operator as a class, we are able to better understand its fundamental nature and the different special cases that emerge. In particular, we show that many other named models of fractional calculus can fit within the class of operators defined by Prabhakar and that this class contains both singular and nonsingular operators together. We characterise completely the cases in which these operators are singular or nonsingular and the cases in which they can be written as finite or infinite sums of Riemann–Liouville differintegrals, to obtain finally a catalogue of subclasses with different types of properties.},

  abstract     = {In this research, we are interested in analyzing the behavior of a diffusive predator–prey model in the presence of predator rivalry and prey social behavior. The predator rivalry affects hugely the behavior of predator and the prey, so we are interested in analyzing the complex dynamics generated by the presence of predator harvesting and its influence on the behavior of the solution. For the mathematical purpose, we will concentrate on analyzing the system in the absence of diffusion where the existence of Hopf bifurcation is investigated; also, we proved that the presence of the time lags generates interesting patterns, which it can lead to instability even Hopf bifurcation. The stability of the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous periodic solution generated by the presence of Hopf bifurcation is established using the normal form. The mathematical obtained results are checked numerically using graphical representations.},

The analysis leads to the existence of weak (nonnegative) solutions in the special case of potential terms with critical frequency and a superlinear reaction term. In order to prove the existence result, we combine critical point theory of mountain pass type with related topological and variational methods. Basically, the approach is variational, but we do not impose any Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type condition for the superlinearity of the reaction. More specifically, we apply the Euler-Lagrange functional approach to the variational formulation of the above-mentioned model problem. We note that we work in the whole space and so we have to consider non-compact embeddings. This aspect constitutes an additional difficulty in our study.},

We focus on the case in which all populations have periodic logistic growth, if isolated, and no competition occurs between predators. Our main purpose is to study the asymptotic properties of the solutions of this reaction–diffusion model. More specifically, suitable conditions, depending on the domain evolution function and the space dimension, are introduced leading to the extinction of one predator and the stable coexistence of the surviving predator and its prey. Their density, as time tends to infinity, tends to the periodic solution of the corresponding kinetic predator–prey model. Finally, the autonomous model on a fixed domain is treated.},

The purpose of the present paper is to obtain and analyze the numerical solutions of Modified Equal Width equation (MEW). This equation is one of those equations used to model nonlinear phenomena which has a significant role in several branches of science such as plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics and kinetics. Firstly, for the discretization of spatial derivatives, a fifth-order quintic B-spline based scheme is directly implemented. Secondly, a forward finite difference formula is applied for the temporal discretization of derivatives with respect to time. Simulation results establish the validity and applicability of the suggested technique for a wide range of nonlinear equations. Then, the newly obtained theoretical consequences are numerically justified by the simulations and test problems. These illustrative test problems are presented verifying the superiority of the newly presented scheme compared to other existing schemes and techniques. The suggested method with symbolic computational software such as, Matlab, is proven as an effective way to obtain the soliton solutions of several nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Finally, the newly obtained results are presented graphically to justify the approximate findings.},

The drug therapy consists of an intake of Interleukin-2 cytokines which boosts the effect of immunosuppressive cells on the autoimmune reaction. We also derive the macroscopic model relative to the kinetic system and study the wellposedness of the Cauchy problem for the corresponding system of equations. We formulate an optimal control problem relative to the model so that the quantity of both the self-reactive T cells that are produced in the body and the Interleukin-2 cytokines that are administrated is simultaneously minimized.

  abstract     = {A prey-predator model with two discrete delays incorporating Beddington-DeAngelis functional response is investigated. The positivity and boundedness of the solution of the delayed system have been discussed. Further, permanence of the system has been established under sufficient conditions which proves long-term survival of prey and predator population. The occurrence of periodic solutions in the system is confirmed via phenomenon of Hopf bifurcation with respect to both discrete delays. The properties of periodic solutions are determined by using central manifold and normal form theory. The supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs with respect to one delay parameter. The global stability of the system has been established for different combinations of delays. The numerical computation has also been performed to verify analytical results. The presence of delays in the system causes a wide range of complex dynamics, viz., limit cycles, quasi-periodicity, and chaos.},

First, the nonlinear integral-differential governing equation is established according to the variable fractional constitutive relation and geometrical relationship. Second, the nonlinear integral-differential governing equation is transformed into algebraic equations and solved by using the shifted Legendre polynomials. Furthermore, the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm are verified according to the mathematical example. A small value of the absolute error between numerical and accurate solution is obtained. Finally, the dynamic analysis of viscoelastic arch is investigated to determine the displacement at different times and positions. The displacement of the viscoelastic arch is compared under various loading (uniformly distributed load and linear load). The displacement of the viscoelastic arch of different materials under the same load conditions is also investigated.

Nevertheless, we obtain new results also for linear difference equations. Moreover, the combination of the presented results with previous ones shows that many useful equations are conditionally oscillatory.

To study the dynamic behavior of the obtained results, extensive numerical simulations are provided. We observe that the employed method is simple but quite efficient for determining the exact solutions of the problem in the local sense.

In addition, the resultant fractional equations avoid dimensional mismatching by using an auxiliary parameter. Furthermore, the nonnegativity of the solution, the equilibrium points, and their stability are studied. Additionally, we implement the model by a powerful approximation scheme based on the product-integration rule. Comparative results with the real experimental observations, happened in Cape Verde Islands from 1987 to 2014, verify that the new fractional model is more efficient than the pre-existent classical model with ordinary time derivatives. More to the point, the fractional order itself provides a degree of flexibility affecting the performance of the model, which is helpful to exhibit the hidden features of the disease transmission in an accurate, appropriate manner.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical modeling will allow us to make effective interventions by policy makers and determine a specific program for the country&#39;s health managers. In recent years, applications of differential equations of the fractional-order in biological and epidemic models have been significantly increased. In this paper, we consider a fractional-order SVEIR model, which represents the interaction of five distinct compartments of people in a community with an epidemic. To verify the well-posedness of the proposed fractional-order model, the existence and uniqueness of positive and bounded solutions have been explored. Also, through analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations, the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium are discussed. Further, by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions and LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle, the asymptotic stability of the different equilibrium points of the system is also investigated. In another part of the article, we investigate the basic reproduction number index corresponding to the model, which provides a good description of the epidemic model&#39;s global dynamics. It has been shown that whenever the basic reproduction number of a system is less than unity, the disease-free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. If indicator is greater than unity, then there exists a unique endemic equilibrium point that is globally asymptotically stable. Moreover, some numerical simulations are included to verify the theoretical achievement. These results provide good evidence for the implications of the theoretical results corresponding to the model.},

Based on POD technique, we then build a set of optimal POD bases maximizing the energy content in the original ensemble data, and in the new space spanned by the POD basis, we establish a low-order numerical model of reduced-order finite element (ROFE) formulation of the unsteady temperature field. And we prove the error estimates of the ROFE solutions of the unsteady temperature field. Finally, numerical tests are provided to simulate the temperature field of crushed stone clay under the natural pavement near the foundation of a stadium building in a frozen soil area of the northwest of Sichuan province in China.},

This treatment optimized solutions relying on the Sobolev spaces and Schmidt orthogonalization process that can be directly implemented to generate Fourier expansion at a rapid convergence rate, in which the arbitrary kernel functions satisfy Robin&#39;s homogeneous conditions. Furthermore, the solution is displayed in a fractional series formula in complete Hilbert spaces without any restrictive hypothesis on the desired issues. The effectiveness, validity, and potentiality of the proposed procedure are demonstrated by testing some applications. The graphical consequences indicate that the method is superior, accurate, and convenient in solving such fractional models.},

  abstract     = {It is currently established that for general heterogeneous media, the classical Fick law must be replaced by a nonlocal fractional differential operator. In such situations where anomalous diffusion occurs, the crucial difficulty is the identification of the correct orders of fractional differential operators. In the present paper, order identification of fractional differential operators is studied in the case of stationary and evolution partial differential equations. The novelty of our work is the determination of the exact problem satisfied by the derivative of the solution with respect to the differential order. More precisely, if the solution of our boundary value problem, with a fractional differential order α , is denoted by u ⁡ ( α ) , we show that d ⁢ u ⁡ ( α ) d α satisfies the same problem but with other source terms. Our new result allows to carry out an exact computation of the cost functional derivative with respect to to perform more accurate and efficient steepest descent minimization algorithms. It can also be applied in optimal control theory and for sensitivity analysis frameworks. Our method is illustrated in two situations: Fractional Poisson equation and Taylor-Couette flow problem with fractional time derivative.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a general theoretical framework to establish the time-space fractional derivative models for non-Fourier heat conduction. Similar to viscoelastic modeling in mechanics, some new heat conduction elements are proposed instead of mechanical ones. With different combinations of the thermal elements, the time-space fractional generalizations, such as the Kelvin-Voigt model, the Maxwell model, and the Zener model, are presented. In addition, it is possible to obtain the fractional derivative heat conduction equations from the corresponding transport equations. While incorporating the existing non-Fourier heat conduction models into the proposed theoretical framework, some new time-space fractional derivative models are presented. Finally, the nonlocal models considering the long-range heat fluxes are investigated and confirmed to be consistent with the proposed framework.},

By simply solving this FDΔE, series solutions can be obtained. To show the efficacy and accuracy of this method, three famous NFDΔE, i.e, fractional Lotka-Volterra equation, fractional discrete KdV equation and discretized fractional mKdV lattice equation, will be solved numerically via PIA. Also, comparison of numerical results for α =1 will be done with exact solutions, and their absolute error will also be provided. Graphical illustrations for different values of α will be given to establish the certainty of results. Also, to prove the proficiency among other methods, comparison with different numerical methods is given. Advantage of PIA is that nonlinear terms get vanished during the calculations of Taylor series expansion; therefore, less calculation effort can obtain comprehensive accurate solutions.},

Based on the designed disturbance observers, a uniform fractional-order sliding mode control is proposed. The proposed method can deal with the mismatched disturbances and has better control performance.

Because of the space property of dust plasma, (3 + 1)-dimensional modified Burgers equation is more suitable than low-dimensional equation to describe the dust ion-acoustic waves. Furthermore, applying the semi-inverse method and the fractional variational principle, time-fractional modified Burgers equation is given, which owns potential value for comprehending the propagation feature of dust ion-acoustic waves in three-dimensional space. Following, the conservation laws of the time-fractional modified Burgers equation are discussed by using the Noether method. Finally, the shock wave solutions of the new model is obtained with the help of the G ′ / G -expansion method; meanwhile, the radial basis function method is also used to get the numerical solutions of the (3 + 1)-dimensional time-fractional modified Burgers equation.},

Issues related to the drawback of ADM application to the Riemann problem are examined broadly and brought under the perspective of their mathematical and physical sources. We emphasize on the connection between ADM&#39;s weakness and approaches of characteristic curves choice to overcome this limitation. This combination is capable to deal with first-order PDEs, linear and quasi-linear, with nonsmooth or piecewise initial and boundary conditions. A validation of this combination is performed numerically. The ability of such combination is verified by investigating different Riemann problems. Results are demonstrated graphically, which reveals the effectiveness and convenience of this new approach.},

As a result, fractional derivatives of Faddeeva function, Gaussian function, and Dawson&#39;s integral are expressed as a weighted sum of complex scaled Gaussian and Dawson&#39;s integral. Error bounds for the approximations are provided. Another feature of the proposed method compared with the previous approaches is it can be extended to approximate partial derivatives with respect to the order of the fractional derivative that can be used in PDE constraint optimization problems.},

A discrete time delay is introduced in the model to justify the time taken for diagnosis of the disease. Existence and positivity of the solutions are investigated. Some interesting sufficient conditions that ensure the local asymptotic stability of infection-free and endemic steady states are studied. The fractional-order TB model undergoes Hopf bifurcation with respect to time delay and disease transmission rate. The presence of fractional order and time delay in the model improves the model behaviors and develops the stability results. A numerical example is provided to support our theoretical results.},

We use two optimization techniques to provide the optimal solution for the system because a unique solution for the singular system cannot be obtained due to the non-consistency of the IC. These two optimization techniques involve perturbations to the non-consistent IC, specifically, an l 2 perturbation (which seeks an optimal solution for the system in terms of least squares), and a second-order optimization technique at an l 1 minimum perturbation, (which includes an appropriate smoothing). Numerical examples are given to justify our theory. We use the Caputo ( C ) fractional derivative and two recently defined alternative versions of this derivative, the Caputo-Fabrizio ( C F ) and the Atangana-Baleanu ( A B ) fractional derivative.},

  abstract     = {This work attempts to present mathematical modeling of the dynamics of the hydroelastic system consisting of a hollow cylinder with inhomogeneous initial stresses and a compressible barotropic inviscid fluid which filled the interior of the cylinder. The motion of the cylinder is described with the 3D linearized theory of elastic waves in bodies with initial stresses; however, the flow of the fluid is described with the linearized Euler equations for compressible inviscid fluid. Formulations of the boundary conditions on the outer surface of the cylinder and compatibility conditions between the cylinder and fluid on the interior surface of the cylinder are presented. Concrete formulations are made for the axisymmetric case, and general aspects of the solution methods of the formulated problems are considered. Under these considerations, two types of problem are selected: (1) the axisymmetric longitudinal wave propagation and (2) fluid flow profile on the outer free surface of the cylinder—the “circular” radial moving load. Numerical results are presented and discussed for the first type of problem. In particular, it is established that the character of the influence of the inhomogeneous initial stresses on the wave propagation velocity in the hydroelastic system under consideration depends on the dimensionless wavenumber. The perspective of future investigations is also presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Taking into account the public health importance of the human papillomavirus (HPV) control in the future, it is mandatory to assess the effect of the vaccination campaigns on the control of HPV spread and the associated diseases using reliable mathematical models. We propose a computational random network model with the aim of studying the transmission dynamics of HPV infections. This model reflects the herd immunity effect in the heterosexual network more accurately than the classical models. We perform a sensitivity analysis of the sexual behavior changes consisting of increasing the number of men who have sex with men (MSM), increasing the frequency of the intercourses and increasing the number of sexual partners. We find that large changes in the sexual behavior, in some extent, only have minor effects on the decline of the HPV infections in women and men in the current vaccination campaign in Spain (vaccination of young girls with a coverage of 70%). Therefore, the current vaccination program in Spain is robust for the heterosexuals. However, we cannot say the same for MSM, where they do not benefit by the herd immunity effect of the vaccination of girls, and consequently, the circulation of the virus among them remains unchanged. A consequence of the present study is that the effect of other external factors that may affect the transmission dynamics of the HPV, for instance, the tourism or the immigration, does not influence the protection provided by the current Spanish vaccination program.},

Then, this definition was extended to a topological group X by replacing a linear functional G with an arbitrary additive function defined on a subgroup of the group of all X -valued sequences. Also, some new theorems in generalized setting were given, and some other theorems that had not been obtained for real functions were presented.

Three generalized thermoelasticity theories are considered: classical dynamical (CD), Lord and Shulman (LS), and dual-phase-lags (DPL). The equations governing the problem are presented considering the voids, photothermal, semiconducting, initial stress, and parameters concerning the theory of thermoelasticity in a generalized form. We applied the normal mode technique analysis to solve the algebraic system of equations in this phenomenon under suitable boundary conditions. The results showed that the photothermal, voids as a volume fraction, process of semiconductor, electromagnetic field, thermal relaxation times, and initial stress have a significant impact on the phenomenon. The physical quantities with some analytical comparisons are introduced analytically and displayed in graphs. A comparison was made between the obtained results and the works presented by others. If the volume fraction, electromagnetic field, and initial stress are neglected, the results obtained are deduced to Abo-Dahab and Lotfy as a special case from the present study. The results obtained with neglecting the external parameters, viz, electromagnetic field, initial stress, voids, and phase lags, and considering the Laplace transform technique agree with the results of other works.},

Mixed convection occurs when both forced and natural convection mechanisms act together. Mixed convection problems are categorized by Grashof number. This is also addressed as situations where both buoyant and pressure forces interact. Slip condition is considered at the boundary for the velocity. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) fluid is considered. Novel features of nanofluids like Brownian motion and thermophoresis diffusions are further addressed. Convective condition is imposed at the stretched boundary. Concentration of material particles is discussed with activation energy. Nonlinear partial differential equations are converted into ordinary ones via appropriate similarity transformations. The velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction, Nusselt number, and entropy generation are discussed numerically with the help of built-in-shooting method. Our obtained outcomes show that the velocity of material particles reduces against larger slip parameter and micropolar parameter. Temperature enhances for larger thermal Biot and Eckert numbers. Concentration of fluid particles is more versus solutal Biot number and activation energy parameter. Furthermore, entropy rate increases for higher values of micropolar fluid parameter and activation energy parameter while it declines against slip parameter.},

The bvp4c (built-in-shooting) technique is utilized to solve the governing equations for the entropy generation.

If every cofinite submodule of M has a g-radical supplement in M , then M is called a cofinitely g-radical supplemented module. In this work, some properties of cofinitely g-radical supplemented modules are investigated. It is clear that every cofinitely g-supplemented module is cofinitely g-radical supplemented. Hence, cofinitely g-radical supplemented modules are more general than cofinitely g-supplemented modules.},

For various predescribed tolerances in the accuracy of the approximation of the inverses, the obtained incomplete block-matrix factorizations are used to precondition the iterative methods as one-step stationary iterative (OSSI) method and biconjugate gradient stabilized method (BI-CGSTAB). Certain applications are conducted on M -matrices occurring from the discretization of two Dirichlet boundary value problems of Laplace&#39;s equation on a rectangle using finite difference method. Numerical results justify that the given incomplete block-matrix factorization of M -matrices using the two-step iterative method to approximate the inverse of diagonal pivoting block matrices at each stage of the recursion give robust preconditioners.

In order to achieve these results, some equipment like the Leibniz rule, the index law, the shift operator, and the power rule are set out in the frame of the discreet fractional calculus. We use all of these tools to the governing equation for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous situations. The major benefit of the fractional nabla operator is that it implements singular differential equations and converts them into fractional order equations.

Two new geometric invariants are presented to classify the singularities of generalized focal surfaces and evolutes. Much more importantly, we reveal the correspondence among the geometric invariants, the types of singularities on generalized focal surfaces and evolutes, the singularities of two kinds of evolutes, and the contact of with the osculating spheres.

In comparison to the traditional proof methods, the suggested method is easy because it does not require heavy estimations. Also, it is effective because it does not need some unnatural conditions, which are required for application of fixed-point theorems. Using these advantages of the suggested method, we prove that a semilinear system in a Hilbert space, which satisfies general conditions for the existence of its solution, steers any initial state to any final state from the domain of the system operator if its linear part is exactly controllable at every noninitial time moment, the nonlinear term is bounded, and the norm of the inverse of the Gramian increases as time goes to zero not faster than the reciprocal function. The obtained result is demonstrated on examples.},

We discuss the method of successive complementary expansion (SCEM) with asymptotics beyond all orders approach thinking and also scrutinise the solutions that already exist in the literature along with their advantages and drawbacks. In particular, we present an approach using techniques in exponential asymptotics that extends the SCEM for singular differential equations well beyond the leading-order terms and consider the interaction of small parameter in the solutions. We optimally truncate the divergent outer solution and do not eliminate the growing exponentials. Through this analysis, we show that the extended method exhibits more information, such as the effects of exponential smallness and Stokes lines, than the regular SCEM that cannot reveal the information from such singular differential equations.},

Besides, the mappings are a basic mathematical tool which is utilized in numerous areas of mathematics, other sciences, and their applications. But there is not any note on the mappings in the setting of N -soft set theory. To deal with these problems, firstly, we advance the concept of complement of an N -soft set and demonstrate that De Morgan&#39;s laws and double complementation law are satisfied in N -soft set theory according to this new definition. Then we present an idea of the N -soft mappings and investigate some of their properties. Also, we illustrate given properties with examples and counter examples.

  abstract     = {A mathematical model is developed for fluid flow, nutrient transport, and cell growth inside a bioreactor with a scaffold at the periphery and lumen at the centerline. The scaffold material is assumed to be deformable. In order to deal with the deformation of the solid phase and fluid phase inside the scaffold, biphasic mixture theory equations are adopted, which are derived from the theory of mixtures. The flow inside the lumen is governed by Stokes equation. Advection–diffusion–reaction equation is used for the mass balance of the nutrient within the scaffold region. Cell growth depends on the nutrient concentration and is expressed by the Contois equation that accounts for contact inhibition. We use lubrication approximation to reduce the system of hydrodynamic and nutrient transport equations. This leads to a coupled system of partial differential equations (PDEs) with time-dependent variables. Laplace transformation is used to deal with time-dependent terms, and Durbin&#39;s algorithm is used to retrieve the time dependency. We investigate the outreach of nutrients inside the scaffold region, which regulates the growth of cells at a particular time. Based on the available experimental data, we consider relevant reaction kinematics of the cells and observe the corresponding nutrient distribution inside the bioreactor. The factors that affect the nutrient concentration are lumen radius, porosity, and permeability of the scaffold, Thiele modulus, pressure gradient, and so forth. The total mass transfer rate is computed to understand the nutrient distribution across various regions of the bioreactor.},

  abstract     = {This paper attempts to solve the split common fixed point problem for demicontractive mappings. We give an accelerated hybrid projection algorithm that combines the hybrid projection method and the inertial technique. The strong convergence theorem of this algorithm is obtained under mild conditions by a self-adaptive step-size sequence, which does not need prior knowledge of the operator norm. Some numerical experiments in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are provided to illustrate the reliability and robustness of the algorithm and also to compare it with existing ones.},

  abstract     = {The total variation model performs very well for removing noise while preserving edges. However, it gives a piecewise constant solution which often leads to the staircase effect, consequently small details such as textures are filtered out in the denoising process. Fractional-order total variation method is one of the major approaches to overcome such drawbacks. Unlike their good quality of fractional order, all these methods use a fixed fractional order for the whole of the image. In this paper, a novel variable-order total fractional variation model is proposed for image denoising, in which the order of fractional derivative will be allocated automatically for each pixel based on the context of the image. This kind of selection is able to capture the edges and texture of the image simultaneously. In this regard, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the presented model. The split Bregman method is adapted to solve the model. Finally, the results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model that yielded good visual effects and a better signal-to-noise ratio.},

The convergence of one group in power series is determined by means of ratio tests for infinite series, while the other groups are designed to solve problems which admit finite-series solutions. Actually, we envisage periodic quasi-exactly solvable potentials for which the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is reduced to the Darboux equation. In general, finite- and infinite-series solutions are obtained from power series expansions for Heun&#39;s equation. However, we show that the Schrödinger equation admits additional finite-series expansions in terms of hypergeometric functions for a family of associated Lamé potentials used in band theory of solids.For each finite-series solution, we find as well four infinite-series expansions which are bounded and convergent for all values of the independent variable.},

The differential operational matrices of modified fractional Legendre wavelets are established by building the relations between the modified Legendre wavelets and modified polynomials functions. The original differential system is transferred into a linear algebraic system of equations by introducing the modified Legendre wavelet vectors and their fractional differential operational matrices. The obtained system can be easily solved by any mathematical technique and tool. The error analysis theorem of the system is detailed investigated by introducing the variables x and t and the parameters α and β .

  abstract     = {This research work is going to apply the homotopy perturbation method to solve the problem of flowing Newtonian fluid on a flat plate. For this purpose, initially, the problem, including the governing equations and boundary conditions, is defined, and after that, the considered assumptions to solve the defined problem are introduced. Next, the working principle of the homotopy perturbation method is described, and then, the way to obtain the analytical solution using the homotopy perturbation method is presented, and finally, the accuracy of the proposed analytical solution in comparison to the numerical approach is compared for validation. Both momentum and energy equations are solved. The maple software program is utilized for carrying out the mathematical calculations, while the validation is done using the profiles for stream function, velocity distribution, stress, and dimensionless temperature as the key indicators related to the solution. The conducted comparison shows that the analytical solution provided by the homotopy perturbation method is able to predict all the important performance criteria for the problem very well, and therefore, the homotopy perturbation method has a strong potential to be employed for providing the analytical solution for such problems.},

To calculate this pitch and this angle of pitch of the closed ruled surface of dimension ( k + 1), three different ruled surfaces are taken according to the rotation minimizing frame. Therefore, for these three different ruled surfaces, three different situations are found. Second, by taking any curve in four-dimensional Euclidean space, the closed ruled surface of this curve, its orthogonal trajectory, the pitch, and the angle of pitch of this closed ruled surface are obtained according to the rotation minimizing frame. Finally, the pitch and the angle of pitch of the closed ruled surface of dimension ( k + 1) are generalized to n- dimensional Euclidean space with the help of the rotation minimizing frame.},

The polyharmonic spline radial basis function pseudo-spectral method is implemented on nonuniform grids for numerical simulation of the problem. The dimensionless governing equations are adopted in stream function-vorticity formulation. In the geometry of the problem as a unit square cavity, the right wall is open, the top wall is the cold wall including a cold fin, the bottom wall is the hot wall involving a hot fin, and the left wall is adiabatic. The uniform partial magnetic field is assumed to be vertically applied. The presence of both fins and the partial magnetic field reduces the convective heat transfer. The rise in both Hartmann number and radiation parameter suppresses the temperature gradient along the right bottom part of the cavity. Fins and partial magnetic field can be used as controlling structures for fluid flow and heat transfer in such a Rayleigh-Benard type problem.},

And a tax is imposed in the process of harvesting. To begin with, boundeness of the system is discussed. Following this, we studied the existence of the possible equilibrium along with their local stability for both of the unexploited system (8) and exploited system (5). After that, we analyzed the global stability of the positive equilibrium of the exploited system and how the tax τ affects the positive equilibrium. Then, the optimal tax policy is obtained by using the Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to support the analytical findings.},

For this, first, it is defined as a growth velocity in the direction of the Darboux vector at every point on a spatial non-null curve in three-dimensional Lorentz–Minkowski spacetime. Second, accretive surface growth is presented through quaternions. With the help of the quaternionic form of the growth model, we reach that a point (cell tract) on the accretive surface makes a homothetic motion.

Specifically, a variant of non-integer fractional derivative known as Antangana–Baleanu fractional derivative is applied on one-dimensional advection diffusion equation to obtain a fractional model for the contaminant transport in soils. This fractional model is examined under the hypothesis of initial and generalized Robin type boundary conditions. The analytical expression of solution for contaminant transport in soil is derived for the fractional initial-boundary value problem for partial differential equation (PDE) of mixed type using integral transforms, namely, Laplace and finite sine–cosine Fourier transforms. The solution of the ordinary advection diffusion equation arises as a case of the obtained solution. The numerical results are obtained for initial concentrated loading and Heaviside unit step function as a boundary conditions, from the analytical solution for various parameters of interest, and the corresponding graphs are plotted with the help of software MATHCAD. The graphs illustrate that the memory effects are remarkable for small values of time and ordinary for large values of the time.},

Using the Euler formula, functional equation method for generating function, and differential operator technique, we give relations among parametric Hermite-based Milne–Thomson type polynomials, the Bernoulli numbers, the Euler numbers, the Chebyshev polynomials, the Bernstein basis functions, homogeneous harmonic polynomials, and parametric kinds of Apostol type polynomials. Moreover, some computational formulas for these polynomials are derived. Finally, using Wolfram Mathematica version 12.0, some of these polynomials and their generating functions are illustrated by their plots under the special conditions. Potential relationships and connections of this paper&#39;s results with the results of previous and future research are pointed out.},

The shifted Vieta-Fibonacci (VF) polynomials are generated and adopted to establish a simple and accurate numerical method for solving this equation. To this end, the operational matrices of ordinary and FF derivatives of these polynomials are obtained in explicit forms. These matrices together with the series expansion of the shifted VF polynomials are mutually utilized to convert the original equation into a system of algebraic equations which is much easier. Some numerical examples are examined to show the power and accuracy of the method.},

The proposed method uses a multistep, second-order temporal discretization with a finite element (FE) spatial discretization in such a way that the resulting algorithm is linear at each time level and decouples the evolution equations from the velocity filter step. Since the indicator function chosen in this model is mathematically based on approximation theory, the proposed numerical algorithm can be analyzed robustly, i.e., the stability and convergence of the method is provable. A series of numerical tests are carried out to verify the theoretical convergence rates and to compare the algorithm with direct numerical simulation and the usual Leray- α model of the flow problem.},

A comparative study of the streamlines, velocity components, and microrotation components is presented for two types of the boundary value problems. In case of boundary value problem with continuity of tangential stress, streamlines have circulatory behavior inside the porous cylinder whereas, streamlines have non-circulatory nature in case of boundary value problem with continuity of couple stress.},

In this paper, we characterize the quaternionic Banach spaces such that the quaternionic operator valued Fourier transforms satisfy the Hausdorff-Young inequalities. Then, with these Banach spaces, the vector-valued Pitt inequalities are generalized to the quaternion setting. We also show that the Mikhlin type multiplier theorems can be transplanted to this setting.

  abstract     = {The main aim of this study is to analyze the dynamical properties of hepatitis B-type virus (HBV) infection in terms of mathematical model. The presented mathematical model on HBV involves the various factors such as immune impairment, total carrying capacity, logistic growth term, and antiretroviral therapies. In addition, the effect of time delays is also considered into the model, which are inevitable during the activation of immune response and time taken to infect the healthy cells. Mathematically, the qualitative analyses such as stability, bifurcation, and stabilization analysis are performed to explore the dynamical characteristics of HBV over the period of time. The significance of the model parameters is revealed through Hopf-type bifurcation analysis and the global stability analysis of the proposed model. With the help of data set values that are extracted from the literature, the efficiency of the derived theoretical results is explored.},

  abstract     = {Full waveform seismic inversion (FWI) in the viscoelastic regime entails the task of identifying parameters in the viscoelastic wave equation from partial waveform measurements. Traditionally, one frames this nonlinear problem as an operator equation for the parameter-to-state map. Alternatively, in an all-at-once approach, one augments the nonlinear operator by the viscoelastic wave equation as an additional component and considers the states as additional variables. Hence, parameters and states are sought for simultaneously. In this article, we give a mathematically rigorous all-at-once version of FWI in a functional analytical formulation. Further, the corresponding nonlinear map is shown to be Fréchet differentiable, and the adjoint operator of the Fréchet derivative is given in an explicit way suitable for implementation in a Newton-type/gradient-based regularization scheme.},

The integral kernel is represented as a Fourier-Jacobi series. The solution is represented as a Neumann series of Bessel functions uniformly convergent with respect to ω . For the coefficients of the series convenient for numerical computation recurrent integration formulas are obtained. The new representation improves the ones previously obtained by the authors for large values of ω and ℓ and for noninteger values of ℓ . The results are based on application of several ideas from the classical transmutation (transformation) operator theory, asymptotic formulas for the solution, results connecting the decay rate of the Fourier transform with the smoothness of a function, the Paley-Wiener theorem, and some results from constructive approximation theory. We show that the analytical representation obtained among other possible applications offers a simple and efficient numerical method able to compute large sets of eigendata with a nondeteriorating accuracy.},

Due to the application of phase lags τ Ω , τ Θ satisfying τ Ω &gt; τ Θ , the finite speed of thermal wave propagation has been achieved. The corresponding governing equations of motion and stresses have been considered in two-dimensional bounded spherical domain. The spherical boundaries are assumed to be traction free. The Laplace and the Legendre integral transforms have been applied to obtain the analytical solutions of conductive and thermodynamical temperatures, displacement components, and thermal stresses.

  abstract     = {The long-time behavior of flows is a very interesting and important problem in the theory of stochastic hydrodynamic equations. Inspired by the theory of dynamic system, we develop a new method to the study of the pathwise exponential behavior of 3D stochastic primitive equations driven by fractional Brownian motion. That is, we show that the weak solutions to the 3D stochastic primitive equations converge exponentially to the unique stationary solution. The result and method presented in this article can be widely applied to the study of long-time behavior of other hydrodynamic equations with noises including Brownian motion and Lévy noise.},

The fractional Schrödinger–Boussinesq (FSB) and fractional generalized Zakharov (FGZ) equations are analyzed in the present framework using fractional natural decomposition method (FNDM). The hired technique is graceful amalgamations of natural transform technique with Adomian decomposition scheme. Three different cases are considered, one with FSB equations and two cases are associated with FGZ equations with different initial conditions. To validate and illustrate the proficiency of the projected solution procedure, we analyzed the projected model in terms of fractional order. Further, we captured the nature of FNDM results for different values of fractional order in terms of the plots. The considered scheme is highly effective and structured while examining nonlinear models and which can be observed and confirmed from the obtained results. Moreover, the plots show that the hired fractional operator and algorithm can help to exemplify the more fascinating properties of the complex system associated with real-world problems.},

The effect of distinct irregularity parameters on displacement and microrotational fields of reflected wave has been analysed numerically and graphically. The deduced microrotational fields due to scattering and reflection phenomena in irregular layered structure with microrotations serve as highlights of the present work which may find their application in seismic prediction, acoustic engineering and civil engineering.},

The mathematical modeling based on fractional treatment of governing equation subject to the temperature distribution, shearing stress, and velocity field is developed. The fractionalized analytical solutions have been traced out separately through Atangana-Baleanu (AB) and Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) fractional differential operators. These differential operators with and without non-locality have been employed on the developed governing partial differential equations. The mathematical analysis of developed fractionalized governing partial differential equations has been established by means of systematic and powerful techniques of Laplace transform with its inversion. For the sake of physical investigation of the considered problem, the effective Prandtl number and fractional parameter have been invoked on temperature with and without single slip assumption. Our results suggest that the velocity profile decrease by increasing the effective Prandtl number. The existence of an effective Prandtl number may reflect the control of the thickness of momentum and enlargement of thermal conductivity. Additionally, the magnetic field and relaxation phenomenon have been analyzed on the profile of velocity with and without single slip assumption.},

Next, we construct a bivariate case of the above q -operators and determine the rate of convergence in terms of the moduli of continuity. A Voronovskaja-type theorem is derived too. Further, we study the rate of approximation of Bögel continuous and Bögel differentiable functions by the associated generalized Boolean sum (GBS) operators with the aid of mixed modulus of smoothness. We illustrate the rate of approximation of the q -operators, their bivariate, and the GBS cases by means of graphics and tables and show that the GBS operators provide better rate of convergence than the bivariate operators.},

By building a sensible Lyapunov fractional related with integral and fractional derivative terms, a few satisfactory conditions comprehensively asymptotic stability is gotten. At that point, the global asymptotically stability investigation of fractional-order neural systems utilizes the results from the obtained LMI conditions.

In this work, we propose an efficient numerical method for the solution of two-dimensional variable order time fractional mobile–immobile advection–dispersion model with spatially variable convection coefficient. At first, we discretize the time derivatives with a second-order scheme. Then, we apply the Legendre spectral element method in spatial directions and obtain the fully discrete scheme. We prove that the semi-discrete scheme is unconditionally stable and present an error estimate for the fully discrete scheme. The numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The proposed method shares some features with the stochastic collocation techniques, and in particular, it takes advantage of the assumption of smoothness of the functional to be approximated, to achieve fast convergence. The solution to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) is represented by means of Lagrange polynomials. The coefficients of the polynomial basis are functions of time, and they can be computed by solving a system of deterministic ordinary differential equations. Another motivation of this work lies in the novelty of the numerical scheme that does not belong to classical techniques to solve SDEs. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method. In particular, we observe a spectral convergence for the mean and the variance of the solution.},

The direct pathway refers to the person-to-person transmission between susceptibles and infectious individuals. Infected individuals shed virus on the objects, and new infections arise through touching a contaminated surface; this refers to the indirect transmission pathway. We model the direct and indirect transmission pathways with a S A D O I R ode model. Our proposal explicitly includes compartments for the contaminated objects, susceptible individuals, asymptomatic infectious, detected infectious, and recovered individuals. We compute the basic reproduction number and epidemic growth rate of the model and determine how these fundamental quantities relate to the transmission rate of the pathways. We further study the relationship between the rate of loss of immunity and the occurrence of backward bifurcation. An efficient statistical framework is introduced to estimate the parameters of the model. We show the performance of the model in the simulation scenarios and the real data from the COVID-19 daily cases in South Korea.},

We show the nonnegativity and boundedness of solution, obtain the steady states, and prove local asymptotic stability of the steady states. Then the optimal control problem with antiretroviral therapy and pharmacological delay is posed. We establish and analyze two types of objective functions: one is linear control and the other is quadratic control. Numerical simulations have been performed to verify the stability of steady states and show the optimal control strategies and the effects of control on cells concentration by Matlab and Lingo.},

The basic reproduction number of the deterministic equation is calculated using the next-generation matrix method. We prove the uniqueness and existence of the deterministic model using Lipschitz conditions and also show that it is locally asymptotically stable at it endemic equilibrium states. We constructed two equivalent stochastic differential equations (SDEs) models, whereas the Weiner process is equal to (i) the number of model equations and (ii) the number of independent changes in the model. Our aim is to solve (i) computationally using Cholesky decomposition technique with the variance–covariance matrix. Our proposed Cholesky decomposition SEIRD-SDEs model is compared with (ii) and also with the epidemic data of the 2018 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The applied magnetic field and nonlinear convection aspects reduce the axial velocity field.

But the periodic wave solution is not reported. So in this paper, He&#39;s variational methods are employed to find the solitary and periodic wave solutions of the generalized fourth-order Boussinesq equation. The greatest advantage of the variational method is that it can reduce the order of the research equation, make the equation more simple, and obtain the optimal solution. Finally, the numerical results are shown in the form of a graph to prove the applicability and effectiveness of the method. The results reveal that variational method is simple and straightforward and can avoid the tedious calculation process, which is expected to shed a light to the new research frontiers of solitary wave theory.},

When all the drift, diffusion, and jumps coefficients are allowed to be nonlinear, the exponential mean-square stability of the analytic solution to the equation is obtained. It is revealed that the implicit backward Euler–Maruyama numerical solution can reproduce the corresponding stability of the analytic solution under some given nonlinear conditions. It is different from the explicit Euler–Maruyama numerical solution whose stability depends on the linear growth condition. With some requirements related to the delayed function and the property of compensated Poisson process, we deal with time-varying delay and Poisson jumps. One highly nonlinear example is given to confirm the effectiveness of our theory.},

However, high accuracy requires considerable BPFs because they are piecewise constant and not so smooth. As a result, it increases the dimension of operational matrix and computational burden. To overcome this deficiency, a novel numerical method is developed to solve fractional differential equations. The method is based upon hybrid of BPFs and Bernstein polynomials (HBBPs), which are piecewise smooth. The HBBPs operational matrix of fractional-order integral is derived to reduce the FDEs to a system of algebraic equations. Then the numerical solution of the FDEs is obtained through solving the system of algebraic equations. The convergence analysis is conducted for the suggested scheme, and the upper bound of error of the solution is given. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the validity, applicability, and efficiency of the proposed technique in contrast with other approaches.},

The homotopy analysis transform method (HATM) is being taken to solve the fractional model of the K-G equation. A convergence study of HATM has been studied. The existence and uniqueness of the solution for the fractional K-G equation are presented. For verifying the obtained numerical outcomes regarding accuracy and competency, we have given different graphical presentations.

This paper aims to define the m -parameter Mittag–Leffler function, which can be reduced to various already known extensions of the Mittag–Leffler function. Important properties like recurrence relations, differentiation formulae, and integral representations are discussed for the newly defined m -parameter Mittag–Leffler function. Moreover, the new m -parameter Mittag–Leffler function is expressed in terms of some well-known special functions such as generalized hypergeometric function, Mellin-Barnes integral, Wright generalized hypergeometric function, and Fox H-function. The paper also deals with various integral transforms like Euler-Beta, Whittaker, Laplace, and Mellin transforms of the m -parameter Mittag–Leffler function. Fractional differential and integral operators are considered to highlight certain intriguing properties of the m -parameter Mittag–Leffler function. We also use the above function to define a generalization of Prabhakar integral and discuss its properties. Further, the relation of the newly defined m -parameter Mittag–Leffler function with various other functions such as exponential, trigonometric, hypergeometric, and algebraic functions is obtained and represented graphically using MATHEMATICA 12.},

  abstract     = {In this article, two nonstandard high-order schemes on a uniform and nonuniform time stepping combined with the multi-parameter exponential fitting technique (MPEF) have been developed to solve the time-fractional nonlinear reaction–diffusion system. The first method based on the MPEF combined with the 3-weighted shifted-Grünwald–Letnikov approximation with uniform time stepping, this scheme leads to a numerical solution that suffers from the singularity near t = 0 . In order to frustrate this singularity, a nonstandard higher-order L1-approximation for a nonuniform time-stepping scheme is developed. The developed scheme&#39;s convergence and unconditionally stability analysis have been verified. Numerical results effectively validate the theoretical aspects.},

Based on the obtained results, and by using state transformations, we derive the smallest componentwise ultimate bound of the state vector of the linear positive singular system with bounded disturbances. Then, we propose some sufficient criteria for linear functional state bounding problems of the positive singular system with time-varying delays by using some new mathematical techniques. Since the conditions are given in terms of the linear programming/Hurwit matrix/spectral abscissa, we can check them easily and compute directly the smallest componentwise ultimate bound.

The model is a two-dimensional system of partial differential equations that describes the interactions between disjoint groups of a human population. More precisely, we assume that the population is conformed by individuals who are susceptible to the virus, subjects who have been exposed to the virus, members who are infected and show symptoms, asymptomatic infected individuals, and recovered subjects. Various realistic assumptions are imposed upon the model, including the consideration of a time-delay parameter which takes into account the effects of social distancing and lockdown. We obtain the equilibrium points of the model and analyze them for stability. Moreover, we examine the bifurcation of the system in terms of one of the parameters of the model. To simulate numerically this mathematical model, we propose a time-splitting nonlocal finite-difference scheme. The properties of the model are thoroughly established, including its capability to preserve the positivity of solutions, its consistency, and its stability. Some numerical experiments are provided for illustration purposes.},

For one case, the lump solution will be shown the bright-dark lump structure, and for another case, the dark lump structure two small peaks and one deep hole can be present. Also, the interaction of lump with periodic waves and the interaction between the lump and two stripe solitons can be catched by introducing the Hirota forms. Simultaneously, the interaction between k -lump and k -stripe soliton wave solutions can be gained by the Hirota operator. The physical phenomena of these gained multiple soliton solutions are analyzed and indicated in diagrams by choosing proper amounts.},

In order to show its potential applications, we construct the theory for the case of bilinear forms acting in couples of a Banach space and its dual. Our method consists of using integral representations of bilinear maps that satisfy particular domination properties, which is shown to be equivalent to having a certain spectral structure. Thus, we develop a measure-based technique for the characterization of bilinear operators having a spectral representation, introducing the notion of eigenmeasure, which will become the central tool of our formalism.

Suitable coupling conditions at inner vertices are derived that guarantee conservation of mass and dissipation of a mathematical energy which allows us to prove stability and well-posedness. For single intervals and appropriately specified initial conditions, it is well-known that the solutions of the convection–diffusion problem converge to that of the transport problem with order O ⁡ ( ϵ ) in the L ∞ ( L 2 ) -norm with diffusion ϵ → 0 . In this paper, we prove a corresponding result for problems on one-dimensional networks. The main difficulty in the analysis is that the number and type of coupling conditions changes in the singular limit which gives rise to additional boundary layers at the interior vertices of the network. Since the values of the solution at these network junctions are not known a priori, the asymptotic analysis requires a delicate choice of boundary layer functions that allows to handle these interior layers.},

Then, we pass to consider a first-order mean-field approximation of the exact model and its stability properties, by relying on the graph-theoretical notion of equitable partition. In the case of graphs possessing this kind of partition, we prove that the endemic equilibrium can be computed by using a lower-dimensional dynamical system. Finally, in the special case of regular graphs, we investigate the domain of attraction of the endemic equilibrium.},

An optimal set of two-dimensional inequivalent subalgebras of the maximal Lie invariance algebra is constructed. The optimality among the subalgebras of Lie algebra is proved in a constructive manner by using rank of coefficient matrix of general two-dimensional element and successive application of adjoint actions. On the basis of these subalgebras, we carry out group invariant reductions and compute exact solutions for different classes of subalgebras in an optimal system. Mathematical and physical behaviors of different invariant solutions are shown graphically demonstrating that classical Lie symmetries are capable of solving the modified KZK equation.},

A nonhomogeneous boundary condition for microrotation is considered: The microrotation is assumed to be proportional to the rotation rate of the velocity on the boundary of the obstacles. The existence and uniqueness of solution are analyzed. Moreover, passing to the limit when ε tends to zero, an analog of the classical micropolar Darcy&#39;s law in the theory of porous media is derived.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to introduce an optimal control for a nonlocal calcium dynamic model in a cardiac cell acting on ryanodine receptors. The optimal control problem is considered as a coupled nonlocal reaction-diffusion system with a transmission boundary condition covering the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic domain. We establish the well-posedness result of the adjoint problem using Faedo-Galerkin approximation, a priori estimates, and compactness arguments. The numerical discretization of direct and adjoint problems is realized by using the implicit Euler method in time and the finite element for spatial discretization. Moreover, we obtain the stability result in the L 2 -norm for the direct and the adjoint discrete problems. Finally, in order to illustrate the control of our calcium dynamic model, we present some numerical experiments devoted to constant and nonlocal diffusions using the proposed numerical scheme.},

We consider the case that the plasma consists of N particle species, the particles are located in a bounded container Ω ⊂ ℝ 3 , and are subject to boundary conditions on ∂ Ω . Furthermore, there are external currents, typically in the exterior of the container, that may serve as a control of the plasma if adjusted suitably. We do not impose perfect conductor boundary conditions for the electromagnetic fields but consider the fields as functions on whole space and model objects, that are placed in space, via given matrix-valued functions ε (the permittivity) and μ (the permeability). A weak solution concept is introduced and existence of global-in-time solutions is proved, as well as the redundancy of the divergence part of the Maxwell equations in this weak solution concept.},

The main purpose of this contribution is to construct a novel efficient technique to retrieve exact fractional solutions to local fractional Gardner&#39;s equation defined on Cantor sets by an effective numerical methodology. In the framework of this technique, first a set of elementary functions are defined on the contour set. Taking these functions into account, the general structure of the exact solution for the equation is suggested as a specific combination of the defined basis functions. By determining the unknown coefficients in this expansion and by placing them in the original equation, specific forms of solutions to the fractional equation are determined. Several interesting numerical simulations of the achieved results are also presented in the article to give a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of these results. The results obtained in this research confirm that the method used is very simple and efficient in terms of application. Moreover, it is accurate and free of any errors in terms of calculation. Therefore, it can be employed to handle other partial differential equations including local fractional derivatives.},

In Hamed and Khater, three recent computational schemes (sech–tanh expansion method; extended sinh–Gorden expansion method; and extended simplest equation method) have been applied to the fractional model for constructing the exact traveling wave solutions. Many distinct solutions have been obtained, and some of them have been sketched in two, three-dimensional, and density plots. Here, these solutions are investigated to evaluate the initial and boundary conditions that apply the suggested numerical scheme. The accuracy of the constructed exact solutions is investigated by calculating the absolute value of error.

We then study the mean-field limit from the many-individual Hegselmann–Krause equation to the continuity-type partial differential equation as the number N of individuals goes to infinity. For the limiting equation, we prove global-in-time existence and uniqueness of measure-valued solutions.

First, the Hamiltonian symmetry classification is performed for the three-dimensional generalized Ermakov system. For arbitrary form of the function F ( θ , ϕ ) , four first integrals are established, and only three of these are functionally independent. The Hamiltonian integral theorem yields seven different functional forms of F ( θ , ϕ ) for which the generalized Ermakov system has additional Hamiltonian symmetries and related first integrals. These functional forms are new and not provided before in the literature. Finally, the exact solutions of the generalized Ermakov system, for arbitrary F ( θ , ϕ ) as well as for different forms of F ( θ , ϕ ) are provided with the aid of these derived first integrals.},

It has proved to be a robust and reliable tool for the forecast of the total and active cases, which can be also used to simulate different scenarios. In particular, the model is able to address a number of issues, such as assessing the adoption of the lockdown in Italy, started from March 11, 2020; the estimate of the actual attack rate; and how to employ a rapid screening test campaign for containing the epidemic.},

  abstract     = {Electrolytic computer-grade capacitors (ECGCs) are vastly implemented in energy storage systems. However, their models are not accurate and simple as other kinds of capacitors. For example, ECGCs and supercapacitors share many characteristics but have some differences because of their physicochemical properties, so it is wrong to assume their electrical behaviour is equivalent. In this work, we study the discharging response of ECGCs using four models obtained from fractional differential equations (FDEs) with integer initial conditions and causal fractional definitions, that is, Caputo and conformable operators. We also recall a correct procedure to achieve models from FDEs with physical consistency of units and avoiding additional and senseless constants. Thence, we perform a fitting procedure over an experimental dataset from six ECGCs via a hybrid solving procedure powered by the cuckoo search algorithm and interior-point algorithm. Our results show that models based on the traditional ordinary differential equation give the worst description of discharge, while models containing the Mittag–Leffler function, with time to the power of fractional order as the argument, render the best description of ECGCs.},

Our model includes the life cycle of Echinococcus in dog population (stray dogs and domestic dogs), contaminated environment, and human population to gain new biological insight. Note that different control strategies on stray and domestic dog populations may lead to inconsistency in the impulsive periods and system itself period, which brings great challenges in analyzing the proposed periodic system with multiple pulses. We theoretically examined the threshold dynamics, uniform persistence of disease on the basis of basic reproduction number. In particular, we define the basic reproduction number for stray and domestic dog population and obtain the globally asymptotical stability of the disease-free periodic solutions. We further obtain that echinococcosis may persist in human population if it persists in any dog population. Numerical simulations show that increasing the delivery rate and frequency of anthelmintics in domestic dogs and increasing the culling intensity and frequency in wild dogs could greatly reduce the disease incidence in two populations, respectively. The findings suggest that culling measures on wild dog population and environmental hygiene are crucial strategies in the control of the spread of echinococcosis in human being.},

  abstract     = {Random ordinary differential equations (RODEs) are important differential equations that contain a stochastic process in their vector field functions. Examples of such stochastic processes are Brownian motion (i.e., Wiener process) and fractional Brownian motion. Taking a path from the stochastic process, these equations can be considered as ordinary differential equations, but numerical schemes for solving ordinary differential equations don&#39;t necessarily preserve their convergence order for these equations. In this paper, an implicit ϑ -averaged scheme for numerical solution of RODEs is introduced. The proposed method involves averaging the noise inside the vector field and leads to integrals of the noise over discretization subintervals. Pathwise convergence and B-stability of the above scheme are proved. Eventually, the desired averaged scheme is implemented on a medical model.},

This type of parameterized generalized inverse eigenvalue problem, including multiplicative and additive inverse eigenvalue problems, appears in many applications. We show that the direction produced by the Newton-like method does not depend explicitly on the eigenvalues. Also, the inexact version can minimize the oversolving problem of Newton-like methods and hence improve efficiency. We discuss the convergence properties of the presented methods. Finally, the performance and effectiveness of the algorithms are tested on three numerical examples and compared to the Newton algorithm.},

Most of existing approximate methods for solving partial differential equations are unbalanced, since they have used a low order scheme such as finite difference methods for integrating the temporal variable and a high order numerical framework such as spectral Galerkin (or meshless) method for discretization of space variables. So in the current paper, our suggested scheme is balanced in both time and space variables. Due to the non-smoothness of solutions of time-fractional Burgers equations, we apply efficient basis functions as the fractional Lagrange functions for interpolating time variable. By collocating the main equation and the initial-boundary conditions together with the implementation of the corresponding operational matrices of spatial and fractional temporal variables, the assumed model is transformed into the associated system of nonlinear algebraic equations, which can be solved via efficient iterative solvers such as the Levenberg–Marquardt method. Also, we fully analyze the convergence of method. Moreover, we consider several test problems for examining the suggested scheme that confirms its high accuracy and low computational cost with respect to recent numerical methods in the literature.},

In the models, the classical reaction–diffusion equations subject to the Neumann boundary conditions are formulated on a finite but large domain x ∈ [0, L ] by replacing the second-order spatial derivatives with the fractional Laplacian operator of order 1 &lt; α ≤ 2 , which is classified as superdiffusion process. We examine the resulting coupled reaction–diffusion models for linear stability analysis and derive conditions under which the spatial patterns is evolved. In a view to understand our theoretical findings, the species spatial interactions is described in one and two dimensions. Through numerical experiments, we observe that a number of patterns can arise, including Turing spots, spiral-like structures, and seemingly complex spatiotemporal distributions.},

The iterative form of residual vector for the problems understudy has been presented to seek some new results of a nonlinear family of evolutionary fractional problems. The coupling of spectral technique with the Picard method can easily tackle the high nonlinearities including quadratic, cubic, exponential, and hyperbolic, while it brings more accurate and efficient results than the published results. A worthy comparative study with exact solutions and existing techniques including numerical and analytical is being made, which shows an excellent level of accuracy for the problems under study. The authenticity of the proposed method is validated via convergence, error-bound, and norms, while the set of graphs is illustrated for integer and noninteger orders. Hence, this unlocks the opportunities to deal with solutions of the weakly singular integral and lattice Toda equations and other complex nonlinear problems arising in applied sciences and may provide a better observation of physical mechanism.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and study a multi-scale approximation of a nonlinear elliptic functional introduced by Bake and Zisserman (BZ) for solving image restoration problems. The functional is a fourth-order PDE variational model that aims to locate geometric features that are singularities of first kind and second kind in the image. The method consists in introducing a family of linear discrete energies approximating BZ functional in the sense of the Γ -convergence. These functionals are built from an adaptive finite element method that reflects how the corresponding high-order diffusion operators act on image restoration with preserving contours and corners. The initial nonlinear functional includes low-dimensional measures (Hausdorff) of the singular sets, whereas its linear discrete counterpart keep a simple structure of the underlying PDEs system easy to solve. The resulting approach allows us to capture that singularities of the image and its gradient better than the second-order methods. We perform the analysis of the proposed method in the framework of the Γ -convergence, and we derive a new algorithm to solve the minimization of the BZ functional. We consider and implement the algorithm and a variant based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to enhance the convergence. We give some numerical results in agreement with the theoretical analysis to show the performances of the method.},

Implicit systems are especially relevant to behavioural systems theory, the analysis and synthesis of complex interconnected systems, systems identification and robust control. By incorporating algebraic constraints, implicit models provide additional versatility relative to the standard input–output framework. Problems of robust stability in implicit systems lead in a natural way to non-standard structured singular value ( μ ) formulations. In this note, it is shown that for a class of uncertainty structures involving repeated scalar parameters, these problems reduce to a standard μ problem which is well studied and for the solution of which several numerical algorithms are available. Our results are based on a matrix dilation technique and the redefinition of the uncertainty structure of the transformed problem.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the inverse problem of recovering the spatially varying material properties of a solid polycrystalline object from ultrasonic travel time measurements taken between pairs of points lying on the domain boundary. We consider a medium of constant density in which the orientation of the material&#39;s lattice structure varies in a piecewise constant manner, generating locally anisotropic regions in which the wave speed varies according to the incident wave direction and the material&#39;s known slowness curve. This particular problem is inspired by current challenges faced by the ultrasonic non-destructive testing of polycrystalline solids. We model the geometry of the material using Voronoi tessellations and study two simplified inverse problems where we ignore wave refraction. In the first problem, the Voronoi geometry itself and the orientations associated to each region are unknowns. We solve this nonsmooth, nonconvex optimisation problem using a multistart non-linear least squares method. Good reconstructions are achieved, but the method is shown to be sensitive to the addition of noise. The second problem considers the reconstruction of the orientations on a fixed square mesh. This is a smooth optimisation problem but with a much larger number of degrees of freedom. We prove that the orientations can be determined uniquely given enough boundary measurements and provide a numerical method that is more stable with respect to the addition of noise.},

This is connected to impossibility to solve all polynomial equations of degree bigger than four. In the case of nonlinear difference equations and systems the situation is even worse. So it is of interest to find new classes of practically solvable difference equations and systems. Recently, there have been presented several classes of practically solvable hyperbolic-cotangent–type systems of difference equations. Here, we present a new class of solvable systems of this type. It is a bit surprising that all the systems in the class are practically solvable, especially since several special cases are connected to some polynomials of degree eight.},

Recently, the interest in M-LF has significantly developed and a variety of extensions and generalizations forms have been posed. In this research, we define and study a new function called Mittag-Leffler–confluent hypergeometric function (MLCHF).

  abstract     = {In this century when computers and other electronic devices have taken over the world, the rate at which malwares including viruses are infecting these devices has also started to increase rapidly. The developments of computer systems and its ever increasing uses require preventing strategies of malwares. This study aims to analyze an epidemiological model on the spread of computer viruses. We investigated the existence and uniqueness of solutions, examined the stability of the model, and performed numerical simulations. First, a model has been extended with the help of Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative in Caputo sense. Then, the fixed point approach has been adopted to investigate the existence and uniqueness of solution of the model. Furthermore, the stability of the model has been examined with the help of the Hyers–Ulam stability method, and the model&#39;s numerical solutions have been obtained with the help of the Adam–Bashforth method. Lastly, the model&#39;s simulations have been performed considering various fractional derivative values.},

  abstract     = {Infectious diseases affect prey populations, and predators choosing susceptible prey may lead to the extinction of the prey population. We propose a mathematical model of prey–predator interaction with the prey population divided into two classes: susceptible and infected. The susceptible prey subpopulation becomes infected by direct contact with the infected prey subpopulation, and the predator consumes only susceptible prey. An analysis of the model enabled the establishment of thresholds for the spread of disease in the absence and presence of predators. In the absence of predators, we obtain the classic basic reproduction number ℜ 0 , and in the presence of predators, we obtain a new threshold ℜ 0 P , which measures the effect of predators in the disease spread. Furthermore, these thresholds establish conditions for the existence and stability of biologically viable equilibrium points. Using numerical simulations, we determined the different biological characteristics of the model and illustrated the analytical results.},

  abstract     = {The main emphasis of the present study is to analyze the novel feature of entropy generation in the flow and heat transfer of Sisko nanofluid over a stretching sheet in the presence of the magnetic field, chemical reaction, and convective boundary conditions. Buongiorno&#39;s nanofluid model is used to consider the effect of Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis. The governing Sisko nanofluid flow equations comprising the momentum, nanoparticle volume fraction, and energy are reduced to nonlinear differential equations by utilizing appropriate similarity variables. The numerical solution of nonlinear coupled differential equations is obtained using the finite difference scheme in combination with the quasilinearization technique. The impact of different physical parameters on velocity, nanoparticle volume fraction, and temperature is presented graphically. The variation in entropy generation and Bejan number with different pertinent parameters that characterize the entropy generation phenomenon for the flow of Sisko nanofluid is discussed. The obtained results indicate that the entropy generation enhances with an increase in the magnetic parameter, Brinkman number, and thermal Biot number while reduces with the Sisko material parameter. Moreover, the behavior of mass and heat transfer rates is displayed through the Brownian diffusion parameter and thermophoresis parameter. The analysis of entropy generation minimization has crucial applications in the industrial heat transfer problems, solar heat exchanger, turbomachinery designing, LED-based spotlights, designing of air-cooled gas turbine blades, cooling in nuclear fuel rods, rotating reactors, in chillers, air separators, and so forth. Furthermore, entropy generation with MHD flow has applications in MHD generators, nuclear reactors, flow meters, micropumps, power plants, and so forth.},

  abstract     = {In the recent developments of regularization theory for inverse and ill-posed problems, a variational quasi-reversibility (QR) method has been designed to solve a class of time-reversed quasi-linear parabolic problems. Known as a PDE-based approach, this method relies on adding a suitable perturbing operator to the original problem and consequently, on gaining the corresponding fine stabilized operator, which leads us to a forward-like problem. In this work, we establish new conditional estimates for such operators to solve a prototypical Cauchy problem for elliptic equations. This problem is based on the stationary case of the inverse heat conduction problem, where one wants to identify the heat distribution in a certain medium, given the partial boundary data. Using the new QR method, we obtain a second-order initial value problem for a wave-type equation, whose weak solvability can be deduced using a priori estimates and compactness arguments. Weighted by a Carleman-like function, a new type of energy estimates is explored in a variational setting when we investigate the Hölder convergence rate of the proposed scheme. Besides, a linearized version of this scheme is analyzed. Numerical examples are provided to corroborate our theoretical analysis.},

In this paper, we are interested in investigating the combined influences of local interaction and processing delay on the asymptotic behavior in a particle model with local communication weights. With new observations, we show that the desired particle system undergoes both periodic flocking and periodic clustering behaviors when the processing delay crosses a threshold value and the eigenvalue 1 of average matrix is semi-simple. In this case, the connectedness of the particle system may be absent. Also, the number of clusters is discussed by using subspace analysis. In results, some criteria on flocking and clustering emergence with exponential convergent rate are established by the standard functional differential equations analysis when the processing delay is small. When the processing delay reaches the threshold value, the system undergoes periodic flocking and periodic clustering emergence. It also shows that the processing time lags qualitatively change the emergent performances in a nonlinear way. Finally, we conclude this study with several numerical simulations that intuitively illustrate the validity of the theoretical results and address some discussions for both variable communication weight and distributed processing delay.},

Therefore, the SDTS iteration method is of wider range of applications than the RSHSS iteration method. Furthermore, the SDTS iteration method will naturally lead to a scaled diagonal-times-circulant splitting (SDCS) preconditioner. Theoretical analysis shows that the eigenvalues of the corresponding preconditioned matrix are clustered around 1.

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce an efficient meshless technique for solving the two-dimensional variable-order time-fractional mobile/immobile advection-diffusion model with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The main advantage of this scheme is to obtain a global approximation for this problem which reduces such problems to a system of algebraic equations. To approximate the first and fractional variable-order against the time, we use the finite difference relations. The proposed method is based on the moving Kriging (MK) interpolation shape functions. To discretize this model in space variables, we use the MK interpolation. Duo to the fact that the shape functions of MK have Kronecker&#39;s delta property, boundary conditions are imposed directly and easily. To illustrate the capability of the proposed technique on regular and irregular domains, several examples are presented in different kinds of domains and with uniform and nonuniform nodes. Also, we use this scheme to simulating anomalous contaminant diffusion in underground reservoirs.},

  abstract     = {For the speed control of direct current motor, a fractional complex-order controller (FCOC) is proposed in this paper. The FCOC is an extension of the fractional-order controller. It is known that fractional-order controllers exhibit strong robustness to open-loop gain variations. However, in actual situations, due to external interference, the phase angle and gain of the system may change at the same time. The FCOC proposed in this paper adds an additional parameter, which makes the system show strong robustness when the phase angle and gain change simultaneously. Existing methods for parameter tuning of FCOCs only consider the preset gain crossover frequency and the expected phase margin. This may not allow the system to exhibit good dynamic and stable performance. In this paper, based on the frequency domain analysis, the parameters of the FCOC are tuned by integrating the gain crossover frequency, cutoff frequency, phase margin, and amplitude margin. The optimal solution satisfying a set of constraint equations is obtained by optimization algorithm. Finally, the simulation results are compared with those of the fractional-order controller and the integer-order controller. At the same time, the robustness of the system under disturbance is analyzed. The results show that the complex fractional-order control presented in this paper has better dynamic performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Very recently, the concept of fractal differentiation and fractional differentiation has been combined to produce new differentiation operators. The new operators were constructed using three different kernels, namely, power law, exponential decay, and the generalized Mittag-Leffler function. The new operators have two parameters: the first is considered as fractional order and the second as fractal dimension. In this work, we applied these new operators to model some chaotic attractors, and the models were solved numerically using a new and very efficient numerical scheme. We presented numerical simulations for some specific fractional order and fractal dimension. The classical fractional differential models could be recovered when the fractal dimension is equal to 1; in these cases, the obtained attractors with power law presented no similarities. Nevertheless, those obtained via Caputo-Fabrizio and the Atangana-Baleanu derivative show some crossover effects, which is due to non-index law property. However, those obtained from fractal-fractional, in particular, those with the Mittag-Leffler kernel, show very strange and new attractors with self-similarities; these results are obtained for the first time. We conclude that this new concept is the future to modelling complexities with self-similarities.},

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to developing an accurate operational matrix (OM) method for the solution of a new category of nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs) explained by fractal-fractional dynamical systems. The fractal-fractional differentiation is considered in the sense of Atangana-Riemann-Liouville. The method is based on the shifted Legendre polynomials (LPs). Through the way, a new OM of fractal-fractional differentiation is extracted for the shifted LPs. The optimality conditions are converted to an algebraic system of equations by using the shifted LP expansions of the state and control variables and applying the method of constrained extrema. More precisely, these variables are approximated by the shifted LPs with undetermined coefficients. Then, these expansions are replaced in the performance index, and the Gauss-Legendre integration method is used to approximate the performance index for extracting a nonlinear algebraic equation. In the sequel, the mentioned OM and the collocation method are used to generate some algebraic equations from the dynamical system. Finally, the method of the constrained extrema is used by coupling the algebraic constraints generated from the dynamical system and the initial condition with the algebraic equation elicited from the performance index by a set of unknown Lagrange multipliers. The accuracy of the method is studied by solving some numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {A quadratic finite volume (FV) method for steady-state Riesz space-fractional diffusion equations (sFDEs) with variable diffusivity coefficient is developed using piecewise quadratic basis functions, and a resulting linear algebra system with two-by-two block-type Toeplitz-like coefficient matrix is formulated. It is proved that the method requires a minimum memory of order O ⁡ ( N ) , where N is the number of spatial partitions. Moreover, as two of the produced Toeplitz-like submatrices are not square, a new fast nonsquare Toeplitz-like matrix-vector product is specially designed, which requires an almost linear computational complexity of order O ⁡ ( N ⁢ log 2 ⁡ N ) . Then, a fast version of biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB) solution algorithm, named FBiCGSTAB, is proposed for the FV scheme. The FV method combined with Crank-Nicolson (CN) time discretization is applied to solve time-dependent sFDEs, and an efficient CN-FV scheme is developed and analyzed. Finally, numerical results are presented to show the utility of the fast FV and fast CN-FV methods.},

In this paper, we study a simple numerical technique to solve two important types of fractional anomalous sub-diffusion equations that appear strongly in chemical reactions and spiny neuronal dendrites, which are the two-dimensional fractional Cable equation and the two-dimensional fractional reaction sub-diffusion equation. The proposed technique is a simple one which is an extension of the weighted average finite difference technique. The stability analysis of the proposed method is studied by means of John von Neumann stability analysis technique. An accurate stability criterion which is valid for different discretization schemes of the fractional derivative and arbitrary weight factor is introduced. Four numerical examples are presented (two for the Cable equation and two for the reaction sub-diffusion equation) to demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the presented method.},

We apply a modified auxiliary equation method and the Adomian decomposition method to get distinct solutions to our suggested model. These solutions describe the dynamic of the phase separation in iron alloys and use in solidification and nucleation problems. The applications of this method arise in many various fields such as plasma physics, quantum mechanics, mathematical biology, and fluid dynamics. We apply a conformable fractional derivative to this fractional model to convert it into a nonlinear partial differential equation with integer order. We obtain many analytical wave solutions and also apply a semi-analytical scheme to calculate the absolute value of error. All solutions are verified by using Mathematica software.},

By working from the fractional-calculus viewpoint, it is possible to obtain many new results concerning the double integral operator, including a series formula and a bivariate chain rule. We also discover a left inverse operator, which completes this model of fractional calculus. As applications, we solve some initial value problems and use a modified Stancu-Bernstein model to approximate the image of a Hölder-continuous function under the action of our double integral operator.},

The generalization consists into considering the advection-diffusion equation with memory based on the time-fractional Atangana-Baleanu derivative with Mittag-Leffler kernel. Analytical solution of the fractional differential advection-diffusion equation along with initial and boundary value conditions has been determined by employing Laplace transform and finite sine-Fourier transform. On the basis of the properties of Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivatives and the properties of Mittag-Leffler functions, the general solution is particularized for the fractional parameter α = 1 in order to find solution of the classical advection-diffusion process. The influence of memory parameter on the solute concentration has been investigated using the analytical solution and the software Mathcad. From this analysis, it is found that for a constant concentration&#39;s source on the boundary, the solute concentration is increasing with fractional parameter, and therefore, an advection-diffusion process described by Atangana-Baleanu time-fractional derivative leads to a smaller solute concentration than in the classical process.},

In this paper, we are interested in discussing the existence of solutions for nonlinear Rayleigh-Stokes problem for a generalized second grade fluid with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative.

In particular, saturated nonlinear function series, stair nonlinear function series, polynomial function, and hysteresis series are combined to extend equilibrium points in a linear stable four-dimensional (4-D) system to generate FOHCMS attractors. Dynamics of the designed systems are analyzed; the existence of hyperchaos is verified using two maximum positive Lyapunov exponents and Poincaré maps; multi-scroll attractors are observed. The corresponding circuit is designed and simulated where multi-scroll hyperchaotic attractors are observed. Numerical simulations and circuit simulation results show that our design is feasible.},

This is established by imposing weaker conditions than the commonly used ones on the relaxation function and by utilizing an appropriate boundary controller.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of interpersonal relationships has started to become popular in the last few decades. Interpersonal relationships exist in many ways, including family, friendship, job, and clubs. In this manuscript, we have implemented the homotopy perturbation Elzaki transform method to obtain the solutions of romantic and interpersonal relationships model involving time-fractional-order derivatives with non-singular kernels. The present method is the combination of the classical homotopy perturbation method and the Elzaki transform. This method offers a rapidly convergent series of solutions. The present approach explores the dynamics of love between couples. Validation and usefulness of the method are incorporated with new fractional-order derivatives with exponential decay law and with general Mittag–Leffler law. Obtained results are compared with the established solution defined in the Caputo sense. Further, a comparative study among Caputo and newly defined fractional derivatives are discussed.},

First, depending on some theories, a fractional order reproducing kernel space W α [0, 1] is constructed. The fractional order reproducing kernel space is a very suitable space to solve a class of fractional differential equations. Then, we calculate the reproducing kernel R y ( x ) of the space W α [0, 1] skilfully in §3. And convergence order and time complexity of this algorithm are discussed. We prove that the approximate solution u n of (1.1) converges to its exact solution u is not less than the second order. The time complexity of the algorithm is equal to the polynomial time of the third degree. Finally, three experiments support the algorithm strongly from the aspect of theory and technique.},

The method is a computational procedure based on the collocation technique and the shifted discrete CPs together with their operational matrices (ordinary and VO fractional derivatives). The main advantage of the designed approach is that it provides a global solution for the problem. In order to examine the efficiency of the designed algorithm, some numerical problems have been provided.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we define a non-iterative transformation method for an extended Blasius problem. The original non-iterative transformation method, which is based on scaling invariance properties, was defined for the classical Blasius problem by Töpfer in 1912. This method allows us to solve numerically a boundary value problem by solving a related initial value problem and then rescaling the obtained numerical solution. In recent years, we have seen applications of the non-iterative transformation method to several problems of interest. The obtained numerical results are improved by both a mesh refinement strategy and Richardson&#39;s extrapolation technique. In this way, we can be confident that the computed first six decimal places are correct.},

  abstract     = {Studying the spread of epidemics and diseases is a worldwide problem especially during the current time where the whole world is suffering from COVID-19 pandemic. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and waning vaccination are classified as worldwide problems. Both depend on the exposure time to antibiotic and vaccination. Here, a simple model for competition between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive bacteria is given. Conditions for local stability are investigated, which agree with observation. Existence of positive solution in the AMR complex networks is proved. Dynamics of the identical AMR models are explored with different topologies of complex networks such as global, star, line, and unidirectional line networks coupled through their susceptible states. Chaotic attractors are shown to exist as the AMR models are located on all these topologies of complex networks. Thus, it is found that the dynamics of the AMR model become more complicated as it is located on either integer-order or fractional-order complex networks. Furthermore, a discretized version of the fractional AMR model is presented. Complex dynamics such as existence of Neimark–Sacker, flip bifurcations, coexistence of multiple attractors, homoclinic connections, and multiple closed invariant curves are investigated. Basin sets of attraction are also computed. Finally, the discretized system is located on complex networks with different topologies which show rich variety of complex dynamics. Also, 0–1 test is used to verify the existence of unpredictable dynamics. So, studying the dynamics of AMR models on complex networks is very helpful to understand the mechanism of spread of diseases.},

This paper focuses on building simple architecture FNNs with approximation ability by constructing an activation function. First, for any continuous function defined on [0, 1] and an arbitrary accuracy ϵ &gt; 0 , an FNN is constructed, which has only one neuron and a fixed weight 1 and can approximate the function with an accuracy of ϵ . Thereafter, we study the representation of FNNs for polynomial functions by constructing a proper activation function. It is proved that any algebraic polynomial with the degree n can be represented by an FNN. Further, a piecewise function is constructed as an activation function of an FNN such that the FNN represents the famous Bernstein polynomials.},

The integral representations are obtained in form of the inverse Fourier–Bessel transform and as a double contour integrals of the Mellin–Barnes type. Concerning series expansions, the eigenfunctions are expressed as the double generalized hypergeometric series for any β ∈]1, 2[ and as Kampé de Fériet and Lauricella series in two variables for the rational values of β . The limit cases β = 1 (diffusion operator) and β = 2 (wave operator) as well as an intermediate case β = 3 2 are studied in detail. Finally, we provide several plots of the eigenfunctions to some selected eigenvalues for different particular values of the fractional derivative order β and the spatial dimension n .},

These properties established enrich the knowledge of Poisson μ -pseudo almost automorphic stochastic processes. Meanwhile, a more significant point is that without the Amerio semiseparation condition, we establish the Amerio-type theorem that all the L p -bounded mild solutions are μ -pseudo almost automorphic in distribution for a class of nonlinear Sobolev-type stochastic differential equations with Markov switching and jumps. In this sense, we partly contribute to a better understanding of the stochastic analysis between L p -bounded mild solutions and μ -pseudo almost automorphic mild solutions in distribution for nonlinear SDEs. Finally, we give an example to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.},

  abstract     = {From many fewer acquired measurements than that suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory, compressive sensing (CS) theory demonstrates that a signal can be reconstructed with high probability when it exhibits sparsity in a certain domain. Recent CS methods have employed analytical sparsifying transforms such as wavelets, curvelets, and finite differences. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for image recovery, which minimizes a linear combination of three terms corresponding to least square data fitting, adaptive dictionary, and Hessian Schatten-norm regularization. We split the problem into some subproblems which turn the minimization task into much simpler. Numerical experiments are conducted on several test images with a variety of sampling patterns and ratios in both noiseless and noise scenarios. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.},

Then, drive system and response system achieve synchronization by combining graph theory, Lyapunov stability theory, and adaptive control technique. At the same time, the uncertain multiple topological structures of drive system can be identified by response system based on adaptive synchronization. Furthermore, topological structures of MWCN with time delay are also successfully identified.

Here, the density is assumed to be uniform and magnetic pressure is assumed to vary according to power law with distance from the symmetry axis in the undisturbed medium. Using power series method, we obtain approximate analytic solutions in the form of a power series in ( a 0 / V ) 2 , where a 0 and V are the velocities of sound in the undisturbed medium and shock front, respectively. The first-order and second-order approximate solutions to the considered problem are discussed with the help of the said method. We construct solutions for the first-order approximation in closed form. Distributions of the flow variables such as fluid velocity, density, pressure, and magnetic pressure for the first-order approximation are analyzed graphically behind the shock front. Also, the effects of non-ideal parameter and shock Cowling number on the flow variables are discussed. It is observed that an increase in the value of non-ideal parameter causes fluid velocity to increase, and density, pressure, and magnetic pressure to decrease. Increase in the shock Cowling number causes decrease in density and pressure, whereas increase in fluid velocity and magnetic pressure behind the shock. Also, it is found that numerical results obtained in the absence of magnetic field recover the existing results in the literature. Further, these results are found to be in good agreement with those obtained by the Runge-Kutta method of fourth-order.},

The inverse problem considered in this paper has a unique solution. However, it is an ill-posed problem by being sensitive to noise. The one-dimensional inverse problem is discretized using the FDM and recast as a nonlinear least-squares minimization of Tikhonov regularization function. Numerically, this is effectively solved using the MATLAB subroutine lsqnonlin . The present numerical results demonstrate that accurate and stable approximate solutions have been attained.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies resilient coordinated control over networks with hybrid dynamics and malicious agents. In a hybrid multi-agent system, continuous-time and discrete-time agents concurrently exist and communicate through local interaction. We introduce the notion of heterogeneous robustness to capture the topological structure and facilitate convergence analysis of hybrid agents over multiple subnetworks, where the exact number and identities of malicious agents are not known. A hybrid resilient strategy is first designed to ensure group consensus of the heterogeneously robust network admitting completely distributed implementation. We then develop a scaled consensus protocol which allows different clusters within each subnetwork, providing further flexibility over the resilient control tasks. Finally, some numerical examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.},

We discuss, firstly, the existence and stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium of wild animals and environment-only model; this happens to be the initial stage of disease transmission. Further, with the intervention of control measures, the model degenerates into a subsystem with only human population and environment; the existence and stability of the disease-free equilibrium of this subsystem are studied. With the strengthening of control strategies, the environment and human population subsystems have further degenerated into a human population-only model with blocking migration and environment; the ultimate extinction of this disease and the peak of the outbreak are researched. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried to explain the main results and the impacts of various control strategies on the disease outbreak. In particular, we also fit the confirmed cases in Wuhan from 24 January to 5 March to illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of our model. The results show that, in the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, stopping all the migration of humans, increasing the intensity of treatment, enhancing the awareness of personal protection, and especially increasing the ability to identify asymptomatic infections are indispensable control means to control this disease.},

We use the cell average of the discharge on the staggered cell to discretize the source term due to the effect of Coriolis forces. The positivity-preserving property of the water depth is obtained by providing an appropriate CFL condition with the help of a “draining” time-step technique. Finally, several two-dimensional numerical results of classical problems of the system are presented to test these properties of the current scheme.},

  abstract     = {This work is motivated by a longstanding interest in the long time behavior of flow-structure interaction (FSI) PDE dynamics. We consider a linearized compressible flow structure interaction (FSI) PDE model with a view of analyzing the stability properties of both the compressible flow and plate solution components. In our earlier work, we gave an answer in the affirmative to question of uniform stability for finite energy solutions of said compressible flow-structure system, by means of a “frequency domain” approach. However, the frequency domain method of proof in that work is not “robust” (insofar as we can see), when one wishes to study longtime behavior of solutions of compressible flow-structure PDE models, which track the appearance of the ambient state onto the boundary interface. Nor is a frequency domain approach in this earlier work availing when one wishes to consider the dynamics, in long time, of solutions to physically relevant nonlinear versions of the compressible flow-structure PDE system under present consideration (e.g., the Navier–Stokes nonlinearity in the PDE flow component or a nonlinearity of Berger/Von Karman type in the plate equation). Accordingly, in the present work, we operate in the time domain by way of obtaining the necessary energy estimates, which culminate in an alternative proof for the uniform stability of finite energy compressible flow-structure solutions. Since there is a need to avoid steady states in our stability analysis, as a prerequisite result, we also show here that zero is an eigenvalue for the generators of flow-structure systems, whether the material derivative term be absent or present. Moreover, we provide a clean characterization of the (one dimensional) zero eigenspace, with or without material derivative, under an appropriate assumption on the underlying ambient vector field.},

Treatment was captured using efficacy functions replicating the realistic pharmacokinetics properties of two drugs, one of which is administered intravenously and the other orally. Our results suggest that natural drug resistance increases the hepatitis B virus burden more than suboptimal adherence to drugs from both monotherapies and combined therapies. The results also suggest that the inclusion of both immune cells and cytokine responses is essential and that combination therapies are more significant in reducing hepatitis B virus infection than monotherapies.},

More precisely, by transforming the three-dimensional CEE for GCG with damping to a symmetric hyperbolic system, one shows that the total energy in H 3 is strictly decaying with time for any sufficiently small initial data. As a result, the GE result follows from the local well-posedness of the system in H 3 . This gives the first GE result relating to the three-dimensional CEE.},

Non-linear radiation is added in accepted nanofluid model. Through similarity technique, we obtain non-linear ODEs from leading PDEs, and numerically, by employing RK-4 shooting practice, we resolve the succeeding equation. Stimulus of inspiring flow factors on the flow specifically is accomplished precisely through figures and charts.

This equation is nonlocal in time and contains a term, called the interaction potential, that depends on the time-integral of the solution over the entire interval of solving the problem. In fact, one needs to know the “future” in order to determine the coefficient in this term, that is, the causality principle is violated. The existence of a weak solution of the initial boundary value problem is proven. The interaction potential satisfies fairly general conditions and can have arbitrary growth at infinity. The uniqueness of this solution is established with restrictions on the length of the considered time interval.},

So far, the virus has attacked as many as 188 countries of the world and 5 549 131 (27 May 2020) human population is affected with 348 224 deaths. In this regard, public and private health authorities are looking for manpower with modeling skills and possible vaccine. In this research paper, keeping in view the fast transmission dynamics of the virus, we have proposed a new mathematical model of eight mutually distinct compartments with the help of memory-possessing operator of Caputo type. The fractional order parameter ψ of the model has been optimized so that smallest error can be attained while comparing simulations and the real data set which is considered for the country Pakistan. Using Banach fixed point analysis, it has been shown that the model has a unique solution whereas its basic reproduction number is approximated to be 6.5894. Disease-free steady state is shown to be locally asymptotically stable for , otherwise unstable. Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm under MATLAB Toolbox with daily real cases of the virus in Pakistan is employed to obtain best fitted values of the parameters for the model&#39;s validation. Numerical simulations of the model have come into good agreement with the practical observations wherein social distancing, wearing masks, and staying home have proved to be the most effective measures in order to prevent the virus from further spread.},

The existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution are discussed. Some theoretical results are established. The numerical reconstruction of the unknown source term is investigated using an iterative process. The proposed method involves a denoising procedure at each iteration step and provides a sequence of source term approximations converging in norm to the actual solution of the minimization problem.

This paper primarily investigates the optimal control problem of the uncertain second-order circuit based on first hitting criteria. First, considering time efficiency and different from the ordinary expected utility criterion over an infinite time horizon, two first hitting criteria which are reliability index and reliable time criteria are innovatively proposed. Second, assuming the circuit output voltage as an uncertain variable when the historical data is lacking, we better model the real circuit system with the uncertain second-order differential equation which is essentially the uncertain fractional-order differential equation. Then, based on the first hitting time theorem of the uncertain fractional-order differential equation, the distribution function of the first hitting time under the second-order circuit system is proposed and the uncertain second-order circuit optimal control model (reliability index and reliable time-based model) is transformed into corresponding crisp optimal problem. Lastly, analytic expressions of the optimal control for the reliability index model are obtained. Meanwhile, sufficient condition and guidance for parameters for the optimal solution of the reliable time-based model are derived, and corresponding numerical examples are also given to demonstrate the fluctuation of our optimal solution for different parameters.},

In constant and time periodic environments, it is calculated as the spectral radius of the so-called next-generation operator. In continuously structured populations defined in a Banach lattice X with concentrated states at birth, one cannot define the next-generation operator in X . In the present paper, we present an approach to compute the basic reproduction number of such models as the limit of the basic reproduction number of a sequence of models for which R 0 can be computed as the spectral radius of the next-generation operator. We apply these results to some examples: the (classical) size-dependent model, a size-structured cell population model, a size-structured model with diffusion in structure space (under some particular assumptions), and a (physiological) age-structured model with diffusion in structure space.},

The accumulated criminal records show that serious and minor crimes differ in many measures and are related in a complex way. While some of those who have committed minor crime spontaneously evolve into serious criminals, the transition from minor crime to major crime involves many social factors and has not been fully understood yet. In this work, we present a mathematical model to describe how minor criminals turn into major criminals inside and outside of prisons. The model assumes that a population can be divided into a set of compartments, according to the level of crime and whether arrested or not, and individuals have equal probability to change compartment. The model is design to implement two social effects which respectively have been conceptualized in popular terms “broken windows effect” and “prison as a crime school.” Analysis of the system shows how the crime-related parameters such as the arrest rate, the period of imprisonment, and the in-prison contact rate affect the criminal distribution at equilibrium. Without proper control of contact between prisoners, the longer imprisonment rather increases occurrence of serious crimes in society. An optimal allocation of the police resources to suppress crimes is also discussed.},

This set of special functions have been defined as the infinite and countable set of the eigenfunctions of a weighted finite Fourier transform operator.

  abstract     = {A widescale description of various phenomena in science and engineering such as physics, chemical, acoustics, control theory, finance, economics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and social sciences is well described by nonlinear fractional differential equations (NLFDEs). In turbulence, fluid dynamics, and nonlinear biological systems, applications of NLFDEs can also be found. NLFDEs are believed to be powerful tools to describe real-world problems more precisely than the differential equation of the integer-order. In this research, we have used the fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM) to find the solution of the time-fractional Sawada-Kotera-Ito seventh-order equation. The novelty of the FRDTM is that it does not require any discretization, transformation, perturbation, or any restrictive conditions. In addition, compared to other methods, this approach needs less calculation. For special cases of an integer and noninteger orders, computed results are compared with existing results. Present results are in good agreement with the existing solutions. Here, the fractional derivatives are considered in the Caputo sense. Convergence analysis of the results has also been studied with the increasing number of terms of the solution.},

The global asymptotic stability of the constant endemic equilibrium is discussed in the case of homogeneous environment. We mainly investigate the effects of diffusion and saturation on asymptotic profiles of the endemic equilibrium. When the saturated incidence rate tends to infinity, the susceptible and infective distributes in the habitat in a nonhomogeneous way; this result is in strong contrast with the case of no spontaneous infection, where the endemic equilibrium tends to the disease free equilibrium. Our analysis shows that the spontaneous infection can enhance the persistence of an infectious disease and may provide some useful implications on disease control.},

After integration in time by the fully implicit average vector field method, ROMs are constructed with proper orthogonal decomposition(POD)/discrete empirical interpolation method that preserves the Hamiltonian structure. In the second approach, the SWE as a partial differential equation with quadratic nonlinearity is integrated in time by the linearly implicit Kahan&#39;s method, and ROMs are constructed with the tensorial POD that preserves the linear-quadratic structure of the SWE. We show that in both approaches, the invariants of the SWE such as the energy, enstrophy, mass and circulation are preserved over a long period of time, leading to stable solutions.

The proposed schemes utilize the graded L 1 formula for the Caputo fractional derivative and a special finite difference discretization for IFL, where the graded mesh can capture the model problem with a weak singularity at initial time. The stability and convergence are rigorously proved via the M -matrix analysis, which is from the spatial discretized matrix of IFL. Moreover, the proposed schemes use the fast sum-of-exponential approximation and Toeplitz matrix algorithms to reduce the computational cost for the nonlocal property of time and space fractional derivatives, respectively. The fast schemes greatly reduce the computational work of solving the discretized linear systems from by a direct solver to per preconditioned Krylov subspace iteration and a memory requirement from 𝒪 ( M N 2 ) to 𝒪 ( N N e x p ) , where N and ( N e x p ≪) M are the number of spatial and temporal grid nodes, respectively. The spectrum of preconditioned matrix is also given for ensuring the acceleration benefit of circulant preconditioners.

Interactions between B leukemia cells, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and T-helper cells are considered to be incorporated into a system consisting of four fractional differential equations. For estimation of the parameters, clinical data of six patients were used. By numerical solution of the system, the interactions between the leukemia cell population and the immune system cell populations for values of α ∈ (0,1) at different times were explained. By determining points of equilibrium and stability of the system were met. Bifurcation analysis showed that use of the fractional-order model, figure out unpredictable behaviors of the system such as saddle-node, bistability and hysteresis phenomenon occurred in the system by changing the values of some of the parameters, it was predictable.},

The micropolar equations with standard Laplacian dissipation model fluids with microstructure. The generalization to include fractional dissipation allows simultaneous study of a family of equations and is relevant in some physical circumstances. We establish that, when α ≥ 1 2 and β ≥ 1 2 , any initial data ( u 0 , w 0 ) in the critical Besov space u 0 ∈ B 2 , 1 1 + d 2 − 2 ⁢ α ⁡ ( ℝ d ) and w 0 ∈ B 2 , 1 1 + d 2 − 2 ⁢ β ⁡ ( ℝ d ) yields a unique weak solution. For α ≥ 1 and β =0, any initial data u 0 ∈ B 2 , 1 1 + d 2 − 2 ⁢ α ⁡ ( ℝ d ) and w 0 ∈ B 2 , 1 d 2 ⁡ ( ℝ d ) also leads to a unique weak solution as well. The regularity indices in these Besov spaces appear to be optimal and can not be lowered in order to achieve the uniqueness. Especially, the 2D micropolar equations with the standard Laplacian dissipation, namely, α = β =1, have a unique weak solution for . The proof involves the construction of successive approximation sequences and extensive a priori estimates in Besov space settings.},

In the class of r-CFSLPs, we discuss two types of CFSLPs which include left- and right-sided CFDs, each of order α ∈( n , n +1], and prove properties of the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions in a certain Hilbert space. Also, we apply a fixed-point theorem for proving the existence and uniqueness of the eigenfunctions. As an operator for the class of s-CFSLPs, we first derive two fractional types of the hypergeometric differential equations of order α ∈(0,1] and obtain their analytical eigensolutions as Gauss hypergeometric functions. Afterwards, we define the conformable fractional Legendre polynomial/functions (CFLP/Fs) as Jacobi polynomial and investigate their basic properties. Moreover, the conformable fractional integral Legendre transforms (CFILTs) based on CFLP/Fs-I and -II are introduced, and using these new transforms, an effective procedure for solving explicitly certain ordinary and partial conformable fractional differential equations (CFDEs) are given. Finally, as a theoretical application, some fractional diffusion equations are solved.},

  abstract     = {Many transcendental functions were constructed through finding closed-form solutions of algebraic or differential equations and become ubiquitous gradually with increasing awareness of applications in specific problems naturally arising from life science. Motivated by Lambert W function, a family of transcendent X functions was introduced recently to express the closed-form solutions of some nonlinear pharmacokinetic models. Unfortunately, its mathematical properties have not been completely studied. For the purposes of mathematical point of views and the use of wider applications, our objective in this paper is to characterize morphism classification of X functions at the scope of real branches.},

We choose a convenient regularized problem ( P ϵ ) for which we prove the existence and uniqueness of solution using the comparison Lemma 2.1 and the Schauder fixed-point theorem. Then, we pass to the limit, when ϵ goes to 0, to get a solution for our problem. Moreover, we will see another approach for the incompressible case where we pass to the limit in ( P ), when α goes to 0, to get a solution.},

Some technique lemmas will be given to solve the problems caused by the weak form of associativity. These versions of Schwarz lemma and Schwarz-Pick lemma are first studied in octonionic setting which will invoke integral representation formula for harmonic function and Möbius transformations. This will generalize the corresponding results which appear in the classical function theory to nonassociative space and may give new energy for the development of physics.},

The nonlinear governing equations of the symmetric rectangular honeycomb sandwich panel subjected to transverse excitations are simplified to a set of two ordinary differential equations by the Galerkin method. Based on the homotopy analysis method, the average equations of the primary resonance and harmonic resonance are obtained. The influence of structural parameters, the transverse exciting force amplitude, and transverse damping to the symmetric rectangular honeycomb sandwich panel are discussed by using the analytic approximation method. Compared with the results obtained by single-mode modeling technique, the results obtained by double-mode modeling technique change the softening and hardening nonlinear characteristics when Ω ≈ ω 1 , ω 1 /3, and ω 2 /3.},
