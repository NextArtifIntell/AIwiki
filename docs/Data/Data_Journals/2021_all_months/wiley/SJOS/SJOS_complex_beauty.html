  abstract     = {Bias approximation has played an important rôle in statistical inference, and numerous bias calculation techniques have been proposed under different contexts. We provide a unified approach to approximating the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator and thel2penalized likelihood estimator for both linear and nonlinear models, where the design variables are allowed to be random and the sample size can be a stopping time. The proposed method is based on the Woodroofe–Stein identity and is justified by very weak approximations. The accuracy of the derived bias formulas is assessed by simulation for several examples. The bias of the ridge estimator in high-dimensional settings is also discussed.},

It is assumed that the covariate affects only the marginal distributions through regression models while the dependence structure, which is described by a copula, is unaffected. A parametric estimation of the copula function is considered with focus on the maximum pseudo-likelihood method. It is proved that under some appropriate regularity assumptions the estimator calculated from the residuals has the same asymptotic distribution as the estimator based on the unobserved errors. In such case one can ignore the fact that the response is first adjusted for the effect of the covariate. The theoretical results are accompanied by a Monte Carlo simulation study which illustrates that the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator based on residuals may behave poorly when the stated regularity assumptions are not satisfied.},

Many approaches have been considered to make them more robust against a broader family of alternatives, including taking linear combinations, or the maximum among a finite collection of them. In this article, we propose as test statistic the supremum of a collection of (potentially infinitely many) weighted log-rank tests where the weight functions belong to the unit ball in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). By using some desirable properties of RKHSs we provide an exact and simple evaluation of the test statistic and establish connections with previous tests in the literature. Additionally, we show that for a special family of RKHSs, the proposed test is omnibus. We finalize by performing an empirical evaluation of the proposed methodology and show an application to a real data scenario.},

It is for the first time that such properties are provided for integer-valued time series models.

In simulation studies, the proposed procedure is shown to perform well in locating the change-point of INARCH models.

When a given censoring time is considered, similar assumptions can be made on the censoring time. This allows for a characterization of so-called pointwise independence as well as full independence of censoring time and event time and type.

Empirical Bayes methods offer a data-driven solution to this problem by estimating the prior itself from an ensemble of data. In the nonparametric case, the maximum likelihood estimate is known to overfit the data, an issue that is commonly tackled by regularization. However, the majority of regularizations are ad hoc choices which lack invariance under reparametrization of the model and result in inconsistent estimates for equivalent models. We introduce a nonparametric, transformation-invariant estimator for the prior distribution. Being defined in terms of the missing information similar to the reference prior, it can be seen as an extension of the latter to the data-driven setting. This implies a natural interpretation as a trade-off between choosing the least informative prior and incorporating the information provided by the data, a symbiosis between the objective and empirical Bayes methodologies.},

In the current article, we consider how the underlying ideas of the EnKF can be applied when the state vector consists of binary variables. While the EnKF relies on Gaussian approximations, we instead introduce a first-order Markov chain approximation. To update the prior ensemble we simulate samples from a distribution which maximizes the expected number of equal components in a prior and posterior state vector. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a simulation experiment where, compared with a more naive updating procedure, we find that it leads to an almost 50\% reduction in the difference between true and estimated marginal filtering probabilities with respect to the Frobenius norm.},

We propose a new class of semiparametric models for recurrent events that simultaneously account for risk factors and correlation among the spatial locations, and that subsumes the current methods. Since the parameters involved in the models are not directly estimable because of the high dimension of the likelihood, we use composite likelihood approach for estimation. The approach leads to estimates with population interpretation where their large sample properties are obtained under a reasonable set of regularity conditions. Simulation studies suggest that the resulting estimators have a very good finite sampling properties.

Despite the popularity of IPW, its performance is often poor due to instability of the estimated weights. We develop an estimating equation-based strategy for the nuisance parameters indexing the weights at each time point, aimed at preventing highly volatile weights and ensuring the stability of IPW estimation. Our proposed approach targets the estimation of the counterfactual mean under a chosen treatment regime and requires fitting a separate propensity score model at each time point. We discuss and examine extensions to enable the fitting of marginal structural models using one propensity score model across all time points. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate adequate performance of our approach compared with the maximum likelihood propensity score estimator and the covariate balancing propensity score estimator.},

  abstract     = {Model uncertainty is a pervasive problem in regression applications. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) takes model uncertainty into account and identifies robust determinants. However, it requires the specification of suitable model priors. Mixture model priors are appealing because they explicitly account for different groups of covariates as robust determinants. Specific Dirichlet process clustering (DPC) model priors are proposed; their correspondence to the binomial model prior derived and methods to perform the BMA analysis including a DPC postprocessing procedure to identify groups of determinants are outlined. The application of these model priors is demonstrated in a simulation exercise and in an empirical analysis of cross-country economic growth data. The BMA analysis is performed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition sampler to obtain samples from the posterior of the model specifications. Results are compared with those obtained under a beta-binomial and a collinearity-adjusted dilution model prior.},

  abstract     = {The question whether structural changes in time-resolved images are of statistical significance or merely emerge from random noise is of great relevance in many practical applications such as live cell fluorescence microscopy, where intracellular diffusion processes are investigated. Using bootstrap-methods, we construct nonparametric confidence bands for time-resolved images from fluorescence microscopy and use these to detect and visualize temporal changes between individual frames in imaging of living cells. We model the images frames as two-dimensional fields of Poisson random variables and provide a strong approximation result for independent and standardized but not necessarily identically distributed Poisson random variables. The latter result is used to derive a limit result for the maximal difference between the reconstructed and the true image. This provides the theoretical foundation of our method. We apply regularization techniques to cope with the ill-posedness of the convolution problem induced by the imaging system. Our approach provides a criterion to assess time-resolved small scale structural changes, for example, in the nanometer range. It can also be adopted for use in other imaging systems. Moreover, a data-driven selection method for the regularization parameter based on statistical multiscale methods is discussed.},

When several possible models are under consideration for the data, multiple imputation is typically performed under a single-best model selected from the candidate models. This single-model selection approach ignores the uncertainty associated with the model selection and so leads to underestimation of the variance of multiple imputation estimator. In this article, we propose a new multiple imputation procedure incorporating model uncertainty in the final inference. The proposed method incorporates possible candidate models for the data into the imputation procedure using the idea of Bayesian model averaging. The proposed method is directly applicable to handling item nonresponse in survey sampling. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are investigated.

The observations consist of binary sequences (along with covariates) for each individual under study. These sequences are modeled as generated by latent Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes being above or below certain thresholds. Features of the latent process and the thresholds are taken as functions of covariates, allowing the researcher to distinguish factors that have an effect on the frailty, from those that have an effect on the variability, of the observational unit. Inference is achieved by a quasi-likelihood approach, for which consistency and asymptotic normality is established. An advantage of our model is that particularities regarding the censoring need not be taken actively into account, and that it is well suited for situations where the individuals under study are irregularly and asynchronously observed. The motivation for our model came from a dataset pertaining to the incidence of diarrhoea among Brazilian children growing up under rather harsh conditions. We analyze these data with our model and contrast the results with an intensity-based counting process analysis of the same data.},

We derive a limit theorem concerning the attractors for the distributions of the aggregated data, which boil down to a new family of max-stable distributions. We also connect the extremal dependence structure of classical max-stable distributions and that of our new family of max-stable distributions. Using an inversion method, we derive a semiparametric composite-estimator for the extremal dependence of the unobservable data, starting from a preliminary estimator of the extremal dependence of the aggregated data.

One solution to this problem is to use the covariate distribution to weight the outcomes such that the data appear randomized. The propensity score is a natural quantity that arises in this setting. Propensity score weights have desirable asymptotic properties, but they often fail to adequately balance covariate data in finite samples. Empirical covariate balancing methods pose as an appealing alternative by exactly balancing the sample moments of the covariate distribution. With this objective in mind, we propose a framework for estimating balancing weights by solving a constrained convex program, where the criterion function to be optimized is a Bregman distance. We then show that the different distances in this class render identical weights to those of other covariate balancing methods. A series of numerical studies are presented to demonstrate these similarities.},

The boosting algorithm provides a simple sequential procedure for updating the weights of the component density functions, until an optimality criterion is satisfied. An extension of this procedure can be useful for composite likelihood inference, in order to specify the weights of the component likelihood objects and, simultaneously, implement parameter estimation. Finally, three applications are presented. The first one regards prediction and inference for autoregressive models, the second one is the use of model pools for prediction in a time series framework, and the third one is the estimation of the covariance and the precision matrices of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Empirical results on real-world financial data are presented in challenging contexts, where we have to deal with a large dataset or with sparse matrices and a large number of unknown parameters.},

Examples are testing whether coordinates of a high-dimensional random vector are uncorrelated, constructing confidence intervals for the risk of optimal portfolios or testing for the stability of a covariance matrix, especially for factor models. Extending previous works to a general high-dimensional multivariate linear process framework and factor models, we establish distributional approximations for the associated bilinear form of the sample covariance matrix. These approximations hold for increasing dimension without any constraint relative to the sample size. The results are used to construct change-point tests for the covariance structure, especially in order to check the stability of a high-dimensional factor model. Tests based on the cumulated sum (CUSUM), self-standardized CUSUM and the CUSUM statistic maximized over all subsamples are considered. Size and power of the proposed testing methodology are investigated by a simulation study and illustrated by analyzing the Fama and French factors for a change due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.},

Being based on a new trimming scheme for the CUSUM process introduced in Horváth et al. (2020), this test is particularly well suited to detect changes that might occur near the endpoints of the sample. A complete asymptotic theory for the test is developed under the null hypothesis of no change in the regression parameter, and consistency of the test is also established in the presence of a parameter change. Monte Carlo simulations show that our test is comparable to existing methods when the errors are homoscedastic. In contrast, existing methods developed for homoscedastic data are demonstrated to be ill-sized and poorly performing in the presence of heteroscedasticity, while the proposed test continues to perform well in heteroscedastic environments. These results are further demonstrated in a study of the linear connection between the price of crude oil and the U.S. dollar, and in detecting changes points in asset pricing models surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.},

The test statistic under the null hypothesis is asymptotically normally distributed. Although it is also based on nonparametric estimation like any local smoothing tests for conditional independence, its behavior is similar to existing local smoothing tests with only the number of covariates under the null hypothesis. Furthermore, it can detect local alternatives distinct from the null at the rate that is also only related to the number of covariates under the null hypothesis. Therefore, the curse of dimensionality is largely alleviated. To achieve the above goal, we also suggest a groupwise least squares estimation for the groupwise central subspace in sufficient dimension reduction. It is of its own importance in estimation theory though it is as a by-product for the model adaptation of test statistic described herewith. Numerical studies and analyses for two real data sets are then conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed test.},

In this article, we propose a novel goodness-of-fit test for the FLMFR against a general, unspecified, alternative. The test statistic is formulated in terms of a Cramér–von Mises norm over a doubly projected empirical process which, using geometrical arguments, yields an easy-to-compute weighted quadratic norm. A resampling procedure calibrates the test through a wild bootstrap on the residuals and the use of convenient computational procedures. As a sideways contribution, and since the statistic requires a reliable estimator of the FLMFR, we discuss and compare several regularized estimators, providing a new one specifically convenient for our test. The finite sample behavior of the test is illustrated via a simulation study. Also, the new proposal is compared with previous significance tests. Two novel real data sets illustrate the application of the new test.},

Various methods have been proposed for case-cohort data when the dimension of covariates is smaller than sample size. However, limited work has been done for high-dimensional case-cohort data which are frequently collected in large epidemiological studies. In this paper, we propose a variable screening method for ultrahigh-dimensional case-cohort data under the framework of proportional model, which allows the covariate dimension increases with sample size at exponential rate. Our procedure enjoys the sure screening property and the ranking consistency under some mild regularity conditions. We further extend this method to an iterative version to handle the scenarios where some covariates are jointly important but are marginally unrelated or weakly correlated to the response. The finite sample performance of the proposed procedure is evaluated via both simulation studies and an application to a real data from the breast cancer study.},

This implies that the popular max-stable models are inadequate to capture the rate of joint tail decay, and to estimate joint extremal probabilities beyond observed levels. We here develop a more flexible modeling framework based on the class of max-infinitely divisible processes, which extend max-stable processes while retaining dependence properties that are natural for maxima. We propose two parametric constructions for max-infinitely divisible models, which relax the max-stability property but remain close to some popular max-stable models obtained as special cases. The first model considers maxima over a finite, random number of independent observations, while the second model generalizes the spectral representation of max-stable processes. Inference is performed using a pairwise likelihood. We illustrate the benefits of our new modeling framework on Dutch wind gust maxima calculated over different time units. Results strongly suggest that our proposed models outperform other natural models, such as the Student-tcopula process and its max-stable limit, even for large block sizes.},

Here, we have developed a variable selection method for aK-outcome model (multivariate regression) that identifies the most important covariates across all outcomes. The prior for all regression coefficients is a mean zero normal with coefficient-specific variance term that consists of a predictor-specific factor (shared local shrinkage parameter) and a model-specific factor (global shrinkage term) that differs in each model.

  abstract     = {We address the identifiability and estimation of recursive max-linear structural equation models represented by an edge-weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG). Such models are generally unidentifiable and we identify the whole class of DAG s and edge weights corresponding to a given observational distribution. For estimation, standard likelihood theory cannot be applied because the corresponding families of distributions are not dominated. Given the underlying DAG, we present an estimator for the class of edge weights and show that it can be considered a generalized maximum likelihood estimator. In addition, we develop a simple method for identifying the structure of the DAG. With probability tending to one at an exponential rate with the number of observations, this method correctly identifies the class of DAGs and, similarly, exactly identifies the possible edge weights.},

Our approach is based on TJADE andk-JADE, two recently proposed generalizations of the classical JADE algorithm. Our novel method achieves the consistency and the limiting distribution of TJADE under mild assumptions and at the same time offers notable improvement in computational speed. Detailed mathematical proofs of the statistical properties of our method are given and, as a special case, a conjecture on the properties ofk-JADE is resolved. Simulations and timing comparisons demonstrate remarkable gain in speed. Moreover, the desired efficiency is obtained approximately for finite samples. The method is applied successfully to large-scale video data, for which neither TJADE nork-JADE is feasible. Finally, an experimental procedure is proposed to select the values of a set of tuning parameters. Supplementary material including the R-code for running the examples and the proofs of the theoretical results is available online.},

For the simulation, we utilize numerical approximation schemes based on truncation and discretization of stochastic integrals and we analyze the associated simulation errors in detail.

  abstract     = {Estimating function inference is indispensable for many common point process models where the joint intensities are tractable while the likelihood function is not. In this article, we establish asymptotic normality of estimating function estimators in a very general setting of nonstationary point processes. We then adapt this result to the case of nonstationary determinantal point processes, which are an important class of models for repulsive point patterns. In practice, often first- and second-order estimating functions are used. For the latter, it is a common practice to omit contributions for pairs of points separated by a distance larger than some truncation distance, which is usually specified in an ad hoc manner. We suggest instead a data-driven approach where the truncation distance is adapted automatically to the point process being fitted and where the approach integrates seamlessly with our asymptotic framework. The good performance of the adaptive approach is illustrated via simulation studies for non-stationary determinantal point processes and by an application to a real dataset.},

The proposed model follows a generalized linear model approach where the random component, conditioned on the past information, follows a beta distribution, while the conditional mean specification may include covariates and also an extra additive term given by the iteration of a map that can present chaotic behavior. The resulting model is very flexible and its systematic component can accommodate short- and long-range dependence, periodic behavior, laminar phases, etc. We derive easily verifiable conditions for the stationarity of the proposed model, as well as conditions for the law of large numbers and a Birkhoff-type theorem to hold. A Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to assess the finite sample behavior of the partial maximum likelihood approach for parameter estimation in the proposed model. Finally, an application to the proportion of stored hydroelectrical energy in Southern Brazil is presented.},

We propose a calibrated imputation approach so that valid point and variance estimates of the population (or domain) totals can be computed by the secondary users using simple complete-sample formulae. This is especially helpful for variance estimation, which generally require additional information and tools that are unavailable to the secondary users. Our approach is natural for continuous variables, where the estimation may be either based on reweighting or imputation, including possibly their outlier-robust extensions. We also propose a multivariate procedure to accommodate the estimation of the covariance matrix between estimated population totals, which facilitates variance estimation of the ratios or differences among the estimated totals. We illustrate the proposed approach using simulation data in supplementary materials that are available online.},

We propose a profile likelihood to efficiently estimate both parameter and nonparametric function. The main difference from the classical profile likelihood is that the profile likelihood proposed is a functional of the base measure function, instead of a function of a real variable. By making the most of the structure information of the semiparametric exponential family, we get an explicit expression of the estimator of the least favorable curve. It ensures that the new profile likelihood is computationally simple. Due to the use of the least favorable curve, the semiparametric efficiency is achieved successfully and the estimation bias is reduced significantly. Simulation studies can illustrate that our proposal is much better than the existing methodologies for most cases under study, and is robust to the different model conditions.},
