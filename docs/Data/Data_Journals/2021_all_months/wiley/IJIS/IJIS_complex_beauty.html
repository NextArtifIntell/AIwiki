  abstract     = {To cope with awkward and unreliable information in daily life issues, the theory of interval-valued picture fuzzy set (IVPFS) is a useful idea to manage unpredictable and vague information. An IVPFS contains the degree of truth, abstinence, and falsity in the finite subset of a unit interval with a rule that is the sum of the upper parts of all degrees is cannot exceed from unit interval. In this study, to find the interrelationships among any number of IVPFSs, we examined the interval-valued picture fuzzy frank averaging operator, interval-valued picture fuzzy frank weighted averaging operator, interval-valued picture fuzzy frank weighted geometric operator and discussed their properties. Moreover, some special cases of the presented operators based on IVPFSs are also discovered. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) by using the IVPFSs is also explored and discussed in their different aspects. Finally, a multiattribute decision-making procedure is investigated by using proposed operators based on IVPFSs. We illustrated some numerical examples based on explored frank aggregation operators and AHP methods to examine the feasibility and validity of the presented approaches. The comparative analysis, geometrical representations, advantages of the investigated approaches are also discussed.},

This study proposes a novel framework UANA (Uncertainty-Aware Network Alignment) to tackle the limitations of the existing works. By embedding nodes as Gaussian distributions rather than point vectors, UANA enables to capture the uncertainty of a node representation, while being able to discriminate the anchor nodes from the potentially confusing neighbors. We address the P2P matching constraint by introducing an adversarial learning paradigm, which relaxes the exact matching assumption during training with an across-domain generative procedure to reduce the matching errors on testing nodes. In the end, interpretability methods are included to explain the aligning results made by our UANA based on the robust statistics, which enables the explanation of the effect of individual training sample on the NA performance without the need of retraining the model. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets demonstrate that UANA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines while providing explainable results.},

  abstract     = {User rating of a service is the explicit behavior of users expressing their preference for the service. Most exciting recommendation methods focus on predicting user-service ratings according to users&#39; historical rating behaviors. However, the behavior of users invoking services is implicit feedback. By analyzing the services called by users, mining their potential semantic representations can also help model users&#39; hidden interests. To this end, how to integrate the implicit feedback and explicit rating of users to provide users with better recommendation experience is a problem to be addressed for service recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel latent semantic integrated explicit rating (LSIER) scheme to recommend services to users. The LSIER scheme is designed by integrating the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model and the probabilistic latent semantic index (PLSI) model. consists of the two stages: (1) the PMF model is used to generate a user feature matrix and a service feature matrix, and the two feature matrices are updated to complete the missing service score records of the users, and (2) the PLSI model is used to train users access records, where an expectation maximization algorithm is applied to derive the model parameters to realize unsupervised soft clustering of services. When the user gives explicit or implicit feedback to the service, the LSIER scheme can identify the current interest probability distribution of the user according to the category to which the called service belongs, and provide the user with a list of service recommendations with scores. The performance of the proposed LSIER scheme is evaluated using the Netflix data set and the Movielens data set. Experiments show that the scheme can achieve better recommendation accuracy and recall rate than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The multidimensional classification of multivariate time series deals with the assignment of multiple classes to time-ordered data described by a set of feature variables. Although this challenging task has received almost no attention in the literature, it is present in a wide variety of domains, such as medicine, finance or industry. The complexity of this problem lies in two nontrivial tasks, the learning with multivariate time series in continuous time and the simultaneous classification of multiple class variables that may show dependencies between them. These can be addressed with different strategies, but most of them may involve a difficult preprocessing of the data, high space and classification complexity or ignoring useful interclass dependencies. Additionally, no attention has been given to the development of new multidimensional classifiers of time series based on probabilistic graphical models, even though transparent models can facilitate further understanding of the domain. In this paper, a novel probabilistic graphical model is proposed, which is able to classify a discrete multivariate temporal sequence into multiple class variables while modeling their dependencies. This model extends continuous time Bayesian networks to the multidimensional classification problem, which are able to explicitly represent the behavior of time series that evolve over continuous time. Different methods for the learning of the parameters and structure of the model are presented, and numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data show encouraging results in terms of performance and learning time with respect to independent classifiers, the current alternative approach under the continuous time Bayesian network paradigm.},

  abstract     = {The distance measure between intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is a concept of very contemporary interest among the researchers in the field of decision-makings, such as pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, and multiattribute decision-making (MADM) problems. Consequently, diverse distance measures are developed and used in determining the similarity and dissimilarity between IFSs. In the existing methods, the distance measures are calculated based on the geometry of the IFSs. However, the IFSs hold information about the elements in a set. As such, some of the existing distance measures are misleading and unreasonable. Hence, in this paper, a nonlinear distance formula is devised to follow the problem definition. Further, by explicitly proving the distance properties, it is being established that the distance formula is a distance measure. Further, theories for the construction of distance measures are developed. The convex combination of two distance measures is also a distance measure is being proved explicitly. Furthermore, based on the proposed distance measures, similarity measures have been developed. Aside from that, an intriguing idea has been introduced, namely, that an infinite number of distance measures can be constructed from a given pair of distance measures. Additionally, the proposed distance and similarity measures are applied to a variety of problems, including medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, and a MADM problem in COVID-19 face mask selection, where the legitimacy and applicability of the proposed advanced distance measure is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a multicriteria group decision-making methodology with probabilistic linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy sets (PLqROFSs). The benefit of choosing PLqROFSs is that they consider the simultaneous occurrence of stochastic and nonstochastic uncertainty and so are superior to probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets, linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy sets. To develop the methodology, we first propose two types of operators, namely, probabilistic linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy weighted Generalized Dombi operator which gives the flexibility of choosing the parameter values and probabilistic linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy weighted Generalized Dombi Bonferroni mean operator which can consider the interrelationships between criteria. Since both the subjective and objective weights of experts are hardly considered in the current PLqROFSs-based research, so in our proposed methodology, we deploy the thought of consistency and similarity between the experts to calculate the subjective and objective weights, respectively, of the experts and as a result the evaluation results do not get malformed. For measuring the weights of criteria, the gray correlation coefficient of the assessment value of criteria is used to reflect the similarity between the criteria and its reference value. To exhibit the applicability of the proposed operators, we provide a case study on biomass feedstock selection. Moreover, to make sure that our model is stable, we have investigated a sensitivity analysis of parameters. At the end, we make a comparison of our approach to different existing schemes.},

Induced by the large implementation of renewable energy, the more complexities and uncertainties in the future carbon-neutral energy systems make their designs hard accessible to the conventional methods, so machine learning (ML) especially the neural network becomes under focus. Here, we design a deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks (DL-CNN) known for its powerful predicting ability, and first utilize it in a case study of performance prediction of supercritical CO Brayton cycle. The design paradigm of DL-CNN architecture for performance prediction of power cycle is proposed. We also summarize the commonly used fully connected neural network (FC-NN) in related studies of power cycle design. Through systematically comparing the prediction performance of DL-CNN and FC-NN, their respective advantages and application scenarios in energy system design are discussed. In addition, a multiobjective design approach based on DL-CNN combined with random search is proposed and proved to be feasible by comparing with genetic algorithm. The results show that our proposed DL-CNN model is much more competitive than FC-NN model when the training data is sufficient and the prediction condition is complex, in which the prediction accuracy can achieve 99.6\%. In the future, our deep learning model may help solve the complex design problems of hybrid carbon-neutral energy systems.},

AHHO mimics the hunting behavior of Harris Hawks and is modified to draw a synergy between exploration and exploitation by conducting neighborhood search of already visited iterations utilizing random exploratory forage and local random forage. The oppositional based learning has been incorporated to generate adequate diversity among solutions. The proposed algorithm is substantiated on a set of 23 standard benchmark functions to test its characteristics in finding optimal solutions. The algorithm is mathematically modeled in the current work to obtain solution for voltage constrained reactive power dispatch (VCRPD) problem for IEEE 57 and 118 bus systems. The proposed method of VCRPD is implemented first with shunt capacitors as var sources and then replacing them with static var compensator (SVC) for improved performance. The optimal placement of SVC is determined by fast voltage stability index method. The proposed AHHO algorithm reduces the transmission losses by 9.42\% with shunt capacitors in IEEE 57 bus and 10.344\% in IEEE 118 bus system. Similarly, transmission loss with SVC compensated system is reduced by 12.86\% in IEEE 57 bus and 14.74\% in IEEE 118 bus system. Results reveal the proposed technique has the potent to solve real world optimization problems and is competitive with recent methods reported in state-of- art literature.},

  abstract     = {The majority of forecasting methods use a physical time scale for studying price fluctuations of financial markets. Using physical time scales can make companies oblivious to significant activities in the market as the flow of time is discontinuous, which could translate to missed profitable opportunities or risk exposure. Directional changes (DC) has gained attention in the recent years by translating physical time series to event-based series. Under this framework, trend reversals can be predicted by using the length of events. Having this knowledge allows traders to take an action before such reversals happen and thus increase their profitability. In this paper, we investigate how classification algorithms can be incorporated in the process of predicting trend reversals to create DC-based trading strategies. The effect of the proposed trend reversal estimation is measured on 20 foreign exchange markets over a 10-month period in a total of 1000 data sets. We compare our results across 16 algorithms, both DC and non-DC based, such as technical analysis and buy-and-hold. Our findings show that the introduction of classification leads to return higher profit and statistically outperform all other trading strategies.},

Here, the supplier offers an upstream full trade credit to the retailer and the retailer in turn, provides a downstream partial trade credit to her/his customers. Demand rate is assumed to be functionally depends upon carbon emissions, unit selling price and the length of the credit period offered by the retailer to their customers explicitly. Taking a case study, we develop a profit maximization crisp problem first then considering the unit selling price and the carbon elasticity as fuzzy numbers we formulate an equivalent fuzzy problem. After that, the fuzzy problem has been defuzzified with the help of general fuzzy system and the new volumetric fuzzy system under two different scenarios namely with and without carbon emissions also. The aim of this study is to develop a best methodology over fuzzy system on trade credit financing problem so as to optimize the average profit function over the optimum design variables the credit period, the order quantity, the cycle time, the partial shortage time and minimum carbon emissions, respectively. Finally, numerical illustrations and its comparative study with the existing methods, sensitivity analysis and graphical illustrations are performed to justify the novelty of the proposed approach.},

Neutrosophic set is defined with three-dimensional membership functions to describe the degrees of truth, indeterminacy, and falsity. Neutrosophic set theory is a useful instrument to handle incomplete, inconsistent, and indeterminate information. In this paper, we first propose a modified score function for ranking single-valued neutrosophic numbers. Then, we suggest a TOPSIS method based on the proposed function for decision-making under group recommendation. The method is applied to deal with the hotel location selection problem, where the decision values of the attributes for alternatives and the weights of the attributes are given by decision-makers based on single-valued neutrosophic sets.

  abstract     = {Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) methods aim at integrating an optimal partition from a set of precalculated kernel matrices. Though achieving success in various applications, we observe that existing MKC methods: (i) lack of representation flexibility; and (ii) do not considerably preserve the locality structure in partition space. These issues may adversely affect the learning procedure of MKC, leading to unsatisfying clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a late fusion MKC method with local graph refinement to address the aforementioned issues. Different from existing MKC mechanisms, our method unifies the traditional weighted multiple kernel k-means, kernel partition, and graph construction into a single optimization procedure. The local graph is utilized to preserve the locality information in partition space and therefore all of the counterparts can be boosted for mutual clustering improvements. By this way, our approach enhances the local graph structure in partition space and enjoys more flexible kernel representations, leading to significant clustering improvements. Moreover, a three-step alternate algorithm is developed to solve the resultant optimization problem with proved convergence. Extensive experiments are conducted on several multiple kernel benchmark datasets to compare the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art ones, and the results well demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.},

Considering the millisecond level response time in the era of 5G, there are higher demands on the efficiency and accuracy that may be a pair of contradictions in wildcard searchable encryption. To improve the efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy, we put forward a novel scheme, tree-based index scheme (TBIS), through filtering the search results step by step instead of enumeration in the prior works and in the instantiation of TBIS, the search time drops sharply to the millisecond level. By using more kinds of characters, the accuracy of search result is improved visibly. TBIS achieves nonadaptive security that is indistinguishable against chosen character set attacks proposed in this paper. The security criteria can capture the relationship among characters, keywords and documents. At last, we put forward a frame structure in machine learning as an application of the proposed scheme.},

In this work, we propose a novel approach for opponent&#39;s policy explanation and intention inference based on the behavioral portrait of opponent. Specifically, we use the multiagent deep deterministic policy gradients (MADDPG) algorithm to train the agent and opponent in the competitive environment, and collect the behavioral data of opponent based on agent&#39;s observations. Then we perform pattern segmentation and extract the opponent&#39;s behavior events via Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering (TICC) algorithm; hence the opponent&#39;s behavior data can be encoded into a knowledge graph, named opponent&#39;s behavior knowledge graph (OKG). Based on this, we built a question-answer system (QA system) to query and match opponent historical information in OKG, so that the agent can obtain additional experience and gradually infer the intention of opponent with the episodes of iteration. We evaluate the proposed method on the competitive scenario in multiagent particle environment (MPE). Simulation results show that the agents are able to learn better policies with opponent portrait in competitive settings.},

Although the two-tailed sign test is likely the most common nonparametric test for location problems, practitioners face serious drawbacks, such as its lack of statistical power and its inapplicability when information regarding data and hypotheses is uncertain or imprecise. In this paper, we generalize the two-tailed sign test by embedding fuzzy hypotheses caused by uncertainty/imprecision regarding linguistic statements on fractions of underlying quantiles. By achieving this objective, (1) crucial limitations of the common two-tailed sign test are mitigated/overcome, (2) various further strengths are incorporated into the sign test (e.g., meeting the trade-off between point- and interval-valued hypotheses, facilitated formulation of fuzzy hypotheses, standardization of membership functions), and (3) shortcomings that often come along with fuzzy hypothesis testing are avoided (e.g., higher complexity, fuzzy test decision, possibilistic interpretation of test results). In addition, we conduct a comprehensive case study using a real data set on the psychosocial status during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the case study clearly indicate that the generalized two-tailed sign test is preferable to the two-tailed sign test with point- or interval-valued hypotheses.},

  abstract     = {Online action recognition is an important task for human-centered intelligent services. However, it remains a highly challenging problem due to the high varieties and uncertainties of spatial and temporal scales of human actions. In this paper, the following core ideas are proposed to deal with the online action recognition problem. First, we combine spatial and temporal skeleton features to represent human actions, which include not only geometrical features, but also multiscale motion features, such that both spatial and temporal information of the actions are covered. We use an efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network to fuse spatial and temporal features and train them for action recognition. Second, we propose a group sampling method to combine the previous action frames and current action frames, which are based on the hypothesis that the neighboring frames are largely redundant, and the sampling mechanism ensures that the long-term contextual information is also considered. Third, the skeletons from multiview cameras are fused in a distributed manner, which can improve the human pose accuracy in the case of occlusions. Finally, we propose a Restful style based client-server service architecture to deploy the proposed online action recognition module on the remote server as a public service, such that camera networks for online action recognition can benefit from this architecture due to the limited onboard computational resources. We evaluated our model on the data sets of JHMDB and UT-Kinect, which achieved highly promising accuracy levels of 80.1\% and 96.9\%, respectively. Our online experiments show that our memory group sampling mechanism is far superior to the traditional sliding window.},

Various Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for designing intelligent IDS. However, DL techniques face an issue of overfitting because of complex network structure and high-dimensional data sets. Dropout and regularization are two competently perceived concepts of DL used for handling overfitting issue to enhance the performance of DL techniques. In this paper, we aim to apply fusion of various regularization techniques, namely, L1, L2, and elastic net regularization, with dropout regularization technique, for analyzing and enhancing the performance of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based IDS. Experiments are performed using NSL-KDD, UNSW_NB-15, and CIC-IDS-2017 data sets. The value of dropout probability is derived using GridSearchCV-based hyperparameter optimization technique. Moreover, the paper also implements state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques for the performance comparison. Apart from DNN, we have also presented performance analysis of various DL techniques, namely, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Convolutional Neural Network using a fusion of regularization techniques for intrusion detection and classification. The empirical study shows that among the techniques implemented, dropout has proved to be more effective compared with L1, L2, and elastic net regularization. Moreover, fusion of dropout with other regularization techniques achieved better results compared with L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and elastic net regularization, individually. The techniques implemented for DNN-based IDS are also statistically tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.},

Moreover, the weight determination and information aggregation in the PROMETHEE model still suffer from an excessive dependence of decision makers&#39; (DMs&#39;) subjective judgments and the lack of considering the interrelationship among criteria. To solve the aforementioned drawbacks and provide DMs with a reliable and robust method of MCDM, a novel PROMETHEE method based on the rung orthopair fuzzy sets, that is, ROF-PROMETHEE model, is presented herein. First, the PROMETHEE-II method is extended to -rung orthopair fuzzy (-ROF) environment, which not only handles the uncertainty of human cognition but also provides DMs with a broader space to represent their decisions information. Second, a new optimization model is constructed based on the proposed cross entropy and ROF entropy, which is capable of leveraging the preference of DMs to obtain the optimal objective weights among criteria. In addition, the ROF weighted Hamy mean operator is embedded in the preference information aggregation of the PROMETHEE method so as to deal with the interrelationship among criteria. Finally, ROF-PROMETHEE is applied to a hospital performance evaluation case to demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s superiority, validity, and feasibility.},

Subsequently, two optimization models are established for deriving the complete IV-ROFPRs and acceptably additive consistent IV-ROFPRs. Inspired by the Markov model, the weight-generating method is designed to obtain the weights of decision makers. For the purpose of improving the consensus level, a modification process is constructed under the consideration of minimizing the deviations between the adjusted IV-ROFPRs and the original ones. Afterward, a goal programming model is constructed to derive the normalized -rung orthopair fuzzy (-ROF) priority weights. The interval-valued -rung orthopair fuzzy (IV-ROF) priority weights of alternatives are further determined. Thus, an algorithm for the GDM method with IV-ROFPRs is completed.

  abstract     = {The q-rung orthopair sets (q-ROFSs) is an extended version of conventional orthopair fuzzy sets, such as intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs). The most appealing feature of q-ROFSs is that they provide a wider range of reasonable membership grades and offer decision makers (DMs) more leeway in expressing their legitimate perceptions. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs) play a vital role in computational intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and artificial intelligence. We develop numerous generalized aggregation operators (AOs) for information fusion of q-ROFNs to address some drawbacks of existing AOs. For this objective, we enhance the existing AOs by adding pairs of hesitation within the membership functions, and as a result, we introduce new operational rules for q-ROFNs utilizing Einstein norm operations. Based on suggested operational laws, we introduce new AOs namely “q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted geometric operator,” “q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive ordered weighted geometric operator,” “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted geometric operator,” “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive ordered weighted geometric operator,” and “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive hybrid geometric operator.” Then, certain special cases of proposed AOs are explored and their some essential characteristics are described. A new multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is devised with the help of suggested AOs for modeling uncertainties in the real-life problems. Additionally, a practical application of proposed MCDM approach is presented. Moreover, the comparison analysis, sensitivity analysis and authenticity analysis of proposed MCDM approach with existing approaches is also presented to discuss the feasibility, authenticity, and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, radio broadcasting plays an important role in people&#39;s daily life. However, unauthorized broadcasting stations may seriously interfere with normal broadcastings and further disrupt the management of civilian spectrum resources. Since they are easily hidden in the spectrum and are essentially the same as normal signals, it still remains challenging to automatically and effectively identify unauthorized broadcastings in complicated electromagnetic environments. In this paper, we introduce the manifold regularization-based deep convolutional autoencoder (MR-DCAE) model for unauthorized broadcasting identification. The specifically designed autoencoder (AE) is optimized by entropy-stochastic gradient descent, then the reconstruction errors in the testing phase can be adopted to determine whether the received signals are authorized. To make this indicator more discriminative, we design a similarity estimator for manifolds spanning various dimensions as the penalty term to ensure their invariance during the back-propagation of gradients. In theory, the consistency degree between discrete approximations in the manifold regularization (MR) and the continuous objects that motivate them can be guaranteed under an upper bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that MR has been successfully applied in AE to promote cross-layer manifold invariance. Finally, MR-DCAE is evaluated on the benchmark data set AUBI2020, and comparative experiments show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. To help understand the principle behind MR-DCAE, convolution kernels and activation maps of test signals are both visualized. It can be observed that the expert knowledge hidden in normal signals can be extracted and emphasized, rather than simple overfitting.},

Existing M2AL solutions suffer high query costs for scrutinizing all relevant labels of MIML samples, querying excessive bag–label or instance–label pairs. To address these issues, a Cost-effective M2AL solution (CM2AL) is presented. CM2AL first selects the most informative bag–label pairs by leveraging uncertainty, label correlations, label space sparsity, and informativeness from queried instances of the bag, and thus avoids scrutinizing all labels. Next, it queries the most probably positive instance–label pairs of the selected bag–label pair. Particularly, if the feedback is positive, the bag is positively annotated with the label. For negative feedback, it further leverages the label of the neighborhood bags and the label of the nearby instances of queried instances of this bag, if the suggested labels from bag- and instance-levels disagree, CM2AL temporally gives up querying this bag–label pair and moves to another most informativeness one; otherwise, it takes the agreed label to annotate the bag, which further saves the cost by avoiding the excessive query. Extensive experiments on MIML data sets from diverse domains show that CM2AL can more reduce the cost while managing a better performance than state-of-the-art methods, the collaboration between bags and instances contributes to the saved cost.},

The malicious script, like, JavaScript, is a major threat to computer networks in terms of network security. Here, the JavaScript allows the programmers not only to build advanced client-side interfaces for web-based applications but also utilized for carrying out attacks that may steal the user&#39;s confidential data. In addition, the attackers can easily induce malicious JavaScript into webpages for implanting attacks, like, phishing, spreading viruses, and Trojan horses. This paper devises a novel method, namely, Taylor–Harris Hawks Optimization driven deep long short-term memory (Taylor–HHO-based Deep LSTM) for malicious JavaScript discovery. Initially, the JavaScript is subjected as input to feature extraction in which certain features, such as time of execution, function calls, condition statement, break statement, loop statements, Boolean, number of lines, and number of O(N) loops, are extracted. The obtained features are fed to transformation, wherein log transformation is applied for data transformation. The obtained transformed features are fused using information gain and Deep LSTM. Furthermore, the proposed Taylor–HHO-based Deep LSTM is employed for discovering malevolent JavaScript. The proposed Taylor–HHO-based Deep LSTM provided enhanced performance with the highest accuracy of 0.955, minimal FPR of 0.059, and highest TPR of 0.967.},

Moreover, another FTS model is developed to predict the ultimate stress and the ultimate strain of FRP-confined concrete. A comparative analysis is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. As compared with the well-known design-oriented models applied to 69 experiments, the root mean square error is decreased more than 50\% by the proposed model. Also, the effects of input features on the physical behavior of the specimens as described by the proposed model are consistent with the relevant theories and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Deep autoencoder-based methods are the majority of deep anomaly detection. An autoencoder learning on training data is assumed to produce higher reconstruction error for the anomalous samples than the normal samples and thus can distinguish anomalies from normal data. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice, especially in unsupervised anomaly detection, where the training data is anomaly contaminated. We observe that the autoencoder generalizes so well on the training data that it can reconstruct both the normal data and the anomalous data well, leading to poor anomaly detection performance. Besides, we find that anomaly detection performance is not stable when using reconstruction error as anomaly score, which is unacceptable in the unsupervised scenario. Because there are no labels to guide on selecting a proper model. To mitigate these drawbacks for autoencoder-based anomaly detection methods, we propose an Improved AutoEncoder for unsupervised Anomaly Detection (IAEAD). Specifically, we manipulate feature space to make normal data points closer using anomaly detection-based loss as guidance. Different from previous methods, by integrating the anomaly detection-based loss and autoencoder&#39;s reconstruction loss, IAEAD can jointly optimize for anomaly detection tasks and learn representations that preserve the local data structure to avoid feature distortion. Experiments on five image data sets empirically validate the effectiveness and stability of our method.},

Specifically, the difference in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of two blocks is calculated based on three directions in the neighborhood, called the tri-directional correlation (TriDC). Additionally, the representative alternating current (AC) coefficients along horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, which can describe structural patterns, are projected and merged for TriDC differences. Then, the difference of the DCT coefficient is modulated to a predefined zone depending on the JND-based offset. Finally, the extent of the watermarked AC coefficients is determined with perceptual JND adjustment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can protect most common image processing attacks; and has better robustness compared with recent zone modulation watermarking schemes and traditional watermarking methods.},

  abstract     = {Trust has been widely recognized as particularly significant among the factors influencing team performance. Trust directly impacts team performance as it plays a pivotal role in the decisions that each team member (each agent) makes regarding their own actions and their interactions with fellow team members (other agents). Hence, determining the appropriate actions of each agent in the team based on perceived trust information is critical to ensure optimal team performance. However, there is no generic mechanism dedicated to such a problem. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel trust architecture which integrates differentiated trust with response strategies. Differentiated trust is multidimensional trust with each trust dimension representing trust in an agent&#39;s abilities to perform the task associated with that dimension. With differentiated trust, an agent can differentiate the trustworthiness of another agent in performing different subtasks (a secondary task or a portion of the primary task). To further fulfill the transition from perceptual trust to practical actions, responses strategies are introduced. Each response strategy associates trust levels with the available actions through a distinct deterministic strategy. The high dimensional trust enabled by the differentiated trust is used as the input of a response strategy for more nuanced manipulation of the interactions. The impact of the proposed trust architecture is demonstrated through an experimental investigation. A platform simulating team performance is built based on a food foraging task. Scenarios embodying different types and proportions of a priori flawed agents are introduced to enable the system to distinguish between agents in terms of trust; thus, providing a potential to optimize team performance through the trust architecture. It is demonstrated that the proposed trust architecture enables optimized team performance in various scenarios involving agents with different trustworthiness by the appropriate determination of each agent&#39;s actions in the interactive teamwork.},

  abstract     = {Determination of image authenticity usually requires the identification and localization of the manipulated regions of images. Hence, image manipulation detection has become one of the most important tasks in the field of multimedia forensics. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved promising performance in image manipulation detection. However, it is hard for the existing CNN-based manipulation detection approaches to accurately identify and localize the manipulated regions that have undergone geometric transformations, since CNNs are limited by their inability to be geometrically invariant. To address this issue, we propose a geometric rectification-based neural network architecture for image manipulation detection. In this type of network architecture, following the detection of a set of potential manipulated regions (PMRs) using Region Proposal Network, the Spatial Transformer Network is employed to geometrically rectify the convolutional feature maps (CFMs) of these regions to obtain the geometrically rectified CFMs (GR-CFMs). Subsequently, the residual feature maps (RFMs) are computed to capture the characteristic inconsistency between the CFMs and GR-CFMs of each PMR. Finally, the computed RFMs are automatically integrated with the GR-CFMs by a designed attention module to determine whether each PMR is a manipulated region and to localize the manipulated part at the pixel-level. Extensive experiments on the public data set as well as on our challenging data set demonstrate that the proposed network architecture achieves desirable performance in identifying and localizing regions with common tampering artifacts, which involve geometric transformations.},

  abstract     = {The adjusting of autonomous vehicles (AVs) steering angle represents a challenging issue in the intelligent vehicular applications. Among different control strategies, the model predictive control (MPC) is devoted to providing efficacious steering control for the AVs. However, the formulation of MPC with a few parameters is the main challenge to overcome the complicated computation that happens due to the long prediction and control horizons. Hybridization between discrete-time Laguerre function (DTLF) and MPC is suggested to formulate the MPC with few parameters. While the hybrid DTLF–MPC requires an adequate tuning technique for their gains to improve the system performance. A new low computational burden design is proposed in this paper to adjust the gains of the hybrid DTLF–MPC based on the social ski driver algorithm (SSDA). This algorithm is developed as a recently artificial intelligence technique. The tuned hybrid DTLF–MPC by SSDA is devoted to control AV&#39;s steering angle. Furthermore, the proposed system takes into account the vision dynamics. The system performance based on the tuned DTLF–MPC by SSDA is evaluated with the MPC based on the neural network algorithm for comparison. Different scenarios are carried out to confirm the superiority of the suggested control mechanism to handle small as well as large-scale variations of road curvatures.},

This paper proposes a framework for emotion-based classification from social streams, such as Twitter, according to Plutchik&#39;s wheel of emotions. An entropy-based weighted version of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm, called EwFCM, to classify the data collected from streams has been proposed, improved by a fuzzy entropy method for the FCM center cluster initialization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides high accuracy in the classification of tweets according to Plutchik&#39;s primary emotions; moreover, the framework also allows the detection of secondary emotions, which, as defined by Plutchik, are the combination of the primary emotions. Finally, a comparative analysis with a similar fuzzy clustering-based approach for emotion classification shows that EwFCM converges more quickly with better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and runtime. Finally, a straightforward mapping between the computed clusters and the emotion-based classes allows the assessment of the classification quality, reporting coherent and consistent results.},

  abstract     = {When dealing with complex models (i.e., models with many variables, a high degree of dependency between variables, or many states per variable), the efficient representation of quantitative information in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) is a challenging task. To address this problem, this study introduces several new structures, aptly named (VBPs), which are based exclusively on the values. VBPs leverage repeated values to reduce memory requirements. In the present paper, they are compared with some common structures, like standard tables or unidimensional arrays, and probability trees (PT). Like VBPs, PTs are designed to reduce the memory space, but this is achieved only if value repetitions correspond to context-specific independence patterns (i.e., repeated values are related to consecutive indices or configurations). VBPs are devised to overcome this limitation. The goal of this study is to analyze the properties of VBPs. We provide a theoretical analysis of VBPs and use them to encode the quantitative information of a set of well-known Bayesian networks, measuring the access time to their content and the computational time required to perform some inference tasks.},

First, a novel distance measure of PLTSs is defined, and then a distance-based entropy measure and similarity measure are proposed. Subsequently, supposing that elements are independent of each other, an induced generalized PL-ordered weighted average (IG-PLOWA) operator and an induced generalized PL hybrid average (IG-PLHA) operator are introduced. Afterwards, considering some cases in which elements are interactive, an induced generalized probabilistic linguistic Shapley hybrid average (IG-PLSHA) operator is presented, and some desirable properties of this operator are further studied. Fusing the entropy and similarity degrees of decision makers (DMs), DM weights are determined objectively. Then, considering the interactions among attributes and the psychological behaviors of DMs, the models for obtaining the fuzzy measures on the attribute set are built based on the Shapley values and the prospect theory. Finally, taking DMs&#39; risk attitudes into account, an integrated decision making method based on the IG-PLSHA operator is developed. At length, an example is provided to illustrate the feasibility and practicality of the developed method.},

In this study, the introduction of two new generalised measures (entropy and Jensen–Tsalli divergence measure) of q-rung orthopair fuzzy information involving one real parameter is given. The proposed measures have satisfied all the necessary mathematical properties of being a measure. Then the introduced entropy and divergence measure is used to obtain the objective weights. Based on the proposed entropy and divergence measure, we proposed a new decision method to deal with multiple-attribute group decision-making problems under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment. Then, on the basis of the TODIM and VIKOR techniques, an integrated TODIM-VIKOR approach is developed to solve multiattribute group decision-making problem. In this paper, TODIM aims to determine the overall dominance degree and VIKOR aims to determine the compromise solution. Lastly, we handle a supplier selection problem to verify the performance of the proposed q-rung orthopair fuzzy TODIM-VIKOR method and results explore the reliability and effectiveness of our proposed methodology by comparing the ranking solution with the ranking results of the existing approaches.},

In dealing with an OHS risk analysis problem, it is a crucial step and also a big challenge to assess the risk of occupational hazards. Normally, domain experts tend to use qualitative words to express the risk of occupational hazards due to the fuzziness of human cognition, and multiple risk criteria are often involved in the OHS risk analysis. In this study, we develop a new OHS risk assessment framework by integrating the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive and multicriteria decision-making) and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods to assess and rank the risk of occupational hazards under linguistic spherical fuzzy environment. The linguistic spherical fuzzy sets are utilized to deal with the vague and uncertain risk assessments of occupational hazards provided by experts. An integrated TODIM-PROMETHEE algorithm is introduced to determine the risk priority of the identified occupational hazards. Moreover, we extend the indifference threshold-based attribute ratio analysis method to derive the relative weights of risk criteria based on linguistic spherical fuzzy information. Finally, the OHS risk analysis of medical staff in a hospital is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and availability of our proposed model. Results show that the TODIM-PROMETHEE framework being developed in this study provides a useful, effective, and practical way for the risk assessment of occupational hazards in OHS.},

  abstract     = {Event-based social networks (EBSNs) have become increasingly popular, which provide online social event management platforms for event organizers to publish and share social events (e.g., outdoor activities). In EBSNs, a major challenge for a social event organizer is how to plan a social event to attract the maximum number of attendance. To organize an event, three essential elements are required, namely, (i.e., event content), (i.e., event location), and (i.e., event time). In this paper, we focus on the social event planning problem, which selects a location and time to hold a social event for the organizer with the given event content, to maximize the total number of participants. The solution of the social event planning problem could support decision-making for social event organizers. For simplicity, we denote a location and time pair as an item in this paper. To solve the social event planning problem, we present a hybrid pairwise Markov random field (H-PMRF) model which takes latent preferences of users, latent attributes of items, similarities between users and similarities between items into consideration. In particular, we construct an undirected graph where each node represents a user&#39;s decision on a specific item and each edge represents the relationship between the nodes, define the node potentials and edge potentials which model the dependency relationships between nodes, and give a joint probability distribution over the graph. Further, we adopt the Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm to compute the posterior probability distribution of each node in H-PMRF and select the location and time to hold the event which could attract the maximum number of participants. We collect real-world data set from DoubanEvent website and conduct extensive experiments on it. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms several baselines.},

To reduce traffic congestion at crossroads, in this study, an intelligent diverse optimization priority method (IDOPM) was developed for dynamic traffic light control at crossroads, where diverse optimization priorities can be flexibly and efficiently assigned to different crossroads. The IDOPM mainly consists of a dynamic state constructor and an optimization priority assigner. The dynamic state constructor controls the transformation of the signal combinations of traffic lights. The signal combinations of traffic lights at crossroads are abstracted as cells to be controlled by formulated rules. By designing duration particles and enhancing particles, the optimization priority assigner reconstructs the quantum particle swarm algorithm to assign crossroads with different optimization priorities. The results obtained by comparison with state-of-the-art methods via extensive experiments confirmed the outstanding optimization performance of the proposed IDOPM in dynamic traffic light control.},

Optical remote sensing images, on the other hand, are frequently impacted by clouds during the collection process, resulting in reduced image clarity, which impairs feature assessment and future usage, and heavy cloud blockage renders the surface information below totally useless. In this paper, We propose a soft attention recurrent neural module based on an encoder-decoder network, which can solve the cloud occlusion problem.

  abstract     = {Most modern multi-object tracking (MOT) systems for videos follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where objects of interest are first located in each frame then associated correspondingly to form their intact trajectories. In this setting, the appearance features of objects usually provide the most important cues for data association, but it is very susceptible to occlusions, illumination variations, and inaccurate detections, thus easily resulting in incorrect trajectories. To address this issue, in this study we propose to make full use of the neighboring information. Our motivations derive from the observations that people tend to move in a group. As such, when an individual target&#39;s appearance is remarkably changed, the observer can still identify it with its neighbor context. To model the contextual information from neighbors, we first utilize the spatiotemporal relations among trajectories to efficiently select suitable neighbors for targets. Subsequently, we construct neighbor graph for each target and corresponding neighbors then employ the graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model their relations and learn the graph features. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to explicitly leverage neighbor cues via GCN in MOT. Finally, standardized evaluations on the MOT16 and MOT17 data sets demonstrate that our approach can remarkably reduce the identity switches whilst achieve state-of-the-art overall performance.},

Hereby, a fly visual evolutionary neural network is developed to solve large-scale global optimization (LSGO), inspired by swarm evolution and the characteristics of fly visual perception. It includes two functional modules, of which one is to generate global and local motion direction activities of visual neural nodes, and the other takes the activities as learning rates to update the nodes&#39; states by a population-like evolutionary strategy. Also, it is used to optimize the structure of a multilayer perceptron to acquire a sample classification model. The theoretical results indicate that the network is convergent and meanwhile the computational complexity mainly depends on the size of the input layer and the dimension of LSGO. The comparative experiments have verified that the network is an extremely competitive optimizer for LSGO problems.},

Further, the generalized Dombi (GD) operators are pretty flexible with the general parameters during the aggregation process. Besides, the Bonferroni mean (BM) operator has the advantage of considering interrelationships between criteria. In this study, we combine the merits of the GD operator, and BM operator for handling multicriteria group decision-making issues under a DPL setting. The existing research on DPL term sets do not focus on both the subjective and objective weights of decision-experts. As a result, the evaluation results are likely to be distorted. To tackle this situation, in this paper, we utilize the concepts of consistency and similarity between the decision-experts to determine the decision-experts subjective and objective weights, respectively. To calculate the weights of criteria, the grey correlation coefficient of the assessment value of criteria is used to reflect the similarity between the criteria and its reference value. Since the existing aggregation operators fail to capture the interrelations between criteria under DPL setting, so for aggregating criteria values, we propose DPL generalized Dombi BM weighted averaging and geometric aggregation operators. We provide a case study regarding biomass feedstock selection to focus on the applicability of these proposed operators. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the parameters upon ranking order. We also perform a sensitivity assessment of criteria weights to test the stability of our method. Lastly, we provide a comparison between our approach with various extant methods.},

Meanwhile, the property of the new concept is studied. Using this consistency concept, a method for assessing the additive consistency of DHFPRs is offered. To extend the application of DHFPRs, a programming model to determine the missing DHFEs in incomplete DHFPRs is built, which have the highest additive consistency level for the known ones. Two equivalent methods to calculate the priority vector are offered. One method obtains the probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy priority vector, and the other derives the intuitionistic fuzzy priority vector. Furthermore, a consensus index is defined to measure the consensus of individual opinions in group decision making (GDM), and an interactive method for increasing the consensus level is offered. On the basis of the additive consistency and consensus, an algorithm to GDM with DHFPRs is offered that can address inconsistent and incomplete cases.

This situation, worsens in large-scale group decision situations, in which opinions tend to be more polarized, because in problems with extreme opinions it is harder to reach an agreement. Several studies have shown that experts&#39; preferences may not always follow a linear scale, as it has commonly been assumed in previous CRP. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to study the effect of modeling this nonlinear behavior of experts&#39; preferences (expressed by fuzzy preference relations) in CRPs. To do that, the experts&#39; preferences will be remapped by using nonlinear deformations which amplify or reduce the distance between the extreme values. We introduce such automorphisms to remap the preferences as Extreme Values Amplifications (EVAs) and Extreme Values Reductions (EVRs), study their main properties and propose several families of these EVA and EVR functions. An analysis about the behavior of EVAs and EVRs when are implemented in a generic consensus model is then developed.

  abstract     = {Detection of crop diseases is imperative for agriculture to be sustainable. Automated crop disease detection is a major issue in the current agricultural industry due to its cluttered background. Internet of Things (IoT) has gained immense interest in the past decade, as it accumulates a high level of contextual information to identify crop diseases. This study paper presents a novel method based on Taylor-Water Wave Optimization-based Generative Adversarial Network (Taylor-WWO-based GAN) to identify diseases in the agricultural industry. In this method, the IoT nodes sense the plant leaves, and the sensed data are transmitted to the Base Station (BS) using Fractional Gravitational Gray Wolf Optimization. This technique selects the optimal path for data transmission. After performing IoT routing, crop diseases are recognized at the BS. For detecting crop disease, the input image acquired from the IoT routing phase is then forwarded to the next step, that is, preprocessing, to improve the quality of the image for further processing. Then, Segmentation Network (SegNet) is adapted to segment the images, and extraction of significant features is performed using the acquired segments. The extracted features are adapted by the GAN, which is trained by Taylor-WWO. The proposed Taylor-WWO is newly devised by integrating the Taylor series and WWO algorithms. The proposed Taylor-WWO-based GAN showed improved performance with a maximum accuracy of 91.6\%, maximum sensitivity of 89.3\%, and maximum specificity of 92.3\% in comparison with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Interval numbers multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) is an important branch of uncertainty decision theory, and the decision result largely depends on the selection of the aggregation operator. In this paper, we analyze the ordered weighted average (OWA) operator, which is an averaging aggregation operator. The OWA operator provides an aggregation method between the minimum and maximum operators. Moreover, we further analyze some of extensions about OWA operator, and pay special attention to the Bonferroni means and OWA (BON-OWA) operator. Note that the BON-OWA operator only aggregate the input arguments which are exact numbers. Under normal circumstances, decision makers is difficult to provide a clear evaluation value for attribute and most of them are described by vague information. When the decision information is an interval numbers, the BON-OWA operator cannot describe decision result accurately. Under these environments, we proposed the interval numbers BON-OWA (IB-OWA) operator to deal with the vague decision information in this paper. Then we consider their main properties, such as idempotence, monotonicity, and boundedness and prove them. Besides, a wide range of special aggregation operators are found in changing parameter values, such as the square mean and max operator, and so on. We also compare the ranking method of the interval numbers based on Boolean matrix. As a result, the combination of IB-OWA operator makes the decision result more scientific. Finally, a new approach for decision-making problem is developed based on the IB-OWA operator, which shows the effectiveness in practical examples.},

  abstract     = {Due to the use of powerful computers and advanced software for photo editing, image manipulation in digital images simply degrades the trust in digital images. Image forensic analysis focuses on image authenticity and image content. To process forensic research, different methods are introduced, which effectively differentiate fake images from the original image. A technique named image splicing is commonly used for image tampering, and the tampered image may be used in photography contents, news reports, and so forth, which brings negative influences among the society. Thus, for detecting spliced images, this paper proposed an automatic forgery detection approach named Taylor-adaptive rag-bull rider (RR) optimization algorithm-based deep convolutional neural network (Taylor-RNet). At first, the face of a human is detected from the spliced image using the Viola Jones algorithm, and later, to estimate light coefficients, the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the face is determined by using a landmark-based 3D morphable model (L3DMM). Then, distance measures, like, Bhattacharya, Euclidean, Seuclidean, Chebyshev, correlation coefficients, and Hamming, are determined from the light coefficients that form the feature vector to the proposed Taylor-RNet, which identifies the spliced image. Taylor-adaptive RR is the integration of the Taylor series with the adaptive RR optimization algorithm. Finally, the experimental analysis is performed using four data sets, such as DSO-1, DSI-1, real data set, and hybrid data set. The analysis result of the proposed method obtained a maximum accuracy of 96.921\%, true positive rate of 99.981\%, and true negative rate of 99.783\%.},

  abstract     = {Rockfall detection is a crucial procedure in the field of geology, which helps to reduce the associated risks. Currently, geologists identify rockfall events almost manually utilizing point cloud and imagery data obtained from different caption devices such as Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) or digital cameras. Multitemporal comparison of the point clouds obtained with these techniques requires a tedious visual inspection to identify rockfall events which implies inaccuracies that depend on several factors such as human expertize and the sensibility of the sensors. This paper addresses this issue and provides an intelligent framework for rockfall event detection for any individual working in the intersection of the geology domain and decision support systems. The development of such an analysis framework presents major research challenges and justifies exhaustive experimental analysis. In particular, we propose an intelligent system that utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms to detect rockfall clusters of point cloud data. Due to the extremely imbalanced nature of the problem, a plethora of state-of-the-art resampling techniques accompanied by multiple models and feature selection procedures are being investigated. Various machine learning pipeline combinations have been examined and benchmarked applying well-known metrics to be incorporated into our system. Specifically, we developed machine learning techniques and applied them to analyze point cloud data extracted from TLS in two distinct case studies, involving different geological contexts: the basaltic cliff of Castellfollit de la Roca and the conglomerate Montserrat Massif, both located in Spain. Our experimental results indicate that some of the above-mentioned machine learning pipelines can be utilized to detect rockfall incidents on mountain walls, with experimentally validated accuracy.},

Owing to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market, many fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods were proposed to solve stock selection problems. However, these methods have difficulty in characterizing unreliable information, which is widespread in the stock market, and handling the non-compensation among multiple criteria. In this paper, an innovative method is developed from the perspectives of information reliability and criterion non-compensation to manage stock selection problems. First, the Z-number, which is a powerful tool for describing real-life information and identifying information reliability, is introduced to depict stock evaluation information. Second, the outranking degree of Z-numbers is defined based on the fuzzy and probability information. Subsequently, some outranking aggregation and exploitation procedures are presented based on the idea of Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) I to handle the non-compensation among stock evaluation criteria. By integrating the above studies, a Z-number ELECTRE I MCDM method is developed. Finally, a stock investment object selection problem is solved, and some discussions and analyses are conducted to testify the applicability and validity of this method.},

The asymmetry of information among sensors poses a challenge to characterize or compute the Nash equilibria (NE). To overcome the challenge, based on the common information among sensors, the game with asymmetric information is transformed into another game with symmetric information such that a subclass of NE refer to common information based Markov perfect equilibria of the original game can be achieved by using a backward induction algorithm.

Many countries and companies are working hard to develop or introduce smart agricultural solutions. Because of the shackles of traditional agricultural management methods and fierce competition with a variety of different solutions, it is a difficult task for enterprises to select and implement smart agricultural solutions smoothly. Hence, enterprises must assess alternative solutions and select a feasible solution in advance. This study drew a novel assessment and selection for smart agriculture solutions using an information error-based Pythagorean fuzzy cloud algorithm. First, an evaluation index system built on smart agriculture solutions was constructed from four aspects. Then, a new concept of Pythagorean fuzzy clouds was defined to express the evaluation information for each indicator. Simultaneously, the Pythagorean fuzzy cloud weighted Bonferroni mean (PFCWBM) operator was developed to aggregate the assessment information of multiple indicators. Next, an assessment and selection decision framework for smart agriculture solutions based on the PFCWBM operator was presented. In addition, an example was given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, a discussion was conducted to verify the superiority of our approach. The results showed that our algorithm can characterize and evaluate complex information and has high sensitivity and environmental adaptability.},

This study focuses on the consensus reaching process for GDM with LPRs-SC. To do that, some new operational laws for LPRs-SC are presented. Subsequently, an iteration-based consensus proposal for LPRs-SC is proposed. In the proposal, we aggregate the individual LPRs-SC using a self-confidence indices-based method which gives more importance to the most self-confident experts. A self-confidence score function is presented to derive the individual and collective priority vectors. Moreover, considering experts’ acceptable adjustment range of preference values, a two-step feedback adjustment mechanism is utilized to improve the consensus level, which adjusts both the preference values and the self-confidence levels.

Emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) has received widespread attention and many research results have emerged, but how to establish an integrated temporal and spatial feature fusion and classification method with improved convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and how to utilize the spatial information of different electrode channels to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition in the deep learning are two important challenges. This paper proposes an emotion recognition method based on three-dimensional (3D) feature maps and CNNs. First, EEG data are calibrated with 3 s baseline data and divided into segments with 6 s time window, and then the wavelet energy ratio, wavelet entropy of five rhythms, and approximate entropy are extracted from each segment. Second, the extracted features are arranged according to EEG channel mapping positions, and then each segment is converted into a 3D feature map, which is used to simulate the relative position of electrode channels on the scalp and provides spatial information for emotion recognition. Finally, a CNN framework is designed to learn local connections among electrode channels from 3D feature maps and to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. The experiments on data set for emotion analysis using physiological signals data set were conducted and the average classification accuracy of 93.61\% and 94.04\% for valence and arousal was attained in subject-dependent experiments while 83.83\% and 84.53\% in subject-independent experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods.},

Two abstraction techniques based on behavioural decomposition and environmental scaffolding are presented to derive these simpler representations. Parallel and incremental learning architectures incorporated with grammatical evolution (GE) are investigated with three complex problems to evaluate their potential in generating collective multi-agent behaviours. The results infer that both learning architectures surpass a generic GE model in performance for evolving complex behaviours. Furthermore, using environmental scaffolding reduces the robustness of the model than when only the behavioural decomposition technique is used. However, it has more potential to generate solutions with better fitness than when scaffoldings are not used. The evaluations suggest that, by incorporating abstraction learning architectures with grammar-based evolution can significantly improve the performance of an agent system in complex problem domains.},

As a consequence, data are being collected at an unprecedented rate. This poses several challenges, including, for example, regarding the storage and processing of these data. Machine Learning (ML) is also not an exception, in the sense that algorithms must now deal with novel challenges, such as learn from streaming data or deal with concept drift. ML engineers also have a harder task when it comes to selecting the most appropriate model, given the wealth of algorithms and possible configurations that exist nowadays. At the same time, training time is a stronger restriction as the computational complexity of the training model increases. In this paper we propose a framework for dealing with these challenges, based on meta-learning. Specifically, we tackle two well-defined problems: automatic algorithm selection and continuous algorithm updates that do not require the retraining of the whole algorithm to adapt to new data. Results show that the proposed framework can contribute to ameliorate the identified issues.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing emerges as an alternative to cloud computing in the scenarios where the end devices require lower latency and faster access speeds. Edge nodes are deployed at the proximity of the end devices to reduce response time. On the other hand, the edge nodes are usually owned by small organizations that have limited operations and maintenance capabilities. Data on the edge may be easily damaged, due to external attacks or internal hardware failures. Therefore, it is essential to verify data integrity in edge computing. However, edge environment requires a different trust model compared with other computing and storage paradigm. Besides, compared with cloud storage, edge storage is decentralized and storage service participants may pose greater internal and external threats. This paper proposes a blockchain-based intelligent crowdsourcing audit approach (Crowdauditing) to achieve on-chain and off-chain credibility of audit results. The model relies on an untrusted auditor committee from the crowd to audit data integrity and uses smart contracts as the core of the intelligent system to ensure the reliability of result submission, the accuracy of the result judgment, and reasonable punishments and rewards. Specifically, an unbiased selection algorithm is proposed to achieve fairness during the auditor committee construction. An innovative two-stage submission strategy is proposed to ensure that the auditor committee can reach a consensus on the off-chain audit results. An incentive mechanism is carefully designed to force auditors providing audit services honestly to maximize their own rewards. Moreover, we modeled that as a game of players, which proves the reliability of the result. Finally, we implement a prototype of Crowdauditing based on smart contracts. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Crowdauditing.},

This paper extends the evidential reasoning aggregation method in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment, expands the dictionary ranking method by constructing interval-valued numbers through the proposed credibility functions of PF values and the concept of closeness degree, widens the continuous generalized ordered weighted average operator to establish a risk attitude ranking measure, and puts forward a PF MAGDM approach based on risk attitude and evidence reasoning methodology (ERM). First, the proposed method utilizes the ERM to aggregate each decision maker&#39;s decision matrix and the weights of the attributes to get his/her aggregated decision matrix. Then, it incorporates the obtained aggregated decision matrices of the experts, the weights of the experts and the ERM to accomplish the aggregated PF value of each alternative. Finally, the ranking measure value of risk attitude on each alternative&#39;s PF value is calculated, and the sensitivity analysis on the ranking measure function is carried out. The proposed method has overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods for fuzzy MAGDM in PF environments.},

However, widespread use of popular and effective such algorithms is limited by their computational cost. We describe an adaptation of the ReliefF algorithm that simplifies the costliest of its step by approximating the nearest neighbor graph using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). The resulting ReliefF-LSH algorithm can process data sets that are too large for the original ReliefF, a capability further enhanced by distributed implementation in Apache Spark. Furthermore, ReliefF-LSH obtains better results and is more generally applicable than currently available alternatives to the original ReliefF, as it can handle regression and multiclass data sets. The fact that it does not require any additional hyperparameters with respect to ReliefF also avoids costly tuning. A set of experiments demonstrates the validity of this new approach and confirms its good scalability.},

The evolutionary strategy of the algorithm is quite different from that of the existing PSO algorithms. To enhance the global search capability of the particle swarm, the original particle swarm is divided into two parallel evolving independent particle subpopulations to explore the search space simultaneously. In addition, according to the evolutionary factor in each iteration, the poorly performing particles in the two subpopulations are spurred and learned to improve the search speed of the particle swarm. In the process of particle learning, delay information is added to the velocity update item to reduce the occurrence of local capture. Twenty-eight benchmark functions of CEC2013 are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed PLPSO algorithm. Numerous comparisons demonstrate that the performance of the PLPSO algorithm is better than that of other nine PSO algorithms. Afterwards, the PLPSO algorithm is applied to the inverse kinematics (IK) solution of a robotic manipulator. By comparing with other three intelligent algorithms, the PLPSO algorithm shows an excellent performance in solving the IK problem. Finally, tests are carried out on an UR5 manipulator to confirm the practicability of the proposed PLPSO algorithm further. Thus, the feasibility of using the PLPSO algorithm for solving the IK problem of a robotic manipulator is verified.},

In real-life problems, there are many situations where players of a matrix game cannot assess their pay-offs by using fuzzy sets/intuitionistic fuzzy sets or ordinary intervals. RIs are used as an excellent tool to handle such situations. This paper explores matrix games with RI pay-offs and investigates two different solution methodologies to solve such a game. In the first approach, a pair of auxiliary linear programming problems with RI coefficients for the players has been constructed. Then each of the two auxiliary programming problems is converted into two linear programming problems with interval coefficients (LPPICs) using lower and upper approximation intervals of the RI. Finally from each LPPIC, two classical linear programming problems (LPPs) are constructed. In the second approach, the expected value technique for RI is used for transforming auxiliary mathematical programming models under the RI environment to crisp LPP. A case study on the telecom market share problem is considered to show the applicability of the proposed approaches and results are compared and analyzed with an existing method.},

However, it is inherently an interdisciplinary assessment, which includes both the engineering domain and the biological systems. Due to the lack of knowledge at the early stage of product design, the risk assessments mainly depend on experts&#39; subjective judgments, which values are vague, imprecise, and even inconsistent. How to objectively evaluate the biological inspiration under such uncertain and interdisciplinary scenarios remains an open issue. To bridge such gaps, this study proposes a fuzzy rough number extended multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) to evaluate the biological inspiration for BID. A fuzzy rough number is introduced to represent the individual decision maker&#39;s risk assessment and aggregate respective evaluation values within the decision-making group. A fuzzy rough number extended decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is presented to determine the criteria weights and a fuzzy rough number extended multi-attribute ideal real comparative analysis is proposed to rank the candidate biological inspirations. Experimental results and comparative analysis validate the superiority of the proposed MCGDM in handling the subjectivity and uncertainty in biological inspiration evaluation.},

Early detection of osteosarcoma increases the survival rate. Various osteosarcoma detection methods are adopted to detect osteosarcoma at an early stage, but evaluating the slides under the microscope to find the degree of tumor necrosis and tumor result is a major challenge in the medical sector. Hence, an effective detection method is developed using the proposed Fractional-Harris Hawks Optimization-based Generative Adversarial Network (F-HHO-based GAN) for detecting osteosarcoma at an early stage. Here, the proposed F-HHO is designed by the integration of Fractional Calculus and HHO, respectively. Accordingly, the classification of viable tumor, nontumor, and the necrotic tumor is carried out by GAN using the histology image slides. GAN is used to perform osteosarcoma detection based on the features extracted from the image through the process of cell segmentation. The training process of GAN is done using the proposed F-HHO algorithm. However, the proposed F-HHO obtained better performance using the metrics, namely, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with the values of 98\%, 98\%, and 98\% for training percentage and 96.282\%, 97.552\%, and 95.651\% for -fold, respectively.},

The new Fermatean fuzzy entropy takes into account the uncertainty information and the indeterminacy degree of FFSs. Subsequently, we prove that Fermatean fuzzy entropy satisfies the axiom requirement of fuzzy entropy measure. Thereafter, a novel Fermatean fuzzy multicriteria decision-making approach is developed based on Dempster–Shafer theory with the help of the Fermatean fuzzy entropy. The proposed method modeled each Fermatean fuzzy number as a piece of evidence, and the weights of criteria are determined by the entropy measure of FFSs. Then, the weighted average evidence for the alternatives under all criteria is computed from the weights of criteria. Later, Dempster&#39;s combination rule is leveraged to combine the weighted average evidence of the alternatives to obtain the final evaluation information about each alternative. The proposed approach can effectively deal with the uncertain information in decision-making problems and help reduce the information loss in the decision-making process.

  abstract     = {In genome research, it is a fundamental issue to identify few but important survival-related biomarkers. The Cox model is a widely used survival analysis technique, which is used to study the relationship between characteristics and survival response. However, limitations of the existing Cox methods for genomic data are as follows: (1) a typical gene expression data set consists of tens of thousands of genes, and the result of current methods may not be sparse enough; (2) a wealth of structural information about many biological processes, such as regulatory networks and pathways, has often been ignored; (3) genomic data is usually considered as high noise, which is usually ignored in current methods. To alleviate the above problems, in this paper, we study a novel sparse Cox regression model, called SPLSN, which combines self-paced learning (SPL) and a log-sum absolute network-based penalty (Logsum-Net), especially for biomarker selection in survival analysis. SPL is embedded in curriculum design, and the model is trained by gradually increasing samples from low noise to high noise during the training process. The Logsum-Net encourages smoothness among the coefficients of adjacent genes on a specific biological network. We compare the proposed method with five alternative approaches in various experimental scenarios, including a comprehensive simulation, seven benchmark gene expression data sets, and one large validation data set. Results show that the SPLSN can identify fewer meaningful biomarkers and obtain the best or equivalent prediction performance. Moreover, the biological analysis shows that the genes selected by the SPLSN might be helpful to tumor treatment.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of modern transportation system depends heavily on intelligent techniques, information assortment, and its analysis. Sensors play a crucial role in information assortment in charging scheduling of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are destined to become inevitable due to their innate economic contribution, climate improvement, and social attributes as per United Nation&#39;s sustainable development goals. Innovation in EV has gained the interest of many researchers since it is one of the novel green transportation sectors. Moreover, EVs are essential to preserve conventional fuels and to maximize the utilization of renewable sources. Nevertheless, EVs have short driving ranges due to their battery limitation, which hinders the reliability. The charging stations (CS) for EVs are also unevenly distributed. This paper presents a novel strategy to schedule the charging points in EV CSs. The goal is to determine the convenient CS for EVs through Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) model. In this model, the CSs are determined and prioritized using four phases, such as driving, charge planning, charging scheduling, and battery charging. Charging scheduling was designed using a newly developed optimization strategy, exponential Harris Hawks optimization (Exponential HHO) algorithm, which combines two algorithms, Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) and exponential weighted moving average (EWMA). Furthermore, the fitness function was also newly devised by considering parameters such as average waiting time, remaining energy, number of EVs, and distance. The proposed Exponential HHO was validated using VANET simulation and the performance was improved with maximum remaining energy of 52.709 Whr, minimal distance of 27.256 km, and a maximum average waiting time of 0.352 min in comparison with existing methods. To be specific, the proposed Exponential HHO yielded better improvement, especially when considering a large number of vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Ranking methods of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are abundant in literature. However, an adequately accepted approach of ordering intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is not apparent. This motivates to develop a new method of ordering intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In many cases, studies of ranking intuitionistic fuzzy numbers do not investigate the reasonable properties that a ranking method should follow. Furthermore, the majority of existing methods do not meet the reasonable properties. Furthermore, investigating the consistency in image ordering was never a concern in previous studies of ranking intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Hence, in this paper, an innovative method of ranking intuitionistic fuzzy numbers has been developed. The method is based on the index of optimism, that is, a convex combination of value and multiple of ambiguity inclusion function with ambiguity of membership function and value and multiple of ambiguity inclusion function with ambiguity of nonmembership function. The present method exclusively complies with the reasonable properties as it satisfies all the reasonable properties of a ranking method. Further, newer properties that depicts the consistency in ranking the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with their corresponding images are also being developed in this study. It is worth mentioning that the present method consistently ranks the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and their corresponding images.},

  abstract     = {Android platform has been the target of attackers due to its openness and increasing popularity. Android malware has explosively increased in recent years, which poses serious threats to Android security. Thus proposing efficient Android malware detection methods is curial in defeating malware. Various features extracted from static or dynamic analysis using machine learning have played an important role in malware detection recently. However, existing code obfuscation, code encryption, and dynamic code loading techniques can be employed to hinder systems that single based on static analysis, purely dynamic analysis systems cannot detect all potential code execution paths. To address these issues, we propose CoDroid, a sequence-based hybrid Android malware detection method, which utilizes the sequences of static opcode and dynamic system call. We treat one sequence as a sentence in the natural language processing and construct a CNN–BiLSTM–Attention classifier which consists of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with an attention language model. We extensively evaluate CoDroid under a real-world data set and perform comprehensive analysis against other existing related detection methods. The evaluations show the effectiveness and flexibility of CoDroid across a variety of experimental settings.},

In this paper, we suggest the damped window based average utility driven data analytics for intelligent systems, which the damped window reflects the importance according to the arrival time of the transactions. The proposed mining approach adopts novel data structure, which modify the importance of item as the passage of time, and it improves mining efficiency with several pruning strategies and without generating candidate patterns. To evaluate the performance of the proposed mining approach, we conducted various experiments using several real and synthetic data sets. The result of the experiments presented that the suggested method performs better in terms of runtime and memory usage than the other state-of-the-art mining techniques.

This paper aims to propose two nonlinear programming models for calculating the probabilities of elements in a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element and the probability of risk status respectively. First, a nonlinear programming model using maximum entropy principle is established for determining the probabilities of elements in a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element. Second, by introducing the water-filling theory, we put forward its extension and design a novel mathematical programming model to determine the probability of risk status. Moreover, we have proved that both the two mathematical programming models are convex programming models and their global optimal solutions can be found. Thirdly, the collective overall expected values of alternatives are calculated and the ranking order can be derived. Then, the selection of investment project is investigated, and comparison analysis shows the superiority of the presented approach.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent solar tracking systems to track the trajectory of the sun across the sky has been actively studied and proposed nowadays. Several low performance intelligent solar tracking systems have been designed and implemented. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is one of the common controllers that used to drive solar tracking systems. However, when the input data are complex for neural network, neural network would not well explain the relationship between these data. Thus, it performed worse than when the input data are simple. Using a premapping of relationship between samples of data as input to neural network along with the original input data could probably a strong guide to help neural network to reach the desired goal and predict the output variables faster and more accurate. It is found that using the output of logistic regression as input to neural network would faster the process of finding the predicted output by neural network. Thus, this study aims to propose new efficient and low complexity single and dual axis solar tracking systems by integrating supervised logistic regression (LR) and supervised MLP or cascade multilayer perceptron (CMLP). LR models are trained by using one of unsupervised clustering techniques (k-means, fuzzy c-means, and hierarchical clustering algorithms). The proposed models were used to predict both tilt and orientation angles by two different data sets (month, day, and time variables data set) and (month, day, time, Isc, Voc, and power radiation variables data sets). The results revealed that the proposed MLP/CMLP-LR systems are able to increase the prediction rate and decrease the mean square error rate as compared to conventional models in both single and dual axis solar tracking systems. The new developed intelligent systems achieved less number of overall connections, less number of neurons, and less time complexity. The finding suggests that the proposed intelligent solar tracking systems has a great potential to be applied for real-world applications (i.e., solar heating systems, solar lightening systems, factories, and solar powered ventilation.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable site selection for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) is a significant process in the promotion of electric vehicle system development. The assessment and selection of suitable EVCS site is a very critical decision, involving complexity due to the presence of several associated criteria. Furthermore, uncertainty is an inevitable component of the information in the decision-making procedure and its significance in the selection process is relatively high and needs to be cautiously measured. Single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) is one of the valuable and flexible tools for handling such type of uncertain information arising in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) applications. Thus, the objective of this study is to introduce novel single-valued neutrosophic information-based additive ratio assessment (ARAS) approach for evaluating and prioritizing the sustainable EVCS sites. In this method, novel single-valued subjective and objective weighted integrated approach (SVN-SOWIA) is developed to compute the criteria by aggregating the objective weights resulted from a similarity measure-based procedure and the subjective weights given by the experts. For this purpose, an innovative similarity measure is proposed for SVNSs. To display the performance of the present methodology, a computational study of EVCS sites evaluation is conferred under single-valued neutrosophic environment. Comparative and sensitivity analyses are further performed to verify the strength of the developed approach. The outcome illustrates EVCS site EvUrjaa—Electric Vehicle Charging Station is the most optimal EVCS site in Indore region, India. Also, the environmental (0.324) and social (0.273) criteria are more important than technological (0.236) and economical (0.167) criteria in assessing the EVCS sites. The sensitivity analysis outcomes signify the EVCS option EvUrjaa—Electric Vehicle Charging Station always acquires its highest ranking in spite of how sub-criteria weights fluctuate. The outcome of this study indicates that the developed approach can suggest more realistic performance under uncertain environment and therefore, provides a wide range of applications.},

The new validity measure allows it to capture the spatial pattern of the data and obtain the right number of clusters in an automatic way. This new approach, unlike the traditional one that usually identifies well-separated compact clouds, works with arbitrary-shape clusters that may be contiguous or even overlapped. The proposed clustering measure has been evaluated on nine artificial data sets, with different cluster distributions and an increasing number of classes, on three highly nonlinear data sets, and on 17 real data sets. It has been compared with nine well-known clustering validation indices with very satisfactory results. This proves that including density in the definition of clustering validation indices may be useful to identify the right partition of arbitrary-shape and different-size clusters.},

  abstract     = {The main emphasis of this paper is placed on the problem of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) in intuitionistic fuzzy environments. Some limitations in the existing literature that explains Atanassov&#39;s intuitionistic fuzzy sets from the perspective of Dempster–Shafer theory (DST) have been analyzed. To offer an effective solution to the problem of using Dempster&#39;s rule to aggregate intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs), a novel aggregation operator named ordered weighted averaging (OWA)-based mean orthogonal sum (MOS) is proposed, which has advantages in the following aspects: (1) Dempster&#39;s rule is the basis of aggregation, (2) the golden rule-based representative value is the basis for sorting, (3) the idea of soft likelihood function is the guide to improve the fusion process, and (4) OWA operator is a tool to express decision makers&#39; subjectivity. To compare different IFVs obtained from the OWA-based MOS approach, the golden rule-based representative value for IFVs comparison is introduced, which can get over the shortcomings of score functions. The hierarchical structure of the proposed decision approach is presented based on the above researches, which allows us to address MCDM issues without intermediate defuzzification when criteria and associated weights are represented by IFVs. The proposed OWA-based MOS approach is illustrated as a more flexible decision method, which can better solve the problem of intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making in the framework of DST.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on a group decision-making (GDM) approach based on the multiplicative consistency of linguistic preference relation (LPR) with experts&#39; self-confidence and self-doubting (SC&amp;SD) levels. To give their preferences, the experts use their knowledge of the experience according to their degree of SC&amp;SD levels. First, we propose the concepts of multiplicative consistent LPR-SC&amp;SD using the experts&#39; general minimum self-confidence level and the maximum self-doubting level. We suggest then a consensus-building iterative process, that is, a consensus reaching process (CRP) algorithm to achieve multiplicative consistency of LPR-SC&amp;SD according to identification and adjustment rules. A theorem is given for convergence of the CRP algorithm. In a GDM problem, social network analysis is studied for the experts to obtain their weight according to the degree of SC&amp;SD. When we achieve the acceptable preferences of all the experts using the CRP algorithm of the multiplicative consistent LPR-SC&amp;SD, then we aggregate all the preferences by the experts&#39; weights. The aggregation of all preferences is also an LPR-SC&amp;SD, known as the weight collective LPR-SC&amp;SD. Finally, a case-by-case example and several comparative analyses are done with the current GDM processes to demonstrate the viability and applicability of the proposed GDM system.},

This study investigates many aspects of the formulation of this approach, such as the design variables selection and the definition of a feasibility function, to improve both effectiveness and flexibility. In particular, the latter is a key factor compared to many other state-of-the-art approaches: in fact, it can be used with most of the available Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and can manage different quality-of-service performance parameters. The proposed approach is successfully compared with a greedy optimization on the case study of the City of Milan (Italy) using four different EAs. Two different performance parameters have been defined and used to prove the flexibility of the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {The study proposes a rotational multipyramid network (RoMP Net) with bounding-box transformation for object detection. The RoMP Net is a single-stage object detection neural network featuring three characteristics. First, the network uses a rotational bounding box to minimize the effect of background images when extracting features of objects. Bounding-box transformation was proposed to compensate for the limitation of the rotational bounding boxes, which have relatively low prediction accuracy for objects with a high aspect ratio. Second, the RoMP Net introduces a multi-scale and multi-level feature pyramid network to extract distinct and semantic features efficiently. This network architecture ensures high prediction accuracy and robustness regardless of the size and complexity of objects. Third, hyperparameters in the bounding boxes are automatically determined through an unsupervised clustering method. This optimization method is also critical in improving accuracy. The performance of the proposed network and preprocessing methods are validated through image-sets comprising critical components in power transmission facilities, which have a variety of sizes and aspect ratios. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the three key characteristics in the RoMP Net. Furthermore, the RoMP Net outperforms other state-of-the-art deep neural networks in prediction accuracy and robustness for object detection. Specifically, the mean average precision of the RoMP Net in the validation image-sets shows that it has the highest prediction accuracy, whereas its values in the test image-sets confirm the network&#39;s robustness. The fast yet accurate RoMP Net will expand the range of object detection through deep neural networks.},

Based on these concepts and the idea of the traditional Mahalanobis distance, the hesitant Mahalanobis distance between two HFSs is developed. Then we discuss the properties of the new distance measure and uncover the significant characteristic of the introduced distance measure that it can give the attributes an adaptive weight and can eliminate the influence of the correlation between the attributes under hesitant fuzzy environment. And then, some extensions of this new distance measure are also developed. Second, to show the validity and applicability of the proposed distance measures, we compare them with the existing ones in decision making and cluster analysis with some numerical examples. Third, using the proposed distance measures, we develop two algorithms to estimate the optimal number of clusters, which is a new application area of the hesitant fuzzy distance measures.

It aims to identify vehicles violating the rule of yielding to pedestrians at nonsignalized crosswalks. First, we define the concepts of vehicles and pedestrians and then apply the regression background subtraction method and particle filter algorithm to automatically identify and track moving objects. Second, the pedestrian validity feature template is specified to detect temporal trajectory features from videos with labels and to train classification networks aiming to identify unreasonable behavior patterns, such as remaining on the sidewalk, entering the roadway, bicycle riding, and others. Finally, we develop a novel traffic violation recognition method based on multientity interaction analysis. The cases of failing to yield to pedestrians are recognized based on the multientity feature template built using the proposed method. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method on a real traffic data set obtained from surveillance cameras. The obtained results are significantly better compared with the baseline method. The area under curve value of the proposed traffic violation recognition method with multientity interaction is 14.5\%, 11.1\%, and 6.6\% higher compared with the three baseline methods based on single-entity frameworks.},

However, there is a lack of systematic study of evasion attacks on ML-based anti-phishing detection. In this study, we show that evasion attacks are not only effective on practical ML-based classifiers, but can also be efficiently launched without destructing the functionalities and appearance. For this purpose, we propose three mutation-based attacks, differing in the knowledge of the target classifier, addressing a key technical challenge: automatically crafting an adversarial sample from a known phishing website in a way that can mislead classifiers. To launch attacks in the white- and gray-box scenarios, we also propose a sample-based collision attack to gain the knowledge of the target classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our evasion attacks on the state-of-the-art, Google&#39;s phishing page filter, achieved 100\% attack success rate in less than one second per website. Moreover, the transferability attack on BitDefender&#39;s industrial phishing page classifier, TrafficLight, achieved up to 81.25\% attack success rate. We further propose a similarity-based method to mitigate such evasion attacks, Pelican, which compares the similarity of an unknown website with recently detected phishing websites. We demonstrate that Pelican can effectively detect evasion attacks, hence could be integrated into ML-based classifiers. We also highlight two strategies of classification rule selection to enhance the robustness of classifiers. Our findings contribute to design more robust phishing website classifiers in practice.},

  abstract     = {With the development of edge computing, edge storage solutions are attracting widespread attention. When facing the requirements of lower latency and faster access speed from end devices, edge storage solutions are considered to be an alternative to the cloud. However, edges are usually owned by small organizations which have limited operations and maintenance capabilities. This makes these edge devices can be easily disabled by external attacks or internal hardware failures. Besides, the heterogeneity of the edge devices will also make it difficult to price the edge resources uniformly. To tackle these problems, we propose SmartStore: an auction mechanism based on blockchain to allocate edge resources. Considering centralized solutions have access bottlenecks and trust issues, we built SmartStore on the smart contract. With Bayesian game theory, SmartStore can analyze how data owners (DO) and edges price the resources can maximize their benefits. From an economic perspective, both DO and edges can make full use of edge heterogeneous resources with SmartStore. Besides, a two-stage submission strategy is proposed to complete the sealed auction. Furthermore, considering the reliability of edge storage, we propose a cluster-based block distribution algorithm for SmartStore&#39;s intelligent edge recommendation process. SmartStore ensures the reliability of edge storage while maximizing the benefits and resource utilization of both parties. Finally, we conduct specific experiments on the proposed auction smart contract through “Ethereum” and the experimental results of implementation show the effectiveness and efficiency of our SmartStore.},

As a fundamental task in natural language processing field, document classification is a feasible way to handle the large-scale semistructured documents. However, existing methods fail to explicitly take advantage of the hierarchical semantics in semistructured documents. It&#39;s known that the contained semantics is beneficial for understanding the semistructured documents. Considering the hierarchical structure of a given semistructured document, we propose a semistructured document classification framework which explicitly utilizes the semantic hierarchical attention mechanism. More specifically, the hierarchical attention mechanism and graph neural network are employed to model semistructured documents, by which the multilevel semantic relationships and grammatical information are considered. Moreover, we propose an adaptive class cost learning method to treat the issue of data imbalance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two real-world data sets, and the results demonstrate that our framework performs better than selected baselines for semistructured document classification.},

It has been studied extensively in recent years, and the attention mechanism is widely applied in person re-id. But many works mainly focus on extracting discriminative features from local saliency regions, while ignoring some potentially global information between whole-body features and body-part features. In this study, we first proposed two effective global information for extracting discriminative features: spatial topology information (STI) and channel affinity information (CAI). On this basis, we further propose a Multi-information Fusion reinforced Global Attention (MIFGA) module which can effectively fuse a variety of information and utilize more comprehensive information to guide the learning of attention, so as to obtain pedestrian features that are conducive to clustering. Specifically, the proposed MIFGA module includes spatial attention (MIFGA-S) and channel attention (MIFGA-C). MIFGA-S mainly utilizes local feature semantic information and STI to guide the learning of spatial attention. Furthermore, to mine the potential topology information in original feature maps, the self-learning graph convolution network is proposed. MIFGA-C fuses channel semantic information and CAI to guide the learning of channel attention. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that our proposed MIFGA significantly enhances the baseline model and achieves a competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art person re-id methods on standard data sets Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03.},

Human behavior assessments and emotion recognition from a speech signal, such as speech emotion recognition (SER) is an emerging HCI area of exploration with various real time claims. The performance of an efficient SER system depends on feature learning, which include salient and discriminative information such as high-level deep features. In this paper, we proposed a two-stream deep convolutional neural network with an iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA) to learn mutually spatial-spectral features and select the most discriminative optimal features for the final prediction. Our model is composed of two channels, and each channel is associated with the convolutional neural network structure to extract cues from the oral signals. The first channel extracts feature from the spectral domain, and the second channel extracts features from the spatial domain, which are then fused and fed to the INCA to remove the severance and select the optimal features for the final model training. The joint refine features are passed from the fully connected network with a softmax classifier to yield the predictions of the different emotions. We trained our proposed system using three benchmarks, which included the EMO-DB, SAVEE, and RAVDESS emotional speech corpora, and we tested the prediction performance to secure 95\%, 82\%, and 85\% recognition rates. The performance of the system shows the effectiveness and significance of the proposed system.},

  abstract     = {The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered to be a significant health challenge worldwide because of its rapid human-to-human transmission, leading to a rise in the number of infected people and deaths. The detection of COVID-19 at the earliest stage is therefore of paramount importance for controlling the pandemic spread and reducing the mortality rate. The real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the primary method of diagnosis for coronavirus infection, has a relatively high false negative rate while detecting early stage disease. Meanwhile, the manifestations of COVID-19, as seen through medical imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT), radiograph (X-ray), and ultrasound imaging, show individual characteristics that differ from those of healthy cases or other types of pneumonia. Machine learning (ML) applications for COVID-19 diagnosis, detection, and the assessment of disease severity based on medical imaging have gained considerable attention. Herein, we review the recent progress of ML in COVID-19 detection with a particular focus on ML models using CT and X-ray images published in high-ranking journals, including a discussion of the predominant features of medical imaging in patients with COVID-19. Deep Learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks, have been utilized widely for image segmentation and classification to identify patients with COVID-19 and many ML modules have achieved remarkable predictive results using datasets with limited sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technology has attracted tremendous interest from both industry and academia. It is typically used to record a public history of transactions (e.g., payment/smart contract data), but storing nonpayment/contract data in transactions has been common. The ability to store data unrelated to payment/contract such as illicit data on blockchain may be abused for malicious purposes. For example, one may use blockchain to store the data related to child pornography and copyright violations, which are publicly visible and immutable. Moreover, an immutable blockchain is not suitable for all blockchain-based applications. So far, numerous redaction mechanisms for the mutable blockchain have been developed. In this paper, we aim at conducting a comprehensive survey that reviews and analyzes the state-of-the-art redaction mechanisms. We start by giving a general presentation of blockchain and summarize the typical methods of inserting data in blockchain. Next, we discuss the challenges of designing the redaction mechanism and propose a list of evaluation criteria. Then, redaction mechanisms of the existing mutable blockchains are systemically reviewed and analyzed based on our evaluation criteria. The analyses include algorithmic overviews, performance limitations, and security vulnerabilities. Finally, the comparisons and analyses provide new insights into these mechanisms. This survey will provide developers and researchers a comprehensive view and facilitate the design of future mutable blockchains.},

  abstract     = {Augmented assembly (AA) is being gradually incorporated into manual assembly owing to its abundant instruction forms, high efficiency of information transmission, and robust interactivity. However, a lack of a unified description model for assembly information and irregular instruction design forms leads to difficulties in instruction authoring and generation, inconveniences for data management, and low system portability. To address these issues, this paper presents an information-integration and instruction-authoring method for AA systems. First, design guidelines for the AA instructions are established with the aim of minimizing the user&#39;s cognitive load. After that, the designing of visual elements is performed based on the design guidelines, and the information model of the assembly information and instructions is built using Unified Modeling Language. Based on Extensible Markup Language files and Unity3D engine, a standard and rapid development process is presented for deploying the AA system to Hololens2 devices. The usability and replicability of the designed system are demonstrated, and a user study is carried out. The user&#39;s task performance is evaluated using completion time and errors as metrics. The NASA-task load index scale is used to estimate the user&#39;s workload, and the Likert scale reflects the user&#39;s subjective perception of the system and instructions. The results show that the proposed AA instructions can effectively improve the user&#39;s task performance; reduce their workload, especially the cognitive load; and improve their assembly experience.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear causal inference approach based on vector-based BRB. In the modeling process of BRB, the original attributes are ranked by contribution rate and transformed into attribute vectors. Meanwhile, combined with the -means method, appropriate referential vectors are obtained. Thereby a vector-based BRB can be established. In the inference process of BRB, the idea of full activation of vector-based rules is presented. By calculating the spatial matching degree of the testing sample and the referential vectors, activation weights of the rules which are used in the evidential reasoning algorithm are acquired. Experimental results of a nonlinear function with four-dimensional input and the pipeline leakage detection data show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},

It is of vital importance to develop DeepFake detection methods, among which three-dimensional (3D) convolution neural networks (CNN) have attracted wide interest and achieved satisfying performances. However, there are few 3D CNNs designed for DeepFake detection and the parameters of them are large, which cause heavy memory and storage consumption. In this paper, a lightweight 3D CNN is proposed for DeepFake detection. Channel transformation module is designed to extract features with much fewer parameters in higher level. Serving as spatial-temporal module, 3D CNNs are adopted to fuse the spatial features in time dimension. To suppress frame content and highlight frame texture, spatial rich model features are extracted from the input frames, which helps the spatial-temporal module achieve better performance. Experimental results show that the number of parameters of the proposed network is much less than those of other networks and the proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art DeepFake detection methods on mainstream DeepFake data sets.},

  abstract     = {The project selection problem in an electric distribution utility, which is part of the network expansion planning task, requires a formal process of prioritizing some projects since the budget is limited. A complete solution to this problem, involving optimization and a decision-making model, is still a few explored in the literature. We proposed an integrated multicriteria decision-making methodology, including optimization and solutions ranking. The optimization module finds a set of Pareto-optimal portfolios, using the multi-objective genetic algorithm nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II to select and schedule the reinforcement projects in a multistage planning horizon. The proposed decision support module ranks the project portfolios based on Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART), considering the decision-maker profile embedded into the model by the Rank-Order Centroid (ROC) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) criteria weights. This paper tackles this methodology&#39;s theoretical foundations, taking into account some essential attributes, such as power quality and operational performance indexes, the number of consumers, and projects&#39; financial impacts. We presented realistic case studies to show how portfolios are composed, not only when all nine attributes of projects are included in the optimization module, but also when the criteria weights are changed in the decision support module. This paper&#39;s main contribution lies in proposing a unique model to find optimal expansion plans and rank these project portfolios, considering the decision-maker profile adherent to its goals. About the decision-making methods applied in this problem, we infer that the TOPSIS performance overcomes SMART in all analyzed problems and the ROC and AHP weights indicate the same alternative in most of the analyzed cases.},

  abstract     = {Most existing research about task allocation in mobile crowdsensing mainly focus on requester-centric mobile crowdsensing (RCMCS), where the requester assigns tasks to workers to maximize his/her benefits. A worker in RCMCS might suffer benefit damage because the tasks assigned to him/her may not maximize his/her benefit. Contrarily, worker-centric mobile crowdsensing (WCMCS), where workers autonomously select tasks to accomplish to maximize their benefits, does not receive enough attention. The workers in WCMCS can maximize their benefits, but the requester in WCMCS will suffer benefit damage (cannot maximize the number of expected completed tasks). It is hard to maximize the number of expected completed tasks in WCMCS, because some tasks may be selected by no workers, while others may be selected by many workers. In this paper, we apply task bundling to address this issue, and we formulate a novel task bundling problem in WCMCS with the objective of maximizing the number of expected completed tasks. To solve this problem, we design an algorithm named LocTrajBundling which bundles tasks based on the location of tasks and the trajectories of workers. Experimental results show that, compared with other algorithms, our algorithm can achieve a better performance in maximizing the number of expected completed tasks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hybrid evolutionary intelligent system is proposed for dimensionality reduction and tuning the learnable parameters of artificial neural network (ANN) that can forecast the future (1-day-ahead) close price of the stock market using various technical indicators. Although the ANN possesses the ability to model highly uncertain and complex nonlinear data but the key challenge in ANN is tuning its parameters and minimizing the feature set that can be used in the input layer. The backpropagation approach used for training the ANN has a limitation to get trapped in local minima and overfitting the data. Motivated by this, we proposed a hybrid intelligent system for optimizing the initial parameters and for reducing the dimensions of the feature set. The proposed model is a combination of feature extraction technique, namely principal component analysis (PCA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for training the feed-forward neural networks (FFNN). This paper also compares the forecasting efficiency of the proposed model with PSO-FFNN, regular FFNN, two standard benchmark approaches viz. GA and DE and another hybrid model obtained by the combination of PCA and a time series econometric model viz. auto-regressive distributed lag model. The presented technique has been tested to predict the close price of three stock indices viz. Nifty 50, Sensex, and S&amp;P 500. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model shows superior forecasting accuracy as compared with other methods.},

To extend the effective use of the DEMATEL method in multicriteria group decision making problems, we propose some improvements for traditional DEMATEL. The direct-influence matrix is a pairwise comparison matrix of the influence level between criteria, which is the basis of the DEMATEL method. Instead of utilizing crisp numbers to assess the level of direct-influence, each expert provides evaluation with hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) based on an individual linguistic term set, that is, multigranular hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. To obtain a reasonable and satisfying collective DIM, we propose the expert weights model based on the similarity and entropy of HFLTSs and introduce the consensus reach process that is an iterative and dynamic process of modifying experts’ opinions more similar or closer to obtain the satisfying group solution. Considering the increasing complexity of the decision environment and the intricate relationship between the criteria, the Otsu method is applied to determine the threshold value of the total-influence matrix that is the sum of the direct influence and indirect influence and thus eliminate some unnecessary influence. Finally, the feasibility of the improved method is illustrated by an example of information warfare and analysis. Comparative results are presented to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an optimal event-triggered tracking control scheme for completely unknown nonlinear systems under the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework. A data-driven model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is first constructed to model the system uncertainties including the drift dynamics and the input gain matrix, and the modeling error caused by NN approximation is well eliminated through adding a compensation term in the data-driven model such that the model state can asymptotically track the system state. Apart from the traditional construction of optimal tracking controllers, in this paper, an augmented system is developed and a discounted performance function is considered to achieve the optimality. By employing the Bellman optimal principle, an event-triggered tracking Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is then formulated. The approximate solution of the HJB equation can be obtained by virtue of a critic NN, which significantly simplifies the implementation architecture of ADP. Both the historical state data and the current state data are incorporated into the updating of the weight vector in the critic NN, in this circumstance, the persistence of excitation assumption is not needed anymore. It is strictly proven via Lyapunov stability theory that the tracking error state and the critic NN weight are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results examine the validity of the design scheme.},

To describe in the relationship between evidence (conflict or correlation) more accurately, an evidence correlation coefficient based on generalized information quality is proposed. First of all, according to Deng entropy to measure the uncertainty of each evidence, and combined with the information quality of Yager, new generalized information quality is proposed, which performs well in measuring the basic probability assignment&#39;s certainty. Second, the evidence itself is modified by generalized information quality, and the evidence correlation coefficient is calculated based on the Pearson coefficient formula. A new measurement method of evidence conflict based on evidence correlation coefficient is proposed. Finally, combined with the evidence correlation coefficient and DEMATEL model, the evidence is discounted and combined. Numerous examples are used to analyze and compare the evidence conflict coefficient and the evidence combination results. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other evidence conflict measurement methods, the evidence conflict coefficient calculated by this method can reflect the difference between evidence more effectively.

In the first phase, a decision matrix is constructed using the intersection between the 12 key concepts and smart e-tourism data management applications of each category and subcategory in smart e-tourism. In the second phase, the integration of the IT2TR-FWZIC formulation and VIKOR is presented to compute the weights for the 12 key concepts and benchmark the smart e-tourism data management applications for each category. The results are as follows: (1) A clear difference is found among the criteria weights (12 smart key concepts). Specifically, the real-time criterion achieves the highest importance weight (0.098), whereas augmented reality obtains the lowest weight (0.068). The context-awareness and recommender systems have the same weight value (0.087), and the other eight criteria are distributed in between. (2) The smart e-tourism data management applications are evaluated and benchmarked effectively per category and subcategories. (3) Benchmarked applications in each category are subjected to a systematic ranking in the evaluation process. The sensitivity analysis has shown high correlation outcomes to the systematic ranking results over the 31 scenarios of criteria weight changing. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed work with other existing studies is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In the field of evolutionary algorithms, Pareto-based algorithms are less effective when more than three objectives are encountered, due to the lack of sufficient selection pressure. In this paper, a Pareto-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm with reference direction and coordinated selection strategy, abbreviated as SPEACSS, is proposed. The algorithm inherits the fitness calculation strategy of the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm, while it applied an efficient reference direction-based density estimator and a novel selection strategy. Moreover, mating selection and environmental selection are complementary and coordinated in the evolutionary process and have better performance than be used alone. In the criteria of mating selection, a method is given to improve the effectiveness of the parent combination. Experimental results on benchmark functions show that the proposed algorithm is superior to several state-of-the-art designs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved algorithm in balancing diversity and convergence.},

T-SFS covers the degree of truth, abstinence, and falsity with a rule that the sum of the qth-powers of all degrees is restricted to the unit interval. Moreover, for examining the interrelationships among any number of T-SFSs, we construct the idea of T-spherical fuzzy Dombi prioritized weighted arithmetic (T-SFDPWA) aggregation operators, T-spherical fuzzy Dombi prioritized arithmetic, T-spherical fuzzy Dombi prioritized geometric, and T-spherical fuzzy Dombi prioritized weighted geometric (T-SFDPWG) aggregation operators are given. Then, the basic properties of T-SFDPWA and T-SFDPWG aggregation operators are investigated and discussed in some of their cases. The investigated operators based on T-SFS are utilized in the environment of multiattribute decision-making problems to find the consistency and proficiency of the developed operators. In last, we illustrated some numerical examples based on explored operators is to examine the reliability and validity of the investigated operators with the help of comparative analysis and graphical representations with some existing ideas to show the presented approaches are extensive powerful.},

  abstract     = {In practical decision-making problems, the coexistence of several complex situations increases the difficulty for decision makers to make reasonable decision, such as attributes outnumber alternatives, heterogeneous relationships among multiple attributes, and individual risk tendency of decision maker. In view of the advantage of probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) in presenting qualitative information, a novel decision-making approach with PLTSs is constructed to deal with the above special situations simultaneously. To realize this goal, some basic models have been proposed. First of all, to truly reflect the importance of attributes from the heterogeneous relationships, a weight determination model with generalized Banzhaf values is developed to analyze the interaction between combinations of attributes. Then, for analyzing the individual risk tendency of decision maker, the generalized Banzhaf TODIM method with PLTSs is constructed. Moreover, based on the above research results, the generalized Banzhaf TODIM-QUALIFLEX method with PLTSs is developed to solve decision-making problems where the number of attributes exceeds the number of alternatives, the combinations of attributes are interacted with each other, and decision maker is affected by individual risk propensity. Lastly, smartphones selection through online ratings is a typical case of decision-making problems with the above situations, which is designed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. And its rationality and advantages are further demonstrated through some comparative analyses with other methods.},

  abstract     = {Modern information technology, such as the internet of things (IoT) provides a real-time experience into how a system is performing and has been used in diversified areas spanning from machines, supply chain, and logistics to smart cities. IoT captures the changes in surrounding environments based on collections of distributed sensors and then sends the data to a fog computing (FC) layer for analysis and subsequent response. The speed of decision in such a process relies on there being minimal delay, which requires efficient distribution of tasks among the fog nodes. Since the utility of FC relies on the efficiency of this task scheduling task, improvements are always being sought in the speed of response. Here, we suggest an improved elitism genetic algorithm (IEGA) for overcoming the task scheduling problem for FC to enhance the quality of services to users of IoT devices. The improvements offered by IEGA stem from two main phases: first, the mutation rate and crossover rate are manipulated to help the algorithms in exploring most of the combinations that may form the near-optimal permutation; and a second phase mutates a number of solutions based on a certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in local minima and to find a better solution. IEGA is compared with five recent robust optimization algorithms in addition to EGA in terms of makespan, flow time, fitness function, carbon dioxide emission rate, and energy consumption. IEGA is shown to be superior to all other algorithms in all respects.},

  abstract     = {Many group decision making (GDM) models enable experts to use only one preference information representation form. It is natural to allow experts to express preferences in various formats considering the heterogeneity of experts. In this case, how to reach the consensus of a group from heterogeneous preference information is an attractive research issue. This study proposes a consensus reaching process for large-scale GDM with heterogeneous preference information. First, we review various preference formats including preference orderings, numerical assessments, interval-valued assessments, and linguistic assessments. To facilitate the heterogeneous information aggregation, we classify experts into subgroups according to their preference types rather than the similarities of preference values, and then aggregate the homogeneous preference values in each subgroup. The subgroup priorities derived by homogeneous methods are then aggregated into global priorities. An ordinal consensus measuring process based on individual orderings is introduced. To reach the ordinal consensus, optimization models are constructed to ensure each subgroup&#39;s preferences equivalent to the global preferences, and the recommended ranges and strength of preference modification are given to experts. Finally, the proposed method is validated by an illustrative example about blockchain platform selection.},

First, in what measure an approximation distance is taken as a safe distance guaranteeing the safety of the follower drivers. Second, how to control the follower&#39;s vehicle velocities based on the stimulus of the leading vehicle. In this context, to resolve the driving control problem in the CF driving behavior, a bilevel optimization is presented in this paper, based on the behaviors of the follower and leader drivers. Bearing in mind that mathematics has contributed to the imitation of human behaviors, they are now reaching a level of complexity requiring the entry on the scene of a new player, which is artificial intelligence. Thus, in this paper; we used the fuzzy logic theory for modeling a follower driver with a nonnormative behavior. To validate our model, we used a data set from the program of the US Federal Highway Administration. Therefore, according to the experimental results, there is homogeneity between the actual and the simulated travel trajectories in terms of deviation. Besides, the driver&#39;s behavior adopted (normative or nonnormative) is reflected in his reactions to the various components of the road.},

  abstract     = {The maintenance of cash levels under certain security thresholds is key for the health of the banking sector. In this paper, the monitoring process of branch network cash levels is performed using a single intelligent system which should provide an alert when there are cash shortages at any point of the network. Such an integral solution would provide a unified insight that guarantees that branches with similar cash features are secured as a whole. That is to say, a triggered alarm at a specific branch would indicate that attention must also be paid to similar (in-cash-feature) branches. The system also incorporates a (complementary) specific treatment for individual branches. The Early Warning System for securing cash levels presented in this paper (cash level EWS) is deliberately free of local demographic specifications, thereby overcoming the current lack of worldwide definitions for local demographics. This aspect would be particularly valuable for banking institutions with branch networks all over the world. A further benefit is the cost reductions that are a result of replacing several approaches with a single global one. Instead of local demographic parameters, a solid theoretical model based on Markov random fields (MRFs) has been developed. The use of MRFs means a reduction in the amount of information required. This would mean a higher processing speed as well as a significant reduction in the amount of storage capacity required. To the best of the author&#39;s knowledge, this is the first time that MRFs have been applied to cash monitoring.},

In this paper, we classify RL into direct and indirect RL according to how they seek the optimal policy of the Markov decision process problem. The former solves the optimal policy by directly maximizing an objective function using gradient descent methods, in which the objective function is usually the expectation of accumulative future rewards. The latter indirectly finds the optimal policy by solving the Bellman equation, which is the sufficient and necessary condition from Bellman&#39;s principle of optimality. We study policy gradient (PG) forms of direct and indirect RL and show that both of them can derive the actor–critic architecture and can be unified into a PG with the approximate value function and the stationary state distribution, revealing the equivalence of direct and indirect RL. We employ a Gridworld task to verify the influence of different forms of PG, suggesting their differences and relationships experimentally. Finally, we classify current mainstream RL algorithms using the direct and indirect taxonomy, together with other ones, including value-based and policy-based, model-based and model-free.},

Gao et al. conjectured that if a graph with satisfies or , then is a -factor deleted graph. It&#39;s proved that this conjecture holds. However, it is found that as the connectivity changes, the tight lower bound of isolated toughness for -factor deleted graphs will change as well.

  abstract     = {For the application of probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) in multicriteria group decision making (MCGDM), this paper aims to develop an approach to solve the preference problem. First, a belief interval interpretation of PLTSs is presented, which makes it possible to represent the mathematical operations on PLTSs as the operations on belief intervals. This can reduce the uncertainty degree of information caused by the differentiated knowledge and cognitions of decision makers. Then, two methods of belief interval measure are proposed. One is the distance measure, which is utilized to obtain the criteria weights of each decision maker, so as to recognize the preferences for criteria. The other is the probability degree, which is used to get the partial order relation for alternatives of each decision maker, and to recognize the preferences for alternatives. Next, employing Dempster&#39;s rule of combination and graph theory, a visual algorithm is constructed to solve the MCGDM preference problem in the application of PLTSs. Finally, an illustrative example for the selection of emergency materials deployment scheme and the comparative analyses are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Firefly algorithm (FA) is a popular swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. Though FA was employed to solve various optimization problems, it still has some deficiencies, such as high complexity, slow convergence rate, and low precision of solutions. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes an efficient FA based on modified search strategy and neighborhood attraction (namely MSSNaFA). In MSSNaFA, there are four main modifications. First, a novel search strategy based on dimension differences is designed. The attractiveness in the original FA is related to the Euclidean distance, while our new method uses the differences of each dimension for two fireflies to compute the attractiveness. Then, a modified neighborhood attraction mechanism is utilized to reduce the computational complexity. When the current solution is selected, it will move to the global best solution based on the new movement strategy. Third, for each firefly, three neighborhood search operations are carried out based on a preset probability. Lastly, the step factor is adaptively adjusted in the search process. Performance validation between MSSNaFA and four other FA variants show the effectiveness of our approach.},

On the basis of the unique spatial computing property of the maximum energy coefficient of DHT and the energy aggregation principle of multilevel image transform, the color watermark image scrambled by Affine transform is directly hidden into color carrier image by quantitative techniques in the spatial domain, rather than the complex DHT domain. The specific performance of the scheme in various aspects is as follows: (1) the average value of the peak signal-to-noise ratio is higher than 40 dB; (2) the average value of structural similarity index metric remains above 0.9700; (3) the average value of normalized cross-correlation under no attack is 1.0000; (4) the average value of normalized cross-correlation. under attack is above 0.9600; (5) the total execution time is 1.1856 s; (6) the maximum embedding capacity is 0.0625 bpp; and (7) the entire key space is greater than 2.

  abstract     = {A large number of people suffer from anxiety in modern society. As an effective treatment with few side effects, music therapy has been used to reduce anxiety for decades in clinical practice. Yet therapists continue to perform music selection, a key step in music therapy, manually. Considering the growing need for music therapy services and social distancing amid public emergencies, an automatic method for music selection would be of great practical utility. This paper marks the first effort to identify music with therapeutic effects on anxiety reduction via a novel music scoring model. We formulate the calculation of a therapeutic score as a quadratic programming problem, which minimizes score variance among known therapeutic songs while maintaining their superiority over other songs. The proposed model can uncover common features that contribute to anxiety reduction by learning from small and unbalanced data. Using a music therapy experiment, we find that the proposed model outperforms existing techniques in predicting therapeutic songs. Feature analysis is also conducted, revealing that high-frequency spectrums are important in therapeutic scoring.},

By replacing the first convolutional layer in a network with a function using a custom set of filters, we can reduce the number of operations required to compute the layer&#39;s outputs. These filters are composed of four rectangles, labeled as either positive or negative, within the filter space. When combined with an integral image, these filters allow for more efficient computations of feature values than a standard convolutional layer. When using our custom filters of shape 5 × 5, the layer only requires 64\% of the operations that a standard convolutional layer need. This reduction only increases as the filter sizes get larger. Empirically, we have found that these layers&#39; real-world execution times behave as theoretically calculated and that their optimizations do not lead to significant drop inaccuracy.

Therefore, in this paper, we developed an emergency decision support model for consideration of patients care and admission scheduling (PCAS). The complex decision support model assigns a set of patients into a number of restricted resources like rooms, time slots, and beds depending on satisfying a number of predefined constraints such as disease severity, waiting time, and disease types. This is a crucial issue with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). In this paper, we first begin an assessment into the admission and care to tackle this issue and collect four factors effecting the admission and care of COVID-19 patients that form a system of criteria. While there is a lot of vague and uncertain data that can be effectively depicted for these indicators by the spherical hesitant fuzzy set, then, we implement a strong MCDM method based on list of aggregation operators to address the patients&#39; hospital admission and care. Last of all, a numerical real-life application about PCAS is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approaches along with relevant discussions, the merits of proposed approaches are also analyzed by validity test. The proposed methodology has been shown to help hospitals manage the admissions and care of COVID-19 patients in a flexible manner.},

Compared to the Pythagorean and interval Pythagorean fuzzy sets, PCFS contains comprehensive information suitable for solving complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. However, the use of existing PCFS comparison tools, including score-function and distance-measurement, is impractical in some cases. To address this concern, this study transforms PCFS into the geometric form, and proposes the use of the PCFS geometric-distance measurements. The proposed method requires the maximum and minimum values of membership and nonmembership degrees to be considered positive and negative reference points, respectively. Moreover, the gain and loss matrices are constructed. The risk-preference coefficient is introduced to improve the original prospect-value expression. The final ranking results of decision-makers considering several risk preferences are presented by balancing the proportion of the positive and negative prospect values, thereby constructing an MCDM model based on the PCFS-geometric-distance measure and prospect theory. The feasibility and practicality of this model are validated via a case study concerning urban human settlements to ensure satisfactory housing conditions and appropriate infrastructure development. As observed, the proposed model can adequately evaluate urban human settlements, thereby demonstrating the potential to solve similar problems. A sensitivity analysis of the risk-preference coefficient and subsequent comparison against existing methods reveal the proposed MCDM model to yield convincing results.},

The pelvic lymph node is a key indicator of colorectal cancer metastasis. In the traditional process, an experienced radiologist must read all the CT scanning images slice by slice to track the lymph nodes for future diagnosis. However, this process is time-consuming, exhausting, and subjective due to the complex pelvic structure, numerous blood vessels, and small lymph nodes. Therefore, automated methods are desirable to make this process easier. Currently, the available open-source CTLNDataset only contains large lymph nodes. Consequently, a new data set called PLNDataset, which is dedicated to lymph nodes within the pelvis, is constructed to solve this issue. A two-level annotation calibration method is proposed to guarantee the quality and correctness of pelvic lymph node annotation. Moreover, a novel system composed of a keyframe localization network and a lymph node detection network is proposed to detect pelvic lymph nodes in CT scanning images. The proposed method makes full use of two kinds of prior knowledge: spatial prior knowledge for keyframe localization and anchor prior knowledge for lymph node detection. A series of experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed method, including ablation experiments, comparing other state-of-the-art methods, and visualization of results. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other methods on PLNDataset and CTLNDataset. This system is expected to be applied in future clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {The goal of diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from suspected pneumonia cases, that is, recognizing COVID-19 from chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) images, is to improve diagnostic accuracy, leading to faster intervention. The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust diagnosis model. To this end, there are three challenges to overcome: (1) The lack of training samples limits the success of existing deep-learning-based methods. (2) Many public COVID-19 data sets contain only a few images without fine-grained labels. (3) Due to the explosive growth of suspected cases, it is and to diagnose not only COVID-19 cases but also the cases of other types of pneumonia that are similar to the symptoms of COVID-19. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called to address the problem of differentiating COVID-19 from pneumonia cases. During training, our model cannot use any true labels and aims to gain the ability of learning to learn by itself. In particular, we first present a deep diagnosis model based on a relation network to capture and memorize the relation among different images. Second, to enhance the performance of our model, we design a self-knowledge distillation mechanism that distills knowledge within our model itself. Our network is divided into several parts, and the knowledge in the deeper parts is squeezed into the shallow ones. The final results are derived from our model by learning to compare the features of images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we construct a new COVID-19 pneumonia data set based on text mining, consisting of 2696 COVID-19 images (347 X-ray + 2349 CT), 10,155 images (9661 X-ray + 494 CT) about other types of pneumonia, and the fine-grained labels of all. Our data set considers not only a bacterial infection or viral infection which causes pneumonia but also a viral infection derived from the influenza virus or coronavirus.},

  abstract     = {When making regression predictions, the traditional random forest (RF) algorithm can only make predictions within the training set, which can easily lead to overfitting when modeling data have some specific noise. To solve the problem of over-fitting, an improved RF method is proposed in this paper for wind pressure prediction. With the aim to verify the prediction performance of the improved RF algorithm, this paper predicts the wind pressure coefficients of a high-rise building model without wind pressure measurement points. The results show that the improved RF can achieve good results in predicting the mean and fluctuating wind pressure coefficients of high-rise buildings, and its relative error for each measurement point is basically controlled at 5\%, which is acceptable in engineering terms. Further applications show that this improved RF can be used for wind pressure distribution prediction in other large-span building type wind tunnel tests.},

  abstract     = {In view of the decision-making problem that the alternatives actively participate in the decision-making process and present competitive behavior, this paper proposes a new type of aggregation operator called the competitive behavior induced ordered weighted averaging (CB-IOWA) operator. The primary characteristic of the CB-IOWA operator is that the alternative is permitted to highlight its competitive advantage through the order-inducing variables and the weighting vector. A method is introduced to determine the final weighting vector based on the weights provided by different alternatives that can reflect their competitive advantages. The final weights are calculated by maximizing the closeness degree between the final weights and the ones provided the alternatives. The main properties of the CB-IOWA operator are discussed, such as commutativity, boundness, and monotonicity under certain condition. Finally, an application example regarding the competitive development of the economy-environment of four cities in China is provided to illustrate the usage of the CB-IOWA operator. The validity of the operator is checked by comparison with the weighted arithmetic averaging operator representing noncompetitive behavior.},

This problem was addressed by several approaches with different assumptions about the features of the input data, examples of these approaches being self-training, co-training, STRED, among others. This paper presents a framework for data self-labeling based on deep autoencoder combined with a self-labeled technique that takes into consideration cross-entropy. The model uses the Encoder to reduce the dimensionality of the input that is submitted to a labeling layer. The weights of this layer are adjusted through the learning from a clustering performed in the space, which is the reduced dimensionality space. Results showed that the proposed method obtained competitive performance in relation to classic methods that are found in the literature.},

  abstract     = {A new class of link flooding attacks (LFA) can cut off internet connections of target links by employing legitimate flows to congest these without being detected. LFA is especially powerful in disrupting traffic in software-defined networks if the control channel is targeted. Most of the existing solutions work by conducting a deep packet-level inspection of the physical network links. Therefore these techniques incur a significant performance overhead, are reactive, and result in damage to the network before a delayed defense is mounted. Machine learning (ML) of captured network statistics is emerging as a promising, lightweight, and proactive solution to defend against LFA. In this paper, we propose a ML-based security framework, CyberPulse++, that utilizes a pretrained ML repository to test captured network statistics in real-time to detect abnormal path performance on network links. It effectively tackles several challenges faced by network security solutions such as the practicality of large-scale network-level monitoring and collection of network status information. The framework can use a wide variety of algorithms for training the ML repository and allows the analyst a birds-eye view by generating interactive graphs to investigate an attack in its ramp-up stage. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that the framework offers limited bandwidth and computational overhead in proactively detecting and defending against LFA in real-time.},

  abstract     = {Cloud vendors (CVs) play an indispensable role in the development of IT sectors and industry 4.0. Many CVs evolve every day, and a systematic selection of these is becoming substantial for organizations. Literature studies have shown that multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) is a powerful tool for systematic selection. However, the major issue with the state-of-the-art models is that they do not effectively represent uncertainty. Moreover, the personalized selection of CVs based on user queries is not prominent in an MCDM context. In this paper, to circumvent these issues, a new decision framework is proposed that utilizes a generalized preference style called interval-valued probabilistic linguistic term set (IVPLTS). This preference style considers occurring probability values as interval numbers instead of a single precise value, which provides flexibility during preference elicitation. Initially, missing values are imputed systematically by using a case-based method. Then, the consistency of these preferences is checked using Cronbach&#39;s alpha coefficient, and the inconsistent preferences are repaired rationally by using an iterative method. A programming model is proposed for determining the weights of the evaluation criteria. Furthermore, Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) is extended to IVPLTS for aggregating preferences from each expert. The interval-valued probabilistic linguistic comprehensive (IVPLC) method is proposed for prioritizing CVs in a personalized manner. Finally, the framework&#39;s practicality is validated by using a case study of CV selection for an academic institution; strengths and weaknesses of the framework are conferred by comparison with extant CV selection models.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor network (WSN), increasing the network life span remains as a crucial challenge yet to be resolved. The modeling of effectual methods is necessary for conserving the scarce energy resources in WSN. To overcome such issues, cross-layer protocols are exploited, which concerns routing the messages with increased lifetime. This study introduces a new cross-layer design routing model under a clustering-based approach. More importantly, the cluster head is optimally selected by a new hybrid algorithm termed as moth flame integrated dragonfly algorithm. Moreover, the optimal selection of cluster head is carried out based on parameters such as energy consumption, delay, distance, throughput, security, and overhead. Finally, the supremacy of the presented model is proved over existing models in terms of alive node analysis and network lifetime analysis. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed algorithm for test case 3 has accomplished a higher value of 66.229, which is 29.07\%, 13.33\%, 26.36\%, and 9.67\% better than conventional ant lion optimisation approach, grouped grey wolf search optimisation, firefly replaced position update in da, and alpha wolf-assisted whale optimization algorithm, respectively, for median case scenario.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces the PU idea and achieves detecting abnormal events with a limited number of partially labeled data.

  abstract     = {The current unsupervised cross-domain detection methods need source domain data to retrain the detection model in target domain. However, the source domain data may be unavailable due to privacy, decentralization, or computation resource restrictions. A natural idea is to optimize the parameters of the source domain model by self-supervised learning based on pseudo labels. We propose another approach from the viewpoint of noise perturbation without pseudo-labeling. It can be assumed that the source and target domains are actually derived from a domain invariant space through domain-specific perturbations, respectively. A super target domain can be constructed by augmenting more target domain perturbations to the target domain images. The optimal direction of the target domain to the domain invariant space can be approximated as the alignment direction from the super target domain to the target domain. Based on this idea, we propose a novel method called SOAP (SOurce data-free domain Adaptation through domain Perturbation) which can remove domain perturbation from the target domain. The image-level, instance-level, and category consistency regularizations based on Mean Teacher structure are proposed to learn the correct alignment direction. Specifically, the category consistency can also further improve the classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that SOAP achieves better performance surpassing the baseline (Faster R-CNN) and multiple state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods which need to access source domain data.},

  abstract     = {Smart product-service systems (Smart PSS) are receiving increasing attention due to their potentials to satisfy customer needs and create sustainability to meet hybrid concerns. As a value co-creation business paradigm, various sustainable value propositions (SVPs) and their assessments come from stakeholders&#39; subjective judgments, which values are imprecise, vague, and even inconsistent. The reliability of these values also varies with the confidence and cognitive bias of the respective stakeholder. How to evaluate these co-creative SVPs to ensure an objective and reliable result under such uncertain environments becomes a critical issue. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a rough-Z-number extended multi-criteria group decision-making framework integrating the rough-Z-number, DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory), and group decision-making strategy to evaluate the co-creative SVPs for Smart PSS. A novel rough-Z-number is presented to deal with the uncertainty and reliability representation of the stakeholder&#39;s individual assessment as well as the aggregation and subjectivity manipulation of these risk assessments from different stakeholders. A rough-Z-number extended DEMATEL is then proposed to determine the risk prioritization of the co-creative SVPs. Experimental results and comparative studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed rough-Z-number-based DEMATEL in handling the uncertainty and reliability characterization as well as the subjectivity manipulation during the evaluation of the co-creative SVPs.},

Belief intervals are easier to manage than a BPA to represent uncertainty-based information. For this reason, several uncertainty measures for DST recently proposed are based on belief intervals. In this study, we carry out a study about the crucial mathematical properties and behavioral requirements that must be verified by every uncertainty measure on belief intervals. We base on the study previously carried out for uncertainty measures on BPAs. Furthermore, we analyze which of these properties are satisfied by each one of the uncertainty measures on belief intervals proposed so far. Such a comparative analysis shows that, among these measures, the maximum of entropy on the belief intervals is the most suitable one to be employed in practical applications since it is the only one that satisfies all the required mathematical properties and behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy sets that have been presented so far are generally related to one-coordinate variables. However, some variables are identified by two coordinates, such as a location on a plane. In this case, the membership degree of each point in a fuzzy set is determined by considering the simultaneous values of both coordinates. In this paper, we develop the classical fuzzy set for two-coordinate variables; we call it the volumetric fuzzy set (VFS) due to the fact that a point on a plane along with its membership degree forms a corresponding point in a three-dimensional coordinate system. In this study, we present a specific type of VFS in which there is only one ideal point with the highest membership degree, and the membership degrees of other points are inversely correlated with their distances from this ideal point. For this purpose, we apply three types of distances which are Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distances. The membership function extracted based on Euclidean distance may have a common volumetric shape, a cone shape, for example, described in detail in this paper; while those extracted based on the other types of distance usually have unusual volumetric shapes. This study also shows the application of the VFS in optimization problems. For this purpose, three location optimization problems are developed based on different types of volumetric membership functions and then solved using the max–min approach. To illustrate the proposed volumetric optimization models, three numerical examples are used and their results are compared.},

  abstract     = {Selfish mining attacks sabotage the blockchain systems by utilizing the vulnerabilities of consensus mechanism. The attackers&#39; main target is to obtain higher revenues compared with honest parties. More specifically, the essence of selfish mining is to waste the power of honest parties by generating a private chain. However, these attacks are not practical due to high forking rate. The honest parties may quit the blockchain system once they detect the abnormal forking rate, which impairs their revenues. While selfish mining attacks make no sense anymore with the honest parties&#39; departure. Therefore, selfish miners need to restrain when launch selfish mining attacks such that the forking rate is not preposterously higher than normal level. The crux is how to illustrate the attacks toward the view of honest parties, who are blind to the private chain. Generally, previous works, especially those using Markov decision processes, stress on the increment of attackers&#39; revenues, while overlooking the detection on forking rate. In this paper, we propose, to maintain the benefit from selfish mining, an improved selfish mining based on hidden Markov decision processes (SMHMDP). To reduce the forking rate, we also relax the behaviors of selfish miners (also known as semi-selfish miners), who mine on the private chain, to mine on public chain with a small probability . Simulation results show that SMHMDP can trade off between revenues and forking rate. Put differently, selfish miners benefit from attacking within an acceptable forking rate toward the view of honest parties, without leading selfish mining attacks to be an armchair strategist.},

  abstract     = {The world faced a major disruption in the form of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which caused many countries to impose severe restrictions on movement, popularly known as “lockdown.” These lockdowns impacted transportation adversely, leading to massive disruptions in global and local supply chains. As the local markets were shut down, more people started turning to e-commerce logistics platforms offering doorstep deliveries of essential items (food and medicines). This resulted in an explosion in demand for such services, and businesses struggled to complete their deliveries. Additionally, the volume of real-time text data suddenly increased, as these customers started sharing their feedback on social media platforms. The availability of real-time raw text data and its popularity for solving complex business problems motivated the development of the approach proposed herein to address last-mile delivery issues. Thus, this paper suggests the use of Twitter data to identify the various grievances of customers about e-commerce logistics platforms. Natural language processing, a popular tool for text analytics, is employed to extract consumer tweets from the Twitter profiles of such businesses and subsequently to clean, process, and analyse them. Issues are categorized and used as objectives in a multiobjective fuzzy vehicle routing problem (VRP). An integrated hybrid fuzzy VRP is developed and coded to solve last-mile delivery issues. Experimental results and comparative analyses highlight the benefits of the novel approach. Managerial insights and scope for future research assist in the further development of the idea.},

Investigating that the information could be qualitative and quantitative, and the different measurement units cause difficulties in some MADM problems, the additive ratio assessment system (ARAS) method was proposed. The method tries to solve MADM problems through a simple way efficiently, and at the same time eliminates the influence of different measurement units. Till now, the method has received extensive attention and has been extended to different information environments and application fields. To know about the development of the method and improve the method efficiently, this paper reviews the studies on the ARAS method from the perspectives of basic information (including the bibliometrics analyses and the outline of ARAS method), the development on theory (including the development on MADM mechanism, different information environments, and combination with different methods), the development on the application and the future challenge. From the overview, the basic situations and the development of the ARAS method are presented clearly, and the analyses of the challenges can also provide useful and sufficient instructions for the future application and improvement of the method.},

Based on the numerical simulations in different scenarios, we systematically study the dependence of SME growth performance on various factors, including capital structure, investment preference, and internal risk level, and find that dynamical optimal equity structure always corresponds to the better performance on value at response risks, and significantly reduces the bilateral cooperative risk at the inconspicuous cost of systematic response risk. Moreover, it is also observed that SME state behaves some important nonmonotonous features, such as stochastic resonance with internal risk level, generalized stochastic resonance with operating capital leverage. These results will provide the latent support for SMEs to create useful decision rules in capital optimization, risk management, and growth path regulation.},

The FFS introduced by Senapati and Yager, carries out uncertain and imprecise information smartly in exercising decision-making than IFS and PFS. A generalized form of union and intersection on FFS can be formulated from a generalized T-norm and T-conorm. Hamacher operations such as Hamacher product and Hamacher sum, are good alternatives to product and sum. In this course of this article, we first device new operations on Fermatean fuzzy information by employing Hamacher T-conorm and T-norm and discuss basic operations. Induced by the Hamacher operations and FFS, we propose Fermatean fuzzy Hamacher arithmetic and also geometric aggregation operators. In the first section, we introduce the concepts of a Fermatean fuzzy Hamacher weighted average operator, a Fermatean fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted average operator, and a Fermatean fuzzy Hamacher hybrid weighted operator and discuss their basic properties in detail. In the second part, we develop Fermatean fuzzy Hamacher weighted geometric operator, Fermatean fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted geometric operator, and Fermatean fuzzy Hamacher hybrid geometric operator. We study essential properties and a few special cases of our newly introduced operators. Then, we make use of these proposed operators in developing tools which are key factors in solving the Fermatean fuzzy multiattribute decision-making situations. The cyclone disaster assessment phenomena is considered as a direct application for analysis and to demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our model. Further, comparison analysis is conducted for the authenticity of our proposed operators.},

  abstract     = {Real-estate advertisements through electronic and print media are bringing considerable fortune to the global real-estate sector. However, innovative advertisement methods must be adopted if real estate aims to transform into smart real estate. The current study, which is based on a systematic literature review of 58 articles published in the last decade, identifies key media for real-estate advertisements as print media (e.g., magazines, brochures, newspapers, and digests), electronic media (e.g., websites, social media, and other digital tools), and mixed methods (e.g., billboards, signs and banners, and personalized messaging). This study takes the case of Kingsford suburb in the eastern Sydney area, and investigates the performance of the Australian real-estate industry in general and lists the key dynamics of properties in Kingsford and its prominent real-estate agencies. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based smart real-estate advertisement material delivery system is proposed to deliver advertisement materials and gifts to the potential customers of these agencies. The system paths are optimized through four Java-run algorithms: greedy, interroute, intraroute, and Tabu. Results based on six cases, three each for rent and sales with varying numbers of customers and UAVs and an 8-h operating time, indicate that the Tabu algorithm provides the best-optimized paths in all cases, followed by the interroute, intraroute, and greedy algorithms. However, the inter- and intraroute algorithms show superior performance in terms of computation speed. The proposed framework is a practical approach in disrupting the real-estate advertising sector, thereby helping this sector transform into a smart real estate consistent with industry 4.0 goals.},

  abstract     = {The competition in the telecommunications industry is mainly reflected in the competition for the number of key customers. Therefore, how to effectively prevent the loss of large customers is a problem that many telecommunications companies are very concerned about. This paper establishes a customer churn prediction model based on the improved bat algorithm (IBA) optimized extreme learning machine (ELM), with the purpose of discovering potential churn customers in time and taking measures to retain them in advance. This paper uses the IBA to optimize the initial random weights of the ELM, so as to improve the prediction accuracy of the ELM. To overcome the shortcomings of the bat algorithm (BA) that the convergence speed is too slow in the early stage and difficult to converge in the later stage, this paper introduces the inertia weight into the speed update formula. To improve the population diversity and local search ability of the BA, this paper adds a chaotic local search method to balance the global search ability of the BA in the early stage. To control the search range of the BAs in the later stage, the lane flight formula is introduced into the position update formula to speed up the convergence speed of the algorithm. Then according to the result of function optimization, it can be seen that IBA has a significant improvement in convergence speed and accuracy. Finally, IBA was used to optimize ELM, and a customer churn prediction model was established. The empirical results show that the predictive model proposed in this paper can effectively identify lost customers and lay a foundation for improving the competitiveness of the telecommunications industry in the future.},

  abstract     = {In multiattribute group decision-making (MAGDM), experts often articulate their preference information to support decision-making by applying the multigranular linguistic model. Thus, the present work aims to introduce a novel MAGDM model to manage multigranular generalized orthopair 2-tuple linguistic information (GO2TLI). To begin with, a generalized orthopair 2-tuple linguistic model is put forward with the attempt of taking advantages of both -rung orthopair fuzzy set (-ROFS) and the 2-tuple linguistic model, while a transformation approach is supplied to tackle the consistency of multigranular GO2TLI. In addition, the Archimedean Copula as well as the Co-Copula operators are extended to handle GO2TLI along with their operational laws, to comprehensively model the relationship among attributes and experts. The Banzhaf Choquet-Copula aggregation operators on the generalized orthopair 2-tuple linguistic (GO2TLBCCA) are introduced, also some of its properties discussed. Third, the algorithms for regulating and determining the fuzzy measure (FM) of attributes and experts sets are proposed, followed by the corresponding decision-making approaches based upon the proposed GO2TLBCCA. The proposed MAGDM model can not only accommodate effectively the FMs of attribute (and expert) sets which are given subjectively, but also effectively address some multigranular GO2TLI as well as the partially unknown or completely unknown weights of attribute and expert sets. Finally, a case study is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach along with relevant discussions, the merits of the proposed approach are also analyzed by comparing with some extant decision methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the uncertainty of human subjective judgments, it is sometimes very difficult to obtain accurate evaluation information. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is one of the functional methods used to solve the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. However, the traditional TOPSIS is based only on a distance measure and takes into account neither a similarity measure nor a likelihood measure. Therefore, in this article, we define two new information measures which are called as the projection and divergence and more functional than some other existing ones in the neutrosophic sets. Then we develop an innovative TOPSIS (DPL-TOPSIS) based on the hybrid closeness coefficient which is an optimization of the ivergence (distance), rojection (similarity), and ikelihood (magnitude) closeness coefficients that can also use separately to make the decision in neutrosophic environment. To develop the DPL-TOPSIS, we define three kinds of analogical factors: the distance-like positive and negative divergence decision-making factors, the similarity-like positive and negative projection decision-making factors, and the magnitude-like positive and negative likelihood decision-making factors. In addition, we provide an objective weight determination model to determine expert judgment with the proposed divergence measure. Finally, to demonstrate the functionality of the developed DPL-TOPSIS, an application has been made on selection of the masks used as one of the protection methods in the COVID-19 epidemic, which has recently affected our world, and the results are compared with other existing methods.},

In the process of developing the AOs, some operational laws of DH-ROF numbers based on D-CN&amp;-Ns are defined first. Several important properties of the developed operators are discussed. The proposed AOs are used to frame a new methodology to solve multicriteria group decision making problems under DH-ROF contexts. Several illustrative examples are solved to demonstrate effectiveness and benefits of the developed method. Sensitivity analysis is performed to show the variations of ranking values with the change of different parameters in the decision making contexts.

In this study we address the case where there is uncertainty over a given observation and explore it. This can happen, for example, when the observation outputs are collected by sensors with some noise, that are known to return incorrect value with some probability. We formally define this problem for abductive and consistency-based forms domains. Furthermore, we propose two complete and sound algorithms for finding and ranking all diagnoses and analyze their complexity. We dive deeper and improve the first algorithm&#39;s efficiency even more by exploiting past results. Finally, we propose a third algorithm that returns the most likely diagnosis without finding all possible diagnoses, assuming the uncertainty over the observations and the components behavior modes are independents. Experimental evaluation shows that the last algorithm can be very efficient in cases where the diagnosis cardinality, as well as the uncertainty likelihood over the observation, are expected to be small. If, however, all possible diagnoses are desired, then the choice between the first two algorithms depends on whether the domain&#39;s diagnosis form is abductive or consistent.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there is an increasing concern in machine learning about the causes underlying unfair decision making, that is, algorithmic decisions discriminating some groups over others, especially with groups that are defined over protected attributes, such as gender, race and nationality. Missing values are one frequent manifestation of all these latent causes: protected groups are more reluctant to give information that could be used against them, sensitive information for some groups can be erased by human operators, or data acquisition may simply be less complete and systematic for minority groups. However, most recent techniques, libraries and experimental results dealing with fairness in machine learning have simply ignored missing data. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the relation between missing values and algorithmic fairness for machine learning: (1) we analyse the sources of missing data and bias, mapping the common causes, (2) we find that rows containing missing values are usually fairer than the rest, which should discourage the consideration of missing values as the uncomfortable ugly data that different techniques and libraries for handling algorithmic bias get rid of at the first occasion, (3) we study the trade-off between performance and fairness when the rows with missing values are used (either because the technique deals with them directly or by imputation methods), and (4) we show that the sensitivity of six different machine-learning techniques to missing values is usually low, which reinforces the view that the rows with missing data contribute more to fairness through the other, nonmissing, attributes. We end the paper with a series of recommended procedures about what to do with missing data when aiming for fair decision making.},

  abstract     = {A corpus is a massive body of structured textual data that are stored and operated electronically. It usually combines with statistics, machine learning algorithms, or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to explore the semantic relationship between lexical units, and beneficial when applied to language learning, information processing, translation, and so forth. In the face of a novel disease, like, COVID-19, establishing medical-specific corpus will enhance frontline medical personnel&#39;s information acquisition efficiency, guiding them on the right approaches to respond to and prevent the novel disease. To effectively retrieve critical messages from the corpus, appropriately handling word-ranking issues is quite crucial. However, traditional frequency-based approaches may cause bias in handling word-ranking issues because they neither optimize the corpus nor integrally take words&#39; frequency dispersion and concentration criteria into consideration. Thus, this paper develops a novel corpus-based approach that combines a corpus software and Hirsch index (H-index) algorithm to handle the aforementioned issues simultaneously, making word-ranking processes more accurate. This paper compiled 100 COVID-19-related research articles as an empirical example of the target corpus. To verify the proposed approach, this study compared the results of two traditional frequency-based approaches and the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can refine corpus and simultaneously compute words&#39; frequency dispersion and concentration criteria in handling word-ranking issues.},

Based on this, the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has attracted considerable attention. Its main purpose is to simulate users&#39; behavior habits of check-in behavior. Then, different types of context information are used to construct a personalized recommendation model. However, the users&#39; check-in data are extremely sparse, which leads to low performance in personalized model training using recurrent neural network. Therefore, we propose a category-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) model to mitigate the negative impact of sparse check-in data, capture long-range dependence between user check-ins and get better recommendation results of POI category. We combine the spatiotemporal information of check-in data and take the POI category as users&#39; preference to train the model. Also, we develop an attention-based category-aware GRU (ATCA-GRU) model for the next POI category recommendation. The ATCA-GRU model can selectively utilize the attention mechanism to pay attention to the relevant historical check-in trajectories in the check-in sequence. We evaluate ATCA-GRU using a real-world data set, named Foursquare. The experimental results indicate that our ATCA-GRU model outperforms the existing similar methods for next POI recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Representation-based classification (RBC) has been attracting a great deal of attention in pattern recognition. As a typical extension to RBC, collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) has demonstrated its superior performance in various image classification tasks. Ideally, we expect that the learned class-specific representations for a testing sample are discriminative, and the representation computed for the true class dominates the final representation of the testing sample. Most existing CRC-based methods can learn pattern discrimination, but cannot differentiate the contribution of class-specific representations to the classification of each testing sample. It is challenging for a representation-based classifier to retain both properties. To address this challenge and further improve CRC&#39;s classification performance, we propose a novel CRC-based method, class mean-weighted discriminative collaborative representation-based classifier (CMW-DCRC). Its objective function penalises the standard -norm residuals with two discriminative regularisation terms. A decorrelating term makes the class-specific representations more discriminative, and a newly designed class mean-weighted term that promotes the training samples from individual classes to competitively reconstruct the testing sample while boosting the contribution of the true class. To further enhance the robustness of CRC, we extend CMW-DCRC by replacing the -norm coding residual with a -norm coding residual, and solve the optimisation problem with an iteratively reweighted least square algorithm. Extensive experimental results on nine image data sets have shown that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art RBC-based methods.},

By combining these two ideas, this paper is divided into three parts. First, the CN--ROFS concept is introduced and its features are read. Moreover, some operation laws are defined to combine the different elements of the proposed set. Second, a novel measure of the degree of possibility is presented to measure the degree of possibility within the given objects. Finally, a group decision-making method for solving problems with uncertain information is propagated and illustrated with a series of examples.

To mitigate this issue, this study investigates some feature selection methods and introduces an ensemble of Neural Networks and Random Forest to improve the detection performance. In particular, we design an intelligent system that can choose an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. In the evaluation, we study the feasibility of our approach with KDD99 data set and evaluate its practical performance with a real data set collected from a Honeynet environment.

  abstract     = {Sampling method is one of the most commonly used techniques in dealing with imbalanced data. Most of the existing undersampling methods randomly select samples from negative class with replacement. However, it may lose some important information of the training data. Moreover, increasing the positive data by oversampling in high imbalanced situations may cause the overlapping problem. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a hybrid sampling method. The method takes the distributions of the training data into consideration by the information entropy, thus distinguishing the important samples in the undersampling procedure. Meanwhile, since the positive data only extend to the size of each subset of the negative class in the oversampling, the overlapping problem is relieved. Further, the method retains all the data in the training procedure and generates various data views from the original training data. Then each view is handled with an individual basic classifier. Finally, all the basic classifiers are combined by the ensemble method. The newly proposed method is named as Entropy-based Hybrid Sampling Ensemble Learning (EHSEL). In addition, the EHSEL is applied to three different kinds of basic classifiers to validate its robustness. Experiments results show the great effectiveness of the EHSEL on real-world imbalanced data sets.},

Answering the increase in the number of infected patients during the pandemic is one of the biggest challenges for healthcare systems, where resources have already been employed by a significant number of patients. While assigning most of the resources to infected people is an effective way in a short-term planning, its bitter effects on regular healthcare cannot be undervalued. Moreover, within this plan the risk of spreading the disease to other patients and healthcare providers is another risk that should not be underestimated. Therefore, in this study, we proposed the Delphi-based multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for selecting the most appropriate location for an isolation hospital serving only epidemic-based patients with mild to moderate symptoms. The integrated framework consists of Delphi, Best–Worst Method, and interval type-2 fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methodologies. Nine most effecting criteria are considered in the evaluation of five alternative locations in a real case study conducted at the European side of Istanbul. Ataturk Airport is determined as the best location to set up an isolation hospital based on determined nine evaluation criteria. The effectiveness and robustness of the framework are analyzed through comparative and sensitivity analyses.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering (MVC) collects complementary and abundant information, which draws much attention in machine learning and data mining community. Existing MVC methods usually hold the assumption that all the views are complete. However, multiple source data are often incomplete in real-world applications, and so on sensor failure or unfinished collection process, which gives rise to incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC). Although enormous efforts have been devoted in IMVC, there still are some urgent issues that need to be solved: (i) The locality among multiple views has not been utilized in the existing mechanism; (ii) Existing methods inappropriately force all the views to share consensus representation while ignoring specific structures. In this paper, we propose a novel method termed partial MVC with locality graph regularization to address these issues. First, followed the traditional IMVC approaches, we construct weighted semi-nonnegative matrix factorization models to handle incomplete multiview data. Then, upon the consensus representation matrix, the locality graph is constructed for regularizing the shared feature matrix. Moreover, we add the coefficient regression term to constraint the various base matrices among views. We incorporate the three aforementioned processes into a unified framework, whereas they can negotiate with each other serving for learning tasks. An effective iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the resultant optimization problem with theoretically guaranteed convergence. The comprehensive experiment results on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The inappropriate dumping of agricultural residues (ARs) can result in environmental pollution and the waste of valuable energy resources. The process of converting ARs to energy has been considered an important step for regional energy, agricultural development, and environmental sustainability and recently, many sustainable bioenergy technologies (BETs) have been developed for ARs. Since the assessment of ARs-to-energy conversion technologies contains several alternatives concerning multiple criteria with imprecise information, it is deliberated as an uncertain multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is an important and effective way to tackle the uncertainty present in real-life decision-making problems. To select a suitable conversion technology from a set of options and upgrade the ARs-to-energy industries, the present study develops a combined approach to PFSs based on weighted discrimination-based approximation (WDBA). This method extends the classical WDBA approach using an improved score function and discrimination measure within the PFS context, to evaluate MCDM problems with partial information on the criteria weights. To estimate the weights of the unknown attributes, a score function-based linear programming model is developed. A new ranking method is extended to grade the options using the proposed discrimination measure within the PFS environment. Further, a case study assessing ARs-to-energy conversion technologies is conducted to illustrate the practicality and feasibility of this method. A comparative analysis shows that the approach developed is more effective and proficient in facilitating decision experts&#39; selection of desirable BETs for ARs.},

However, the common sign test has serious drawbacks such as loss of information by considering solely signs of observations but not their magnitudes, various problems related to handling of ties in the data, and the lack of embedding uncertainty regarding the fraction of underlying quantile. To address these issues, we present an extended sign test based on fuzzy categories and fuzzy formulated hypotheses that improves the generality, versatility, and practicability of the common sign test. This generalized test procedure is neat in theory and practice and avoids disadvantages that are often associated with fuzzy tests (e.g., a considerably higher complexity of the underlying model, a fuzzy test decision, and a possibilistic instead of a probabilistic interpretation of test results). In addition, we perform a comprehensive case study on COVID-19 in HIV-infected individuals with a focus on human body temperature and related measurement problems. The results of the study clearly indicate that fuzzy categories and fuzzy hypotheses improve the performance of the sign test.},

  abstract     = {The increasing complexity of the modern engineering system has made the multisource information fusion a necessary yet challenging task. In the context of reliability engineering, the information fusion process is either ineffective or less efficient as the aggregation error increases with respect to the collection of multiple dependent pieces of evidence. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a comprehensive Bayesian approach for system reliability evaluation that considers multiple, dependent sources of information. We show that the so-called “Bayesian anomaly,” a type of aggregation error, is caused by misuse of the dependent information and could be eliminated if all available information is properly addressed. A topological technique is employed as a tool for information fusion in the likelihood construction. A likelihood-based approach is then developed to formulate the overall likelihood as well as the reliability model. These two techniques are embedded into a comprehensive Bayesian framework to allow for an efficient evaluation of the system reliability. Our approach has also been extended to include imprecise information, such as interval and/or censored data, which is more frequently encountered in practical engineering. We demonstrate the proposed method through several numerical cases and one real-life application example. This study provides a better understanding of the role of dependent information in system reliability evaluation. In addition, it presents an efficient pathway to extract the inherent dependency information embedded in imperfect data sets.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in energy consumption is a crucial step towards developing efficient energy saving systems, diminishing overall energy expenditure and reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, implementing powerful techniques to identify anomalous consumption in buildings and providing this information to end-users and managers is of significant importance. Accordingly, two novel schemes are proposed in this paper; the first one is an unsupervised abnormality detection based on one-class support vector machine, namely UAD-OCSVM, in which abnormalities are extracted without the need of annotated data; the second is a supervised abnormality detection based on micromoments (SAD-M2), which is implemented in the following steps: (i) normal and abnormal power consumptions are defined and assigned; (ii) a rule-based algorithm is introduced to extract the micromoments representing the intent-rich moments, in which the end-users make decisions to consume energy; and (iii) an improved K-nearest neighbors model is introduced to automatically classify consumption footprints as normal or abnormal. Empirical evaluation conducted in this framework under three different data sets demonstrates that SAD-M2 achieves both a highest abnormality detection performance and real-time processing capability with considerably lower computational cost in comparison with other machine learning methods. For instance, up to 99.71\% accuracy and 99.77\% F1 score have been achieved using a real-world data set collected at the Qatar University energy lab.},

Some of their necessary properties are also discussed. In the proposed method, a generalized weighted distance measure is developed using a linguistic-scale function to evaluate differences among linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy sets (LPFSs). An entropy measure is also introduced for LPFS to measure fuzziness associated with linguistic decision information. Moreover, a technique for ordering preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)-based methodology is constructed through the newly defined concepts to address linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy multicriteria group decision-making problems, where the information about weight is either completely known or unknown. Subsequently, weights of decision makers are computed through a TOPSIS-based algorithm, and weights of criteria are evaluated by introducing a linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy entropy weight model. To minimize information loss throughout the decision-making procedure, aggregation is done at the final stage for obtaining the final ranking of alternatives. Finally, several practical examples are considered, solved, and compared with existing methods to exhibit the robustness of the proposed methodology. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed to establish the dynamic nature of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Multi-instance learning (MIL) can model complex bags (samples) that are further made of diverse instances (subsamples). In typical MIL, the labels of bags are known while those of individual instances are unknown and to be specified. In this paper we propose an imbalanced deep multi-instance learning approach (IDMIL-III) and apply it to predict genome-wide isoform–isoform interactions (IIIs). This prediction task is crucial for precisely understanding the interactome between proteoforms and to reveal their functional diversity. The current solutions typically formulate the prediction of IIIs as a MIL problem by pairing two genes as a “bag” and any two isoforms spliced from these two genes as “instances.” The key instances (interacting isoform pairs) trigger the label of the positive (interacting) gene bags, which is important for identifying the IIIs. Furthermore, the prediction task was simplified as a balanced classification problem, which in practice is a rather imbalanced one. To address these issues, IDMIL-III fuses RNA-seq, nucleotide sequence, amino acid sequence and exon array data, and further introduces a novel loss function to separately model the loss of positive pairs and of negative pairs, and thus to avoid the expected loss dominated by majority negative pairs. In addition, it includes an attention strategy to identify positive isoform pairs from a positive gene bag. Extensive experimental results prove the effectiveness of IDMIL-III on predicting IIIs. Particularly, IDMIL-III achieves an F1 value as 95.4\%, at least 3.8\% higher than those of competitive methods at the gene-level; and obtains an F1 as 29.8\%, at least 2.4\% higher than the state-of-the-art methods at the isoform-level. The code of IDMIL-III is available at .},

We argue that the existing PoWs based on Merkle hash tree and specific encodings are not much efficient if the size of message is sufficiently huge. In this paper, we first propose a new PoW protocol based on the chameleon hash function without key exposure. Interestingly, it is equivalent to having the prover compute a new collision of chameleon hashing as the proof in our construction. Therefore, the proposed protocol is much efficient since the computation and storage overhead of proof is independent of the size of the message. Moreover, we utilize the proposed PoWs to design a deduplication scheme over ciphertext.},

Online support is available through which students can hire professional developers to code their regular programming tasks. These facilities make it easier for students to practice plagiarism. First, raw source codes are cleaned from noisy data to extract meaningful codes as the actual logic is more important to the programmers. Second, pre-processing techniques based on tokenization are used to convert filtered codes into meaningful tokens. It breaks the codes into small instances with the number of occurrences known as the frequency. Thirdly, the local and global weighting scheme method is applied to estimate the significance of each feature in an individual or a group of documents. It helps us greatly to zoom in on the importance of each feature of how effective it is for the next phase. Fourth, the single value decomposition method is used to reduce the dimensions of these features by maintaining the actual semantics of the source codes. This technique is used to remove overloaded noise information and collect only those features that are more effective for plagiarism detection. Fifth, the latent semantic analysis (LSA) technique is used to mine the actual semantics of the source codes in the form of latent variables. After that, the LSA features are used as input to cosine similarity to compute the plagiarism among different source codes. To validate the proposed approach, we used the topic modeling approach to group the relevant features into different topics.},

  abstract     = {The concept of Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets represents a superior tool to model complex uncertainties in an ambiguous and equivocal decision-making framework. In consideration of the significant capacity for exhibiting the uncertainty of subjective appraisals and estimations under the aegis of the PF theory, this paper presents a simple-to-operate decision-making approach that is grounded in some beneficial concepts of original likelihood functions and measurements of dominating and dominated characters. On the strength of beta distributions, this paper seeks to propound new notions of PF likelihood functions and likelihood-oriented dominating/dominated characters and to launch an exploitable multiple criteria evaluation method by means of a dominance ordering model for treating decision analysis within PF environments. This paper initiates an efficient beta distribution-based approach to the construction of novel PF likelihood functions that can quantify the possibility degrees of outranking and outranked relationships between Pythagorean membership grades. The applicable satisfaction and dissatisfaction estimations are established on the likelihood-oriented dominating and dominated characters, respectively. Furthermore, this paper formulates a straightforward dominance ordering model to obtain the ultimate dominance ranking orders of candidate alternatives and accomplish multiple criteria decision-making issues involving complicated uncertainty. A financing decision-making problem concerning working capital requirements is investigated to validate the application results using the advanced methodology. The real-world application is implemented to examine the reasonableness and efficacy of the established techniques. Moreover, comparative studies through the utility of a sensitivity analysis are performed to demonstrate the efficacy and merits of the dominance ordering model. The comparison results manifest that the initiated methodology is an advantageous and reliable decision-making technique that can enhance the methodological development regarding the multiple criteria evaluation model under PF uncertainty. Finally, recommendations for future research directions are also presented in the conclusions.},

To alleviate the above problems, simplified BFO with quorum sensing (QS) is proposed. First, a novel computational framework is provided to reduce the computational complexity, leading to a simplified version. Second, the concept of “QS,” bacterial reciprocal behavior, is integrated into the simplified version by utilizing a new position updating equation coupled with a dynamic communication topology. Each bacterium adjusts its search trajectory based on both biased random walk and promising search directions provided by its communicatees. The communicatees are selected via a dynamic communication topology, where a rank-based communication strategy and two information mutation schemes are used for global exploration of the search space. Finally, a parameter automation strategy is introduced to promote the exploitation of promising regions. Further, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are empirically confirmed on 30 benchmark functions, by comparing it with the four variants of BFO and four other advanced algorithms.},

Online production recommendation plays a key role in the development of e-commerce, and can greatly improve consumers&#39; shopping experiences. However, few online shopping sites provide interactive decision aids for consumers such that they can articulate their preferences towards multiple selection attributes with the purpose of mitigating choice difficulty and improving decision quality. Additionally, consumers&#39; risk attitudes to online shopping dramatically impact their product choices. In the model proposed in this paper, the risk attitude-based power average (RAPA) operator is used to integrate the risk attitude of the decision-maker into the information fusion process of multiple attribute decision-making. Subsequently, the risk attitude function, with several basic types, is introduced to quantify the risk attitude of the decision-maker for use in the RAPA operator. A proportional hesitant fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic term set (PHF2TLTS) is constructed by incorporating a binary of linguistic information aiming to comprehensively analyze the hybrid product information. With a focus on the information fusion process, the proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic RAPA operator and weighted proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic RAPA operator are introduced to aggregate a given set of PHF2TLTSs. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated using an illustrative example, a comparison with existing approaches and detailed explanations of the performance differences.},

The control law depends on the quadrotor states and the observer states, and guarantees that the attitude synchronization error converges to zero for all quadrotors, under aggressive maneuvers.

  abstract     = {Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild is a very challenging problem due to different expressions under complex scenario (e.g., large head pose, illumination variation, occlusions, etc.), leading to suboptimal FER performance. Accuracy in FER heavily relies on discovering superior discriminative, emotion-related features. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end module to disentangle latent emotion discriminative factors from the complex factors variables for FER to obtain salient emotion features. The training of proposed method contains two stages. First of all, emotion samples are used to obtain the latent representation using a variational auto-encoder with reconstruction penalization. Furthermore, the latent representation as the input is thrown into a disentangling layer to learn a set of discriminative emotion factors through the attention mechanism (e.g., a Squeeze-and-Excitation block) that encourages to separate emotion-related factors and nonaffective factors. Experimental results on public benchmark databases (RAF-DB and FER2013) show that our approach has remarkable performance in complex scenes than current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we developed a hybrid deep learning (DL) model, which is one of the first interpretable hybrid DL models with Inception modules, to give a descriptive prediction of drug side-effects. The model consists of a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) with Inception modules to allow more efficient learning of drug molecular features and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) recurrent neural networks to associate drug structure with its associated side effects. The outputs from the two networks (GCNN and BiLSTM) are then concatenated and a fully connected network is used to predict the side effects of drugs. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.846 irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen. It has a precision score of 0.925 and the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores obtained were 0.973, 0.938, 0.927, and 0.318 which show significant achievements despite the fact that a small drug data set is used for adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction. Moreover, the model is capable of accurately structuring correct words to describe drug side-effects and associates them with its drug name and molecular structure. The predicted drug structure and ADR relation will provide a reference for preclinical safety pharmacology studies and facilitate the identification of ADRs during early phases of drug development. It can also help detect unknown ADRs embedded in existing drugs, hence contributing significantly to the science of pharmacovigilance.},

  abstract     = {Physical defects reduce the organic solar cells (OSC) functioning. Throughout the OSC fabrication process, the defects can occur, for instance, by scratches or uneven morphologies. In general, bulk defects, interface defects, and interconnect defects can promote shunt and series resistance of the cell. It is crucial to properly detect and classify such defects and their amount in the structure. Correlating such defects with the performance of the cell is important both during the R&amp;D stages to optimize processes, and for mass production stages where defects detection is an integral part of the production line. For the recognition of texture variations in the scanning electron microscope images caused by these defects is crucial the definition of a set of features for texture representation. Because the low-order Zernike moments can represent the whole shape of the image and the high-order Zernike moments can describe the detail. Then, in our case, the feature of the image can be represented by a small number of Zernike moments. In fact, the feature set extracted and described by the Zernike moments are not sensitive to the noises and are hardly redundant. So it possible concentrate the signal energy over a set of few vectors. Finally, for classification, an elliptical basis function neural networks was used. The results show effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In fact, we obtained correct classification of 89.3\% over testing data set.},

In this paper, we introduce and formalize two intelligent community deception methods to conceal the nodes from various CDAs. We used node-based matrices, persistence and safeness scores, to formalize the optimization problems to confound the CDAs. The persistence score is used to destabilize the constant communities in the network while the safeness score is used to assess the level of hiding of a node from CDAs. The objective functions aim to minimize the persistence score and maximize the safeness score of the nodes in the network. From the simulation results, it can be analyzed that the proposed strategies are intelligently concealing the community information in the complex industrial system.},

The rehabilitation of Patients&#39; limb functions has great medical value, for example, the therapy of functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems, but suffers from effective rehabilitation evaluation. In this paper, six gestures of upper limb rehabilitation were monitored and collected using microelectromechanical systems sensors, where data stability was guaranteed using data preprocessing methods, that is, deweighting, interpolation, and feature extraction. A fully connected neural network has been proposed investigating the effects of different hidden layers, and determining its activation functions and optimizers. Experiments have depicted that a three-hidden-layer model with a softmax function and an adaptive gradient descent optimizer can reach an average gesture recognition rate of 97.19\%. A stop mechanism has been used via recognition of dangerous gesture to ensure the safety of the system, and the lightweight cryptography has been used via hash to ensure the security of the system. Comparison to the classification models, for example, -nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and other random gradient descent algorithms, was conducted to verify the outperformance in recognition of upper limb gesture data. This study also provides an approach to creating health profiles based on large-scale rehabilitation data and therefore consequent diagnosis of the effects of FES rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {In the customer segmentation problem, a large number of features are manually designed and used to comprehensively describe the customer instances. However, some of these features are irrelevant, redundant, and noisy, which are not necessary and effective for customer segmentation. Feature selection is an important data preprocessing method by selecting important features from the original feature set. Particularly, feature selection in customer segmentation is a multiobjective problem that aims to minimize the feature number and maximize the classification performance. This paper proposes a multiobjective feature-selection method based on a meta-heuristic algorithm—hydrological cycling optimization (HCO)—to solve customer segmentation. The proposed method is able to automatically evolve a set of non-dominated solutions that select small numbers of features and achieve high classification accuracy. To this end, three strategies based on the global flow operator, possibility-based acceptance criteria, and density-based evaporation and precipitation are proposed to improve the global search ability and the solution diversity of the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed approach is examined on three customer-segmentation datasets and compared with original multiobjective HCO and six well-known evolutionary multiobjective algorithms. The results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach in solving multiobjective customer-segmentation problems by achieving higher calculation stability, search diversity, and solution quality compared with the other competing methods.},

Similar to other artificial intelligence-based applications, A3C-based pathfinding is also threatened by the adversarial attack. In this paper, we are the first to study the adversarial attack to A3C, that can unexpectedly wake up longtime retraining mechanism until successful pathfinding. We also discover an attack example generation to launch the attack based on gradient band, in which only one baffle of extremely few unit lengths can successfully perform the attack.

To overcome these two drawbacks, we propose a novel hesitant fuzzy linguistic decision-making method to solve the problem of evaluating startup companies. To this end, a novel semantic comparison method based on the experts&#39; psychology and the ratio of score value to deviation degree is proposed to compare the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. Then, a novel definition of hesitant fuzzy linguistic information envelopment efficiency (HFLIEE) is proposed, based on which, a novel hesitant fuzzy linguistic information envelopment analysis (HFLIEA) model and a novel preference model are proposed. By solving these models, all the alternatives can be ranked and nonoptimal alternatives can be improved. Finally, the numerical analysis is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed models and the robustness analyses of the proposed models are provided.

When considering the performance of MECS, it is often full of uncertainty. The rung orthopair fuzzy set (ROFS), characterized by membership and nonmembership degrees with adjustable parameter , is quite a high-efficiency way to capture uncertainty. In this paper, first, information measure (entropy, distance measure, and similarity measure)-based area difference under the rung orthopair fuzzy (ROF) circumstance is studied along with their detailed proofs. Then, we present a comprehensive weight-determination method by combining objective weights (determining by entropy) and subjective weights (given by experts) as combined weights, which can effectually alleviate the unconscionable influence of extreme data on evaluation results and simultaneously reflect objective data and subjective emotion. Moreover, ROF score function-based distance measure is presented for dealing with a value comparison problem. Later, ROF multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) method called total area based on orthogonal vector (TAOV) is introduced. Moreover, its feasibility is illustrated by MECS selection problem. Finally, a comparison of some existing MCDM methods and the proposed method is constructed for displaying their effectiveness. This proposed method can effectively avoid counterintuitive phenomena, eliminate antilogarithm by negative and zero issue, and has no division by zero issue.},

Intuitively, an orness measure quantifies the similarity of an aggregation function to the “or” function and results in an essential tool for decision engineering, field in which the choice of aggregation function is sometimes restricted to a desired value of orness (orness-directed aggregation). In 1988, Yager presented a particular example of orness measure for ordered weighted averaging (OWA) functions and initiated a series of contributions aiming at proposing an axiomatic definition of orness measure for OWA functions. In this paper, we go much further and present an axiomatic definition of orness measure for the whole family of aggregation functions. We end by proposing two natural construction methods for an orness measure for aggregation functions. The particular examples of the (discrete) Choquet integral and uninorms are studied in detail.},

  abstract     = {This study applies reinforcement learning (RL) from the AI machine learning field to derive an optimal Bitcoin-like blockchain mining strategy. A salient feature of the RL learning framework is that an optimal (or near-optimal) strategy can be obtained without knowing the details of the blockchain network model. Previously, the most profitable mining strategy was believed to be honest mining encoded in the default blockchain protocol. It was shown later that it is possible to gain more mining rewards by deviating from honest mining. In particular, the mining problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which can be solved to give the optimal mining strategy. However, solving the mining MDP requires knowing the values of various parameters that characterize the blockchain network model. In real blockchain networks, these parameter values are not easy to obtain and may change over time. This hinders the use of the MDP model-based solution. In this study, we employ RL to dynamically learn a mining strategy with performance approaching that of the optimal mining strategy. Since the mining MDP problem has a nonlinear objective function (rather than linear functions of standard MDP problems), we design a new multidimensional RL algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental results indicate that, without knowing the parameter values of the mining MDP model, our multidimensional RL mining algorithm can still achieve optimal performance over time-varying blockchain networks.},

Admissible (total) orders collaborate by reducing the collapse in the ranking of alternatives related to preference relations. In such context, three classes of admissible orders are presented in a non-restrictive way, integrating the concepts of linearity and cardinality and providing support to the comparison between two typical hesitant fuzzy elements. In the sense of hesitant fuzzy logic, the study of fuzzy operators and their main properties is extended considering the admissible linear orders. Namely, the typical hesitant fuzzy aggregation functions, negations and implication functions are discussed mainly related to their (iso/anti)tonicity properties w.r.t. these admissible orders. An algorithmic procedure is introduced illustrating our strategy to solve an ME-MCDM problem, by selecting a Computer Integrating Manufacturing software and making use of the achieved theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial images generated by generative adversarial networks are not close to any existing benign images, and contain nonrobust features that have been identified as critical to the robustness of a machine learning model. Since adversarial images have an underlying distribution that differs from normal images, these kinds of images can offer valuable features for training a robust model. To deal with these special features, we focus on a novel machine learning task of adversarial images classification, where adversarial images can be used to investigate the problem of classifying adversarial images themselves. In the setting of this novel task, adversarial images are the ONLY kind of data used in training and testing, rather than not just a set of testing images as usual. To this end, we propose a novel spatial–frequency ensemble relation network with generative adversarial learning. First, we present a spatial–frequency ensemble representation learning to extract the feature of training images. Second, we design a meta-learning-based relation model to gain the relationship between images. Third, to achieve a robust model, we utilize generative adversarial learning and transform the relationship into a Jacobian matrix. Finally, we design a discriminator model that determines whether an adversarial image is from the matching category or not. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher performance compared with other state-of-the-arts.},

Edge computing could meet the demand for low time consumption by processing data at the edge of the network and then transmitting it to a third-party platform. However, since the credibility of the third-party platform is unknown which can easily leak the privacy of workers. For the transparent mechanism of blockchain, a two-stage privacy protection mechanism based on blockchain is proposed to solve this problem. In the first stage, this paper proposes a double disturbance localized differential privacy (DDLDP) algorithm to disturb the location information of workers. In the second stage, all the sensing data are uploaded to the blockchain through edge nodes, processed by the edge cloud, and fed back to the requester. Blockchain technology not only guarantees the integrity of sensing data, but also prevents the possibility of third-party platforms from leaking workers&#39; privacy. Through extensive performance evaluation and comparative experiments on real data sets, the DDLDP algorithm could effectively protect the privacy of workers and has higher service quality and data availability.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series (MTS) prediction aims at predicting future time series by extracting multiple forms of dependencies of past time series. Traditional prediction methods and deep learning-based prediction methods focus on extracting the dynamic relationships of certain aspects of MTS, especially the temporal characteristics, often neglecting the spatial and temporal dynamic correlations of MTS. Inspired by convolution neural network (CNN) and attention mechanism, this paper proposes a convolution LSTM network model based on MTS prediction with two-stage attention. Specifically, we first propose a new MTS preprocessing method to perform convolution operations better. Then convolution layer extracts spatial correlation of MTS and LSTM model extracts temporal correlation. It is worth mentioning that the combination of attention mechanism and LSTM can effectively solve the problem of insufficient time dependency in MTS prediction. In addition, dual-stage attention mechanism can effectively eliminate irrelevant information, select the relevant exogenous sequence, give it higher weight, and increase the past value of the target sequence to further eliminate irrelevant information. Finally, the MTS spatio-temporal correlation is extracted to improve the prediction accuracy, and the model is interpreted. Experimental results show that the model has broad application prospects. Experiments based on typical datasets of finance, environment, and energy determine the optimal window size and hidden size of the prediction, and demonstrate that the model achieves the state-of-the-art effect compared to the other four deep learning models. On top of that, the model is not only suitable for single-step prediction of MTS, but also suitable for multistep prediction of time step in a certain range.},

Recently, some approaches have extended the BoDs framework in a fuzzy, “noncrisp” direction, considering probabilities or preferences. While previous approaches have mainly aimed at providing an optimal solution to the set of constraints, we propose an innovative class of approaches in which constraint propagation algorithms aim at identifying the “space of solutions” (i.e., the ) with their preferences, and query answering mechanisms are provided to explore the space of solutions as required, for example, in decision support tasks. Aiming at generality, we propose a class of approaches parametrized over user-defined scales of qualitative preferences (e.g., Low, Medium, High, and Very High), utilizing the and operations to combine preferences, and considering different formalisms to associate preferences with BoDs. We consider both “general” preferences and a form of layered preferences that we call “pyramid” preferences. The properties of the class of approaches are also analyzed. In particular, we show that, when the resume and extension operations are defined such that they constitute a closed semiring, a more efficient constraint propagation algorithm can be used. Finally, we provide a preliminary implementation of the constraint propagation algorithms.},

Optimizing operating conditions can reduce the amount of energy consumed and improve the efficiency of chemical processes. Herein, we developed a machine learning-based prediction model for a distillation process and applied the developed model to process optimization. The energy consumed in the distillation process is mainly used to control the temperature of the distillation column. We developed a model that predicted temperature according to the following procedure: (1) data collection; (2) characteristic extraction from the collected data to reduce learning time; (3) min–max normalization to improve prediction performance; and (4) a case study conducted to select the artificial neural network algorithm, optimization method, and batch size, which are the most appropriate elements for predicting production stage temperature. The result of the case study revealed that the most appropriate model was observed with a root mean squared error of 0.0791 and a coefficient of determination of 0.924 when the long short-term memory algorithm, Adam optimization method, and batch size of 128 were applied. We calculated the amount of steam consumption required to consistently maintain the production stage temperature by utilizing the developed model. The calculation result indicated that the amount of steam consumption was expected to be reduced by approximately 14\%, from an average flow rate of 2763–2374 kg/h. This study proposed a control method applying a machine learning-based prediction model in the distillation process and confirmed that operation energy could be reduced through efficient operation.},

The results show that bipolar fuzzy CPT-TODIM method with unique advantages in some aspects is reasonable and effective, and can be applied to more uncertain decision fields.

  abstract     = {Negation in general represents the contradiction and denial of anything. In classical logic, negation is identified as the logical connective that takes truthfulness to falsehood. However, there can be situations in which we have to deal with the possibility of any truth value besides true or false. The probability theory has been effective in modelling such situations. Therefore exploring the concept of probability functions from the negation point of view should be helpful in investigating new horizons related with a random phenomena. The negation of a probability distribution results from a transformation which reallocates the probability of each event equally among the other alternatives in a finite sample space. Proposed by Yager, this transformation possesses the maximum entropy allocation. Since any type of mixing increases the disorder(uncertainty) in a system, intuitively the uncertainty associated with the obtained negation must be greater than the uncertainty associated with the original probability distribution. A closer look at Yager&#39;s negation reveals that negation of probabilities are convex combinations of the probabilities in the original distribution and we have utilized this for estimating the unpredictability associated with the negation and the implications have been discussed in detail. Also, we have shown that the concept of negation can be helpful for estimation of symmetry and biasness in probability distributions. The binomial distribution has been taken as an example. An extension in case of Atanassov&#39;s intuitionistic fuzzy sets has also been discussed.},

  abstract     = {Information quality has received extensive attention recently. Yager and Petry proposed an information quality suitable for the framework of probability theory, and proposed a method of fusing multisource information, which can improve the information quality required for decision-making. Then, Bouhamed et al. extended information quality to the theory of possibility. However, the basic probability assignment () in evidence theory can deal with uncertainty more effectively. Therefore, this work provides a companion paper that makes the method applicable to evidence theory. This method uses vector notation to represent . A fusion method is designed to select the best quality subset based on two factors: information quality and source credibility function, and using the score function to verify the quality of each subset. Finally, a numerical example details the eight steps of the method, and uses the Iris data set and banknote authentication data set to illustrate the application of the method in pattern recognition.},

  abstract     = {Undoubtedly, most of the information conveyed is full of impreciseness or vagueness. In such situation, fuzzy set theory is a proper tool to handle these types of impreciseness or vagueness. Fuzzy numbers are also of different types based on the presence of uncertainty. Neutrosphic numbers are one type of fuzzy number that consists of three types of membership functions, namely, truth, indeterminacy and falsity. In fact, neutrosophic numbers are generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. These numbers might be used in decision making problems, where it is essential to rank those numbers. So, ordering of these numbers becomes a new trends with more challenges. In this paper, an innovative ranking approach of single-valued neutrosophic number has been put forwarded. The method is based on value, ambiguity and function. Value and ambiguity are defined on three functions of the neutrosophic numbers. Further, the reliability of the proposed method is established by considering the reasonable properties of ranking method. One important aspect of ranking neutrosophic numbers is to consider the consistency in ordering the neutrosophic numbers and their corresponding images. It is worth to mention that the current approach consistently ranks the single-valued neutrosophic numbers as well as their corresponding images.},

The presented work is divided into three folds. The first fold is that the concept of CIFPRs is introduced in this study in which the pairwise comparison values are represented using CIF numbers which have the characteristic of portraying membership and nonmembership degrees over the unit disc of the complex plane. The conditions for additive consistent CIFPR are defined and the related results are explored. In addition, an algorithm for rectifying inconsistent CIFPR is also developed. The second fold is that two goal programming models are established for generating CIF normalized priority weights corresponding to individual and group decision-making problems. The third fold is to develop the algorithms for handling individual and group decision-making problems with CIFPRs. The practicality of the proposed algorithms is shown by applying them to real-life decision-making problems. The results of the presented methods are compared with several existing studies.},

  abstract     = {A novel notion of dense fuzzy lock set was introduced as an extension of fuzzy sets. Learning experiences have a vital role in this fuzzy lock set instigation. The novel fuzzy lock set reduces the fuzziness of the situation. Occasionally, the players are bound to make little changes in their game strategies to reach their goal for some matrix game problems. It may lead to some changes in payoffs. In this scenario, a matrix game&#39;s payoffs are chosen as dense fuzzy lock sets to make the problem more realistic. This paper&#39;s prime intent is to develop a mathematical model of a matrix game that represents payoffs by triangular dense fuzzy lock sets. Initially, a new defuzzification function MagD(.) is defined to find a ranking order relation of the dense fuzzy lock sets. Then a pair of auxiliary dense fuzzy programming problems is established for two players. These two problems are transformed into two equivalent crisp linear programming problems applying the proposed defuzzification function and its linearity property. The reduced problems are solved using LINGO 17.0 software to determine each player&#39;s optimal strategies and the game values. One surprising fact of this approach is that the value of the game increases with the increment of the player&#39;s learning experience. The validity, applicability, and superiority of this proposed methodology are illustrated by considering a real-life media share problem.},

These pipes have different sizes that can be used according to the need. In a particular construction, most of them can be used but some of them are left unused, which are known as leftovers. There are some usable leftovers (standards), whereas others are nonusable (nonstandards) leftovers. These leftovers could be difficult to manage to know which of them could be reused. The reuse of such leftovers become difficult for the construction companies to use them properly. On the other hand, these leftovers would be useful for other construction purposes rather than throw them into the bin. In this paper, we have presented a model and used a heuristic approach to make sure that the leftovers after different constructions could be reused according to the given demand. For this purpose, a genetic-based decision support system is applied to validate the solution feasibility of the problem. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this novel proposed model by numerical experiments, and the leftovers are minimized up to a high extent.},

How to measure the uncertainty in DS evidence theory precisely remains an outstanding problem. Various types of uncertainty measures for evidence have been presented. However, they all suffer some limitations. To address this issue, we propose a novel total uncertainty measure for the DS evidence theory framework that can quantify the uncertainty in the evidence. The new total uncertainty measure uses the Hellinger distance between the belief interval of every singleton and the most uncertain interval. Compared with the existing uncertainty measurement methods, the proposed approach is more sensitive to changes in evidence. The effectiveness and rationality of the brand new total uncertainty measure are illustrated by numerical examples and practical applications.},

At present, there is no research work to summarize nonontology knowledge modeling methods, nor to systematically summarize the processes and techniques of knowledge modeling. In this paper, the processes, techniques, and characteristics of knowledge modeling methods based on ontology and nonontology are surveyed. Three research questions related to knowledge modeling are proposed. (1) What methods can be used for knowledge modeling? (2) What processes are involved in knowledge modeling? (3) What techniques are used in the processes of knowledge modeling? By answering these questions, the results of the survey help developers choose appropriate knowledge modeling methods in their work and complete modeling tasks effectively.

However, images also contain sensitive information that can compromise a person&#39;s privacy or be used for nefarious purposes. To date, most methods for preserving privacy with images have relied on obfuscation techniques, such as pixelation, blurring, or masking parts of the image. However, new face-recognition technologies driven by deep learning are showing cracks in the old techniques. Moreover, faceless recognition is presenting a whole new set of challenges for image privacy. The core of these issues it is how to ensure privacy while still being able to see and use the image. Our solution is a model based on a generative adversarial network that protects identity information while preserving face features of the original image as much as possible. The premise is to generate a fake image of a face that shares all the same attributes as the original image, for example, a brown-eyed child smiling. With this strategy, the image remains useful, but no person or algorithm could determine the identity of the pictured individual. The framework consists of three parts: a detection module, an image creation module, and an image transformation module. The detection module extracts the attribute labels. The image creation module generates images of faces, and the image transformation module transforms the fake features to match the attributes in the original image. A comprehensive set of experiments shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Then, these weights are defuzzified using the center of gravity (COG) method. We also propose an approach to integrate different local weights obtained from different approximated methods to achieve a unified local weight. Moreover, this study proposes a novel and simple approach in which uncommon FNs are indirectly defuzzified based on COG method. This helps extend the multi-attribute decision-making methods to uncommon FNs. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed approaches, three numerical examples are given and their results are compared with some well-known FAHP methods in the literature.},

In fact, IoV implementations are commonly based on wireless nodes, which rely on a limited energy source; therefore, an efficient communication among the nodes is desirable to prolong the lifetime of the devices. In particular, the alternation of active and sleep states and the regulation of the transmission power represent two common approaches to save energy. Based on this strategy, an effective fuzzy control system is presented in the paper to manage power consumption and quality of services of IoV applications. Two fuzzy controllers increase the battery life while keeping a good throughput to workload ratio. This technique has been simulated with two leading technologies in IoV: IEEE 802.11b/g/n and IEEE 802.11p.

  abstract     = {One worthwhile way of expressing imprecise information is the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs), which extend intuitionistic fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. The main goal of this contribution is to further extend the concept of similarity measure for q-ROFSs, which not only endows the similarity framework with more ability to create new ones but also inherits all essential properties of a logical similarity measure. This contribution proposes a class of novel similarity measures for q-ROFSs by drawing a general framework of existing q-ROFS similarity and q-ROFS distance measures. These q-ROFS similarity measures enable us to overcome the theoretical drawbacks of the existing measures in the case where they are used individually. In the application part of the contribution, a pattern recognition problem on classification of building materials with a number of known building materials is reconsidered. The study of this particular case shows that the proposed family of similarity measures consistently classify the unknown building material pattern with the same known building material pattern. Then, an experimental case study regarding a problem of classroom teaching quality is re-examined for the comparison of the performance of proposed similarity measures against the existing ones. The salient features of the proposed similarity measures in comparison to the existing qROFS similarity measures, are as follows: (i) a number of existing q-ROFS similarity measures are inherently correlation coefficients, and they satisfy only a limited number of essential properties of a comprehensive similarity measure; (ii) several existing q-ROFS similarity measures lead sometimes to nonlogical results, more specifically, to the same maximum similarity value for different q-ROFSs; (iii) a variety of existing q-ROFS similarity measures depend on subjective parameters, which either hinder their application in practice or increase their computational cost. In brief, following this direction of research, we will prove the superiority of the developed similarity measures over the existing ones from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints.},

In weighted extended hesitant fuzzy sets (WEHFSs) environment, researchers have only defined a class of correlation coefficients between WEHFSs with values in the unit interval . This is not ideal because it does not extend the classical correlation coefficient in the case of classical sets. In fact, the negative values of the interval are ignored, and such neglectfulness leads to unreasonable results in decision-making. In other words, the existing definitions are unconvincing and lack consistency, which hinder their application potentials. This article addresses this issue by introducing a new class of weighted correlation coefficients of WEHFSs with values in the interval .

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on power aggregation (PA) operators, neutrality average and neutrality geometric aggregation operators are proposed. Furthermore, a general score function for -rung orthopair fuzzy sets (-ROFSs) is proposed. PA can reduce the impact of excessively high or excessively low arguments. It also emphasizes the interrelationship between attributes on the decision matrix. PA and neutrality aggregations (NAs) were hybrid with more fair and neutral decisions of the DMs evaluations. Also, neutrality aggregation operator provides reliable results by taking into account neutrality among decision-makers. On the one hand, through its dynamic structure, -ROFSs provide a wider evaluation for decision-makers (DMs). -ROFSs include many fuzzy sets with varying parameters. One of the most important parts of multi-attribute group decision-making problems is that DMs do not take into account their bias. On the other hand, the NA operator evaluates the decisions of the DMs from a neutral attitude perspective. The power neutrality aggregation operator proposed in this study produces more objective results. The proposed operator is more consistent with the advantages of both operators and it deals with the attitude of DMs more objectively. Validity tests are applied to the proposed methods. Also, the superior aspects of the proposed methods are demonstrated by numerical examples. As a result of validity tests and comparisons with other studies in the literature, it is seen that the proposed methods give effective results.},

These adversarial examples not only exist in the digital world, but also in the physical world. At present, research on autonomous driving platform mainly focus on attacking a single sensor. In this paper, we introduce Camdar-adv, a method for generating image adversarial examples on three-dimensional (3D) objects, which could potentially lunch a multisensor attack toward the autonomous driving platforms. Specifically, with objects that can attack LiDAR sensors, a geometric transformation can be used to project their shape onto the two-dimensional plane. Adversarial perturbations against optical image sensor could be added to the surface of the adversarial 3D objects precisely without changing its geometry. Test results on the open-source autonomous driving data set KITTI show that Camdar-adv can generate adversarial samples for the state of the art object detection model. From a fixed viewpoint, our method can achieve an attack success rate over 99\%.},

On the basis of the idea of quality function deployment (QFD), this paper combines fuzzy G1 method, two-tuple linguistic representation model, and dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute evaluation method to propose a new method for risk assessment. QFD is innovatively used to create an overall framework, which includes the basic importance rating of risk factors, the correlation between risk factors and network failures, the importance rating of network failures, and the comprehensive importance rating of risk factors. The comprehensive importance rating is regarded as an indicator to verify, improve, and modify the basic importance rating, which can make up for the disadvantage of the existing risk assessment methods in proving the credibility of the results. Its result is the key to judging the degree of influence of risk factors on network operation. This paper takes the multimodal transport network in the Sichuan–Tibet region of China as an example for analysis. The results are analyzed and discussed to prove the validity and advancement of the proposed method.},

Our goal is to provide methodology for justifiable selection of the most suitable aggregator for various information fusion problems. When aggregating arguments from [0, 1], such arguments are regularly interpreted as degrees of truth or degrees of fuzzy membership. In such cases we deal with logic aggregators that must have appropriate logic properties. Our analysis identifies 10 necessary properties that are critical for decision support applications and must be satisfied by logic aggregators.

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in the static environment with standard reward functions. For intelligent tightening tasks, it is a challenge to transform expert knowledge into a recognizable mathematical expression for RL agents. Changing assembly standards make the model repeat learning updated knowledge with a high time-cost. In addition, as the difficulty and low accuracy of designing reward functions, the RL model itself also limits its application in the complex and dynamic engineering environment. To solve the above problems, a deep transfer-learning-based dynamic reinforcement learning (DRL-DTL) is presented and applied in the intelligent tightening system. Specifically, a deep convolution transfer-learning model (DCTL) is presented to build a mathematical mapping between agents of the model and subjective knowledge, which endows agents to learn from human knowledge efficiently. Then, a dynamic expert library is established to improve the adaptability of algorithm to the changing environment. And an inverse RL based on prior knowledge is presented to acquire reward functions. Experiments are conducted on a tightening assembly system and the results show that the tightening robot with the proposed model can inspect quality problems during the tightening process autonomously and make an adjustment decision based on the optimal policy that the agent calculates.},

First, eight key features of infertility are screened out by feature selection. Second, the entropy-based feature discretization method was used to divide the feature abnormal intervals, and the random forest was used to determine the weight of each feature. Finally, the pregnancy outcome can be predicted according to the overall risk score of patients, which is helpful for doctors to choose targeted treatment more efficiently. It is worth noting that, to further improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, we also divided the patients into age groups and constructed the corresponding risk scoring system for patients of different age groups. The stability test results show the good performance of the system.

To start with, a novel denoising method based on the dynamic threshold is proposed to identify the desirable impulse noise from the background noise. Then, in the frequency domain, we focus on the power distribution of impulsive noise at different frequency bands. Results exhibit a shadow effect with regard to different frequency bands and we characterize it by using a linear function with a Gaussian distribution. Besides, analyses on the power spectrum correlation for different polarization modes and scenarios are also provided. In the time domain, we performed a series of statistical analyses from aspects of pulse amplitude, duration, and elapse interval to characterize the impulsive noise. Furthermore, three empirical distributions are employed to depict the parameters&#39; variation tendency, that is, Cauchy distribution for amplitude, Gamma distribution for pulse duration, and exponential distribution for pulse interval. Finally, a first-order two-states Markov method is proposed to model the industrial noise. Simulation results are proved to be consistent with the actual measured results in terms of the amplitude distribution.},

The objective of the TSP is to find the shortest Hamilton route between cities to visit all existing cities and returning to the original city, from which the route started. Various researches have been carried out on TSP, and manifold solutions have been proposed to find the shortest route between cities, but none has been able to solve this problem completely. In this paper, a novel discrete version of the Farmland Fertility Algorithm is proposed, which uses three neighborhood searching mechanisms, and one Crossover operator. The Metropolis Acceptance Criterion has also been utilized to evade the local optimal traps. Furthermore, the Roulette Wheel selection technique is used to select neighboring mechanisms during the optimization process. Moreover, a local search mechanism is used to maximize the performance of the proposed algorithm. To prove the effectiveness of the contributions, and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the TSP library is evaluated on 37 data sets and compared with some well-known similar methods. The simulation results showed the superiority of the proposed algorithm against other comparative methods.},

With the further study of FCM, various different kinds of FCM algorithms are put forward to deal with the specific problems in image segmentation. Because there exist uncertainties in different regions of the image and similarity in the same region, reducing the uncertainty is still the main problem in image segmentation. Considering that Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is a powerful tool to deal with uncertainty, in this paper, we use PFS to describe the uncertainty of image segmentation, including introducing fuzzification and defuzzification process and Pythagorean fuzzy element to describe the membership degree of pixel, combine the neighborhood information with weights and Pythagorean fuzzy distance, and propose Pythagorean fuzzy C-means (PFCM) algorithm. Finally, we apply PFCM algorithm in image segmentation, such as different size images and Berkeley Segmentation Data Set to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, we do comparison analysis between PFCM, fully convolution network and Deep-image-Prior networks, these results show that our proposed PFCM has good intuition and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {vMixing coins strategy can realize the anonymity of user information, thereby protecting the user&#39;s privacy. Ideally, the blacklist is public information and all bad coins are recorded in it. However, due to the failure of some bad coins to be registered in the blacklist in time, users can only obtain part of the blacklist information, which allows illegal criminals to take advantage of it. How to prevent illegal activities under the partial information blacklist and how to design coins&#39; quality updating rule rationally have become open issues in mixing coins. The updating rule of coins&#39; quality in mixing is addressed since illegal criminals may carry out illegal activities, for example, money laundering. ImpSuic, an improved suicide strategy, is proposed as a new quality updating rule. The intuition is: all coins of the one who has the highest bad coins according to the blacklist, are recorded as bad coins. On the other hand, the coins&#39; quality of others remain unchanged. Besides, linear programming is introduced into ImpSuic strategy to predict the maximum utility after mixing coins, which facilitates users to make reasonable decisions before mixing coins. Simulation results show that the quality updating rule in ImpSuic strategy can preserve users&#39; privacy and antimoney launder.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy observer (NFO) is proposed for estimating the unmeasured states of an information-poor system by relaxing the strictly positive real condition (without using filtered fuzzy basis function (FBF) and filtered output estimation error) and without using high-gain terms. To recover the performance of the observer in the absence of high-gain terms, a concept of weighted fuzzy rules (or strengthened FBF) is proposed. The weighted fuzzy rules are then used to propose the concept of weighted function approximation which is then utilized in the design of NFO to estimate the unknown dynamical function. For reducing computational power and avoiding over-tuning of the weights, a concept of relay-switching is also introduced in the design of the NFO. The stability analysis of the proposed NFO is also presented using Lyapunov approach and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through a simulation example.},

Parameters such as toughness, isolated toughness, and binding number characterize the vulnerable of the network from the structure of networks. The path factor, a special case of the generalized -factor, measures the feasibility of data transmission in networks. Recent advances have been obtained to show that there is an inevitable connection between the vulnerability parameters of the network and the existence of path factors, while we found that some existing theoretical results are not tight and there is still a long way for further improvement. In view of graph theory approaches, this paper mainly contributes to determine the sharp bounds of toughness, isolated toughness, and binding number for the existence of path factor in different settings, and therefore solve the open problems left unsolved in previous articles.},

  abstract     = {When solving many regression problems, there exist a large number of input features. However, not all features are relevant for current regression, and sometimes, including irrelevant features may deteriorate the learning performance. Therefore, it is essential to select the most relevant features, especially for high-dimensional regression. Feature selection is an effective way to solve this problem. It tries to represent original data by extracting relevant features that contain useful information. In this paper, aiming to effectively select useful features in least squares support vector regression (LSSVR), we propose a novel sparse LSSVR based on -norm (SLSSVR), . Different from the existing -norm LSSVR (-LSSVR) and -norm LSSVR (-LSSVR), SLSSVR uses a smooth approximation of the nonsmooth nonconvex -norm term along with an effective solving algorithm. The proposed algorithm avoids the singularity issue that may encounter in -LSSVR, and its convergency is also guaranteed. Experimental results support the effectiveness of SLSSVR on both feature selection ability and regression performance.},

To address the above problems, a hybrid augmented loss discriminator is designed. In this designed discriminator, to reduce the sensitivity of the discriminator classification recognition, make it pay attention to the semantic and structural changes, we add the loss value of the fake sample to the loss value of the real sample. Moreover, to indirectly guide the generator to generate samples, the loss value of the real sample is added to the fake sample. The loss value mixed with real and fake samples actually augments signal transmission. It perturbs parameter update of the discriminator during optimization and prevents the discriminator from falling into the local suboptimal state prematurely. Whereafter, we apply the proposed discriminator to two kinds of text-to-image synthesis tasks.

In this study, a reinforcement learning-based method (and in particular dyna-Q+) is presented for a team of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to cooperatively learn an unknown dynamic field (and in particular, an agricultural field). The problem we address here is to deploy UGVs to map plant rows, find obstacles, whose locations are not known a priori, and define regions of interest in the field (e.g., areas with high water stress). Once an environment model is built, the UGVs are then distributed to provide full coverage of plants and update the reconstructed map simultaneously. Simulation results are finally presented to demonstrate that the proposed method for simultaneous learning and planning can successfully learn a model of the field and monitor the coverage area.},

This paper proposes a host security analysis method based on Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. It adopts three models of support vector regression, logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbor regression, as sensors for multisource information fusion. Multiple sensors perform security analysis on the host, respectively, and use the analysis results as evidence of D-S evidence theory. Experiments show that the proposed method provides effective security protection for the host in terms of absolute error, root mean square error, and the average absolute percentage error.},

First, experts give their evaluation in IVIFS, and then the weighting evaluation matrix is computed based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator with the subjective attribute weights given in advance. Second, a simple and useful weighting approach on the basis of correlation coefficient is put forward to obtain the experts weights. Third, we treat the attribute weights as a varying vector, and then propose a variable weighting approach for its acquisition. Fourth, an individual decision can be converted to an alternative decision by considering the experts and attributes weights together. At last, the integrated assessment value of each alternative is computed by TOPSIS, and then the most appropriate alternative is chosen. Two illustrative examples dealt with the problem by the method presented in this article demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, compared with those by the other methods.},

The new operator facilitates to capture the distribution characteristics of the opinion data with respect to the consensus and constructs a nonlinear aggregation of individual opinions. Further, we extend the new operator to the situation where the experts&#39; opinions are represented by probability density functions (PDFs).

Applying blockchain to covert communication can improve the channel&#39;s anti-interference and antitampering. Whisper is the communication protocol of Ethereum, which mainly relies on payload to store information and padding to expand. These two fields can store a large amount of information, creating conditions for the realization of covert communication. In this paper, we propose a covert communication method based on the whisper protocol to covertly transfer information in the blockchain. To implement this method, we use payload to store the carrier information, matching it with the secret message. The generated index is recorded in the padding field. To improve the concealment of communication, we simulate the default filling rules of the protocol to maintain the message size. A new pair interaction method is also proposed to improve the security of the model. Moreover, the anti-interference, antitampering and antidetection of the newly proposed model are verified through theoretical analysis and experiment. The experimental findings show that the amount of information in the proposed method is 4.7 times that of the traditional time-based covert communication. The time consumption of information transmission is reduced to 52.25\% under the same settings and even less in actual use. The cost of the new pair interaction is reduced by nearly 50\% compared with the original method.},

Various types of electricity market pricing strategies are available in the literature with which the grid buys and sells power to the MG system. These strategies are implemented in turns on two different low voltage (LV) MG systems, and the generation cost of the systems are recorded to distinguish the cheapest strategy among them. A novel hybrid of recently developed superior optimization algorithms viz. grey wolf optimizer (GWO), sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and crow search algorithm (CSA) is used to minimize the overall generation cost of the MG system. It was evident from the results that generation cost was minimum when electricity market pricing was done using Strategy 2. Also, active participation of the grid incurred 15\% savings in the system generation cost for the same strategy compared to the case when the grid was operating passively. Furthermore, statistical analysis corroborates to the superiority of the proposed hybrid MGWO-SCA-CSA over other algorithms used.},

We build up another model of optimization for the uncommon circumstance where the attribute weight information is totally unknown. By solving this model, we get a basic and definite equation which can be utilized to be determined attribute weight. The grey relation degree between each alternative and positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) are determined. At the same time, a degree of relative relational is defined to decide all alternative order of ranking by ascertaining the grey relation degree to both the PIS and NIS. To examine the produced approach and to show its effectiveness and applicability an illustrative examples are given.

  abstract     = {Double hierarchy linguistic term set (DHLTS) is a powerful tool when expressing the real thoughts of experts and handling complex linguistic information considering that it divides complex linguistic information into two simple linguistic hierarchies in which the first hierarchy linguistic term set (LTS) is the main linguistic hierarchy and the second hierarchy LTS is the linguistic feature or detailed supplementary of each linguistic term in the first hierarchy LTS. Some extensions of DHLTS have been developed, such as the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy LTS, the unbalanced DHLTS, the linguistic preference ordering, the double hierarchy linguistic preference relation, and the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation. In recent years, DHLTS and its extensions have been researched by scholars in lots of fields, including the extended concepts, the operational laws, the comparative methods, the measure methods, the consistency and consensus methods, the decision-making methods, the applications, and so forth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review all the researches of DHLTS and its extensions, as well as proposing some challenges in the future.},

  abstract     = {This study evaluated the benchmarking process of active queue management (AQM) methods, which consider a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem using multidimensional criteria. Academic studies have benchmarked the AQM methods using MCDM techniques. However, these studies have used existing MCDM techniques, which face considerable theoretical challenges. The latest MCDM method called fuzzy decision by opinion score (FDOSM) was published in the in 2020 to address the theoretical challenges of the existing MCDM methods. However, FDOSM continues to encounter serious issues. That is, it exclusively depends on the direct aggregation MCDM approach based on arithmetic mean (AM) operator. However, performing other operators (i.e., geometric mean, harmonic mean, and root mean square), in addition to applying other MCDM approaches (i.e., distance measurement and compromise rank), may result in different ranking results. Hence, this study mainly proposes an extension of FDOSM through the following aspects: (1) application of different aggregation techniques in the direct aggregation MCDM approach, (2) discussion of the effectiveness of each type on the final AQM benchmarking, and (3) use of varying MCDM approaches on FDOSM to reach the optimum result when benchmarking the AQM methods. The current research methodology is based on two sequential phases. The first phase provides the decision matrix used in benchmarking the AQM methods. The decision matrix was constructed based on the AQM evaluation criteria and a list of AQM methods. The second phase presents two stages, namely, data transformation unit and data processing. Findings of the AQM benchmarking are as follows. (1) In the individual FDOSM, two main configurations are recommended when using the AQM benchmarking: direct aggregation MCDM approach with AM operator and compromise rank approach. Benchmarking results of both configurations based on six decision makers are nearly similar, with the AQM BLUE method being ranked the best. The exception is for the results of the compromise rank approach based on the third decision maker, which revealed that the AQM ERED method is the best. (2) Results of the group FDOSM showed a relatively similar order for the AQM methods in both configurations, with the AQM BLUE method being the best. (3) Lastly, significant differences were found among the groups&#39; scores, thereby indicating the validity of the FDOSM-based AQM benchmarking results.},

Although the recommender systems based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) are competent, the user trust information is seldom taken into consideration to improve the recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Trust-Aware GAN with recurrent neural network (RNN) for RECommender systems named , which makes use of the user trust information for top-N recommendation. In the framework, the discriminative model is a multilayer perceptron to distinguish whether a sample is from the real data or fake data generated by the generative model. The discriminator helps to guide the training of the generative model to make it fit the data distribution of the user trust information. The generative model is a RNN with long short-term memory cells, aiming to confuse the discriminative model by generating samples as similar as possible to the real data. Through the adversarial training between the discriminative and generative models, the user trust information can be fully used to improve the recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real-word data sets to validate the effectiveness of the TagRec by comparing it with the benchmarks.},

Many studies learn the affinity matrix from the original high-dimensional data, whose noise goes against the clustering results. Besides, some methods based on self-representation subspace clustering have a high time complexity. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective, and efficient method named Kernel-based Low-rank Tensorized Multiview Spectral Clustering (KLTMSC) to address these issues. Instead of using the original data to get the affinity matrix, KLTMSC learns the affinity matrix from kernel representation of the high-dimensional data to reduce the noisy information. Furthermore, to be robust to noise, the low-rank tensor is learned in the process of exploring the high-order correlations between data. Experiments on real-world data sets show that our method not only yields better results but also is quite time-saving compared with other state-of-the-art models.},

As for uncertainty, the probability distribution is a desirable method to model uncertainty. In this context, a novel dynamic weight allocation method is first proposed, which considers three situations: nonconflict, general conflict, and high conflict. In particular, according to the degree of conflict, different weight allocations are considered by means of generalized information quality and negation operation. After that, a novel dynamic weight allocation method is proposed that contains three subalgorithms: NonC algorithm, BNC algorithm, and BIC algorithm. In addition, a novel multisource information fusion method is presented based on the newly designed dynamic weight allocation method. Besides, some numerical examples illustrate its feasibility. Finally, an application in target recognition demonstrates the practicability of the proposed fusion method.},

  abstract     = {Vine pruning in vineyards is an important canopy management activity. It requires skill and experience to perform well and poor pruning results in low yield and can have a long-term effect on the productivity of the vine. Automated systems usually rely on simplified pruning rules that need to be specified before operation and largely prune all vines in the same way. This is not a realistic approach and limits the pruning quality. We propose a step toward an automated system that can learn pruning behavior from expert examples without the need for explicit pruning rules. By using a novel neural network architecture we train a classifier that can choose which canes should be pruned and which should be kept. We show that the classifier can learn simple pruning rules without prior knowledge and show how this can be used as part of an automated system. The system is robust to vines that are more complex and diverse than those it was trained on and shows potential for future models to be pretrained using synthetic data and fine tuned on a minimal set of expertly pruned vines.},

  abstract     = {As machine learning (ML) technologies evolve, various online intelligent services use ML models to provide predictions. Unfortunately, attackers can obtain the private information of the model by interacting with the online service, namely model inversion attack (MIA). However, MIA requires large data sets to be transferred to an online service to obtain the predictive value of the inference model. Besides, the huge transmission may cause the administrator&#39;s active defense. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel MIA scheme, which leverages latent information extracted by an auxiliary neural network as high-dimensional features to simplify what inversion model should learn. The core idea of our scheme is to reuse some parameters of the local pretraining model. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our method in convolutional neural networks on LFW, pubFig, MNIST data sets. Experimental results show that even with a few queries, our inversion method still work accurately and is superior to other technologies. It is worth mentioning that our method makes it more difficult for administrators to defend against the attack and elicit more investigations for privacy-preserving.},

The concept of explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal system mechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems that support human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. In this study, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energy efficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasive recommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. The persuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) or on a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason for recommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using a Telegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data and human feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\% on the recommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasive facts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems, demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energy saving behavior.},

  abstract     = {Identification of drug–target interactions (DTIs) is critical for discovering potential target protein candidates for new drugs. However, traditional experimental methods have limitations in discovering DTIs. They are time-consuming, tedious, and expensive, and often suffer from high false-positive rates and false-negative rates. Therefore, using computational methods to predict DTIs has received extensive attention from many researchers in recent years. To address this issue, in this paper, an effective prediction model is presented which is based on the information of drug molecular structure data and protein sequence data. It performs prediction with the following procedures. First, we transform the sequences of each target into a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), such that the features can retain biological evolutionary information. We then use a feature vector of molecular substructure fingerprints to describe the chemical structure information of the drug compounds. Second, the Legendre moments algorithm is used to extract new features from the PSSM. Finally, a classification algorithm called rotation forest is used to perform prediction, we tested its prediction performance on four golden standard data sets: enzymes, G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, and nuclear receptors. As a result, the proposed method achieves average accuracies of 0.9026, 0.8260, 0.8703, and 0.7444 on these four data sets using five-fold cross-validation. We also compare the proposed method with the support vector machine and other existing approaches. The proposed model is proved to be superior to comparative methods, showing that it is feasible, effective, and robust for predicting potential DTI.},

  abstract     = {In intuitionistic fuzzy set and their generalizations such as Pythagorean fuzzy sets and q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, ranking is not easy to define. There are several techniques available in literature for ranking values in above mentioned orthopair fuzzy sets. It is interesting to see that almost all the proposed ranking methods produce distinct ranking. Notion of knowledge base is very important to study ranking proposed by different techniques. Aim of this paper is to critically analyze the available ranking techniques for q-rung orthopair fuzzy values and propose a new graphical ranking method based on hesitancy index and entropy. Several numerical examples are tested with the proposed technique, which shows that the technique is intuitive and convenient for real life applications.},

  abstract     = {As a generalization of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, a consciousness of interval-valued -rung orthopair fuzzy sets (IV-ROFSs) is a robust and trustworthy tool to fulfill the imprecise information with an adaptation of the manageable parameter . However, the ranking of any interval-valued numbers is very valuable for interval-valued decision-making problems. Possibility degree measure is a worthy tool to manage the degree of possibility of one object over the other. Driven by these requisite characteristics, it is fascinating to manifest the possibility degree of comparison between two IV-ROFSs, and an innovative method is then encouraged to rank the given numbers. Few properties are checked to explain their features and exhibited the advantages of it over the existing possibility measures with some counterintuitive examples. Later on, we consider the multiattribute group decision making (MAGDM) method and embellish it with numerical examples, to rank the alternatives. Several numerical examples are implemented to test the superiority of the stated MAGDM method and to confer its more manageable and adaptable nature.},

This allows detecting human mobility patterns in urban areas with more detail than ever before. In this context, based on the fusion of mobility data from different and heterogeneous sources, such as public transport, transport-network connectivity and Online Social Networks, this study puts forward a novel approach to uncover the actual land use of a city. Unlike previous solutions, our work avoids a approach and it considers the temporal factor based on the assumption that urban areas are not used by citizens all the time in the same manner.

The decision maker (DM) controls several cost components by playing as Player 1 on the one side and the consumers who may accept/reject those items (unwilling to buy those commodities) stands as Player 2 on the other side. First of all, we develop a profit maximization backlogging EOQ model where the imperfect items are screened out batchwise. Because of the fuzzy flexibility of the model parameters we also develop a fuzzy mathematical model by considering the demand, all cost parameters, and other input parameters of the inventory system as triangular lock fuzzy numbers. Then we develop a 3 × 3 matrix game by applying a five-stage leadership theory employing several key vectors in the model itself. The problem has been solved for crisp, general fuzzy models of several leadership styles also. Numerical results show that for a cooperative game, inventory profit function reaches its maximum rather than the noncooperative game by the use of proper keys. Finally, comparative study, sensitivity analysis, and graphical illustrations are made to justify the new approach.},

In this note, a TCNN model by incorporating an initial rectified term is applied to solve the online calculation problems and the convergent time can be controlled in advance. Theoretical analyses on stability, prespecified time and convergence are rigorously clarified.

However, most CNNs are designed by the rule-of-thumb and suffer from much more computational complexity. Aiming at enhancing the channels of one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) for extracting efficient structural information oftargets form HRRP and reducing the computation complexity, we propose a novel framework for HRRP-based target recognition based on 1D-CNN with channel attention and channel pruning. By introducing an aggregation-perception-recalibration (APR) block for channel attention to the 1D-CNN backbone, channels in each 1D convolutional layer can adaptively learn to recalibrate the extracted features for enhancing the structural information captured from HRRP. To avoid rule-of-thumb design and reduce the computation complexity of 1D-CNN, we proposed a new method incorporated withthe global best leading artificial bee colony (GBL-ABC) to prune the original network based on the lottery ticket hypothesis in an automatic and heuristic manner. The extensive experimental results on the measured data illustrate that the proposed algorithm achievesthe superiorrecognition rate by combing APR and GBL-ABC simultaneously.},

The article considers the universal ontology of knowledge about the diagnosis of processes in various domains as a generalization and the result of many years of experience of the authors in the creation of intelligent systems for the diagnosis of processes. The ontology allows us to formalize anomalies as developing internal processes that are not inherent in a normally functioning system.

  abstract     = {Currently, the furious competitiveness in global markets and speedy improvements in information technology lead to shorter product life cycles, lesser transportation capabilities, and increased demands as well. In most business scenarios, the supply chain network is becoming one of the most vital focusing areas. In the supply chain network, blockchain technology is a promising solution for secure information sharing. However, it is a bit critical in maintaining security at each level of the blockchain and hence the public–private–key cryptography is more commonly preferred. This study intends to construct a new privacy preservation model in the field of supply chain networks based on blockchain technology by undergoing three major phases, namely, (a) data sanitization, (b) key generation, and (c) restoration. Further, the sensitive fields in the original data are selected during the data sanitization phase, and in the key generation phase; the optimal key is generated to hide the selected sensitive fields. The hidden data with the secured key is transferred from the source (manufacturer) to destination (vendor) in the supply chain network via the blockchain. The restoration process takes place in the receiver side with the help of the same key. Among all these data flow methods, the optimal key selection is the critical issue that needs to be overridden to make the data transmission secured. As a novelty, a new optimization algorithm referred to as Whale with New Crosspoint-based Update (WNU), which is the advanced version of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), is developed here to select the optimal key. Finally, the proposed WNU model is analyzed in terms of Hiding Failure (HF) rate, Information Preservation (IP) Rate, and False Rule generation (FR), and Degree of Modification (DM). The proposed secured information sharing in supply chain management (SCM) with blockchain technology will be validated by comparing it over the traditional models in terms of security as well.},

  abstract     = {In multiattribute decision making, the analytic network process (ANP) is an important methodology to derive the subjective weights of attributes when the dependence and feedback relations exist between attributes, and the number of attributes should be no more than seven in a comparison matrix. To reduce the dimensions of attributes, we propose a hybrid hesitant fuzzy linguistic factor analysis method to cluster the attributes into main factors. The method takes multiple forms of decision-making information into consideration, such as single linguistic terms, hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms, and numeric values. Meanwhile, the objective weights of the main factors are obtained as well. As for the subjective weights of main factors, the incomplete probabilistic linguistic ANP is developed after improving the incomplete probabilistic linguistic preference relation with multiplicative consistency. At last, the final weights of the main factors are calculated by combining the objective and subjective weights. A questionnaire survey about assessing the weights of the main factors influencing graduate students&#39; physical health is designed to explain the application of the proposed methodology. To sum up, the main importance and contributions of this study are as following: (1) developing a hybrid hesitant fuzzy linguistic factor analysis method and incomplete probabilistic linguistic ANP, (2) proposing a novel weight-derived method from both objective and subjective perspectives, and (3) applying it to graduate students&#39; physical health assessment.},

Autoencoder is the type of neural network that has been widely applied in these one-class problems. In the Big Data era, new challenges have arisen, mainly related with the data volume. Another main concern derives from Privacy issues when data is distributed and cannot be shared among locations. These two conditions make many of the classic and brilliant methods not applicable. In this paper, we present distributed singular value decomposition (DSVD-autoencoder), a method for autoencoders that allows learning in distributed scenarios without sharing raw data. Additionally, to guarantee privacy, it is noniterative and hyperparameter-free, two interesting characteristics when dealing with Big Data. In comparison with the state of the art, results demonstrate that DSVD-autoencoder provides a highly competitive solution to deal with very large data sets by reducing training from several hours to seconds while maintaining good accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition has become an important component of human–computer interaction systems. Research on emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are mostly conducted by the analysis of all channels&#39; EEG signals. Although some progresses are achieved, there are still several challenges such as high dimensions, correlation between different features and feature redundancy in the realistic experimental process. These challenges have hindered the applications of emotion recognition to portable human–computer interaction systems (or devices). This paper explores how to find out the most effective EEG features and channels for emotion recognition so as to only collect data as less as possible. First, discriminative features of EEG signals from different dimensionalities are extracted for emotion classification, including the first difference, multiscale permutation entropy, Higuchi fractal dimension, and discrete wavelet transform. Second, relief algorithm and floating generalized sequential backward selection algorithm are integrated as a novel channel selection method. Then, support vector machine is employed to classify the emotions for verifying the performance of the channel selection method and extracted features. At last, experimental results demonstrate that the optimal channel set, which are mostly located at the frontal, has extremely high similarity on the self-collected data set and the public data set and the average classification accuracy is achieved up to 91.31\% with the selected 10-channel EEG signals. The findings are valuable for the practical EEG-based emotion recognition systems.},

  abstract     = {Top-Rank- Frequent Itemset (or Pattern) Mining (FPM) is an important data mining task, where user decides on the number of top frequency ranks of patterns (itemsets) they want to mine from a transactional dataset. This problem does not require the minimum support threshold parameter that is typically used in FPM problems. Rather, the algorithms solving the Top-Rank- FPM problem are fed with , the number of frequency ranks of itemsets required, to compute the threshold internally. This paper presents two declarative approaches to tackle the Top-Rank- Closed FPM problem. The first approach is Boolean Satisfiability-based (SAT-based) where we propose an effective encoding for the problem along with an efficient algorithm employing this encoding. The second approach is CP-based, that is, utilizes Constraint Programming technique, where a simple CP model is exploited in an innovative manner to mine the Top-Rank- Closed FPM itemsets from transactional datasets. Both approaches are evaluated experimentally against other declarative and imperative algorithms. The proposed SAT-based approach significantly outperforms , another SAT-based approach, and outperforms the proposed CP-approach for sparse and moderate datasets, whereas the latter excels on dense datasets. An extensive study has been conducted to assess the proposed approaches in terms of their feasibility, performance factors, and practicality of use.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread application of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology in the industry, the security threats are also increasing. To ensure the safe sharing of resources in IIoT, this paper proposes a data security sharing model based on privacy protection (DSS-PP) for blockchain-enabled IIoT. Compared with previous works, DSS-PP has obvious advantages in several important aspects: (1) In the process of identity authentication, it protects users&#39; personal information by using authentication technology with hidden attributes; (2) the encrypted shared resources are stored in off-chain database of the blockchain, while only the ciphertext index information is stored in the block. It reduces the storage load of the blockchain; (3) it uses blockchain logging technology to trace and account for illegal access. Under the hardness assumption of Inverse Computational Diffe–Hellman (ICDH) problem, this model is proven to be correct and safe. Through the analysis of performance, DSS-PP has better performance than the referred works.},

  abstract     = {Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) is the de facto technique for extracting device-level power consumption fingerprints at (almost) no cost from only aggregated mains readings. Specifically, there is no need to install an individual meter for each appliance. However, a robust NILM system should incorporate a precise appliance identification module that can effectively discriminate between various devices. In this context, this paper proposes a powerful method to extract accurate power fingerprints for electrical appliance identification. Rather than relying solely on time-domain (TD) analysis, this framework abstracts the phase encoding of the TD description of power signals using a two-dimensional (2D) representation. This allows mapping power trajectories to a novel 2D binary representation space, and then performing a histogramming process after converting binary codes to new decimal representations. This yields the final histogram of 2D phase encoding of power signals, namely, 2D-PEP. An empirical performance evaluation conducted with three realistic power consumption databases collected at distinct resolutions indicates that the proposed 2D-PEP descriptor achieves outperformance for appliance identification in comparison with other recent techniques. Accordingly, high identification accuracies are attained on the GREEND, UK-DALE, and WHITED data sets, where 99.54\%, 98.78\%, and 100\% rates have been achieved, respectively, using the proposed 2D-PEP descriptor.},

  abstract     = {The application of cross-corpus for speech emotion recognition (SER) via domain adaptation methods have gain high acknowledgment for developing good robust emotion recognition systems using different corpora or datasets. However, the issue of cross-lingual still remains a challenge in SER and needs more attention to resolve the scenario of applying different language types in both training and testing. In this paper, we propose a triple attentive asymmetric convolutional neural network to address the recognition of emotions for cross-lingual and cross-corpus speech in an unsupervised approach. The proposed method adopts the joint supervision of softmax loss and center loss to learn high power discriminative feature representations for target domain via the use of high quality pseudo-labels. The proposed model uses three attentive convolutional neural networks asymmetrically, where two of the networks are used to artificially label unlabeled target samples as a result of their predictions from training on source labeled samples and the other network is used to obtain salient target discriminative features from the pseudo-labeled target samples. We evaluate our proposed method on three different language types (i.e., English, German, and Italian) data sets. The experimental results indicate that, our proposed method achieves higher prediction accuracy over other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {There has been increasing interest in using Stackelberg game (known as a security game) to allocate limited security resources against different attacker types with a specific probability distribution. However, real problems of this kind often face ambiguous information, such as imprecise, unreliable and absent payoffs, and ambiguous assignments of these payoffs. To this end, based on decision theory and the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, this paper proposes a novel framework that can handle these common types of ambiguity. More specifically, this paper deploys the underlying principles of existing rules from decision theory, as a way to characterise different attitudes to ambiguity, during the transformation of ambiguous payoffs into point-valued payoffs. Hence, our framework holds some good properties: (i) it subsumes traditional security games without ambiguous payoffs, (ii) a uniform margin of error will not affect the results and (iii) the influence of complete ignorance can be minimised. Also, our framework is evaluated by using nine different transformation rules, under various conditions and constraints, against 73,000 randomly generated games (a first comprehensive empirical evaluation to date). The evaluation reveals the benefits of each transformation rule and confirms that different rules can model individuals&#39; different attitudes to ambiguity.},
