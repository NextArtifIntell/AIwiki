  abstract     = {In recent years, there is growing interest in using quantum computers for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we developed a generic, machine learning-based framework for mapping continuous-space inverse design problems into surrogate quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems by employing a binary variational autoencoder and a factorization machine. The factorization machine is trained as a low-dimensional, binary surrogate model for the continuous design space and sampled using various QUBO samplers. Using the D-Wave Advantage hybrid sampler and simulated annealing, we demonstrate that by repeated resampling and retraining of the factorization machine, our framework finds designs that exhibit figures of merit exceeding those of its training set. We showcase the framework&#39;s performance on two inverse design problems by optimizing (i) thermal emitter topologies for thermophotovoltaic applications and (ii) diffractive meta-gratings for highly efficient beam steering. This technique can be further scaled to leverage future developments in quantum optimization to solve advanced inverse design problems for science and engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Countless research contributions reflect two major concepts for modeling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) ordinary differential equations for population compartments, such as infected or deceased persons (these approaches often exhibit limited predictive capabilities); and (ii) rules applied to digitally realized agents in the populations (these approaches often lack reliable input data and may become computationally overly expensive). As a remedy, we here introduce and discuss convolutional integrodifferential equations adapted from Boltzmann&#39;s hereditary mechanics, so as to predict COVID-19 fatality trends from the evolutions of newly infected persons. Replacing the classical statistical reasoning by deliberations arising from the notion of “virus loads” and the corresponding compliance of the infected population to these loads, model errors with respect to data recorded in 102 countries, territories, or US states can be drastically reduced, namely, up to 98\% when compared to the traditional kinetics equation of Kermack and McKendrick. The coefficients of determination between model predictions and recorded data range from 94\% to 100\%, a precision hitherto unachieved in equation-based epidemic modeling.},

Although soft manipulators showing 2D in-plane deformations have been extensively studied and applied in many areas, the design method of soft manipulators with a mathematical model that can follow a particular 3D spatial trajectory remains elusive. In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically design bio-inspired multi-segment pneu-net soft manipulators that can match complex 3D trajectories upon single pressurization. The 3D motions can be characterized by a combination of twisting, bending, and helical deformations, which are enabled by the design of the soft segments with programmable chamber orientations. To inverse design the soft manipulators with trajectory matching, we develop an analytical framework that takes into account the material nonlinearity, geometric anisotropy, and varying loading directions. The spatial trajectory can be reconstructed by combining with a 3D rod theory. In this sense, multi-segment soft manipulators with trajectory matching are inversely designed by varying the geometric and material parameters. We further demonstrate the grasping of complex objects using the designed soft manipulators. The proposed methodology has immense potential to design soft manipulators in 3D space and broaden their application.},

Here, inspired by whipped cream production widely used in pastries, hydrogel-based foam bioinks are developed for bioprinting of scaffolds. Upon cross-linking, a multiscale and interconnected porous structure, with pores ranging from few to several hundreds of micrometers, is formed within the printed constructs. The effect of the process parameters on the pore size distribution and mechanical and rheological properties of the bioinks is determined. The developed foam bioinks can be easily printed using both conventional and custom-built handheld bioprinters. In addition, the foam inks are adhesive upon in situ cross-linking and are biocompatible. The subcutaneous implantation of scaffolds formed from the engineered foam bioinks showed their rapid integration and vascularization in comparison with their non-porous hydrogel counterparts. In addition, in vivo application of the foam bioink into the non-healing muscle defect of a murine model of volumetric muscle loss resulted in a significant functional recovery and higher muscle forces at 8 weeks post injury compared with non-treated controls.},

Here, we leverage these methods to investigate the complex multidimensional problem of polycrystalline 2D material fracture. We focus first on graphene and in doing so, demonstrate a practical workflow for exploring the structural dependencies of fracture energy. Despite training our ML model on exclusively single crystal fracture in increments of 10° orientations, we can identify a crack branching mechanism responsible for high bicrystal toughness centered at initial crystal orientation angles of 19° and 41°. These high peaks span only a few degrees in range and are completely overlooked by a search with stride 10°. Furthermore, we can discover qualitative physical phenomena such as collective fracture branch termination and extract quantitative trends relating angular dispersion and mis-orientation angles of crystal grains to fracture energy. None of these complex polycrystalline behaviors were presented in the training data, and the predictive power of the model ultimately allows us to expeditiously generate polycrystalline graphene structures with bespoke fracture paths, a task with great implications in industrial design applications and mechanism discovery. Furthermore, the approach is not limited to graphene specifically, as we demonstrate by retraining the model for another more complex 2D material—MoS 2 —and achieve polycrystalline fracture predictions of comparable accuracy.},

Through photonic spin–orbit interaction, light can transiently turn on topological interactions, such as chiral chemistry, or induce non-Abelian physics in matter. Employing electromagnetic simulations and ultrafast, time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy, we describe the geometric transformation of a normally incident plane wave circularly polarized light carrying a defined spin into surface plasmon polariton field carrying orbital angular momentum which converges into an array of plasmonic vortices with defined spin textures. Numerical simulations show how within each vortex domain, the photonic spin–orbit interaction molds the plasmonic orbital angular momentum into quantum chiral spin angular momentum textures resembling those of a magnetic meron quasiparticles. We experimentally examine the dynamics of such meron plasmonic spin texture lattice by recording the ultrafast nanofemto plasmonic field evolution with deep subwavelength resolution and sub-optical cycle time accuracy from which we extract the linear polarization, L-line singularity distribution, that defines the periodic lattice boundaries. Our results reveal how vectorial optical fields can impress their topologically nontrivial spin textures by coherent dressing or chiral excitations of matter.},

This study has successfully designed and constructed a novel pressurized gyration vessel to fabricate core–sheath polymer nanofibers. Several water-soluble and water-insoluble polymer combinations are investigated. Both polyethylene oxide and polyvinyl alcohol were used as the core while both poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(caprolactone) (PCL) were used as the sheath; PLA and PCL were used as core and sheath, in different instances; respectively. The fluid behavior of the core–sheath within the vessel was studied with and without applied pressure using computational fluid dynamics to simulate the core–sheath flow within the chamber. A high-speed camera was used to observe the behavior of jetted solutions at core–sheath openings, and the best scenario was achieved using 6000 rpm spinning speed with 0.2 MPa (twice atmospheric) applied pressure. The surface morphology of core–sheath fibers was studied using a scanning electron microscope, and focused ion beam milling assisted scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the cross-sectional features of the produced fibers. Laser confocal scanning microscopy was also used to verify the core–sheath structure of the fibers, which were further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Thus, using a variety of polymer combinations, we show, both theoretically and experimentally, how core–sheath fibers evolve in a vessel that can serve as a scalable manufacturing pressurized gyration production process.},

  abstract     = {Domain wall motion is in the core of many information technologies ranging from storage [Beach et al. , J. Magn. Magn. Mater. 320 , 1272–1281 (2008)], processing [Tatara et al. , Phys. Rep. 468 , 213–301 (2008)], and sensing [Ralph and Stiles, J. Magn. Magn. Mater. 320 , 1190–1216 (2008)] up to novel racetrack memory architectures [Parkin et al. , Science 320 , 190–194 (2008)]. The finding of magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials [Huang et al. , Nature 546 , 270 (2017); Gong et al. , Nature 546 , 265–269 (2017); Guguchia et al. , Sci. Adv. 4 , eaat3672 (2018); Klein et al. , Science 360 , 1218–1222 (2018)] has offered a new frontier for the exploration and understanding of domain walls at the limit of few atom-thick layers. However, to use 2D vdW magnets for building spintronics nanodevices such as domain-wall based logic [Allwood et al. , Science 309 , 1688–1692 (2005); Luo et al. , Nature 579 , 214–218 (2020); Xu et al. , Nat. Nanotechnol. 3 , 97–100 (2008)], it is required to gain control of their domain wall dynamics by external driving forces such as spin-polarized currents or magnetic fields, which have so far been elusive. Here, we show that electric currents as well as magnetic fields can efficiently move domain walls in the recently discovered 2D vdW magnets CrI 3 and CrBr 3 at low temperatures and robust down to monolayer. We realize field- and current-driven domain wall motion with velocities up to 1020 m s −1 , which are comparable to the state-of-the-art materials for domain-wall based applications [Yang et al. , Nat. Nanotechnol. 10 , 221–226 (2015); Woo et al. , Nat. Mater. 15 , 501–506 (2016); Vélez et al. , Nat. Commun. 10 , 4750 (2019); Siddiqui et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 , 057701 (2018); Ryu et al. , Nat. Nanotechnol. 8 , 527–533 (2013)]. Domain walls keep their coherence driven by the spin-transfer torque induced by the current and magnetic fields up to large values of about 12 × 10 9 A cm −2 and 5 T, respectively. For larger magnitudes of current or field, a transition to a hydrodynamic spin-liquid regime is observed with the emission of a periodic train of spin-wave solitons with modulational instability [Rabinovich and Trubetskov, Oscillations and Waves: In Linear and Nonlinear Systems, Mathematics and its Applications (Springer Netherlands, 2011)]. The emitted waveform achieves terahertz (THz) frequency in a wide range of fields and current densities, which opens up perspectives for reconfigurable magnonic devices. Moreover, we found that these spin-waves can transport spin angular momentum through the layers over distances as long as 10 μ m without losses for the transport of spin information. Our results push the boundary of what is currently known about the dynamics of domain walls in 2D vdW ferromagnets and unveil strategies to design ultrathin, high-speed, and high-frequency spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an appealing class of methods for performing unsupervised learning on streaming spectral data, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as in situ characterization of materials. These methods seek to decompose a dataset into a small number of components and weights that can compactly represent the underlying signal while effectively reconstructing the observations with minimal error. However, canonical NMF methods have no underlying requirement that the reconstruction uses components or weights that are representative of the true physical processes. In this work, we demonstrate how constraining a subset of the NMF weights or components as rigid priors, provided as known or assumed values, can provide significant improvement in revealing true underlying phenomena. We present a PyTorch-based method for efficiently applying constrained NMF and demonstrate its application to several synthetic examples. Our implementation allows an expert researcher-in-the-loop to provide and dynamically adjust the constraints during a live experiment involving streaming spectral data. Such interactive priors allow researchers to specify known or identified independent components, as well as functional expectations about the mixing or transitions between the components. We further demonstrate the application of this method to measured synchrotron x-ray total scattering data from in situ beamline experiments. In such a context, constrained NMF can result in a more interpretive and scientifically relevant decomposition than canonical NMF or other decomposition techniques. The details of the method are provided, along with general guidance for employing constrained NMF in the extraction of critical information and insights during time-sensitive experimental applications.},

  abstract     = {Infrared laser technology over the last decades has led to an increasing demand for optical detectors with high sensitivity and a wide operative spectral range suitable for spectroscopic applications. In this work, we report on the performance of a custom quartz tuning fork used as a sensitive and broadband infrared photodetector for absorption spectroscopy. The photodetection process is based on light impacting on the tuning fork and creating a local temperature increase that generates a strain field. This light-induced, thermoelastic conversion produces an electrical signal proportional to the absorbed light intensity due to quartz piezoelectricity. A finite-element-method analysis was used to relate the energy release with the induced thermal distribution. To efficiently exploit the photo-induced thermoelastic effects in the low-absorbance spectral region of quartz also, chromium/gold layers, acting as opaque surface, have been deposited on the quartz surface. To demonstrate the flat response as photodetectors, a custom tuning fork, having a fundamental resonance frequency of 9.78 kHz and quality factor of 11 500 at atmospheric pressure, was employed as photodetector in a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy setup and tested with five different lasers with emission wavelength in the 1.65–10.34 μ m range. A spectrally flat responsivity of ∼2.2 kV/W was demonstrated, corresponding to a noise-equivalent power of 1.5 nW/√Hz, without employing any thermoelectrical cooling systems. Finally, a heterodyne detection scheme was implemented in the tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy setup to retrieve the resonance properties of the quartz tuning fork together with the gas concentration in a single, fast measurement.},

  abstract     = {A two-step process for the synthesis of the silicon clathrate film on a diamond silicon wafer is explored in detail. Key factors impacting the film quality are uncovered. We find that the optical properties of the films are strongly influenced by inhomogeneities and defect phases that dominate the top surface and grain boundaries of the material. For the first time, we systematically develop two approaches for minimizing the effects of defective structures and allow intrinsic properties of the clathrate material to be probed. One is separating the film surface from the Si substrate to expose the buried high-quality interface, and the other one is wet or dry etching of the clathrate film to remove the disordered material which is more heavily concentrated at the top surface. With high-quality clathrate surfaces and films produced, more reliable optical measurements are taken and interpreted. Techniques in this work provide a pathway for Si clathrate thin film toward an optically efficient alternative crystalline form of Si that can transform Si-based applications in optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the formation of core-shell nanomaterials is decisive for controlling their growth, structure, and morphology, which is particularly important in catalysis. As a promising material for photo catalysis application, Pd-Pt core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) have been in the spotlight for many years owing to their catalytic performance typically superior to that of pure Pt nanoparticles. The generation of ultra-thin Pt skins of only a few atomic layers on Pd nanoparticles has turned out to be extremely difficult because Pt tends to form islands during deposition instead of a continuous shell. Therefore, understanding the atomic mechanisms of shell formation is critical for atomic-scale design and control of the platinum shell. Here, by using in situ graphene-based liquid cell scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the growth mechanisms of the Pt shell on Pd nanocubes (NCs) are studied in aqueous solution at the atomic level. Pd-Pt core-shell NPs are formed via two distinct mechanisms: (i) at low concentration of Pt atoms, an ultra-thin skin of only a few atomic layers is formed via atom-by-atom deposition and (ii) at higher concentration of Pt atoms, inhomogeneous islands and thick shells are formed via attachment of Pt clusters. Our study provides a route to control core-shell growth and helps us to understand the exact atomic mechanisms of Pt shell growth on Pd seeds.},

  abstract     = {The quantum statistical fluctuations of electromagnetic fields establish a limit, known as the shot-noise limit, on the sensitivity of optical measurements performed with classical technologies. However, quantum technologies are not constrained by this shot-noise limit. In this regard, the possibility of using every photon produced by quantum sources of light to estimate small physical parameters, beyond the shot-noise limit, constitutes one of the main goals of quantum optics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable protocol for quantum-enhanced optical phase estimation across a broad range of phases, with neither pre- nor post-selected measurements. This is achieved through the efficient design of a source of spontaneous parametric downconversion in combination with photon-number-resolving detection. The robustness of two-mode squeezed vacuum states against loss allows us to outperform schemes based on N00N states, in which the loss of a single photon is enough to remove all phase information from a quantum state. In contrast to other schemes that rely on N00N states or conditional measurements, the sensitivity of our technique could be improved through the generation and detection of high-order photon pairs. This unique feature of our protocol makes it scalable. Our work is important for quantum technologies that rely on multiphoton interference such as quantum imaging, boson sampling, and quantum networks.},

  abstract     = {Normally off AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors with a p-type gate are promising for power switching applications, with advantages of low energy consumption and safe operation. In this work, p-NiO is employed as a gate stack, and the interfacial reconstruction and band structure modification at the p-NiO/AlGaN interface have been demonstrated to manipulate channel transport of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors by post-annealing. In addition to achieving a positive threshold voltage of 0.6 V and a large saturation output current of 520 mA/mm, we found that the gate leakage and On/Off drain current ratio can be improved significantly by more than 10 4 due to the p-NiO/AlGaN interfacial reconstruction. However, high annealing temperature also results in an increasing ON-resistance and a dramatically increased knee voltage (V K ), which can be attributed to the formation of an ultra-thin γ-Al 2 O 3 layer and the substitution of O on N site as a shallow donor at the p-NiO/AlGaN interface confirmed by experimental analyses. Theoretical calculations indicate that such interface reconstruction facilitates an additional potential well at the p-NiO/AlGaN interface to which electrons are spilled out from a two-dimensional electron gas channel under high forward gate voltage, resulting in the increased V K . Finally, an optimized annealing condition was confirmed that can eliminate this increased V K phenomenon and simultaneously remain these significantly improved device performances. These findings provide deep understanding of the performance manipulation of AlGaN high electron mobility transistors, which is very important for engineering the p-NiO/AlGaN interface toward high-performance and stable devices.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional flexible thermoelectric devices (2D FTEDs) are a promising candidate for powering wearable electronics by harvesting low-grade energy from human body and other ubiquitous energy sources. However, immature device designs in the parametric geometries of FTEDs cannot provide an optimized output power density because of either insufficient temperature difference or unnecessarily large internal resistance. Here, we theoretically design optimal parametric geometries of 2D FTEDs by systematically considering applied temperature difference, temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties of materials, leg thickness, and thermodynamic conditions. The obtained analytical solution determines the optimal leg length for 2D FTEDs when these parameters are given and, therefore, minimizes the internal device resistance and simultaneously maintains the high temperature difference across the TE legs to maximize the device output power density. According to this design, we use flexible Ag 2 Se films as thermoelectric legs to assemble a 2D FTED, which displays a maximum power output of 11.2 mW and a normalized output power density of 1.43 μ W cm −2 K −1 at a temperature difference of 150 K, outnumbering other 2D FTEDs by threefolds. Our 2D FTED can power up four light-emitting diodes, which shows great potential for harvesting electricity from low-grade heat. The exotic and reliable device design concept of 2D FTEDs reported here can be extended to other thermoelectric systems to boost the practical applications of FTEDs.},

  abstract     = {Ice-templated collagen-based tissue-engineering scaffolds are ideal for controlled tissue regeneration since they mimic the micro-environment experienced in vivo . The structure and properties of scaffolds are fine-tuned during fabrication by controlling a number of experimental parameters. However, this parameter space is large and complex, rendering the interpretation of results and selection of optimal parameters to be challenging in practice. This paper investigates the impact of a cross section of this parameter space (drying conditions and solute environment) on the scaffold microstructure. Qualitative assessment revealed the previously unreported impact of drying temperature and pressure on pore wall roughness, and confirmed the influence of collagen concentration, solvent type, and solute addition on pore morphology. For quantitative comparison, we demonstrate the novel application of random forest regression to analyze multi-dimensional biomaterials datasets, and predict microstructural attributes for a scaffold. Using these regression models, we assessed the relative importance of the input experimental parameters on quantitative pore measurements. Collagen concentration and pH were found to be the largest factors in determining pore size and connectivity. Furthermore, circular dichroism peak intensities were also revealed to be a good predictor for structural variations, which is a parameter that has not previously been investigated for its effect on a scaffold microstructure. Thus, this paper demonstrates the potential for predictive models such as random forest regressors to discover novel relationships in biomaterials datasets. These relationships between parameters (such as circular dichroism spectra and pore connectivity) can therefore also be used to identify and design further avenues of investigation within biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Inorganic lead (Pb)-free Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 double perovskite is one of the most promising light absorbers in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to solve the instability and Pb toxicity problems of organic–inorganic perovskites. However, the intrinsic and extrinsic defects of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 films strongly limit the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 -based PSCs. Herein, the first investigation of additive engineering in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 -based PSCs is reported to achieve an outstanding efficiency. The introduction of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) additive effectively controls the nucleation of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 crystals during the film formation process, improves the perovskite film quality, suppresses the charge carrier recombination, and accelerates the charge extraction simultaneously. Consequently, after optimizing the GuaSCN amount, the device shows a stable PCE of 3.02\% under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) condition. Furthermore, the introduction of GuaSCN additive remarkably improves the ambient stability of the devices. This work provides insights on additive engineering for enhancing the efficiency and stability of inorganic Pb-free Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 -based PSCs toward future industrialization of this technology.},

This law has not yet been validated for the anomalous transport variables, with recent experimental studies yielding material-dependent results. Nevertheless, the anomalous Hall and thermal Hall coefficients of Fe 3− x GeTe 2 are found, within our experimental accuracy, to satisfy the WF law for magnetic fields μ 0 H applied along its c axis. Remarkably, large anomalous transport is also observed for μ 0 H | | a axis with the field aligned along the gradient of the chemical potential generated by thermal gradients or electrical currents, a configuration that should not lead to their observation. These anomalous planar quantities are found to not scale with the component of the planar magnetization ( ⁠ M | | ⁠ ), showing instead a sharp decrease beyond μ 0 H | | = 4 T or the field required to align the magnetic moments along μ 0 H | | ⁠ . We argue that chiral spin structures associated with Bloch domain walls lead to a field-dependent spin chirality that produces a novel type of topological transport in the absence of interaction between the magnetic field and electrical or thermal currents. Locally chiral spin structures are captured by our Monte Carlo simulations incorporating small Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya and biquadratic exchange interactions. These observations reveal not only a new way to detect and expose topological excitations, but also a new configuration for heat conversion that expands the current technological horizon for thermoelectric energy applications.},

Hence, in recent years, significant breakthroughs in design and application of such luminogens have been reported. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in molecular guidelines and photophysical process control for developing luminogens with large multi-photon action cross section. Special attention is paid to how the molecular structure and intermolecular interactions influence the intramolecular charge transfer, and how new strategies have been developed to advance the multi-photon imaging and therapeutic performance.

Based on this unique scaling effect, nanoscale flexoelectricity has shown exciting physical phenomena, promising novel electronic, electromechanical, and photovoltaic applications. One of the most powerful ways to harness nanoscale flexoelectricity is to press the surface of a material through an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip to generate large strain gradients. This so-called AFM tip pressing allows us to locally break the inversion symmetry in any materials and study all the fascinating physical phenomena associated with inversion asymmetry. Although this technique has recently facilitated many important studies on nanoscale flexoelectricity, its effective use still requires a more solid foundation.

Biosensors are analytical devices able to detect bio-chemical analytes (e.g., neurotransmitters, cancer biomarkers, bio-molecules, and ions), through the combination of a bio-recognition element and a bio-transduction device. The use of customized bio-recognition elements such as enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes facilitates achieving high selectivity.

Indeed, these bio-transduction devices are characterized by superior electronic properties and intrinsic signal amplification that allow the detection of a wide range of bio-molecules with high sensitivity (down to pM concentration).

This work provides a comprehensive and critical review of electrolyte-gated carbon nanotube field-effect transistor-based biosensors. First, an introduction to these bio-sensing devices is given. Next, the device configurations and operating principles are presented, and the most used materials and processes are reviewed with a particular focus on carbon nanotubes as the active material. Subsequently, different functionalization strategies reported in the literature, based on enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes, are analyzed critically.

However, every single solar cell has a theoretical power conversion efficiency limit, and, thus, without compromising the cost, the power conversion efficiency enhancement of a solar cell is highly challenging. As a convenient solution, concentrating photovoltaics can focus sunlight onto an extremely high-efficiency solar cell integrating various optics. Concentrating photovoltaics use optical devices that collect and redirect the light toward the smaller photovoltaic cell and reduce the demand for the mined elements required for the solar cell fabrication. The research interest from the photovoltaic community has concentrated on organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite absorbers, and nowadays, perovskite solar cells manifest their outstanding contribution among the low-cost photovoltaic technologies. Inevitably, large-area perovskite solar cells suffer a lot with their poor stability, hindering their commercialization pace. Thus, the implementation of concentrating photovoltaic technology in perovskite solar cells demonstrates an inherent advantage using a smaller size solar cell.

  abstract     = {The desire to perform information processing, computation, communication, signal generation, and related tasks, while dissipating as little energy as possible, has inspired many ideas and paradigms. One of the most powerful among them is the notion of using magnetostrictive nanomagnets as the primitive units of the hardware platforms and manipulating their magnetizations (which are the state variables encoding information) with electrically generated static or time-varying mechanical strain to elicit myriad functionalities. This approach has two advantages. First, information can be retained in the devices after powering off since the nanomagnets are nonvolatile unlike charge-based devices, such as transistors. Second, the energy expended to perform a given task is exceptionally low since it takes very little energy to alter magnetization states with strain. This field is now known as “straintronics, ” in analogy with electronics, spintronics, valleytronics, etc., although it pertains specifically to “magnetic” straintronics and excludes phenomena involving non-magnetic systems. We review the recent advances and trends in straintronics, including digital information processing (logic), information storage (memory), domain wall devices operated with strain, control of skyrmions with strain, non-Boolean computing and machine learning with straintronics, signal generation (microwave sources) and communication (ultra-miniaturized acoustic and electromagnetic antennas) implemented with strained nanomagnets, hybrid straintronics–magnonics, and interaction between phonons and magnons in straintronic systems. We identify key challenges and opportunities, and lay out pathways to advance this field to the point where it might become a mainstream technology for energy-efficient systems.},

  abstract     = {In the past 100 years, external beam energy for the treatment of cancer has continually evolved. Two main modes have been developed. The first is radiotherapy which involves using x-ray, gamma, and proton beams to cause ionizing damage. The second is photodynamic therapy, which uses photons to activate photosensitizers to generate reactive oxidating species causing cytotoxicity. For decades, these two fields have developed separately, with photodynamic therapy being used for treating surface tumors and radiotherapy, for deeper tumors. In the first half of this article, a detailed review of radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy will be presented. For each field, the underlying physical mechanisms will be discussed, followed by the existing technological and engineering designs, and ending off with the relevant vivo studies and clinical applications. In the second half, the recent efforts to combine radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy, leading to the generation of new techniques such as x-ray photodynamic therapy, proton-induced photodynamic therapy and even the possibility of hybrid approaches such as intensity and fluence modulated photodynamic therapy will be discussed. This new field is known as radiodynamic therapy. It has the potential to achieve increased conformality in the treatment of cancer, dealing maximal dosage to the lesion while sparing healthy tissues, paving the way for new advances in precision medicine. The connection between these fields is a neglected area, and this review addresses this gap. It also serves as a repository for researchers who are keen to venture into radiodynamic therapy.},

  abstract     = {The interest in two-dimensional and layered materials continues to expand, driven by the compelling properties of individual atomic layers that can be stacked and/or twisted into synthetic heterostructures. The plethora of electronic properties as well as the emergence of many different quasiparticles, including plasmons, polaritons, trions, and excitons with large, tunable binding energies that all can be controlled and modulated through electrical means, has given rise to many device applications. In addition, these materials exhibit both room-temperature spin and valley polarization, magnetism, superconductivity, piezoelectricity that are intricately dependent on the composition, crystal structure, stacking, twist angle, layer number, and phases of these materials. Initial results on graphene exfoliated from single bulk crystals motivated the development of wide-area, high purity synthesis and heterojunctions with atomically clean interfaces. Now by opening this design space to new synthetic two-dimensional materials “beyond graphene, ” it is possible to explore uncharted opportunities in designing novel heterostructures for electrically tunable devices. To fully reveal the emerging functionalities and opportunities of these atomically thin materials in practical applications, this review highlights several representative and noteworthy research directions in the use of electrical means to tune these aforementioned physical and structural properties, with an emphasis on discussing major applications of beyond graphene 2D materials in tunable devices in recent years and an outlook of what is to come in the next decade.},

The recent advances in selective growth, purification, and sorting of semiconducting and even monochiral carbon nanotubes have enabled field-effect transistors with high carrier mobilities and on/off current ratios that were impossible a few years ago. They have also allowed researchers to examine the microscopic interplay of parameters such as nanotube length, density, diameter distribution, carrier density, intentional and unintentional defects, dielectric environment, etc., and their impact on the macroscopic charge transport properties in a rational and reproducible manner. This review discusses various models that are considered for charge transport in nanotube networks and the experimental methods to characterize and investigate transport beyond simple conductivity or transistor measurements. Static and dynamic absorption, photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectroscopy, as well as scanning probe techniques (e.g., conductive atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy), and their unique insights in the distribution of charge carriers in a given nanotube network and the resulting current pathways will be introduced.

We review state of the art advances in nanoelectrode-neuron interfaces, the standard control experiments to investigate their electrophysiological behavior, and present recent high fidelity recordings of intracellular potentials obtained with ultrasharp NWs developed in our laboratory that naturally permeate neuronal cell bodies.

  abstract     = {Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films stand for a prominent technological brick in the field of microsystems. The recent improvements of their manufacturability combined with excellent piezoelectric properties have enabled their introduction in industrial clean rooms all around the world. These films require annealing temperatures beyond 600 °C to crystallize in the desired perovskite phase, which exhibits outstanding piezoelectric coefficients. This temperature requirement forbids large application fields such as flexible electronics, smart glass but also system-on-chip approaches. Decreasing the annealing temperature of PZT films would therefore spread further their potential usage to other applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with a comprehensive review of the different techniques available in the literature to process piezoelectric PZT thin films at temperatures compatible with semiconductors (450 °C), smart glass (400 °C), or flexible electronics (350 °C). We first present the typical ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of PZT films. The different deposition techniques and growth mechanisms of these films are then reviewed with a focus on thermodynamics. Then, all the low temperature processes are detailed, such as seeding effects, the modification of deposition parameters in vapor-phase deposition, special annealing technologies assisted with UV, lasers, flash lamps, microwave radiations or high-pressure, a focus on the hydrothermal method, and finally what is called solution chemistry design with notably combustion synthesis. Transfer processing is also detailed, as an alternative way to this low temperature approach. An outlook of future applications enabled by these innovative techniques is finally provided.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosis of disease at an early, curable, and reversible stage allows more conservative treatment and better patient outcomes. Fluorescence biosensing is a widely used method to detect biomarkers, which are early indicators of disease. Importantly, biosensing requires a high level of sensitivity. Traditionally, these sensors use antibodies or enzymes as biorecognition molecules; however, these can lack the specificity required in a clinical setting, limiting their overall applicability. Aptamers are short, single stranded nucleotides that are receiving increasing attention over traditional recognition molecules. These exhibit many advantages, such as high specificity, making them promising for ultrasensitive biosensors. Metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) utilizes plasmonic materials, which can increase the sensitivity of label-based fluorescent biosensors. The fluorescence enhancement achieved by placing metallic nanostructures in close proximity to fluorophores allows for detection of ultra-low biomarker concentrations. Plasmonic biosensors have been successfully implemented as diagnostic tools for a number of diseases, such as cancer, yet reproducible systems exhibiting high specificity and the ability to multiplex remain challenging. Similarly, while aptasensors have been extensively reported, few systems currently incorporate MEF, which could drastically improve biosensor sensitivity. Here, we review the latest advancements in the field of aptamer biosensing based on MEF that have been explored for the detection of a wide variety of biological molecules. While this emerging biosensing technology is still in its infant stage, we highlight the potential challenges and its clinical potential in early diagnosis of diseases.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic molecular crystals showing light-triggered macro-movements have attracted great attention due to their unique ability for light–force conversion. These molecular crystals are driven remotely without any intermediary devices like wires and motors, which can transform light energy into mechanical work directly. However, the limited space restricts molecular rotation and motion in the crystalline state; thus, realizing macro-movements in molecular crystal systems is still a formidable challenge. In this review, we aim to focus on the underlying working mechanism of the photo-controllable macroscopic motion of molecular crystals with special focus on their practical applications. In detail, we discuss the basic principles and macroscopic photomechanical effects of these dynamic molecular crystals, including their deformation (i.e., bending, twisting, curling); complex motion (i.e., crawling, rotating, rolling); and disintegration (i.e., photosalient effect). Then, we introduce the most promising applications of photomechanical molecular crystals in the fields of all-optical devices, crystal actuators, and biomimetic artificial muscles. Therefore, this review will provide inspiration to develop state-of-the-art dynamic molecular crystals by bridging the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and engineering science.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric interfacial devices consist of materials systems whose interfacial electronic properties (such as a 2D electron gas or an interfacial magnetic spin configuration) are modulated by a ferroelectric layer set in its immediate vicinity. While the prototypical example of such a system is the ferroelectric field effect transistor first proposed in the 1950s, only with the recent advances in the controlled growth of epitaxial thin films and heterostructures, and the recent physical understanding down to the atomic scale of screening processes at ferroelectric-semiconducting and -metallic interfaces made possible by first principles calculations, have the conditions been met for a full development of the field. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in ferroelectric interfacial systems with emphasis on the ferroelectric control of the electronic properties of interfacial devices with well ordered (epitaxial) interfaces. In particular, we consider the cases of ferroelectric interfacial systems aimed at controlling the correlated state, including superconductivity, Mott metallic-insulator transition, magnetism, charge, and orbital order, and charge and spin transport across ferroelectric tunnel junctions. The focus is on the basic physical mechanisms underlying the emergence of interfacial effects, the nature of the ferroelectric control of the electronic state, and the role of extreme electric field gradients at the interface in giving rise to new physical phenomena. Such understanding is key to the development of ferroelectric interfacial systems with characteristics suitable for next generation electronic devices based on controlling the correlated state of matter.},

Due to their complex nature, each of these processes is generally investigated in separate subdomains, which are considered to have their own theoretical, modeling, and experimental challenges. In this review, however, we want to emphasize the overarching nature of plasma–surface interaction physics and chemistry, by focusing on the general strategy for its computational simulation. In the first half of the review, we provide a menu card with standard and less standardized computational methods to be used for the multiscale modeling of the underlying processes. In the second half, we illustrate the benefits and potential of the multiscale modeling strategy with a case study of Si and SiO 2 etching by fluorocarbon plasmas and identify the gaps in knowledge still present on this intensely investigated plasma–material combination, both on a qualitative and quantitative level. Remarkably, the dominant etching mechanisms remain the least understood. The resulting new insights are of general relevance, for all plasmas and materials, including their various applications. We therefore hope to motivate computational and experimental scientists and engineers to collaborate more intensely on filling the existing gaps in knowledge. In this way, we expect that research will overcome a bottleneck stage in the development and optimization of multiscale models, and thus the fundamental understanding of plasma–surface interaction.},

  abstract     = {Tunable devices are of great interest as they offer reconfigurability to their operation, although many of them employ rare and expensive materials. In a world with increasing focus on ecological compatibility and recyclability, immense efforts are being made to find bio-friendly alternatives. However, in some cases, one does not have to look far, because water, a high-permittivity dielectric at microwave frequencies, is readily available. Recent studies have shown that compact Mie resonators, which are the fundamental blocks in all-dielectric metamaterials and dielectric resonator antennas, can be realized with small water elements. In a variety of applied physics areas, encompassing frequencies from the radio to the optical parts of the spectrum, all-dielectric implementations have received immense attention. When it comes to water, its temperature-dependent permittivity and liquidity enable a multitude of unprecedentedly simple means to reconfigure and tune the resulting devices. Moreover, being a polar solvent, water easily dissolves various physiologically important electrolytes, which potentially can be exploited in a sensor design. Presently, we review water-based devices for advanced microwave control and sensing. We show and discuss the dynamic properties of water and examine the microwave scattering and absorption characteristics of single water elements. We investigate how such water elements can be employed in various microwave designs, including single resonators, metamaterials, metasurfaces, antennas, absorbers, and radio frequency components. The main complications of water are its losses, especially at higher microwave frequencies, and its stability. We discuss how to overcome these and show that even highly loss-sensitive modes, namely, toroidal modes and bound states in the continuum, can be realized with water-based devices. We believe that water-based devices usher the route to meet the UN proclaimed goals on global sustainability and human-friendly environment.},

The search for new approaches to address antibacterial resistance is therefore of crucial importance and seeking alternatives for the treatment and control of bacterial diseases associated with resistant strains, which is in need of urgent action. There is an ongoing interest in metal-based nanoparticles (MBNPs) and their usage synergy with antibiotics due to their unique properties, such as overcoming bacterial resistance, reducing acute toxicity compared to their sizes, and allowing dosage reduction of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Combining MBNPs and antibiotics not only enhances the antibacterial effect but also allows the inhibition of biofilm production. Furthermore, MBNPs and antibiotics incorporated in polymeric biomaterial matrix have been widely studied to improve their efficiency and devoid the resistance. However, these studies need to be combined in a literature review. Polymeric biomaterials offer high mechanical stability with improved biocompatibility. Moreover, their use makes a single dose of administration of the final product with extended antibiotic half-life possible while slowly releasing their reservoir, which is an advantage in continuously combating resistance. This review focuses on different promising biomedical strategies for enhancing the bactericidal efficacy of antibiotics by the synergistic use of MBNPs, antibiotics, and polymeric biomaterials together to combat the resistance of different bacterial strains. In addition, it is prospected to guide opportunities for new research for future biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Even though the quantized interaction between light and matter in the photoelectric effect is considered one of the cornerstones in the development of quantum mechanics, it was long thought impossible to directly observe the quantized nature of light itself. The advent of light-intensity autocorrelation techniques in the 1950s, first developed to study the size of stars, changed little in this perception, until true single-photon correlation spectroscopy from trapped ions was proven to be possible in the late 1970s: Photons from a single quantum emitter tend to arrive in bunches, but each light quantum is spaced apart in time—it is antibunched. Initially considered only as the workhorse of atomic quantum optics, over the past two decades, photon correlation techniques have become a standard in fields as diverse as quantum-information processing, biological imaging, polymer physics, and materials science, in general. The technique is particularly useful for probing materials that are specifically designed to emit or absorb light in optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, or lasers. The central question in such studies is how large a mesoscopic piece of material can become and still behave as an atom-like source of single photons. What interactions may arise between multiple excitations within a material, and what sort of dark states may give rise to intermittency in the stream of photons? We review the many different classes of optoelectronic materials for which photon-correlation spectroscopy has proven to offer useful insight into excited-state dynamics, ranging from molecular, over semiconductor to metallic nanostructures. The technique is particularly suited to probing mesoscopic aggregates of organic semiconductors since each single molecule acts as a quantum emitter itself.},

  abstract     = {In the standard configurations of metal halide perovskite solar cell, the active layer, or absorber, follows a p-i-n or n-i-p electronic structure that is designed to enhance the separation and extraction of photo-induced charge carriers. The control of the Fermi level position across the film, between electron and hole transport layers, is therefore of paramount importance. Direct localized doping in metal halide perovskites being still elusive, the design of n-i-p and p-i-n structures has so far relied predominantly on surface and interface doping of the perovskite as well as on the control of the work function of the substrate and transport layers on which, or between which, the absorber is being placed. We provide here a short review of that work, emphasizing the fundamental studies of electronic structure performed on systems modified with organic molecular dopants. The review starts with a justification for the effectiveness of interface doping, based on the ability to move the Fermi level across the gap of the perovskite. We then review work done on the deposition of molecular oxidants and reductants on perovskite surfaces, including the mitigation of the surface states, and the impact of these dopants on energy level alignment with substrate and charge transport layers. The second part of the review focuses on the use of molecular dopants to either modify the work function of electron or hole transport layers to establish the boundary conditions for a p-i-n or n-i-p structure, or to enhance the conductivity of these layers in order to facilitate charge carrier extraction. Final considerations are also given on recent work on bulk doping of the perovskite layer with molecular dopants.},

However, limited of A-site elements in the definition of M n+ 1 AX n phases, it is a huge challenge for designing nanolaminated ferromagnetic materials with single-atom-thick two-dimensional iron layers occupying the A layers in the M n+ 1 AX n phases. Here, we report three new ternary magnetic M n+ 1 AX n phases (Ta 2 FeC, Ti 2 FeN, and Nb 2 FeC) with A sublayers of single-atom-thick two-dimensional iron through an isomorphous replacement reaction of M n+ 1 AX n precursors (Ta 2 AlC, Ti 2 AlN, and Nb 2 AlC) with a Lewis acid salts (FeCl 2 ). All these M n+ 1 AX n phases exhibit ferromagnetic behavior. The Curie temperatures of the Ta 2 FeC and Nb 2 FeC M n+ 1 AX n phases are 281 and 291 K, respectively, i.e., close to room temperature. The saturation magnetization of these ternary magnetic MAX phases is almost two orders of magnitude higher than V 2 (Sn, Fe)C, whose A-site is partially substituted by Fe. Theoretical calculations on magnetic orderings of spin moments of Fe atoms in these nanolaminated magnetic M n+ 1 AX n phases reveal that the magnetism can be mainly ascribed to an intralayer exchange interaction of the two-dimensional Fe atomic layers. Owing to the richness in composition of M n+ 1 AX n phases, our work provides a large imaginary space for constructing functional single-atom-thick two-dimensional layers in materials using these nanolaminated templates.},

  abstract     = {Vortices in topological superconductors are predicted to host Majorana bound states (MBSs) as exotic quasiparticles. In recent experiments, the spatially non-split zero-energy vortex bound state in topological superconductors has been regarded as an essential spectroscopic signature for the observation of MBSs. Here, we report the observation of anisotropic non-split zero-energy vortex bound states in a conventional elemental superconductor with a topologically trivial band structure using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The experimental results, corroborated by quasi-classical theoretical calculations, indicate that the non-split states directly reflect the quasiparticle trajectories governed by the surface electronic structure. Our study implies that non-split zero-energy states are not a conclusive signature of MBSs in vortex cores, in particular for superconducting systems not being in the quantum limit, stimulating a revision of the current understanding of such states.},

However, most reported wearable temperature sensors suffer from limitations, such as high fabrication cost and low working efficiency, sensing performance, and scalability, which impede their broad application in wearable fields. In this work, a new type of metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) self-gated device based on NiO/Ni heterostructure frameworks is fabricated and employed in wearable high-performance temperature sensors. The MSM self-gated device is prepared via a facile and controllable in situ oxidation method and demonstrates efficient charge transportation, excellent thermal conductivity [3.74 W (m K −1 )], and high thermal diffusivity (9.39 mm 2 s −1 ). The obtained temperature sensors exhibit high sensitivity (−5.04\% °C −1 ), wide working range (−15 to 80 °C), and excellent stability (more than three months) and have been applied to monitor the temperature of objects and the human body. In particular, a flexible temperature sensor array is fabricated to measure the spatially resolved temperature distribution. The array demonstrates the bright application prospects of the sensors in the fields of human–machine interfaces and intelligent medical systems.},

  abstract     = {The exciton physics of organic semiconductors is exotic. It is a domain in which singlet and triplet kinetics both play an important role in determining the performance of various optoelectronic devices. Since triplet excitons are non-emissive, it brings further challenges in the understanding of triplet kinetics. In this work, we have studied the effect of polymer chain packing on triplet diffusion in the polyfluorene based polymeric system, which is known to give efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) efficiency for display devices. Furthermore, this polyfluorene system exhibits an efficient triplet–triplet fusion process, which provides singlet excitons as delayed fluorescence and becomes a tool to study triplet exciton kinetics. We have developed a unique method to trace the position of the triplet exciton in the emissive layer of OLEDs by analyzing angle-resolved delayed electroluminescence emission patterns as a function of time. This study could provide exciton transport kinetics in the transverse direction from the substrate plane. Furthermore, direct visualization of the delayed photoluminescence imaging technique could provide lateral transport kinetics of triplet excitons. Results suggest that the diffusion is significantly anisotropic in thinner films. As the thickness of the film increases, anisotropy reduces in triplet transport. Moreover, we noticed that in thicker polymeric semiconductor films, diffusivity approaches close to ultrahigh 10 −3 cm 2 s −1 , which is similar to the values that are reported for acene-based molecular crystalline thin films. Our results also provide important insight into efficient electroluminescence in unusually thick (1.2 μ m) polyfluorene-based emissive layers of OLEDs.},

  abstract     = {Supercrystalline nanocomposites are a new class of hybrid and nanostructured materials that can reach exceptional mechanical strength and can be fabricated at low temperatures. Hierarchically arranged, they bridge the gap from the nano- to the macro-scale. Even though their mechanical properties are starting to be characterized, their constitutive behavior is still largely unexplored. Here, the mechanical behavior of supercrystalline nanocomposites of iron oxide nanoparticles, surface-functionalized with oleic acid and oleyl phosphate ligands, is investigated in both bending and compression, with loading–unloading tests. A new bar geometry is implemented to better detect deformation prior to unstable crack propagation, and notched bending bars are tested to evaluate fracture toughness. Micro-mechanical tests result in the values of strength and elastic modulus that are extremely high for supercrystals, reaching record-high numbers in the oleic acid-based nanocomposites, which also show a significant tension–compression asymmetry. The constitutive behavior of both materials is predominantly linear elastic, with some more marked nonlinearities arising in the oleyl phosphate-based nanocomposites. The fracture toughness of both types of nanocomposites, ∼0.3 MPa√m, suggests that extrinsic toughening, associated with both material composition and nanostructure, plays an important role. Fractographic observations reveal analogies with shear and cleavage in atomic crystals. The influence of material composition, nanostructure, and processing method on the mechanical behavior of the nanocomposites is analyzed.},

This unique PES leads to a pseudo-centrosymmetric paraelectric β phase that resolves the current controversy between theory and experiment. We further show that while the α -to- β (ferroelectric-to-paraelectric) phase transition is fast and coherent, assisted by an in-plane shear phonon mode, a random distribution of the atoms in the trough of the PES acts as an entropy barrier against the reverse β -to- α transition. This will be the origin of the speed limitation of current In 2 Se 3 ferroelectric devices. However, if one orders the β phase (due to the formation of in-plane ferroelectric domains), the reverse transition can take place within tens of picoseconds in the presence of a perpendicular electric field. Finally, the Mexican-hat PES is a general feature for the entire family of 2D III 2 -VI 3 materials. Our finding offers a critical physical picture in controlling the ultrafast reversible phase transition in 2D In 2 Se 3 and other III 2 -VI 3 materials, which will benefit their practical industrial development for advanced ferroelectric devices.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative candidate to replace lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage devices owing to the natural abundance of potassium and similar mechanism as lithium-ion batteries. In particular, transition metal oxide cathode materials have attracted growing attention due to their high theoretical capacities and low cost compared with other cathode materials. Nevertheless, due to the larger ionic radius of K-ions, transition metal oxide cathode materials suffer from irreversible structural evolution and interlayer-gliding of transition metal layers in potassiation/depotassiation, which results in sluggish kinetics and structural instability. This limited capacity and unsatisfactory cycling properties inhibit the practical application of potassium-ion batteries. It still remains a challenge to develop the suitable cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries. In this work, the interlayer-gliding and irreversible P3–O3 structure transition were suppressed via the replacement of cobalt and iron, and the doping mechanism was investigated by in situ x-ray diffraction. The incorporation of Co ions and Fe ions enlarges the d-space between the transition metal layers, reduces the resistance of K + migration, and provides the buffer spaces to suppress the interlayer-gliding and P3–O3 phase transformation in electrochemical potassium-ion storage, leading to an enhanced rate capability (58 mA h g −1 at 1 A g −1 ) and superior cycling stability (71\% after 300 cycles at 200 mA g −1 ). This strategy provides a better understanding for the effect of Co–Fe substitution in suppressing interlayer-gliding and improving electrochemical properties for the development of a novel cathode material for potassium-ion batteries.},

Resulting MOF alloys exhibit a highly 2D nature with excellent crystallinity and minute control over metal cation ratios. Our experimental and theoretical results show that their electronic bandgaps and photoexcited carrier lifetimes can be engineered by metal cation alloying.

Here, we report on implementation of the van der Waals heterostructure based on a monolayer graphene and an ∼1-nm-thick molecular carbon nanomembrane (CNM) in a solution-gated field-effect transistor (FET) for pH sensing. The nondestructive functionalization of a graphene FET with the amino-terminated CNM (NH 2 -CNM) enables the induction of chemically active groups in the vicinity of the graphene sheet, maintaining its charge carrier transport properties. We applied complementary characterization techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical and atomic force microscopy as well as field-effect and electrical impedance measurements to characterize the engineered NH 2 -CNM/graphene devices. We demonstrate their high pH resolution with a minimum detectable pH change of ∼0.01 at pH 2 and ∼0.04 at pH 12, with a response time in the range of seconds, and we apply an electrical double-layer model to rationalize the experimentally observed performance theoretically.

Topological insulators, presenting symmetry-protected metallic edge states, are a promising class of materials for different applications. However, further development is limited by the scarcity of viable candidates. Here we present and discuss machine learning–accelerated strategies for searching the materials space for two-dimensional topological materials. We show the importance of detailed investigations of each machine learning component, leading to different results. Using recently created databases containing thousands of ab initio calculations of 2D materials, we train machine learning models capable of determining the electronic topology of materials, with an accuracy of over 90\%. We can then generate and screen thousands of novel materials, efficiently predicting their topological character without the need for a priori structural knowledge. We discover 56 non-trivial materials, of which 17 are novel insulating candidates for further investigation, for which we corroborate their topological properties with density functional theory calculations. This strategy is 10× more efficient than the trial-and-error approach while a few orders of magnitude faster and is a proof of concept for guiding improved materials discovery search strategies.},

For most magnetic heating applications, it is crucial to generate a high level of heat with a low dose of MIONs. Current methods to increase the specific absorption rate (SAR) of MIONs include increasing their size and doping iron oxide nanocrystals with other metal elements. Here, we demonstrate that controlled oxidation and surface modification can significantly increase SAR of MIONs. We synthesized MIONs of different core sizes and with different coatings, including phospholipid-PEG and triethylenetetramine (TETA). We oxidized PEG-coated MIONs in a controlled fashion and measured the SAR values of the MIONs under different oxidation states. We found that, with controlled oxidation, the SAR values of 15-nm and 18-nm MIONs increased by ∼1.87 fold after two weeks of oxidation. A similar fold-increase in SAR was achieved for 15-nm MIONs with TETA coating compared with PEG coating. We systematically characterized the physical properties of MIONs and showed that oxidation caused MIONs to transition from magnetite to maghemite, resulting in increased anisotropy constant and SAR values. Our results demonstrate new approaches to significantly increase the heating capacity of MIONs by controlled nanocrystal oxidation and surface modification.},

To date, the development of data-driven experiment planning strategies for autonomous experimentation has largely focused on continuous process parameters, despite the urge to devise efficient strategies for the selection of categorical variables. Here, we introduce G ryffin , a general-purpose optimization framework for the autonomous selection of categorical variables driven by expert knowledge. G ryffin augments Bayesian optimization based on kernel density estimation with smooth approximations to categorical distributions. Leveraging domain knowledge in the form of physicochemical descriptors, G ryffin can significantly accelerate the search for promising molecules and materials. G ryffin can further highlight relevant correlations between the provided descriptors to inspire physical insights and foster scientific intuition. In addition to comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate the capabilities and performance of G ryffin on three examples in materials science and chemistry: (i) the discovery of non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells, (ii) the design of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites for light-harvesting, and (iii) the identification of ligands and process parameters for Suzuki–Miyaura reactions. Our results suggest that G ryffin , in its simplest form, is competitive with state-of-the-art categorical optimization algorithms. However, when leveraging domain knowledge provided via descriptors, G ryffin outperforms other approaches while simultaneously refining this domain knowledge to promote scientific understanding.},

  abstract     = {Polymer informatics is being utilized to accelerate polymer discovery. However, the practical realization of the designed polymer is still slow due to synthesis challenges, e.g., difficulties with the identification of potential polymerization mechanisms and optimal reactants/solvents/processing conditions. In the past, synthesis pathways adopted for a target polymer have been heavily dependent on chemical intuition and past experience. To expedite this process, we have developed a data-driven approach to assist in polymer retrosynthesis planning. In this work, a dataset of polymerization reactions was manually accumulated from various resources to extract hundreds of synthetic templates and used as the training set. Further, a similarity metric was adopted to select synthetic templates and similar existing reactants for the new target polymer. Finally, prediction accuracy was measured by comparison with ground truth and/or bench chemists&#39; estimation. The proposed data-driven polymer synthesis recommendation model has been deployed at https://www.polymergenome.org .},

  abstract     = {Developing advanced electrode materials with high stability and high ion-diffusion rate is vital for the success of high-rate lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the commonly used modification strategies such as carbon coating, nanoarchitecture engineering, and introducing oxygen vacancies are unavoidably meeting with the problems of high cost and complicated preparation process. Herein, we report cation-mixing effect enhanced fast Li + storage in Wadsley-Roth phase Fe-Ti-Nb oxide (FTNO) materials by a facile solution combustion method. Co-existence of Fe 3+ and Ti 4+ in the crystallographic shear structure leads to enhanced cation-mixing effect with cations short-range order (SRO) in FTNO materials, thus resulting in outstanding capabilities of fast Li + storage/diffusion, robust structure and low charge transfer resistance compared with the analogues of FeNb 11 O 29 and Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 . Consequently, a high-capacity retention of 71.8\% is achieved upon 10 000 cycles at 10 C. Most importantly, the feasibilities of FTNO are also systematically verified in various practical electrochemical energy storage devices containing conventional lithium-ion full battery (FTNOǁLiFePO 4 ), high-power lithium-ion hybrid capacitor [FTNOǁactive carbon (AC)], and novel dual-ion battery [FTNOǁmesocarbon microbeads (MCMB)]. It is worth noting that the FTNOǁMCMB with high output voltage of 3 V delivers a capacity of 105.7 mAh g −1 , implying a great potential of FTNO applied in dual-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining both high static liquid repellency and large dynamic pressure resistance is highly preferred for a myriad of applications, such as energy conversion, anti-icing, and antifouling. However, these two merits are mutually exclusive in conventional surface design: Sparse structures with reduced solid–liquid contact area yield high static liquid repellency, which in turn inevitably suffer from poor dynamic wetting properties as exemplified by low wetting resistance and easy Cassie-to-Wenzel transition. Here, we circumvent this trade-off by designing a springtail cuticle-inspired surface consisting of multilayered, doubly reentrant posts with increasing diameter from top to bottom, which simultaneously imparts high static wetting and multiple energy barriers for the gradual liquid penetration in a stepwise mode. Particularly, the synergy between the doubly reentrant structure, which increases the breakthrough pressure, and the multilayered architecture sustains a robust liquid repellency in a broad range of conditions otherwise challenging on conventional structures. Our findings provide an important insight for the rational design of robust superliquid-repellent surfaces.},

  abstract     = {In conventional Kerr and Faraday microscopy, the sample is illuminated with plane-polarized light, and a magnetic domain contrast is generated by an analyzer making use of the Kerr or Faraday rotation. Here, we demonstrate possibilities of analyzer-free magneto-optical microscopy based on magnetization-dependent intensity modulations of the light. (i) The transverse Kerr effect can be applied for in-plane magnetized material, as demonstrated for an FeSi sheet. (ii) Illuminating that sample with circularly polarized light leads to a domain contrast with a different symmetry from the conventional Kerr contrast. (iii) Circular polarization can also be used for perpendicularly magnetized material, as demonstrated for garnet and ultrathin CoFeB films. (iv) Plane-polarized light at a specific angle can be employed for both in-plane and perpendicular media. (v) Perpendicular light incidence leads to a domain contrast on in-plane materials that is quadratic in the magnetization and to a domain boundary contrast. (vi) Domain contrast can even be obtained without a polarizer. In cases (ii) and (iii), the contrast is generated by magnetic circular dichroism (i.e., differential absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light induced by magnetization components along the direction of light propagation), while magnetic linear dichroism (differential absorption of linearly polarized light induced by magnetization components transverse to propagation) is responsible for the contrast in case (v). The domain–boundary contrast is due to the magneto-optical gradient effect. A domain–boundary contrast can also arise by interference of phase-shifted magneto-optical amplitudes. An explanation of these contrast phenomena is provided in terms of Maxwell–Fresnel theory.},

The main goal of this work is to demonstrate precise control of layered materials&#39; electronic properties through careful choice of the constituent layers, their stacking, and relative orientation. Physics-based and AI-driven approaches for the automated planning, execution, and analysis of electronic structure calculations are applied to layered assemblies based on prototype one-dimensional (1D) materials and realistic 2D materials. We find it is possible to routinely generate moiré band structures in 1D with desired electronic characteristics such as a bandgap of any value within a large range, even with few layers and materials (here, four and six, respectively). We argue that this tunability extends to 2D materials by showing the essential physical ingredients are already evident in calculations of two-layer MoS 2 and multi-layer graphene moiré assemblies.},

  abstract     = {Barium titanate materials displaying a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity are ubiquitously employed as thermistors in electrical current and voltage control systems, as well as in gas and thermal sensing applications. The positive temperature coefficient of resistivity effect is widely accepted to be a grain boundary-based phenomenon, although detailed studies on grain boundary structure and chemistry, and their influence on the resulting electrical properties, are seriously lacking. Tailoring of the positive temperature coefficient of resistivity electrical characteristics, for specific high-value applications, will require improved understanding and control over grain boundary phenomenon. A comprehensive overview of the development of barium titanate-based positive temperature coefficient of resistivity ceramics is initially presented. We then advance to a discussion on emerging grain boundary characterization techniques, specifically, a stereographic analysis of electron backscatter diffraction data that could assist in enhancing control over BaTiO 3 defect chemistry and microstructure, through characterization and subsequent manipulation of the population of grain boundary types. These techniques have great potential for increasing the understanding of the delicate interplay between processing conditions, chemistry, microstructure, and functional electrical properties, and are relevant to the development of advanced, high-performance ceramics and electroceramics in general. Contemporary advancements in the field, such as lead-free positive temperature coefficient of resistivity effect materials and multilayer miniaturized systems based on hypostoichiometric barium compositions, are reviewed. Finally, perspectives on future lines of thermistor research, with a focus on the energy sector, are presented including applications in gas separation and chemical sensing.},

The crucial next stage of development is to demonstrate suitable pathways for scale-up that allow patterned arrays of donor qubits to be controllably coupled and that are robust against the inherent donor placement tolerances and material processing constraints that exist. Here, we review progress on the fabrication and measurement of donor-based qubits in silicon via the ion implantation pathway and discuss the key developmental milestones that have been achieved.

Common clinical and nonclinical diagnostic testing methods have been partially effective in satisfying the increasing demand for fast detection point-of-care (POC) methods to slow down further spread. However, accurate point-of-risk diagnosis of this emerging viral infection is paramount as the need for simultaneous standard operating procedures and symptom management of SARS-CoV-2 will be the norm for years to come.

Optical biosensors can provide a noninvasive, extremely sensitive rapid detection platform with sensitivity down to ∼67 fg/ml (1 fM) concentration in a few minutes. These biosensors can be manufactured on a mass scale (millions) to detect the COVID-19 viral load in nasal, saliva, urine, and serological samples, even if the infected person is asymptotic. Methods investigated here are the most advanced available platforms for biosensing optical devices that have resulted from the integration of state-of-the-art designs and materials. These approaches include, but are not limited to, integrated optical devices, plasmonic resonance, and emerging nanomaterial biosensors.

Thus, university facilities and independent research groups often find it difficult, if not impossible, to equip themselves with such machinery. In this Review, we analyze affordable alternatives to commercial bioprinters, which are presented by the Do-it-Yourself (DiY) community. First, we discuss the current state of these low-cost technologies, and the advances made to bridge the divergence between marketed bioprinters and DiY devices. Afterwards, the different bioprinting technologies that are most commonplace for these low-cost devices are examined. Additionally, an overview of the pioneering DiY bioprinters takes place, as well as the open-source software alternatives to control these bioprinters. Next, we analyze the different factors to take into consideration during the bioprinting workflow, such as bioinks, computer-aided models, and bioprinting parameters.

The increasing maturity of simulation and modeling methods sparks the desire to leverage these techniques to rapidly improve and develop technology through digital engineering and multi-scale, electro-thermal models. With that vision in mind, this review attempts to build a holistic understanding of thermal transport by focusing on the often unaddressed relationships between subfields, which can be critical for multi-scale modeling approaches. For example, we outline the relationship between mode-specific (computational) and spectral (analytical) models. We relate thermal boundary resistance models based on perturbation approaches and classic transmissivity based models. We discuss the relationship between lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics approaches along with two-channel transport frameworks that have emerged recently and that connect crystal-like and amorphous-like heat conduction. Throughout, we discuss best practices for modeling experimental data and outline how these models can guide material-level and system-level design.},

  abstract     = {Computational materials discovery has been successful in predicting novel, technologically relevant materials. However, it has remained focused almost exclusively on finding ground-state structures. Now that the lower-hanging fruit has been found in many fields of application, materials exploration is moving toward metastable materials: higher energy phases that are stable at practical time scales. Because of the challenges associated with predicting which phases are realistic, this class of materials has remained relatively unexplored, despite numerous examples of metastable structures with unmatched properties (e.g., diamond). This article highlights recent advances in developing computational and theoretical methods for predicting useful and realizable metastable materials. Topics discussed cover (1) the latest strategies for identifying potential metastable phases, (2) methodologies for assessing which phases can be realized experimentally, and (3) current approaches to estimate the lifetime of metastable materials.},

  abstract     = {All-optical spatial frequency filtering has a long history with many applications now commonly replaced with digital alternatives. Although optical approaches are attractive in that they minimize energy requirements and images can be manipulated in real time, they are relatively bulky compared to the compact electronic devices that are now ubiquitous. With emerging interest in nanophotonic approaches to all-optical information processing, these approaches to enhancing images and performing phase visualization are attracting significant interest. Metasurfaces have been demonstrated as tailored alternatives to conventional spatial filters, but utilizing the spatial frequency sensitivity of these and thin film devices also has the potential to form the basis for ultracompact approaches to image processing. There are, however, significant challenges remaining to realize this promise. This review summarizes the current status of research in this rapidly growing field, places it in the context of the history of all-optical spatial filtering, and assesses prospects for future directions.},

  abstract     = {Efficient generation of spin–orbit torques is central for the exciting field of spin-orbitronics. Platinum, the archetypal spin Hall material, has the potential to be an outstanding provider for spin–orbit torques due to its giant spin Hall conductivity, low resistivity, high stabilities, and the ability to be compatible with CMOS circuits. However, pure clean-limit Pt with low resistivity still provides a low damping-like spin–orbit torque efficiency, which limits its practical applications. The efficiency of spin–orbit torque in Pt-based magnetic heterostructures can be improved considerably by increasing the spin Hall ratio of Pt and the spin transmissivity of the interfaces. Here we review recent advances in understanding the physics of spin current generation, interfacial spin transport, and the metrology of spin–orbit torques and summarize progress toward the goal of Pt-based spin–orbit torque memories and logic that are fast, efficient, reliable, scalable, and nonvolatile.},

They are a leading type of nonvolatile memory due to their very long endurance times and lack of reliability problems. Many semiconductor devices, such as the field effect transistor or nonvolatile memories, have undergone fundamental changes in materials design as dimensional scaling has progressed. Here, we consider how the future scaling of the MTJ dimensions might affect materials choices and compare the performance of different tunnel barriers, such as 2D materials like h-BN with the existing MgO tunnel barriers. We first summarize key features of MgO-based designs of STT-MRAM. We then describe general aspects of the deposition of 2D materials and h-BN on metals. We compare the band structures of MgO and h-BN with their band gaps corrected for the GGA band error. The different absorption sites of h-BN on Fe or Co are compared in terms of physisorbtive or chemisorbtive bonding sites and how this affects their spin-polarized bands and the transmission magneto-resistance (TMR). The transmission magneto-resistance is found to be highest for the physisorptive sites. We look at how these changes would affect the overall TMR and how scaling might progress.},

Low noise and wide tuning range are the two main important characteristics of an on-chip laser as the components required to achieve these characteristics constitute the bulk of current benchtop lasers. In this paper, we review the impact of silicon photonic chips on dramatically improving the tuning range and the noise characteristics. Two different types of technologies are reviewed— heterogeneous integration by wafer bonding and hybrid integration by butt-coupling.

The recent experimental discovery of 2D magnetic ordering in CrI 3 , Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 , VSe 2 , and Fe 3 GeTe 2 has stimulated intense research activities to expand the scope of 2D magnets. This review covers the essential progress on 2D magnets, with an emphasis on the current understanding of the magnetic exchange interaction, the databases of 2D magnets, and the modification strategies for modulation of magnetism. We will address a large number of 2D intrinsic magnetic materials, including binary transition metal halogenides; chalogenides; carbides; nitrides; oxides; borides; silicides; MXene; ternary transition metal compounds CrXTe 3 , MPX 3 , Fe-Ge-Te, MBi 2 Te 4 , and MXY (M = transition metal; X = O, S, Se, Te, N; Y = Cl, Br, I); f -state magnets; p -state magnets; and organic magnets. Their electronic structure, magnetic moment, Curie temperature, and magnetic anisotropy energy will be presented. According to the specific 2D magnets, the underlying direct, superexchange, double exchange, super-superexchange, extended superexchange, and multi-intermediate double exchange interactions will be described. In addition, we will also highlight the effective strategies to manipulate the interatomic exchange mechanism to improve the Curie temperature of 2D magnets, such as chemical functionalization, isoelectronic substitution, alloying, strain engineering, defect engineering, applying electronic/magnetic field, interlayer coupling, carrier doping, optical controlling, and intercalation. We hope this review will contribute to understanding the magnetic exchange interaction of existing 2D magnets, developing unprecedented 2D magnets with desired properties, and offering new perspectives in this rapidly expanding field.},

  abstract     = {The last two decades have witnessed tremendous progress in the development of microfluidic chips that generate micrometer- and nanometer-scale materials. These chips allow precise control over composition, structure, and particle uniformity not achievable using conventional methods. These microfluidic-generated materials have demonstrated enormous potential for applications in medicine, agriculture, food processing, acoustic, and optical meta-materials, and more. However, because the basis of these chips&#39; performance is their precise control of fluid flows at the micrometer scale, their operation is limited to the inherently low throughputs dictated by the physics of multiphasic flows in micro-channels. This limitation on throughput results in material production rates that are too low for most practical applications. In recent years, however, significant progress has been made to tackle this challenge by designing microchip architectures that incorporate multiple microfluidic devices onto single chips. These devices can be operated in parallel to increase throughput while retaining the benefits of microfluidic particle generation. In this review, we will highlight recent work in this area and share our perspective on the key unsolved challenges and opportunities in this field.},

  abstract     = {Graphene, a semi-metal with a gapless band structure, has been used in mid-infrared (MIR) photodetectors (PDs) for some time. However, these detectors often suffer from low responsivity due to the intrinsically low absorption and ultra-short carrier lifetime in graphene, large dark current, and low detectivity due to the semi-metallic nature of graphene. Over the past decade, much effort has been devoted to addressing these issues. A variety of metamaterials and related concepts has been employed to improve the detector responsivity by enhancing the graphene absorption and/or the carrier collection efficiency. Here, we provide an overview of the graphene MIR PDs with and without the use of approaches for responsivity enhancement. We focus our attention on the state-of-the-art graphene MIR PDs whose performance is improved by employing metamaterials and related concepts, including band structure engineering, the photogating effect, integration with plasmonic nanostructures and waveguides, the use of asymmetric plasmons, coupled plasmon–phonon polaritons, and small-twist-angle bilayer graphene. We conclude by providing possible directions for further performance improvement of graphene MIR PDs and a discussion on future applications of these detectors.},

  abstract     = {Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have attracted considerable attention as promising materials for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Intrinsic point defects play an important role in determining the performance of semiconductor devices. LHPs exhibit strong ionic character and unique electronic structure; thus, their defect properties are quite different from conventional covalent bond semiconductors. Understanding the defect science is crucial to the performance optimization of LHP-based devices. State-of-the-art first-principles calculation methods enable one to explore atomistic mechanisms of various defect-related processes, and tremendous efforts from theoretical simulations have provided invaluable insights to the defect physics and defect control of LHPs. In this review, we summarize recent progress, made with the help of theoretical modeling, on atomic-scale understanding about intrinsic point defects and related processes in LHPs. The fundamental properties of intrinsic point defects in LHPs are first introduced, including defect formation energy, charge transition level, and defect tolerance and its origin. A particular emphasis is given to the effects of band edge position on calculated defect properties. The impact of these defects on structural properties, carrier dynamics, and photoluminescence of LHPs is then presented. Advanced strategies to engineer the defects in LHPs are also reviewed, such as growth condition, defect passivation, and doping. Finally, we discuss open issues and outline directions toward a better understanding of defects of LHPs from a theoretical perspective. The goal of the review is to provide a comprehensive summary of atomic-scale understanding of intrinsic point defects in LHPs and to help further related research in the perovskite community.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have been widely used as energy storage devices in electric vehicles and other smart devices due to their excellent properties, such as high energy and power densities, long-term service life, and acceptable cost. The electrochemical performance of the materials in a lithium-ion battery system determines the performance of the battery, so it is essential that the electrochemical properties of these materials be improved. Atomic layer deposition is a versatile thin film coating technique for surface functionalization that can deposit a highly uniform thin film of nanoscale thickness on battery components, and it has been proven to improve the electrochemical performance of materials that operate in a lithium-ion battery system, such as rate capability, interface stability, and cycling life. This review paper focuses on recent advances of application of atomic layer deposition in lithium-ion batteries and summarizes the roles of such thin film coatings in improving the electrochemical performance of batteries. The present review summarizes and classifies the latest understanding of improvement mechanisms proposed by researchers according to different components in lithium-ion batteries, including cathodes, anodes, separators, and solid electrolytes. This review will not only help researchers in this field to comprehend the roles of atomic layer deposition thin film coating for improving the performance of various components in a battery system, but will also help them choose appropriate coating materials on battery components. In addition, we briefly discuss the limitations of atomic layer deposition in lithium-ion battery applications and the challenges that it faces in the future.},

Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent advancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to learn the underlying interactions of multiple elements as well as the relationships among multiple properties to facilitate property prediction in new composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical Correlation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that seamlessly integrates: (i) prediction using only a material&#39;s composition, (ii) learning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in multi-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential domains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for prediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69 three-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear composition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training data are available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the discovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results from the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property correlation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The best performance is obtained using H-CLMP with transfer learning [H-CLMP(T)] wherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of states data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical absorption from composition. H-CLMP(T) aggregates multiple knowledge sources with a framework that is well suited for multi-target regression across the physical sciences.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable alkaline zinc batteries are considered to be potential energy-storage systems owing to their natural abundance, low toxicity, and high capacity. However, their performance and efficiency are limited by the sluggish kinetics and irreversibility of the anode and cathode. In particular, high-capacity binary transition metal-based spinel materials that can store OH − anions are expected to replace commercial MnO cathodes owing to their abundant active sites of two or more transition metals. Herein, we report an ultrafast and reversible anion storage mechanism of spinel NiCo 2 O 4 nanoarchitectures decorated onto N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NCO@N-rGO) for high-performance rechargeable alkaline zinc full cells. The NCO@N-rGO electrode exhibits high specific and rate capacities of 191 mA h g −1 at 1000 mA g −1 and 151 mA h g −1 even at 20 000 mA g −1 , respectively, much higher than those of NCO@rGO and NCO. The as-designed cells achieve a record-high volumetric power density (7.20 W cm −3 ) among alkaline zinc full cells, along with a high energy density (14.93 mW h cm −3 ) and a capacity retention of 77\% over 3000 cycles at 6000 mA g −1 . These results are attributed to the facile charge-storage kinetics of the spinel framework, multiple Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ and Co 3+ /Co 2+ redox couples with OH − , and structural integrity of N-rGO as verified by electrochemical, ex situ XRD and XPS, and postmortem analyses. This work proposes a rational design of nanoarchitectured electrode materials for high volumetric performances and long-cycle life of rechargeable alkaline zinc batteries.},

  abstract     = {Phase retrieval, the problem of recovering lost phase information from measured intensity alone, is an inverse problem that is widely faced in various imaging modalities ranging from astronomy to nanoscale imaging. The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-CDI-NN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programing framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain, solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be “physics-aware” in multiple aspects; in that the physics of the X-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods. Our integrated machine learning and differential programing solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.},

  abstract     = {Generating and detecting radiation in the technologically relevant range of the so-called terahertz gap (0.1–10 THz) is challenging because of a lack of efficient sources and detectors. Quantum dots in carbon nanotubes have shown great potential to build sensitive terahertz detectors, usually based on photon-assisted tunneling. A recently reported mechanism combining resonant quantum dot transitions and tunneling barrier asymmetries results in a narrow linewidth photocurrent response with a large signal-to-noise ratio under weak THz radiation. That device was sensitive to one frequency, corresponding to transitions between equidistant quantized states. In this work we show, using numerical simulations together with scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies of a defect-induced metallic zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot, that breaking simultaneously various symmetries in metallic nanotube quantum dots of arbitrary chirality strongly relaxes the selection rules in the electric dipole approximation and removes energy degeneracies. This leads to a richer set of allowed optical transitions spanning frequencies from 1 THz to several tens of THz, for a ∼10 nm quantum dot. Based on these findings, we propose a terahertz detector device based on a metallic single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot defined by artificial defects. Depending on its length and contacts transparency, the operating regimes range from a high-resolution gate-tunable terahertz sensor to a broadband terahertz detector. Our calculations indicate that the device is largely unaffected by temperatures up to 100 K, making carbon nanotube quantum dots with broken symmetries a promising platform to design tunable terahertz detectors that could operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures.},

To induce the self-alignment of human muscle progenitor cells, in situ uniaxially aligned micro-topographical structure in the printed constructs is created by a fibrillation/leaching of poly(vinyl alcohol) after the printing process. The in vitro results demonstrate that the synergistic effect of tissue-specific biochemical signals (obtained from the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix-derived bioink) and topographical cues [obtained from the poly(vinyl alcohol) fibrillation] improves the myogenic differentiation of the printed human muscle progenitor cells with cellular alignment. Moreover, this self-aligned muscle construct shows the accelerated integration with neural networks and vascular ingrowth in vivo , resulting in rapid restoration of muscle function. We demonstrate that combined biochemical and topographic cues on the 3D bioprinted skeletal muscle constructs can effectively reconstruct the extensive muscle defect injuries.},

Thus far, incorporation of physiochemical cues with cell-size resolution in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds has proven to be a challenging strategy to direct the desired cellular organization. In this work, a rapid, simple, and cost-effective approach is developed for continuous printing of multicompartmental hydrogel fibers with intrinsic 3D microfilaments to control cellular orientation. A static mixer integrated into a coaxial microfluidic device is utilized to print alginate/gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel fibers with patterned internal microtopographies. In the engineered microstructure, GelMA compartments provide a cell-favorable environment, while alginate compartments offer morphological and mechanical cues that direct the cellular orientation. It is demonstrated that the organization of the microtopographies, and consequently the cellular alignment, can be tailored by controlling flow parameters in the printing process. Despite the large diameter of the fibers, the precisely tuned internal microtopographies induce excellent cell spreading and alignment, which facilitate rapid cell proliferation and differentiation toward mature biofabricated constructs. This strategy can advance the engineering of functional tissues.},

By providing a structured environment to promote osteogenesis, these materials offer a robust and minimally invasive means to fuse vertebrae. The present study describes the successful preparation of a biomimetic collagen/hydroxyapatite hierarchical scaffold, with each strut having several microchannels via 3D printing, leaching, and coating processes (i.e., one-way shape morphing, 4D printing). The biophysical properties of the scaffold were analyzed, as were its various cellular activities, using human adipose stem cells. This biomimetic microchannel scaffold demonstrated great potential for osteogenic activities in vitro and significantly increased new bone formation and ingrowth of blood vessels in vivo in a mouse model of posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion. These in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the microchannel collagen/hydroxyapatite scaffold could act as a potential bone graft substitute to promote high rates of successful fusion.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic skyrmions are considered a promising candidate for the next-generation information processing technology. Being topologically robust, magnetic skyrmions are swirling spin textures that can be used in a broad range of applications from memory devices and logic circuits to neuromorphic computing. In a magnetic medium lacking inversion symmetry, magnetic skyrmion arises as a result of the interplay among magnetic exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and magnetic anisotropy. Instrumental to the integrated skyrmion-based applications are the creation and manipulation of magnetic skyrmions at a designated location, absent any need of a magnetic field. In this paper, we propose a generic design strategy to achieve that goal and a model system to demonstrate its feasibility. By implementing a disk-shaped thin film heterostructure with an inhomogeneous perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, stable sub-100-nm size skyrmions can be generated without magnetic field. This structure can be etched out via, for example, focused ion beam microscope. Using micromagnetic simulation, we show that such heterostructure not only stabilizes the edge spins of the skyrmion but also protects its rotation symmetry. Furthermore, we may switch the spin texture between skyrmionic and vortex-like ones by tuning the slope of perpendicular anisotropy using a bias voltage. When embedded into a magnetic conductor and under a spin polarized current, such heterostructure emits skyrmions continuously and may function as a skyrmion source. This unique phenomenon is dubbed a skyrmion battery effect. Our proposal may open a novel venue for the realization of all-electric skyrmion-based devices.},

It has been shown that replacement of ∼50\% of carbon atoms in the most popular MXene family member, titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ), by nitrogen atoms, forming titanium carbonitride (Ti 3 CNT x ), leads to drastically different properties. Such properties include very high negative charge in solution and extreme EMI shielding effectiveness, exceeding all known materials, even metals at comparable thicknesses. Here, by using ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), the electronic structures of Ti 3 CNT x and Ti 3 C 2 T x are systematically investigated and compared as a function of charge carrier density. We observe that, in contrast to Ti 3 C 2 T x , the Ti 3 p core-level of Ti 3 CNT x exhibits a counterintuitive shift to a lower binding energy of up to ∼250 meV upon increasing the electron density, which is a spectroscopic signature of negative electronic compressibility (NEC). These experimentally measured chemical potential shifts are well captured by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The DFT results also further suggest that the hybridization of titanium–nitrogen bonding in Ti 3 CNT x helps to promote the available states of Ti atoms for receiving more electrons above the fermi level and leads to the observed NEC. Our findings explain the differences in electronic properties between the two very important and widely studied MXenes and also suggest a new strategy to apply the NEC effect of Ti 3 CNT x in energy and charge storage applications.},

Based on the reported synthesis and structural modulation methods, in this review, the experimental and computational advances in the electronic structure regulation strategies for SACs, including coordination adjustment, electronic metal-support interaction, oxidation state modulation, and strain engineering, will be summarized. Then, the effects of electronic structures on the adsorption behaviors and, thus, the electrocatalytic activities of water splitting and O 2 /CO 2 reduction reactions will be emphatically exemplified and discussed. In the end, a brief conclusion of this paper and the existing challenges and future opportunities in this research direction will be proposed. This review aims to highlight the understanding of electronic structure in association to the electrocatalytic activity for SACs and provide guidance for their further development in electrochemical applications.},

  abstract     = {Solar-driven water splitting is an efficient process for converting solar energy into chemical energy. In this process, semiconductor materials are excited by solar energy to generate free electrons to participate in the water-splitting reaction. Among these semiconductor materials, inorganic perovskite oxides have a spatial structure that is easy to control and thereby lead to different energy band structures and photocatalytic properties. More importantly, perovskite oxides can be compounded with other organic/inorganic materials to promote charge separation and improve apparent quantum yield. However, the low solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency has not yet reached the requirements of practical applications. In this review, the fundamental principles of solar-driven water splitting based on perovskite materials are introduced according to the most recently published results. In addition, the innovative modification techniques for water splitting based on perovskite oxides have been summarized, focusing on the following methods: element doping, homo/heterojunction formation, Z-scheme, plasmon effect, dye sensitization, carbon enhancement, and surface modifications. Note that the applications in the visible light wavelength range have been described, with emphasis among all these modification materials. Furthermore, the recent water-splitting reaction systems for practical applications are briefly discussed. As a summary, we outline the challenges and potential utilization associated with visible light–driven water splitting based on perovskite oxides for future commercial applications. This review describes various modification methods to improve photochemical performance of perovskite oxides as well as illustrates the potential to employ perovskite oxides as a key material for the practical application of water splitting.},

Printed FSC has provided an economical and simple solution for the fabrication of FSCs different from the traditional manufacturing methods. The successful preparation of printed FSCs mainly depends on the formulating of functional inks and designing of innovative electrode materials. Here, we reviewed the recent development of the ink&#39;s formulation principle, printable electrode materials, and integrated application of FSCs devices. The inks with excellent rheological properties, acquired by tuning the components (including binders, additives and solvents), are first introduced to match different printing techniques. The design of printable electrode materials is also highlighted, focusing on electrical double-layer capacitive carbons, pseudocapacitive materials (metal oxides, conducting polymer, etc.), and the newly emerging materials (MXenes, etc.). We concluded that 3D printing and new printable electrode materials will be key in successfully designing next-generation printed FSC with high energy and high power, and thus offer general guidelines to its integrated applications.},

  abstract     = {The variegated family of two-dimensional (2D) crystals has developed rapidly since the isolation of its forerunner: Graphene. Their plane-confined nature is typically associated with exceptional and peculiar electronic, optical, magnetic, and mechanical properties, heightening the interest of fundamental science and showing promise for applications. Methods for tuning their properties on demand have been pursued, among which the application of mechanical stresses, allowed by the incredible mechanical robustness and flexibility of these atomically thin materials. Great experimental and theoretical efforts have been focused on the development of straining protocols and on the evaluation of their impact on the peculiar properties of 2D crystals, revealing a novel, alluring physics. The relevance held by strain for 2D materials is introduced in Sec. I. Sections II and III present the multiplicity of methods developed to induce strain, highlighting the peculiarities, effectiveness, and drawbacks of each technique. Strain has largely widened the 2D material phase space in a quasi-seamless manner, leading to new and rich scenarios, which are discussed in Secs. IV–VI of this work. The effects of strain on the electronic, optical, vibrational, and mechanical properties of 2D crystals are discussed, as well as the possibility to exploit strain gradients for single-photon emission, non-linear optics, or valley/spintronics. Quantitative surveys of the relevant parameters governing these phenomena are provided. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview of the straining methods and strain-induced effects, and to shed light on possible future paths. The aims and developments, the tools and strategies, and the achievements and challenges of this research field are widely presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Fluids confined in nanopores are ubiquitous in nature and technology. In recent years, the interest in confined fluids has grown, driven by research on unconventional hydrocarbon resources—shale gas and shale oil, much of which are confined in nanopores. When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their properties differ from those of the same fluid in the bulk. These properties include density, freezing point, transport coefficients, thermal expansion coefficient, and elastic properties. The elastic moduli of a fluid confined in the pores contribute to the overall elasticity of the fluid-saturated porous medium and determine the speed at which elastic waves traverse through the medium. Wave propagation in fluid-saturated porous media is pivotal for geophysics, as elastic waves are used for characterization of formations and rock samples. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of experimental works on wave propagation in fluid-saturated nanoporous media, as well as theoretical works focused on calculation of compressibility of fluids in confinement. We discuss models that bridge the gap between experiments and theory, revealing a number of open questions that are both fundamental and applied in nature. While some results were demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically (e.g., the pressure dependence of compressibility of fluids), others were theoretically predicted, but not verified in experiments (e.g., linear scaling of modulus with the pore size). Therefore, there is a demand for the combined experimental-modeling studies on porous samples with various characteristic pore sizes. The extension of molecular simulation studies from simple model fluids to the more complex molecular fluids is another open area of practical interest.},

These atom arrangements contrast with the stacking of conventional oxide ferroelectrics, enabling unprecedented ferroelectric physics in terms of polarization origin, polar stabilization, and switching kinetics. Combined with other inherent optical and electrical features, the vdW ferroelectrics can undoubtedly provide a new, versatile platform for advancing fundamental physics and revolutionizing device technology. In this review, we summarize the unique ferroelectric properties in experimentally confirmed vdW ferroelectrics, particularly those properties that expand our understanding of ferroelectric switching. We also elucidate how some of these properties can intrinsically reduce depolarized instability at the atomic limit. Finally, we discuss innovative devices enabled by distinct properties of vdW ferroelectrics for electronic, optoelectronic, and energy-harvesting applications, and highlight possible future research lines.},

Application of light in the form of photodynamic action on microorganisms and viruses has been growing and is now successfully applied in several areas. The efficacy of this approach has been demonstrated in the fight against viruses, prompting additional efforts to advance the technique, including safety use protocols.

The method was used to understand fundamental processes of negative hydrogen (H − ) ion formation and destruction in hydrogen plasmas. Species composition and plasma parameters in H − ion sources can be estimated from optical emission spectroscopy data, while electrostatic probes are utilized to obtain local plasma parameters in the ion source. Plasma transport toward the extractor is studied by combining a laser beam for photodetachment and a structured electrostatic probe to visualize a flow pattern of H − ions. Spatial distributions of large-area H − ion beams are monitored by infrared thermography images, showing interactions among multiple beamlets. These diagnostic methods deepen the understanding of how H − ions are produced and extracted through beam-forming apertures. The acquired knowledge on ion source plasma and beam transport improves the ion source design of the next-generation H − ion sources for fusion experiments and accelerators.

  abstract     = {All multicellular organisms embed endogenous circadian oscillators or clocks that rhythmically regulate a wide variety of processes in response to daily environmental cycles. Previous molecular studies using rhythmic mutants for several model systems have identified a set of genes responsible for rhythmic activities and illustrated the molecular mechanisms underlying how disruptions in circadian rhythms are associated with the sort of aberrant cell cycling. However, the wide use of these forward genetic studies is impaired by a limited number of mutations that can be identified or induced only in a single genome, limiting the identification of many other conserved or non-conserved clock genes. Genetic linkage or association mapping provides an unprecedented glimpse into the genome-wide scanning and characterization of genes underlying circadian rhythms. The implementation of sophisticated statistical models into genetic mapping studies can not only identify key clock genes or clock quantitative trait loci (cQTL) but also, more importantly, reveal a complete atlas of the genetic control mechanisms constituted by gene interactomes. Here, we introduce and review an advanced statistical mechanics framework for coalescing all possible clock genes into intricate but well-organized interaction networks that regulate rhythmic cycles. The application of this framework to widely available mapping populations will reshape and further our understanding of the genetic signatures behind circadian rhythms for an enlarged range of species including microbes, plants, and humans.},

Fluorite-structured ferroelectrics are considered to be promising for semiconductor devices because of their compatibility with the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology and scalability for highly dense information storage. The research on fluorite-structured ferroelectrics during the first decade of their conceptualization has been mainly focused on elucidating the origin of their ferroelectricity and improving the performance of electronic devices based on such ferroelectrics. Furthermore, as is known, to achieve optimal performance, the emerging biomimicking electronic devices as well as conventional semiconductor devices based on the classical von Neumann architecture require high operating speed, sufficient reliability, and multilevel data storage. Nanoscale electronic devices with fluorite-structured ferroelectrics serve as candidates for these device systems and, thus, have been intensively studied primarily because in ferroelectric materials the switching speed, reliability, and multilevel polarizability are known to be strongly correlated with the domains and domain dynamics. Although there have been important theoretical and experimental studies related to domains and domain dynamics in fluorite-structured ferroelectrics, they are yet to be comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, to provide a strong foundation for research in this field, herein, domains, domain dynamics, and emerging applications, particularly in neuromorphic computing, of fluorite-structured ferroelectrics are comprehensively reviewed based on the existing literature.},

Properties not available from graphite include bending stiffness; this can be determined from studies of carbon nanotubes as well as graphene. In many ways, nanotubes provide access to fundamental properties of graphene, not least because they are the only form of graphene that can be unsupported (unstrained) in vacuum. Environmental effects are considered, including both interactions with substrates and with other solid and liquid media, which may affect the geometrical parameters defining graphene and associated elastic constants. Major uncertainties persist whether slipping or sticking dominates experimental observation, both between graphene and solid media, and between the layers of bilayer and multilayer graphene.

  abstract     = {In optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors, a portion of electron-hole pairs is generated as so-called hot carriers with an excess kinetic energy that is typically lost as heat. The long-standing aim to harvest this excess energy to enhance device performance has proven to be very challenging, largely due to the extremely short-lived nature of hot carriers. Efforts thus focus on increasing the hot carrier relaxation time and on tailoring heterostructures that allow for hot-carrier extraction on short time and length scales. Recently, semiconductor nanowires have emerged as a promising system to achieve these aims, because they offer unique opportunities for heterostructure engineering as well as for potentially modified phononic properties that can lead to increased relaxation times. In this review we assess the current state of theory and experiments relating to hot-carrier dynamics in nanowires, with a focus on hot-carrier photovoltaics. To provide a foundation, we begin with a brief overview of the fundamental processes involved in hot-carrier relaxation and how these can be tailored and characterized in nanowires. We then analyze the advantages offered by nanowires as a system for hot-carrier devices and review the status of proof-of-principle experiments related to hot-carrier photovoltaics. To help interpret existing experiments on photocurrent extraction in nanowires we provide modeling based on non-equilibrium Green&#39;s functions. Finally, we identify open research questions that need to be answered in order to fully evaluate the potential nanowires offer toward achieving more efficient, hot-carrier based, optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {As Moore&#39;s law is gradually losing its effectiveness, the development of alternative high-speed and low-energy–consuming information technology with postsilicon-advanced materials is urgently needed. The successful application of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has given rise to a tremendous economic impact on magnetic informatics, including magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), radiofrequency sensors, microwave generators, and neuromorphic computing networks. The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials brings opportunities for MTJs based on 2D materials, which have many attractive characteristics and advantages. In particular, the recently discovered intrinsic 2D ferromagnetic materials with high spin polarization hold the promise for next-generation nanoscale MTJs. Various 2D materials, such as semimetallic graphene, insulating h-BN, semiconducting MoS 2 , magnetic semiconducting CrI 3 , magnetic metallic Fe 3 GeTe 2 , and some other recently emerged 2D materials, are discussed as the electrodes and/or central scattering materials of MTJs in this review. We discuss the fundamental and main issues facing MTJs; review the current progress made with 2D MTJs; briefly comment on work with some specific 2D materials and highlight how they address the current challenges in MTJs; and, finally, offer an outlook and perspective of 2D MTJs.},

  abstract     = {Calcium fluoride is a dielectric material with a wide bandgap (∼12.1 eV) and a relatively high dielectric constant (∼6.8) that forms a van der Waals interface with two-dimensional (2D) materials, meaning that it contains a very low amount of defects. Thin calcium fluoride films can be synthesized using multiple techniques that are scalable to the wafer level, including molecular beam epitaxy, atomic layer deposition, and chemical vapor deposition. However, the consolidation of calcium fluoride as dielectric for 2D electronics requires overcoming some fundamental challenges related to material quality and integration, as well as carrying out advanced characterization and computational studies to evaluate its real potential. Here, we review the status of calcium fluoride dielectric films in terms of material synthesis, fundamental electrical properties, and future applications; we also discuss the most important challenges of calcium fluoride integration in 2D materials–based, solid-state nano/micro-electronic devices, and propose several potential routes to overcome them. Our manuscript may serve as a useful guide for other scientists working on 2D electronics in general, and provides a clear pathway for calcium fluoride research in the future.},

Recent studies have exploited the nature of 2-dimensional layered materials (2DLMs) to integrate highly disparate materials with unique physical and chemical properties without the constraint of lattice matching and have demonstrated novel memory devices (such as resistive and magnetic) with unprecedented characteristics or unique functionalities desired in emerging memory technologies. This article primarily provides an overview of the progress made, advantages, and challenges toward practical application of 2DLM-based memory units. In this regard, novel electronic properties of these 2DLMs allow designing not only the memory unit but also selectors and CMOS components essential for RRAM technology. Here, we also experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-concept heterostructure consisting of 2DLMs that fulfill the function of a memory unit (using MoTe 2 ) and selector (using WSe 2 ) with desired characteristics for RRAM integration. This demonstration underscores the potential of 2DLMs and their heterostructure toward the realization of future memory technologies.},

  abstract     = {Progress made by materials scientists in recent years has greatly helped the field of ultra-precision manufacturing. Ranging from healthcare to electronics components, phenomena such as twinning, dislocation nucleation, and high-pressure phase transformation have helped to exploit plasticity across a wide range of metallic and semiconductor materials. One current problem at the forefront of the healthcare sector that can benefit from these advances is that of bacterial infections in implanted prosthetic devices. The treatment of implant infections is often complicated by the growth of bacterial biofilms on implant surfaces, which form a barrier that effectively protects the infecting organisms from host immune defenses and exogenous antibiotics. Further surgery is usually required to disrupt the biofilm, or to remove the implant altogether to permit antibiotics to clear the infection, incurring considerable cost and healthcare burdens. In this review, we focus on elucidating aspects of bactericidal surfaces inspired by the biological world to inform the design of implant surface treatments that will suppress bacterial colonization. Alongside manufacturing and materials related challenges, the review identifies the most promising natural bactericidal surfaces and provides representative models of their structure, highlighting the importance of the critical slope presented by these surfaces. The scalable production of these complex hierarchical structures on freeform metallic implant surfaces has remained a scientific challenge to date and, as identified by this review, is one of the many 21 st -century puzzles to be addressed by the field of applied physics.},

Within several years of scientific discoveries focused on 2D magnets, novel opportunities have opened up in the field of spintronics, namely spin pumping devices, spin transfer torque, and tunneling. In this review, we describe the state of the art of the nascent field of magnetic two-dimensional materials focusing on synthesis, engineering, and theory aspects.

For a wide variety of compounds, the majority of studies are limited by observations at fixed temperature and composition, in which case, relevant information can be determined only from the behaviors at topological and structural defects. All analyses to date utilize macroscopic descriptors derived from structural information such as polarization or octahedral tilts extracted from the atomic positions, ignoring the multiple degrees of freedom observable from atomically resolved images. In this article, we provide a solution, by exploring the mechanisms of a phase transition between the trigonal prismatic and distorted octahedral phases of layered chalcogenides in the 2D MoS 2 –ReS 2 system from the observations of local degrees of freedom, namely atomic positions by scanning transmission electron microscopy. We employ local crystallographic analysis based on statistical learning of atomic environments to build a picture of the transition from the atomic level up and determine local and global variables controlling the local symmetry breaking. We highlight how the dependence of the average symmetry-breaking distortion amplitude on global and local concentration can be used to separate local chemical as well as global electronic effects on the transition. This approach allows for the exploring of atomic mechanisms beyond the traditional macroscopic descriptions, utilizing the imaging of compositional fluctuations in solids to explore phase transitions over a range of observed local stoichiometries and atomic configurations.},

We describe recent work in attosecond technology and investigations into materials such as Si, SiO 2 , GaN, Al 2 O 3 , Ti, and TiO 2 , enabled by the convergence of these two capabilities. We showcase the state-of-the-art on isolated attosecond soft x-ray pulses for x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy to observe the 3d-state dynamics of the semi-metal TiS 2 with attosecond resolution at the Ti L-edge (460 eV). We describe how the element- and state-specificity at the transition metal L-edge of the quantum material allows us to unambiguously identify how and where the optical field influences charge carriers. This precision elucidates that the Ti:3d conduction band states are efficiently photo-doped to a density of 1.9 × 10 21 cm −3 . The light-field induces coherent motion of intra-band carriers across 38\% of the first Brillouin zone. Lastly, we describe the prospects with such unambiguous real-time observation of carrier dynamics in specific bonding or anti-bonding states and speculate that such capability will bring unprecedented opportunities toward an engineered approach for designer materials with pre-defined properties and efficiency. Examples are composites of semiconductors and insulators like Si, Ge, SiO 2 , GaN, BN, and quantum materials like graphene, transition metal dichalcogens, or high-Tc superconductors like NbN or LaBaCuO. Exiting are prospects to scrutinize canonical questions in multi-body physics, such as whether the electrons or lattice trigger phase transitions.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite oxides are of particular interest for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their high intrinsic activity. However, low surface area and nonpores in bulk phase generally limit the mass transport and thereby result in unsatisfactory mass activity. Herein, we propose a “molecular-level strategy” with the simultaneous modulation of the ordered pores on the oxygen-deficient sites along with sulfur (S) substitution on oxygen sites at the molecular level to boost the mass transport behavior of perovskite electrocatalyst for enhanced mass activity. As a proof of concept, the elaborately designed brownmillerite oxide Sr 2 Co 1.6 Fe 0.4 O 4.8 S 0.2 (S-BM-SCF) shows approximately fourfold mass activity enhancement in 1 M KOH compared with the pristine SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3- δ (SCF) perovskite. Comprehensive experimental results, in combination with theoretical calculations, demonstrate that the intrinsic molecular-level pores in the brownmillerite structure can facilitate reactive hydroxyl ion (OH − ) uptake into the oxygen-vacant sites and that S doping further promotes OH − adsorption by electronic structure modulation, thus accelerating mass transport rate. Meanwhile, the S-BM-SCF can significantly weaken the resistance of O 2 desorption on the catalyst surface, facilitating the O 2 evolution. This work deepens the understanding of how mass transport impacts the kinetics of the OER process and opens up a new avenue to design high-performance catalysts on the molecular level.},

  abstract     = {Switchable chemotaxis is vital for motile microorganisms seeking benefits or to avoid harm. Inspired by nature, and for the first time, we demonstrate an artificial enzyme-powered micromotor that can autonomously regulate the propulsion mechanism, as well as motion directionality, by solely sensing the change of fuel concentration ( C f ) in its surroundings. The as-designed micromotors have a pot-like microstructure with ureases immobilized on the inner surface. With the confined effect of the pot-like microstructure and unique features of the urease catalytic reaction, the molecular products are further reacted into ions, and their propulsion mechanism can be reversibly adjusted between ionic diffusiophoresis and microbubble recoils when C f changes. Consequently, the as-developed micromotors under magnetic field are able to self-turn back if the local C f differs greatly in their surroundings, indicating the achievement of positive and negative chemotaxis by sensing local C f . Meanwhile, the micromotors also show highly enhanced migration speed by microbubble ejection, up to 60 μm/s, around 30 body lengths per second at physiological urea concentrations. Furthermore, they have an outer surface of mesoporous silica which is easily functionalized for applications such as stimuli-responsive delivery-associated therapies.

  abstract     = {Despite considerable interest in textile-based battery electrodes with large surface areas and mechanical flexibility, issues have restricted further advances in the energy performance of textile electrodes. These issues include the ineffective incorporation of conductive and/or active components into textile frameworks, the poor charge transfer between energy materials, and the formation of numerous unstable interfaces within textile electrodes. Herein, we introduce an aluminum textile-based lithium-ion battery cathode with remarkable areal capacity, high rate performance, and good cycling stability. Ligand exchange reaction-induced layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of metal nanoparticles and small molecule linkers, with subsequent metal electroplating, perfectly converted polyester textiles to 3D-porous aluminum textiles that can be used as current collectors and high-energy reservoirs. The consecutive LbL assembly of high-energy LiFePO 4 and conductive indium tin oxide nanoparticles onto the aluminum textiles using small organic linkers significantly increased the areal capacity and cycling stability (at least 580 cycles) of the resultant cathode, allowing facile charge transfer within the textile electrodes. Furthermore, the areal capacity of these textile electrodes increased from 1.07 to 3.28 mA h cm −2 , with an increase in the folding number from 0 to 2.},

  abstract     = {Changes in the arrangement of atoms in matter, known as structural phase transitions or phase changes, offer a remarkable range of opportunities in photonics. They are exploited in optical data storage and laser-based manufacturing, and have been explored as underpinning mechanisms for controlling laser dynamics, optical and plasmonic modulation, and low-energy switching in single nanoparticle devices and metamaterials. Comprehensive modeling of phase-change processes in photonics is, however, extremely challenging as it involves a number of entangled processes including atomic/molecular structural change, domain and crystallization dynamics, change of optical properties in inhomogeneous composite media, and the transport and dissipation of heat and light, which happen on time and length scales spanning several orders of magnitude. Here, for the first time, we show that the description of such complex nonlinear optical processes in phase-change materials can be reduced to a cellular automata model. Using the important example of a polymorphic gallium film, we show that a cellular model based on only a few independent and physically-interpretable parameters can reproduce the experimentally measured behaviors of gallium all-optical switches over a wide range of optical excitation regimes. The cellular automata methodology has considerable heuristic value for the study of complex nonlinear optical processes without the need to understand details of atomic dynamics, band structure, and energy conservation at the nanoscale.},

  abstract     = {The predictability of a certain effect or phenomenon is often equated with the knowledge of relevant physical laws, typically understood as a functional or numerically derived relationship between the observations and known states of the system. Correspondingly, observations inconsistent with prior knowledge can be used to derive new knowledge on the nature of the system or indicate the presence of yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we explore the applicability of Gaussian processes (GP) to establish predictability and uncertainty of local behaviors from multimodal observations, providing an alternative to this classical paradigm. Using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of multiferroic Sm-doped BiFeO 3 across a broad composition range, we directly visualize the atomic structure and structural, physical, and chemical order parameter fields for the material. GP regression is used to establish the predictability of the local polarization field from different groups of parameters, including the adjacent polarization values and several combinations of physical and chemical descriptors, including lattice parameters, column intensities, etc. We observe that certain elements of microstructure, including charged and uncharged domain walls and interfaces with the substrate, are best predicted with specific combinations of descriptors, and this predictability and associated uncertainties are consistent across the composition series. The associated generative physical mechanisms are discussed. It is also found that certain parameter combinations tend to predict the orthorhombic phase in the cases where rhombohedral phase is observed, suggesting a potential role of clamping and confinement phenomena in phase equilibrium in Sm-BiFeO 3 system close to morphotropic phase boundary. We argue that predictability and uncertainty in observational data offer a new pathway to probe the physics of condensed matter systems from multimodal local observations.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been widely investigated due to limited lithium resources. Though sodium and lithium elements have similar physical and chemical properties, some decently performing anodes of lithium ion batteries are problematic in SIBs. Hence, it is of great importance to develop suitable anodes for SIBs. In recent works, doped amorphous carbon has been considered a prospective and serviceable anode for the storage of sodium. Nevertheless, there is no commonly accepted explanation for the sodium storage mechanism and doping effect of doped carbon to explain why doping can improve the sodium-storage performance in SIBs. In this study, sodium-storage behavior in electron-rich, element-modified, amorphous carbon is addressed, considering N and P. The affinity of N-doped amorphous carbon is identified by calculating the electron distributions of the N-doped structures. Furthermore, the adsorption energies of sodium in the P-doped amorphous carbon systems are analyzed to elucidate the storage behavior of doping. From the above analysis, the internal structure of co-doped carbon is characterized and pyrrolic N and P-O structures reveal excellent sodium-storage performance. Consequently, hydrothermal treatment is designed to build the precursor of the required P-O structure. Based on the sodium-storage theory, a carbon anode doped with dual electron-rich elements is synthesized successfully, which shows enhanced electrochemical performances in terms of cycle life and capacity in batteries. As a result, these research results fill the theoretical gap of the sodium-storage behavior of electron-rich, element-doped, amorphous carbon and provide the experimental basis for its application.},

  abstract     = {The emerging internet of things requires autonomous and ubiquitous on-chip devices with wireless interconnectivity. On-chip power is required to meet the miniaturization requirement, and an integrated on-chip micro-supercapacitor has enormous potential to meet this requirement owing to its high-power density and long cycle life. However, the two-dimensional expansion of the current co-planer design paradigm of micro-supercapacitors, such as the interdigital layout, hinders the on-chip integration density, resulting in a significant consumption of precious chip footprint and an insufficient energy density. This article reports on the use of a three-dimensional framework along with a hybrid printing strategy to fabricate devices entirely without any post-processing, and highly integrated three-dimensional micro-supercapacitors were printed as proof of concept. The micro-supercapacitors exhibit more than 25 times areal capacitance than the interdigital ones (76 mF/cm 2 vs 2.9 mF/cm 2 ) due to their three-dimensional feature. Moreover, it can provide new functions to achieve adjustable voltage and capacitance flexibility within one device&#39;s footprint area. This approach can also enable devices on different substrates. An ultraviolet sensor was integrated with and powered by the three-dimensional micro-supercapacitors on polyimide to demonstrate the compact on-chip application. The three-dimensional framework offers a general solution to the on-chip integration challenges of micro-supercapacitors. Moreover, it can be extended to new materials or even other electronics units, highlighting the promise of further miniaturized and powerful micro-electronics.},

  abstract     = {Quasi two-dimensional halide perovskites (also known as Ruddlesden-Popper or RPs) are the most recent and exciting evolution in the perovskite field. Possessing a unique combination of enhanced moisture and material stability, whilst retaining the excellent optoelectronic properties, RPs are poised to be a game changer in the perovskite field. Spurred by their recent achievements in solar cells, light-emitting diodes and spintronic devices, these materials have garnered a mounting interest. Herein, we critically review the photophysics of RPs and distill the science behind their structure–property relations. We first focus on their structure and morphology by highlighting the crucial role of large cations: dictating the RPs&#39; layered structure and the statistical distribution of thicknesses (i.e., n -phases). Next, we discuss how optoelectronic properties of RPs differ from conventional halide perovskites. Structural disorder, stronger excitonic, and polaronic interaction shape the nature of photo-excitations and their fate. For example, faster recombinations and hindered transport are expected for charge carriers in thinner n -phases. However, the complex energetic landscape of RPs, which originates from the coexistence of different n -phases, allows for funneling of energy and charges. Presently, the photophysics of RPs is still nascent, with many recent exciting discoveries from coherence effects in the above-mentioned funneling cascade to spin effects. Giant Rashba spin–orbit coupling, also observed in RPs, dictates their spin dynamics and provides exciting spintronics opportunities. To leverage these propitious RPs, future research must entail a cross-disciplinary approach. While materials engineering will unlock new chiral RPs and Dion-Jacobson variants, novel characterization techniques such as in situ synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction, ultrafast electron microscopy, and multidimensional electronic spectroscopy, etc., are essential in unraveling their secrets and unleashing their full potential.},

The physicochemical characteristics of bubbles such as large specific surface area, low density, and hydrophobicity make them an ideal platform for developing colloidal and interfacial technologies. Over the past few decades, much effort has been devoted to investigating the properties and behaviors of bubbles and their applications. A series of bubble-based technologies (BBTs) have been developed, which have attracted increasing attention and shown great importance in a wide range of engineering, material, and biological fields. These BBTs, such as bubble flotation and the bubble-liposome system, provide feasible and promising solutions to mineral separation, material assembling, medical diagnosis, and drug delivery. In this work, we have systematically reviewed the physicochemical characteristics of bubbles and how to modulate their behaviors in complex fluid systems, as well as the underlying fundamental interaction mechanisms of bubbles in related BBTs. Advanced nanomechanical techniques such as atomic force microscopy, which are used to quantify the interaction mechanisms in bubble-containing systems, have been introduced. The effects of various influential factors on the bubble behaviors are discussed, which provide potential approaches to improve the controllability and performance of BBTs. The recent advances in the applications of selected BBTs in engineering, biomedical, and material areas are presented. Some remaining challenging issues and perspectives for future studies have also been discussed. This review improves the fundamental understanding of characteristics and surface interaction mechanisms of bubbles, with useful implications for developing advanced BBTs.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this review is to elucidate the potential of chemically exfoliated sheets for the field of quantum matter. Quantum materials are loosely defined as materials that do not follow the laws of classical physics; the family commonly includes complex magnets, topological materials, or superconductors. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been key in driving the field of quantum matter forward due to the high degree of tunability they offer. However, progress has largely been made with mechanically exfoliated sheets while chemically exfoliated sheets have been mostly ignored. The latter offer a wide range of advantages, for example, chemical exfoliation gives access to 2D materials that are unobtainable with other methods. In this review, we highlight the progress that has been made in exploring properties that can be associated with quantum materials of chemically exfoliated nanosheets. We will cover magnetic chemically exfoliated sheets, their use in transistors, their potential as 2D topological insulators, and opportunities that arise for the emerging field of twistronics . We will highlight both the advantages and current shortcomings of chemically exfoliated quantum materials and address how shortcomings might be overcome in the future. We conclude that while the prospects of chemically exfoliated sheets for quantum materials are still underexplored, they offer a large potential for having an impact in that field.},

  abstract     = {The adsorption of chemical species on the surface of graphene alters the concentration of charge carries by either increasing or decreasing it depending on the nature of the adsorbed chemical species and inducing noticeable changes in the material&#39;s electronic properties. This remarkable feature enables graphene-based sensors to detect a wide range of biomolecules, chemicals, and gas/vapors. A lot of progress has been made in this field and technologies based on reduced graphene oxide flakes have been well reviewed. Graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition has proven to be the most prominent route to large-scale production of devices. However, until now, a comprehensive review on scalable, macro-sized, chemical vapor-deposited, graphene-based field-effect transistor sensors was missing. Here we review the present status, current challenges, and future prospects for the bio/chemical sensing applications of scalable, chemical vapor-deposited, graphene field-effect transistors. We explain and examine the fabrication techniques, sensing mechanisms, and various assay strategies. We also discuss the sensing performance of graphene based on quantum mechanics simulations and theoretical calculations.},

  abstract     = {Video microscopy has a long history of providing insight and breakthroughs for a broad range of disciplines, from physics to biology. Image analysis to extract quantitative information from video microscopy data has traditionally relied on algorithmic approaches, which are often difficult to implement, time-consuming, and computationally expensive. Recently, alternative data-driven approaches using deep learning have greatly improved quantitative digital microscopy, potentially offering automatized, accurate, and fast image analysis. However, the combination of deep learning and video microscopy remains underutilized primarily due to the steep learning curve involved in developing custom deep-learning solutions. To overcome this issue, we introduce software, DeepTrack 2.0, to design, train, and validate deep-learning solutions for digital microscopy. We use this software to exemplify how deep learning can be employed for a broad range of applications, from particle localization, tracking, and characterization, to cell counting and classification. Thanks to its user-friendly graphical interface, DeepTrack 2.0 can be easily customized for user-specific applications, and thanks to its open-source, object-oriented programing, it can be easily expanded to add features and functionalities, potentially introducing deep-learning-enhanced video microscopy to a far wider audience.},

  abstract     = {Control of interfacial physicochemical properties associated with device materials to minimize the impact of point defects on device performance has been a dominant theme in the semiconductor industry. Control of the density of such defects for silicon has been well established for metal oxide-semiconductor field-effect device applications through deliberate reactions with chemically congruent species, such as hydrogen. In contrast, control of interfacial defects for technologically important III–V device materials is still an active area of research. Performance criteria for III–V devices are demanding in terms of energy efficiency, material consumption, sensitivity, and speed. The surface reactions of III–V crystals, including oxidation, are typically known to result in performance limitation for devices, causing significant degradation due to high defect-level densities at the surfaces/interfaces, in contrast to high quality bulk crystal regions. Here, we discuss the approach of utilizing atomically thin, ordered oxide interfacial layers of III–V compound semiconductors since they provide a unique opportunity for metal-oxide semiconductor applications, compared to the more common approach to avoid surface oxidation. Long-range ordered oxide interfaces have been obtained by oxidizing cleaned III–V surfaces intentionally in ultrahigh vacuum conditions. This can be combined with different passivation methods to decrease interfacial defect density in III–V devices. We present the current understanding of the physical and chemical properties of crystalline oxidized III–V materials, based on both experimental and computational models. The results are compared to those obtained by current state-of-the-art passivation methods.},

The functionalities of all the parts needed to create a quantum computer, such as quantum error correction, couplings, quantum teleportation, and a quantum repeater, have already been experimentally demonstrated. These achievements are expected to influence the industrial development of quantum information technology as well as quantum sensing. Whereas quantum sensing has been established and a large number of organizations are working on new developments in this area, a quantum computer itself remains elusive due to technical reasons and limitations of the available materials. For example, only in recent months has it become possible to electrically readout the NV spin state at the level of a single center and significantly improve the scalability of NV center production. A number of ideas have been proposed to overcome the above-mentioned limitations. This paper summarizes the status of research in the area, details the most promising concepts for development, and discusses factors limiting progress as well as the most recent developments in the field.},

In the past decade, “ ion-cut ” has become the key technique to produce wafer-size, high-quality, sub micrometer-thickness crystalline LiNbO 3 thin films, i.e., lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI). With the rapid development of LNOI technology and the tremendous progress of associated surface structuring and engineering techniques over the last few years, many novel chip-integrated LiNbO 3 -based devices and applications with reduced cost, complexity, power, and size, are demonstrated, boosting the resurgence of integrated photonics based on this material. The remarkable achievements are largely facilitated by the most recent technological progress in photonic integration and performance optimization of LNOI on-chip devices, such as high-quality surface domain engineering, advanced heterogeneous integration technology, powerful dispersion engineering, fine polishing lithography, and wafer-scale fabrication. Accordingly, batch-compatible chip-integrated platforms for more complex photonic integrated circuits, such as quantum optical circuits, are within reach. This article provides a timely review of the key advances in LNOI technology and a reasonable perspective on the near-future directions for both integrated photonics and applied physics communities.},

  abstract     = {The study of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) began about a decade ago. Currently, multiple applications of CAP have been discovered including biomedicine, nanomaterials, agriculture, and water purifications. At the current stage of these research fields, it is obvious that the next move will be CAP optimization for each specific application. For example, in the field of plasma-based cancer treatment, due to the different responses of cell lines, CAP can activate different biological pathways in different cells, i.e., to be selective. One of the most commonly used CAP types is the cold atmospheric plasma jet (CAPJ). However, without a full understanding of CAPJ physics, it is impossible to optimize the plasma for every application condition. Moreover, since each research team is equipped with its own CAPJ generator, the hardware behaviors vary significantly across researchers. Therefore, a complete big picture of CAPJ control and parameters is a critical milestone for future CAPJ optimization in these research fields. This Review provides a summary of how CAPJ parameters can be manipulated with the control inputs and hardware design to extend that the chemical compositions can be modified by the gas flow rate, discharge waveform, target properties, and local environment. Based on the control map summarized in this work, CAPJ users can easily optimize their device for a certain specific purpose, such as maximizing OH and H 2 O 2 for cancer treatment or maximizing O 3 and ultraviolet for sterilization. Therefore, this study sheds light on the general theory of CAPJ control and can be a basis for future optimization of low-temperature plasma devices. Consideration of the plasma control based on machine learning methods has been receiving interest recently and certainly will become a future hot topic.},

With the advent of high brilliance x-ray sources and innovative computing algorithms, there have been notable advances in small angle x-ray scattering analysis of superlattices. High brilliance x-ray beams have made data analyses less model-dependent. Additionally, novel data acquisition systems are faster and more competitive than ever before, enabling a more accurate mapping of the superlattices&#39; reciprocal space. Fast and high-throughput computing systems and algorithms also make possible advanced analysis methods, including iterative phasing algorithms, non-parameterized fitting of scattering data with molecular dynamics simulations, and the use of machine learning algorithms. As a result, solving nanoscale structures with high resolutions has become an attainable task. In this review, we highlight new developments in the field and introduce their applications for the analysis of nanoscale ordered structures, including nanoparticle supercrystals, nanoscale lithography patterns, and supramolecular self-assemblies. Particularly, we highlight the reciprocal space mapping techniques and the use of iterative phase retrieval algorithms.

Dopant control at the nanoscale greatly narrows their exploitation as components for device integration. In this context, doping appears the truly last missing piece of the puzzle for III–V NWs, for them to become commercially exploitable. In this paper, we review the doping of bottom up III–V NW arrays grown by molecular beam epitaxy and metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy, aiming to link materials science challenges with the critical aspect of device design. First, the doping methods and mechanisms are described, highlighting the differences between self-assembled and ordered NW arrays. Then, a brief overview of the available tools for investigating the doping is offered to understand the common strategies used for doping characterization. Both aspects are crucial to discuss the recent advancements in reproducibility and up-scalability, which are discussed in view of large area fabrication for industrial production. Finally, the most common doping-related challenges are presented together with the latest solutions to achieve high performing NW-based devices. On this basis, we believe that new insights and innovative findings discussed herein will open the low dimensional materials era, on the premise of multidisciplinary collaborative works of all the sectors involved in the design and optimization of commercial products.},

  abstract     = {To address the critical issues in solar energy, the current research has focused on developing advanced solar harvesting materials that are low cost, lightweight, and environmentally friendly. Among many organic photovoltaics (PVs), the porphyrin compounds exhibit unique structural features that are responsible for strong ultraviolet (UV) and near infrared absorptions and high average visible transmittance, making them ideal candidates for solar-based energy applications. The porphyrin compounds have also been found to exhibit strong photothermal (PT) effects and recently applied for optical thermal insulation of building skins. These structural and optical properties of the porphyrin compounds enable them to function as a PT or a PV device upon sufficient solar harvesting. It is possible to develop a transparent porphyrin thin film with PT- and PV-dual-modality for converting sunlight to either electricity or thermal energy, which can be altered depending on energy consumption needs. A building skin can be engineered into an active device with the PT- and PV-dual modality for large-scale energy harvesting, saving, and generation. This review provides the current experimental results on the PT and PV properties of the porphyrin compounds such as chlorophyll and chlorophyllin. Their PT and PV mechanisms are discussed in correlations to their electronic structures.

  abstract     = {Radical photo-cross-linking of polymers has been at the forefront in the development of biomedical applications to meet many of the biomaterial design criteria needed to address clinical and healthcare challenges, particularly in relation to regenerative and restorative medicine strategies, to treat damaged or diseased tissues and organs. Exciting new hybrid designs, elegantly expanding the range of properties and applications available to individual polymeric materials, are starting to offer detailed customization with complex and dynamic interactions similar to the events occurring within native tissue microenvironments in vivo . Yet the variety in success reported in the literature highlights the many unknown design criteria and parameters affecting functional restoration of damaged tissues and organs. The applied light curing units and radical initiating system, as well as underlying chemical reactions and resultant network structures, all require detailed consideration as means to modulate biological function while further being assessed as sources of toxicity. This is especially important when cells embedded in the polymeric material (or in surrounding tissues) are directly exposed to photo-irradiation. Ultimately, achieving successful clinical translation necessitates the chemical photo-polymerization platforms to be efficacious, safe, and customizable but also convenient for clinical use and cost-effective production. This review thus aims to summarize current and emerging toolkits to photo-polymerize biomedical polymers requiring the direct irradiation of cells and/or mammalian tissues and its associated impact on biological functionality. This specifically includes (1) in vitro photo-polymerization of cell-laden 3D-hydrogels for tissue engineering and regeneration medicine applications, (2) in vivo transdermal photo-polymerization of injectable hydrogels for cell/drug delivery, and (3) in vivo photo-polymerization of cell-free, injectable resin-based composites for load-bearing restorative surgery, all fast-growing and highly competitive fields of modern medicine. We herein summarize both design considerations and biological risk factors associated with selecting suitable light sources, photo-initiators, functional groups, chemical propagation, as well as how subsequent network properties can modulate biological function and ultimately clinical applicability. As more knowledge is continuously accumulated through materials science, matrix biology, and technology, this review provides recommendations for researchers to extend their chemical, biological, and structural characterizations to systematically enrich the paradigm of photo-polymerizable materials for biomedical applications to help ensure efficient and safe radical photo-processing.},
