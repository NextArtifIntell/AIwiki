In this paper, we prove that a fixed point theory approach based on the celebrated Schauder’s fixed point theorem may provide a general method to concisely establish not only the existence of localized structures but also a required rate of spatial localization. As a case study, we consider lattices of coupled particles with a nonlinear nearest neighbor interaction and prove the existence of exponentially spatially localized breathers exhibiting either even-parity or odd-parity symmetry under necessary non-resonant conditions accompanied with the proof of energy bounds of solutions.},

In this paper, we consider a higher-order KN equation with third-order dispersion and fifth-order nonlinearity. Based on the theory of the inverse scattering, the matrix Riemann–Hilbert problem is established. Through the dressing method, the solution matrix with simple zeros without reflection is constructed. In particular, a new form of solution is given which is more direct and simpler than previous methods. In addition, through the determinant solution matrix, the vivid diagrams and dynamic analysis of single-soliton solution and two-soliton solution are given in detail. Finally, by using the technique of limit, we construct the general solution matrix in the case of multiple zeros, and the examples of solutions for the cases of double zeros, triple zeros, single–double zeros, and double–double zeros are especially shown.},

Specifically, we are interested in sampling the possibly multimodal invariant probability distribution of a Langevin system at small noise (or low temperature), for which the dynamics can easily get trapped inside metastable subsets of the phase space. We follow Chen et al. [J. Math. Phys. 56 , 113302 (2015)] and consider a Langevin equation that is simulated at a high temperature, with the control playing the role of a friction that balances the additional noise so as to restore the original invariant measure at a lower temperature. We discuss different limits as the temperature ratio goes to infinity and prove convergence to a limit dynamics. It turns out that, depending on whether the lower (“target”) or the higher (“simulation”) temperature is fixed, the controlled dynamics converges either to the overdamped Langevin equation or to a deterministic gradient flow. This implies that (a) the ergodic limit and the large temperature separation limit do not commute in general and that (b) it is not possible to accelerate the speed of convergence to the ergodic limit by making the temperature separation larger and larger. We discuss the implications of these observations from the perspective of stochastic optimization algorithms and enhanced sampling schemes in molecular dynamics.},

Its magnitude is a combined local measure for non-stationarity, diabaticity, and dissipation in the flow, and it has been shown to provide good qualitative indications for the onset and presence of precipitation and the organization of storms. The index has been derived thus far for ideal fluid models only, however, so that one may expect more detailed insights from a revised definition of the quantity that includes more complex aerothermodynamics. The present paper suggests definitions of DSI-like indicators for flows of moist air with phase changes and precipitation. In this way, the DSI is generalized to signal deviations from a variety of different types of balanced states. A comparison of these indices evaluated with respect to one and the same flow field enables the user to test whether the flow internally balances any combination of the physical processes encoded in the generalized DSI-indices.},

Such a field is characterized by the existence of a singular foliation entirely consisting of invariant submanifolds. A compact regular leaf (a flux surface) of this foliation must be diffeomorphic to the two-torus. In a neighborhood of a flux surface, it is known that the magnetic field admits several exact smooth normal forms in which the field lines are straight. However, these normal forms break down near singular leaves, including elliptic and hyperbolic magnetic axes. In this paper, the existence of exact smooth normal forms for integrable magnetic fields near elliptic and hyperbolic magnetic axes is established. In the elliptic case, smooth near-axis Hamada and Boozer coordinates are defined and constructed. Ultimately, these results establish previously conjectured smoothness properties for smooth solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equations. The key arguments are a consequence of a geometric reframing of integrability and magnetic fields: they are presymplectic systems.},

Compared to projection-based discrete models on the manifold, it is embedding free and enjoys the same structural properties as the corresponding continuous models. For the proposed model, we provide a sufficient framework leading to asymptotic velocity alignment in which all particles’ velocity align when they lie in the same tangent plane via the parallel transport along the length-minimizing geodesic. For the unit- d sphere ( ⁠ S d ⁠ ), we provide explicit representations of the Sasaki metric and the corresponding geodesics on T S d and show that the TCS model exhibits a dichotomy in asymptotic spatial patterns (either energy tends to zero or all particles move along a common geodesic on S d ⁠ , which is a great circle). We also provide several numerical examples and compare them with analytical results.},

In this paper, we present an improvement of this inequality. We first prove an improved quantum logarithmic-Sobolev inequality and then use the well-known equivalence of logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities and hypercontractivity inequalities to obtain our main result. As applications of these results, we present an asymptotically tight quantum Faber–Krahn inequality on the hypercube and a new quantum Schwartz–Zippel lemma.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by general relativity, we suggest an approach for long-range potential scattering. In scattering theory, there is a general theory for short-range potential scattering, but there is no general theory for long-range potential scattering. This is because the scattering boundary conditions for all short-range potentials are the same, but for different long-range potentials, they are different. In this paper, by introducing tortoise coordinates, we convert long-range potential scattering to short-range potential scattering. This allows us to deal with long-range potential scattering as short-range potential scattering. An explicit expression of the scattering wave function for long-range potential scattering is presented, in which the scattering wave function is represented by the tortoise coordinate and the scattering phase shift. We show that the long-range potential scattering wave function is just the short-range potential scattering wave function with a replacement of a common coordinate by a tortoise coordinate. The approach applies not only to scattering but also applies to bound states. Furthermore, in terms of tortoise coordinates, we suggest a classification scheme for potentials. We also discuss the duality between tortoise coordinates.},

  abstract     = {Universality vs non-universality on the quantum Zeno effect and the anti-Zeno effect is discussed. It is well-known that the Zeno effect is a result of the branch point effect based on the constraint that the energy spectrum is bounded from below. On the other hand, we show that the anti-Zeno effect arises from the interference of multiple complex poles in the lower half energy plane on a larger time scale compared with the Zeno time. Since the production of extra complex poles depends on the characteristics of the interaction Hamiltonian, we emphasize that the anti-Zeno effect is model-dependent and non-universal, while the Zeno effect is a universal phenomenon independent of the form of the interaction.},

The aim was to obtain a generalized GL free energy that approximates the microscopic model better. Since 1960s, multiple works have claimed or implicitly assumed that this extended GL model corresponds to the free energy and has solutions in the form of local minima describing superconductivity, such as vortex solutions. In contrast to this, we prove that this extended GL functional does not represent free energy since it does not have any solutions in the form of minima. Accordingly, it cannot be used to describe superconducting states.},

The superhelical conformation of long twisted strands is known to be more efficient in terms of ropelength compared with the circular double helical conformation. In this paper, we present a conformation of 2-bridge knots by using ropelength-minimizing superhelical curves and derive an upper bound on the ropelength of 2-bridge knots. Our superhelical model of 2-bridge knots is shown to be more efficient than the standard double helical one if the iterative twisted parts are long enough.},

In addition, uniform lower and upper bounds are established for the Robin–Neumann gaps in terms of their limiting mean spacing.

These models amount to Gibbs changes of measure of a classical renewal process and can be identified with a constrained pinning model of polymers. The extensive observables that enter the thermodynamic description turn out to be cumulative rewards corresponding to deterministic rewards that are uniquely determined by the waiting time and grow no faster than it. The probability decay with the system size of their fluctuations switches from exponential to subexponential at criticality, which is a regime corresponding to a discontinuous pinning–depinning phase transition. We describe such decay by proposing a precise large deviation principle under the assumption that the subexponential correction term to the waiting time distribution is regularly varying. This principle is, in particular, used to characterize the fluctuations of the number of renewals, which measures the DNA-bound monomers in the Poland–Scheraga model, the particles in the Fisher–Felderhof model and the Tokar–Dreyssé model, and the native peptide bonds in the Wako–Saitô–Muñoz–Eaton model.},

Particular cases of this problem have been considered previously in studies of the circular-restricted n -body problem. We show that the number of equilibria is finite for a generic set of parameters, and we establish estimates for the number of equilibria. We prove that the number of equilibria is bounded below by n + 1, and we provide examples to show that this lower bound is sharp. We prove an upper bound on the number of equilibria that grows exponentially in n . In order to establish a lower bound on the maximum number of equilibria, we analyze a class of examples, referred to as “ring configurations,” consisting of n − 1 equal masses positioned at vertices of a regular polygon with an additional mass located at the center. Previous numerical observations indicate that these configurations can produce as many as 5 n − 5 equilibria. We verify analytically that the ring configuration has at least 5 n − 5 equilibria when the central mass is sufficiently small. We conjecture that the maximum number of equilibria grows linearly with the number of point masses. We also discuss some mathematical similarities to other equilibrium problems in mathematical physics, namely, Maxwell’s problem from electrostatics and the image counting problem from gravitational lensing.},

Whereas all previous results on isochrone mechanics have been established using classical analysis and geometry, in this article, we revisit the isochrone problem of motion using tools from Hamiltonian dynamical systems. In particular, we (1) solve the problem of motion using a well-adapted set of angle-action coordinates and generalize the notion of eccentric anomaly to all isochrone orbits, and (2) we construct the Birkhoff normal form for a particle orbiting a generic radial potential and examine its Birkhoff invariants to prove that the class of isochrone potentials is in correspondence with parabolas in the plane. Along the way, several fundamental results of celestial mechanics, such as the Bertrand theorem or the Kepler equation and laws, are obtained as special cases of more general properties characterizing isochrone mechanics.},

The guiding, physically motivated, principles are (i) locality, i.e., the generating role of the algebras localized in small, topologically trivial, regions, (ii) diffeomorphism covariance, which guarantees the intrinsic character of the analysis, and (iii) the exclusion of additional local degrees of freedom with respect to the Schrödinger representation. The locally normal representations of the resulting observable algebra are classified by unitary representations of the fundamental group of the manifold, which actually generate an observable, “topological,” subalgebra. The result is confronted with the standard approach based on the introduction of the universal covering M ̃ of M and on the decomposition of L 2 ( M ̃ ) according to the spectrum of the fundamental group, which plays the role of a gauge group. It is shown that in this way one obtains all the representations of the observables iff the fundamental group is amenable. The implications on the observability of the permutation group in particle statistics are discussed.},

Then, we extend the classical “stochastic Gronwall’s lemma,” making it more convenient in applications.

Contained in this work is an exact solution of the so-called type I chain in the case of the disorder variables being given by a gamma distribution. The exact solution exhibits a singularity in the density of states about the origin, which has since been shown to be universal for one-dimensional tight binding models with off diagonal disorder. We discuss this context and also point out some universal features of the weak disorder expansion of the exact solution near the band edge. Furthermore, a link between the exact solution and a tridiagonal formalism of anti-symmetric Gaussian β -ensembles with β proportional to 1/ N is made.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the interface between two regions of an incompressible ideal fluid flow moving in a relative motion is necessarily destabilized, regardless of the velocity difference’s strength. This phenomenon is the so-called Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. However, a large number of works demonstrated a surprising result that the instability is suppressed for shallow water flows; the interface is stabilized if the Froude number, defined by the velocity difference’s ratio to the gravity wave’s speed, is sufficiently large. In a limited way, these authors used the shallow water equations without the higher-order effect of the dispersive terms. Thus, this investigation aims at examining these higher-order dispersive effects to analyze the interface stability problem of tangential-velocity discontinuity in shallow water flows. In particular, we use the Green–Naghdi equations to introduce the dispersive terms related to the depth and the depth-averaged horizontal velocities of the fluid. We show that the interface stability depends on the Froude number (i.e., the velocity difference’s strength) and the water depth. A critical value of the Froude number to stabilize the interface is smaller than the case of no dispersive terms, and the flow in a deeper region is more stable than in a shallower one. We also consider the distribution of kinetic and potential energy to clarify a feature characteristic of a large class of instabilities in shallow water flow. The instability of flows is caused by the decrease in the kinetic energy during the perturbation of waves. This phenomenon is known as negative energy modes and plays a vital role in applying the model to industrial equipment. A conclusion is that the equipartition of energies occurs if and only if the velocity difference is zero and the water depth is shallow enough to ignore the dispersive terms.},

We propose an algorithm for construction of explicit isometric embeddings of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with symmetries into an ambient space of higher dimension. While most of the existing methods are based on Gauss–Codazzi–Mainardi–Peterson equations, we do not use them and instead concentrate on a system of equations that connects the metric on the manifold and the embedding function of the surface. Our algorithm is based on the group theoretical method of separation of variables that we developed earlier. The algorithm makes this method more convenient and simple to use. It allowed us to simplify the construction of many known embeddings as well as obtain some new ones. In particular, we obtain explicit global (i.e., smooth at all values of radius) embeddings of spinning the BTZ black hole in seven-dimensional flat space.},

In the continuum field theory, at the classical level, this symmetry algebra is given by the central extension of the Poincaré loop algebra. At the quantum level, we construct a discrete current algebra based on a quantum symmetry group given by the Drinfeld double D S U ( 2 ) ⁠ . Those discrete currents depend on an integer N , a discreteness parameter, understood as the number of quanta of geometry on the 1D boundary: low N is the deep quantum regime, while large N should lead back to a continuum picture. We show that this algebra satisfies two fundamental properties. First, it is compatible with the quantum space-time picture given by the Ponzano–Regge state-sum model, which provides discrete path integral amplitudes for 3D quantum gravity. The integer N then counts the flux lines attached to the boundary. Second, we analyze the refinement, coarse-graining, and fusion processes as N changes, and we show that the N → ∞ limit is a classical limit where we recover the Poincaré current algebra. Identifying such a discrete current algebra on quantum boundaries is an important step toward understanding how conformal field theories arise on spatial boundaries in quantized space-times such as in loop quantum gravity.},

Here, we propose a new variational principle to uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle, information measures, such as relative entropy and Fisher information, are imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This principle not only recovers Nelson’s theory and, consequently, the Schrödinger equation but also clears an unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple Lagrangians can be used in the variational method and yield the same theory. The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical picture for stochastic mechanics. Each path configuration is considered as a degree of freedom and has its own law of dynamics. Thus, the variation principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory. The structure of Lagrangian developed here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are originated from information constraints. This suggests that a Lagrangian may need to include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete description of the dynamics of a physical system.},

Some states exhibit remarkable crossovers of symmetry “making” and “breaking”: a broken PT gets reinstated, while higher levels “collude” to continue with symmetry breaking.

Under the assumption of quasi-periodicity of the wavefunction, the Zak’s magnetic translations in the Bravais lattice generate a non-commutative quantum torus. We concentrate on the case when the magnetic flux density is a rational number. The Bloch wavefunctions form a finite-dimensional module of the noncommutative torus of magnetic translations as well as of its commutant, which is the non-commutative torus of magnetic translations in the dual Bravais lattice. The bi-module structure of the Bloch waves is shown to be the connecting link between two Morita equivalent non-commutative tori. The main focus of our review is the Kähler structure on the Hilbert space of Bloch waves and its inherent quantum toric geometry. We reveal that the metaplectic group M p ( 2 , R ) of the automorphisms of magnetic translation algebras is represented by the quantum optics squeezing operators.},

When the symmetry is slightly broken, this resonant state can be excited from the far field.

Using asymptotic analysis, we compute the scattering matrix of the system explicitly, thereby characterizing this Fano-type transmission anomaly.},

We show that the asymptotic limit of the Vlasov equation is a diffusion equation in the velocity space but homogeneous in the physical space. We obtain a diffusion matrix, quadratic with respect to the electric field, which can be related to the diffusion matrix of the resonance broadening theory and of the quasilinear theory, depending on whether the typical autocorrelation time of particles is finite or not. In the self-consistent deterministic case, we show that the asymptotic distribution function is homogenized in the space variables, while the electric field converges weakly to zero. We also show that the lack of compactness in time for the electric field is necessary to obtain a genuine diffusion limit. By contrast, the time compactness property leads to a “cheap” version of the Landau damping: the electric field converges strongly to zero, implying the vanishing of the diffusion matrix, while the distribution function relaxes, in a weak topology, toward a spatially homogeneous stationary solution of the Vlasov–Poisson system.},

The reason is that they enable the derivation of exact formulas, which then provide a route to calculating the large-matrix asymptotics of these quantities. We develop a parallel theory for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) of random matrices and other related unitary invariant matrix ensembles. This allows us to write down exact formulas in these cases for the joint moments of the traces and the joint moments of the characteristic polynomials in terms of appropriately defined symmetric functions. As an example of an application, for the joint moments of the traces, we derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the rate of convergence of the moments of polynomial functions of GUE matrices to those of a standard normal distribution when the matrix size tends to infinity.},

For injective matrix product states, we, moreover, show that the classical CMI decays exponentially whenever the collection of matrix product operators satisfies a “purity condition,” a notion previously established in the theory of random matrix products. We, furthermore, show that violation of the purity condition enables a generalized notion of error correction on the virtual space, thus indicating the non-generic nature of such violations. We make this intuition more concrete by constructing a probabilistic model where purity is a typical property. The proof of our main result makes extensive use of the theory of random matrix products and may find applications elsewhere.},

We prove that such systems also admit nearly invariant manifolds of each order, near which rapid oscillations are suppressed. We study the nonlinear normal stability of these slow manifolds for nearly periodic Hamiltonian systems on barely symplectic manifolds —manifolds equipped with closed, non-degenerate 2-forms that may be degenerate to leading order. In particular, we establish a sufficient condition for long-term normal stability based on second derivatives of the well-known adiabatic invariant. We use these results to investigate the problem of embedding guiding center dynamics of a magnetized charged particle as a slow manifold in a nearly periodic system. We prove that one previous embedding and two new embeddings enjoy long-term normal stability and thereby strengthen the theoretical justification for these models.},

With this in mind, we study gauge freedom in magnetostatics and its effect on the comparison between magnetic configurations through key quantities such as the magnetic helicity. For this, we apply the Hodge decomposition of k -forms on compact orientable Riemaniann manifolds with smooth boundary, as well as de Rham cohomology, to the representation of magnetic fields through potential one-forms in toroidal volumes. An advantage of the homological approach is the recovery of classical results without explicit coordinates and assumptions about the fields on the exterior of the domain. In particular, a detailed construction of minimal gauges and a formal proof of relative helicity formulas are presented.},

For positive semidefinite matrices, we show that the separations between rank, purification rank, and separable rank disappear for a large class of Schatten p -norms. For non-negative tensors, we show that the separations between rank, positive semidefinite rank, and non-negative rank disappear for all ℓ p -norms with p &gt; 1. For the trace norm ( p = 1), we obtain upper bounds that depend on the ambient dimension. We also provide a deterministic algorithm to obtain the approximate decomposition attaining our bounds.

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional geophysical fluids support both internal and boundary-trapped waves. To obtain the normal modes in such fluids, we must solve a differential eigenvalue problem for the vertical structure (for simplicity, we only consider horizontally periodic domains). If the boundaries are dynamically inert (e.g., rigid boundaries in the Boussinesq internal wave problem and flat boundaries in the quasigeostrophic Rossby wave problem), the resulting eigenvalue problem typically has a Sturm–Liouville form and the properties of such problems are well-known. However, when restoring forces are also present at the boundaries, then the equations of motion contain a time-derivative in the boundary conditions, and this leads to an eigenvalue problem where the eigenvalue correspondingly appears in the boundary conditions. In certain cases, the eigenvalue problem can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem in the Hilbert space L 2 ⊕ C and this theory is well-developed. Less explored is the case when the eigenvalue problem takes place in a Pontryagin space, as in the Rossby wave problem over sloping topography. This article develops the theory of such problems and explores the properties of wave problems with dynamically active boundaries. The theory allows us to solve the initial value problem for quasigeostrophic Rossby waves in a region with sloping bottom (we also apply the theory to two Boussinesq problems with a free-surface). For a step-function perturbation at a dynamically active boundary, we find that the resulting time-evolution consists of waves present in proportion to their projection onto the dynamically active boundary.},

Indeed, it satisfies the Frisch–Parisi multifractal formalism, which establishes a relationship with turbulence and implies some intermittent nature. It also plays a surprising role as a physical trajectory in the evolution of regular polygonal vortices that follow the binormal flow. With this motivation, we focus on one more classic tool to measure intermittency, namely, the fourth-order flatness, and we refine the results that can be deduced from the multifractal analysis to show that it diverges logarithmically.

  abstract     = {This is an investigation into the exact forms of images of point charges in 2D conducting ellipses and 3D prolate spheroids. For an ellipse with an exterior point source, we compare two previous expressions for the analytic continuation inside the ellipse down to the focal line, the location of the image charge. For an interior source, we discover a sequence of image charges lying outside. For a point source close to the surface of a spheroid, series solutions for the potential diverge in a region that encompasses the singularities of the continuation of the reflected potential inside the spheroid. We uncover an image system for a point charge on the axis of a prolate spheroid that extends from the focal segment somewhat further up the axis. For an off-axis charge, we find a new approximate image charge. For a point charge at the center of the spheroid, the image singularity is found to lie on an infinitely wide, flat sheet with a hole around the spheroid. For a point charge located anywhere inside the spheroid, we find two new approximate image charge solutions: a point charge in real space, which applies when the source lies near the surface, or a point charge in complex space that projects as a ring in the real space which applies when the source lies near the rotation axis. When the point charge lies exactly on a focal point, a multipole of order 1/2 is an ideal image approximation.},

One of their open questions was the limit α → 1 of this divergence.

Analogous minimizations of arbitrary generalized divergences lead to a new family of generalized divergences that we call kringel divergences for which we prove various properties, including the data-processing inequality.},

Here, we generalize this result to tensor squares of qubit maps. Specifically, we show that any positive tensor product of a qubit map with itself is decomposable. This solves a recent conjecture by Filippov and Magadov [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50 (5), 055301 (2017)]. We contrast this result with examples of non-decomposable positive maps arising as the tensor product of two distinct qubit maps or as the tensor square of a decomposable map from a qubit to a ququart. To show our main result, we reduce the problem to Pauli diagonal maps. We then characterize the cone of decomposable ququart Pauli diagonal maps by determining all 252 extremal rays of ququart Pauli diagonal maps that are both completely positive and completely copositive. These extremal rays split into three disjoint orbits under a natural symmetry group, and two of these orbits contain only entanglement breaking maps. Finally, we develop a general combinatorial method to determine the extremal rays of Pauli diagonal maps that are both completely positive and completely copositive between multi-qubit systems using the ordered spectra of their Choi matrices. Classifying these extremal rays beyond ququarts is left as an open problem.},

In this article, we explain this coincidence by proving that the min-cut function of any weighted hypergraph can be approximated (up to an overall rescaling) by the entropies of quantum states known as stabilizer states. We do so by constructing a novel ensemble of random quantum states, built from tensor networks, whose entanglement structure is determined by a given hypergraph. This implies that the min-cuts of hypergraphs are constrained by quantum entropy inequalities, and it follows that the recently defined hypergraph cones are contained in the quantum stabilizer entropy cones, which confirms a conjecture made in the recent literature.},

We associate antihermitian forms of the unit determinant over Laurent polynomial rings to TI Clifford QCA with lattice boundaries and prove that the form determines the QCA up to Clifford circuits and shifts (trivial). It follows that every 2D TI Clifford QCA is trivial since the antihermitian form in this case is always trivial. Furthermore, we prove that for any D , the fourth power of any TI Clifford QCA is trivial. We present explicit examples of nontrivial TI Clifford QCA for D = 3 and any odd prime p and show that the Witt group of the finite field F p is a subgroup of the group C ( D = 3 , p ) of all TI Clifford QCA modulo trivial ones. That is, C ( D = 3 , p ≡ 1 mod 4 ) ⊇ Z 2 × Z 2 and C ( D = 3 , p ≡ 3 mod 4 ) ⊇ Z 4 ⁠ . The examples are found by disentangling the ground state of a commuting Pauli Hamiltonian, which is constructed by coupling layers of prime dimensional toric codes such that an exposed surface has an anomalous topological order that is not realizable by commuting Pauli Hamiltonians strictly in two dimensions. In an appendix independent of the main body of this paper, we revisit a recent theorem of Freedman and Hastings that any two-dimensional QCA, which is not necessarily Clifford or translation invariant, is a constant depth quantum circuit followed by a shift.

Once emitted by a source, the entity propagates within the space of Alice’s and Bob’s detection screens, with the measurements’ outcomes corresponding to the entity being absorbed or not absorbed in a given time interval. The violation of the marginal laws results from the fact that the choice of the screen on the side of Alice affects the detection probability on the side of Bob, and vice versa, and we show that for certain screen choices, the Bell-CHSH inequality can be violated up to its mathematical maximum. Our analysis provides a clarification of the mechanisms that could be at play when the Bell-CHSH inequality and marginal laws are violated in entangled bipartite systems, which would not primarily depend on the presence of a bipartite structure but on the fact that the latter can manifest as an undivided whole.},

From the supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians and the shape invariance technique, we obtain the eigenstates and the eigenvalues along with the ladders operators, thus showing a preservation of the supersymmetric structure in terms of the deformed counterpartners. The deformed space in supersymmetry allows to characterize position-dependent effective mass and uniform field interactions and to obtain a generalized uncertainty relation (GUP) that behaves as a distinguishability measure for the coherent states, these latter satisfying a periodic evolution for the corrections of the GUP.},

We study deformations of twisted Rota–Baxter operators from cohomological points of view. Some applications are given to Reynolds operators and twisted r -matrices. Next, we introduce a new algebraic structure, called NS-Lie algebras, that is related to twisted Rota–Baxter operators in the same way pre-Lie algebras are related to Rota–Baxter operators.

We prove that the eigenfunctions in balls are localized around an intermediate sphere whose radius is increasing with respect to the l – k ratio. The eigenfunctions decay exponentially inside the localized sphere and decay polynomially outside. Furthermore, we discover a novel phase transition for the eigenfunctions in spherical shells as the l – k ratio crosses a critical value. In the supercritical case, the eigenfunctions are localized around a sphere between the inner and outer boundaries of the spherical shell. In the critical case, the eigenfunctions are localized around the inner boundary. In the subcritical case, no localization could be observed, giving rise to localization breaking.},

However, the earlier works are not sufficient to obtain the precise criteria for the global existence for the Cauchy problem. In this paper, the exact criteria for the global existence of L 2 solutions are shown by studying the interaction between the Fourier 0 mode and oscillation of solutions.

  abstract     = {We consider the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene introduced by Tarnopolsky, Kruchkov, and Vishwanath (TKV). TKV proved that for inverse twist angles α such that the effective Fermi velocity at the moiré K point vanishes, the chiral model has a perfectly flat band at zero energy over the whole Brillouin zone. By a formal expansion, TKV found that the Fermi velocity vanishes at α ≈ 0.586. In this work, we give a proof that the Fermi velocity vanishes for at least one α between 0.57 and 0.61 by rigorously justifying TKV’s formal expansion of the Fermi velocity over a sufficiently large interval of α values. The idea of the proof is to project the TKV Hamiltonian onto a finite-dimensional subspace and then expand the Fermi velocity in terms of explicitly computable linear combinations of modes in the subspace while controlling the error. The proof relies on two propositions whose proofs are computer-assisted, i.e., numerical computation together with worst-case estimates on the accumulation of round-off error, which show that round-off error cannot possibly change the conclusion of computation. The propositions give a bound below on the spectral gap of the projected Hamiltonian, an Hermitian 80 × 80 matrix whose spectrum is symmetric about 0, and verify that two real 18-th order polynomials, which approximate the numerator of the Fermi velocity, take values with a definite sign when evaluated at specific values of α . Together with TKV’s work, our result proves the existence of at least one perfectly flat band of the chiral model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we prove the existence of at least two nontrivial solutions for a class of quasilinear problems with two non-negative and continuous potentials. Thanks to the geometries of these potentials, we are able to prove compact embeddings in some weighted Sobolev spaces, and by a minimization argument, we find a positive and a nodal (or sign-changing) (weak) solution with two nodal domains or that changes the sign exactly once in R N for such problems. The nonlinearity in this problem satisfies suitable growth and monotonicity conditions, which allow this result to complement the classical results due to Liu, Wang, and Wang [Commun. Partial Differ. Equations 29 , 879–901 (2004)].},

  abstract     = {We prove the existence of a countably infinite number of “excited” states for the Lorentzian-signature Taub–Wheeler–DeWitt (WDW) equation when a cosmological constant is present using the Euclidean-signature semi-classical method. We also find a “ground” state solution when both an aligned electromagnetic field and cosmological constant are present; as a result, conjecture that the Euclidean-signature semi-classical method can be used to prove the existence of a countably “infinite” number of “excited” states when the two aforementioned matter sources are present. Afterward, we prove the existence of asymptotic solutions to the vacuum Taub–WDW equation using the “no boundary” and “wormhole” solutions of the Taub Euclidean-signature Hamilton–Jacobi equation and compare their mathematical properties. We then discuss the fascinating qualitative properties of the wave functions we have computed. By utilizing the Euclidean-signature semi-classical method in the above manner, we further show its ability to prove the existence of solutions to Lorentzian-signature equations without having to invoke a Wick rotation. This feature of not needing to apply a Wick rotation makes this method potentially very useful for tackling a variety of problems in bosonic relativistic field theory and quantum gravity.},

First, the modified CKP hierarchy is constructed by using free bosons, and the corresponding Lax structure is given. Then, the constrained CKP hierarchy is found to be related to the modified CKP hierarchy, and the corresponding solutions are derived by using free bosons. Next, by using the relations between the Darboux transformations and the squared eigenfunction symmetries, we express the Darboux transformations of the CKP hierarchy in terms of free bosons, by which one can better understand the essential properties of the CKP Darboux transformations. In particular, the additional symmetries of the CKP hierarchy can be viewed as the infinitesimal generator of the CKP Darboux transformations. Based on these results, we finally obtain the actions of the CKP additional symmetries on the CKP tau functions constructed by free bosons.},

We study the coupling of spectral triples with twisted real structures to gauge fields, adopting Morita equivalence via modules and bimodules as a guiding principle and paying special attention to modifications to the inner fluctuations of the Dirac operator. In particular, we analyze the twisted first-order condition as a possible alternative to abandoning the first-order condition in order to go beyond the standard model and elaborate upon the special case of gauge transformations accordingly. Applying the formalism to a toy model, we argue that under certain physically motivated assumptions, the spectral triple based on the left–right symmetric algebra should reduce to that of the standard model of fundamental particles and interactions, as in the untwisted case.},

A formal solution is proposed using the Green function method which, for appropriate initial and boundary conditions, can be expressed in terms of the generalized H-function of Fox—a typical track of anomalous diffusive processes.

  abstract     = {In contrast to the study of Langevin equations in a homogeneous environment in the literature, the study on Langevin equations in randomly varying environments is relatively scarce. Almost all the existing works require random environments to have a specific formulation that is independent of the systems. This paper aims at considering large deviation principles (LDPs) of Langevin equations involving a random environment that is a process taking values in a measurable space and that is allowed to interact with the systems, without specified formulation on the random environment. Examples and applications to statistical physics are provided. Our formulation of the random environment presents the main challenges and requires new approaches. Our approach stems from the intuition of the Smoluchowski–Kramers approximation. The techniques developed in this paper focus on the relation between the solutions of the second-order equations and the associated first-order equations. We obtain the desired LDPs by showing that a family of processes enjoy the exponential tightness and local LDPs with an appropriate rate function.},

  abstract     = {A model for the third-order velocity structure function, S 3 , is proposed for closing the transport equation of the second-order velocity structure function, S 2 , in the scaling range of finite Reynolds number homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT). The model is based on a gradient type hypothesis with an eddy-viscosity formulation. The present model differs from previous ones in that no assumptions are made with regard to the behaviors of S 2 and S 3 in the scaling range. This allows S 3 to be modeled whether the intermittency of the energy dissipation ɛ (as modeled by the intermittency phenomenology) is considered or not. In both cases, the model predicts the same (infinite Reynolds number) asymptotic behavior for S 2 . This corresponds to the K41 prediction, i.e., S 2 ∼ r 2/3 . The model yields good agreement against direct numerical simulation data for forced HIT at all scales of motion except in the transition region between the dissipative and scaling ranges. The introduction of a simple bridging function in the model improves significantly the agreement in this region. Furthermore, the model illustrates the effect of the finite Reynolds number on the scaling range and shows that this effect is responsible for the deviation from a power-law behavior.},

Phys. 61 (4), 042701 (2020)], a first-order aggregation model on the hyperboloid was proposed and sufficient conditions for emergent dynamics were proposed in terms of initial configuration and system parameters. In this paper, we are interested in the second-order modeling of CS flocks on the hyperboloid. For this, we derive our second-order model from the abstract CS model on complete and smooth Riemannian manifolds via explicit identifications of geodesic and parallel transport. Velocity alignment has been shown by combining general velocity alignment estimates for the abstract CS model on manifolds and verifications of the a priori estimate of the second derivative of the energy functional. For the two-dimensional case H 2 ⁠ , similar to the recent result by Ahn, Ha, and Shim [Kinet. Relat. Models 14 (2), 323–351 (2021)], asymptotic flocking admits only two types of asymptotic scenarios, either convergence to a rest state or a state lying on the same plane (coplanar state). We also provide several numerical simulations to illustrate an aforementioned dichotomy on the asymptotic dynamics of the hyperboloid CS model on H 2 ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {The traveling wave tube (TWT) is a powerful vacuum electronic device used to amplify radio-frequency signals with numerous applications, including radar, television, and telephone satellite communications. TWT design in a nutshell comprises a pencil-like electron beam (e-beam) in vacuum interacting with a guiding slow-wave structure (SWS). In our studies here, the e-beam is represented by one-dimensional electron flow and SWS is represented by a transmission line (TL). The interaction between the e-beam and the TL is modeled by an analytic theory that generalizes the well-known Pierce model by taking into account the so-called space-charge effects, particularly electron-to-electron repulsion (debunching). Many important aspects of the analytic theory of TWTs have been already analyzed in our monograph on the subject. The focus of the studies here is on degeneracies of the TWT dispersion relations, particularly on exceptional points of degeneracy and their applications. The term exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) refers to the property of the relevant matrix to have a nontrivial Jordan block structure. Using special parameterization, particularly suited to chosen EPD, we derive exact formulas for the relevant Jordan basis, including the eigenvectors and the so-called root vector associated with the Jordan block. Based on these studies, we develop a constructive approach to sensing of small signals.},

(ii) Globally well-behaved double null foliations can be constructed from infinity using a choice of spheres related to the level sets of a new mass aspect function .

From earlier literature, the limiting eigenvalue density is known to be related to classical functions. Our study gives a unifying mechanism underlying this fact, identifying, in particular, the Gauss hypergeometric differential equation determining the Stieltjes transform of the limiting density in the Jacobi case. Our characterization of the moments and covariances of monomial linear statistics is through recurrence relations. We also extend recent work, which begins with the β -ensembles in the high-temperature limit and constructs a family of tridiagonal matrices referred to as α -ensembles, obtaining a random anti-symmetric tridiagonal matrix with i.i.d. (Independent Identically Distributed) gamma distributed random variables. From this, we can supplement analytic results obtained by Dyson in the study of the so-called type I disordered chain.},

  abstract     = {Folded linear molecular chains are ubiquitous in biology. Folding is mediated by intra-chain interactions that “glue” two or more regions of a chain. The resulting fold topology is widely believed to be a determinant of biomolecular properties and function. Recently, knot theory has been extended to describe the topology of folded linear chains, such as proteins and nucleic acids. To classify and distinguish chain topologies, algebraic structure of quandles has been adapted and applied. However, the approach is limited as apparently distinct topologies may end up having the same number of colorings. Here, we enhance the resolving power of the quandle coloring approach by introducing Boltzmann weights. We demonstrate that the enhanced coloring invariants can distinguish fold topologies with an improved resolution.},

This has the consequence of implying that the latter density satisfies a linear differential equation of degree three for β = 2 and of degree five for β = 1 and 4, analogs of which are already known for the Jacobi weight x a (1 − x ) b supported on (0, 1). We concentrate on the case a = b [Jacobi weight on (−1, 1)] and η real (Cauchy weight) since the density is then an even function and the differential equations simplify. From the differential equations, recurrences can be obtained for the moments of the Jacobi weight supported on (−1, 1) and/or the moments of the Cauchy weight. Particular attention is paid to the case β = 2 and the Jacobi weight on (−1, 1) in the symmetric case a = b , which in keeping with a recent result obtained by Assiotis et al. (“Moments of generalised Cauchy random matrices and continuous-Hahn polynomials,” Nonlinearity (to be published), arXiv:2009.04752) for the β = 2 case of the symmetric Cauchy weight (parameter η real), allows for an explicit solution of the recurrence in terms of particular continuous Hahn polynomials. Also for the symmetric Cauchy weight with η = − β ( N − 1)/2 − 1 − α , after appropriately scaling α proportional to N , we use differential equations to compute terms in the 1/ N 2 (1/ N ) expansion of the resolvent for β = 2 ( β = 1, 4).},

The examples of SFLT given here treat 3D Euler fluid flow, rotating shallow water dynamics, and the Euler–Boussinesq equations. In each example, one sees the effect of stochastic Stokes drift and material entrainment in the generation of fluid circulation.

We rigorously derive a world line integral expression for the self-force of the charged particle from a distributional equation for the conservation of four-momentum only. This naturally leads to an equation of motion for charged particles that incorporates a history-dependent self-interaction. We show additionally that the same equation of motion follows from a variational principle for retarded fields. Our work thus gives a rigorous vindication of an expression for the self-force first proposed by Landé and Thomas, studied by Zayats for straight line motion, and, more generally, obtained by Gratus, Perlick, and Tucker on the basis of an averaging axiom.},

To determine the primitivity of the transition matrices, we introduce the connecting operators that reduce the high-order transition matrices to lower-order transition matrices. Then, two sufficient conditions for primitivity are provided; they are invariant diagonal cycles and primitive commutative cycles of connecting operators. Then, the primitivity, corner-extendability, and crisscross-extendability are used to demonstrate the topological mixing. Finally, we show that the hole-filling condition yields the strong specification property. The application of all the above-mentioned conditions can be verified in a finite number of steps.},

  abstract     = {Using the formalism of stochastic embedding developed by Cresson and Darses [J. Math. Phys. 48 , 072703 (2007)], we study how the dynamics of the classical Newton equation for a force deriving from a potential is deformed under the assumption that this equation can admit stochastic processes as solutions. We focus on two definitions of a stochastic Newton equation called differential and variational. We first prove a stochastic virial theorem that is a natural generalization of the classical case. The stochasticity modifies the virial relation by adding a potential term called the induced potential, which corresponds in quantum mechanics to the Bohm potential. Moreover, the differential stochastic Newton equation naturally provides an action functional that satisfies a stochastic Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The real part of this equation corresponds to the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation with an extra potential term corresponding to the induced potential already observed in the stochastic virial theorem. The induced potential has an explicit form depending on the density of the stochastic process solutions of the stochastic Newton equation. It is proved that this density satisfies a nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Applying this formalism for the Kepler potential, one proves that the induced potential coincides with the ad hoc “dark potential” used to recover a flat rotation curve of spiral galaxies. We then discuss the application of the previous formalism in the context of spiral galaxies following the proposal and computations given by Da Rocha and Nottale [Chaos, Solitons Fractals, 16 (4), 565–595 (2003)] where the emergence of the “dark potential” is seen as a consequence of the fractality of space in the context of the scale relativity theory.},

Quite recently, they appeared in physics: Intersection numbers of twisted cocycles define a scalar product on the vector space of Feynman integrals. With this application, the practical and efficient computation of intersection numbers of twisted cocycles becomes a topic of interest. An existing algorithm for the computation of intersection numbers of twisted cocycles requires in intermediate steps the introduction of algebraic extensions (for example, square roots) although the final result may be expressed without algebraic extensions. In this article, I present an improvement of this algorithm, which avoids algebraic extensions.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the long-time transport properties of quantum waves in weakly disordered media, the present work puts random Schrödinger operators into a new spectral perspective. Based on a stationary random version of a Floquet type fibration, we reduce the description of the quantum dynamics to a fibered family of abstract spectral perturbation problems on the underlying probability space. We state a natural resonance conjecture for these fibered operators: in contrast with periodic and quasiperiodic settings, this would entail that Bloch waves do not exist as extended states but rather as resonant modes, and this would justify the expected exponential decay of time correlations. Although this resonance conjecture remains open, we develop new tools for spectral analysis on the probability space, and in particular, we show how ideas from Malliavin calculus lead to rigorous Mourre type results: we obtain an approximate dynamical resonance result and the first spectral proof of the decay of time correlations on the kinetic timescale. This spectral approach suggests a whole new way of circumventing perturbative expansions and renormalization techniques.},

General necessary and sufficient conditions for a mixed Weyl quantum channel of an arbitrary dimension to be accessible by a semigroup are established. The set A N Q is shown to be log-convex and star-shaped with respect to the completely depolarizing channel. A decoherence supermap acting in the space of Lindblad operators transforms them into the space of Kolmogorov generators of classical semigroups. We show that for mixed Weyl channels, the super-decoherence commutes with the dynamics so that decohering a quantum accessible channel, we obtain a bistochastic matrix from the set A N C of classical maps accessible by a semigroup. Focusing on three-level systems, we investigate the geometry of the sets of quantum accessible maps, its classical counterpart, and the support of their spectra. We demonstrate that the set A 3 Q is not included in the set U 3 Q of quantum unistochastic channels, although an analogous relation holds for N = 2. The set of transition matrices obtained by super-decoherence of unistochastic channels of order N ≥ 3 is shown to be larger than the set of unistochastic matrices of this order and yields a motivation to introduce the larger sets of k -unistochastic matrices.},

  abstract     = {Susskind–Glogower coherent states, whose Fock expansion coefficients include Bessel functions, have recently attracted considerable attention for their optical properties. Nevertheless, identity resolution is still an open question, which is an essential mathematical property that defines an overcomplete basis in the Fock space and allows a coherent state quantization map. In this regard, the modified Susskind – Glogower coherent states have been introduced as an alternative family of states that resolve the identity resolution. In this paper, the quantization map related to the modified Susskind–Glogower coherent states is exploited, which naturally leads to a particular representation of the s u ( 1 , 1 ) Lie algebra in its discrete series. The latter provides evidence about further generalizations of coherent states, built from the Susskind–Glogower ones by extending the indices of the Bessel functions of the first kind and, alternatively, by employing the modified Bessel functions of the second kind. In this form, the new families of Susskind – Glogower-I and Susskind – Glogower-II coherent states are introduced. The corresponding quantization maps are constructed so that they lead to general representations of elements of the s u ( 1 , 1 ) and s u ( 2 ) Lie algebras as generators of the SU(1, 1) and SU(2) unitary irreducible representations, respectively. For completeness, the optical properties related to the new families of coherent states are explored and compared with respect to some well-known optical states.},

Our study is restricted to solutions in the space of relative motion with zero total angular momentum ( S -states). In variables ρ i j ≡ r i j 2 ⁠ , the corresponding reduced Hamiltonian of the system possesses a hidden sl (7; R ) Lie algebra structure. In the ρ -representation, it is shown that the four-body harmonic oscillator with arbitrary masses and unequal spring constants is exactly solvable. We pay special attention to the case of four equal masses and to atomic-like (where one mass is infinite and three others are equal), molecular two-center (two masses are infinite and two others are equal), and molecular three-center (three infinite masses) cases. In particular, exact results in the molecular case are compared with those obtained within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The first and second order symmetries of non-interacting system are searched. In addition, the reduction to the lower dimensional cases d = 1, 2 is discussed. It is shown that for the four-body harmonic oscillator case, there exists an infinite family of eigenfunctions that depend on the single variable, which is the moment of inertia of the system.},

We will prove trivialness of the velocity and the magnetic field with various boundary conditions. In some boundary conditions, the additional assumption that the horizontal angular component(s) of the velocity or (and) the magnetic field is (are) axially symmetric is needed. More precisely, five types of boundary conditions will be considered: the vertical periodic boundary condition for the velocity and the magnetic field, the Navier-slip boundary condition for the velocity, the perfectly conducting or insulating boundary condition for the magnetic field, the non-slip boundary condition for the velocity, and the perfectly conducting or insulating boundary condition for the magnetic field. One of our innovations is that we do not impose finite Dirichlet integral assumption on the magnetic field compared with previous works.},

The inequivalent graded Lie (super)algebras are obtained by solving the constraints imposed by the respective graded Jacobi identities. A motivation for this mathematical result is to systematically investigate the properties of dynamical systems invariant under graded (super)algebras. Recent works only paid attention to the special case of the one-dimensional Z 2 × Z 2 -graded Poincaré superalgebra. As applications, we are able to extend certain constructions originally introduced for this special superalgebra to other listed Z 2 × Z 2 -graded (super)algebras. We mention, in particular, the notion of Z 2 × Z 2 -graded superspace and of invariant dynamical systems (both classical worldline sigma models and quantum Hamiltonians). As a further by-product, we point out that, contrary to Z 2 × Z 2 -graded superalgebras, a theory invariant under a Z 2 × Z 2 -graded algebra implies the presence of ordinary bosons and three different types of exotic bosons, with exotic bosons of different types anticommuting among themselves.},

The analysis yields the edge exponents and associated amplitudes that describe the local behavior of the response function near a threshold. The singular behavior is derived starting from first principles considerations: the method of analysis does not rely, at any stage , on some hypothetical correspondence with a field theory or other phenomenological approaches. The analysis builds on the massless form factor expansion for the response functions of the XXZ chain obtained recently by the author. It confirms the non-linear Luttinger based predictions relative to the power-law behavior and of the associated edge exponents that arise in the vicinity of the dispersion relation of one massive excitation (hole, particle, or bound state). In addition, the present analysis shows that due to the lack of strict convexity of the particle dispersion relation and due to the presence of slow velocity branches of the bound states, there exist excitation thresholds with a different structure of edge exponents. These originate from multi-particle/hole/bound state excitations maximizing the energy at fixed momentum.},

  abstract     = {The present work provides a mathematically rigorous account on super fiber bundle theory, connection forms, and their parallel transport, which ties together various approaches. We begin with a detailed introduction to super fiber bundles. We then introduce the concept of so-called relative supermanifolds as well as bundles and connections defined in these categories. Studying these objects turns out to be of utmost importance in order to, among other things, model anticommuting classical fermionic fields in mathematical physics. We then construct the parallel transport map corresponding to such connections and compare the results with those found by other means in the mathematical literature. Finally, applications of these methods to supergravity will be discussed, such as the Cartan geometric formulation of Poincaré supergravity as well as the description of Killing vector fields and Killing spinors of super Riemannian manifolds arising from metric reductive super Cartan geometries.},

  abstract     = {The infinite affine Lie algebras of type ABCD, also called g l ̂ ( ∞ ) ⁠ , o ̂ ( ∞ ) ⁠ , and s p ̂ ( ∞ ) ⁠ , are equivalent to subalgebras of the quantum W 1+∞ algebras. They have well-known representations on the Fock space of a Dirac fermion ( ⁠ A ̂ ∞ ⁠ ), a Majorana fermion ( ⁠ B ̂ ∞ and D ̂ ∞ ⁠ ), or a symplectic boson ( ⁠ C ̂ ∞ ⁠ ). Explicit formulas for the action of the quantum W 1+∞ subalgebras on the Fock states are proposed for each representation. These formulas are the equivalent of the vertical presentation of the quantum toroidal g l ( 1 ) algebra Fock representation. They provide an alternative to the fermionic and bosonic expressions of the horizontal presentation . Furthermore, these algebras are known to have a deep connection with symmetric polynomials. The action of the quantum W 1+∞ generators leads to the derivation of Pieri-like rules and q-difference equations for these polynomials. In the specific case of B ̂ ∞ ⁠ , a q-difference equation is obtained for Q -Schur polynomials indexed by strict partitions.},

We first determine, under the modified-momentum, the generating functions identifying the complexified potentials V ± ( x ) under both concepts of pseudo-Hermiticity η ̃ + (respectively, weak pseudo-Hermiticity η ̃ − ⁠ ). We show that the concept of complementarity can be understood and interpreted as a coordinate transformation through their respective generating functions. As a consequence, a similarity transformation that implements coordinate transformations is obtained. We show that the similarity transformation is set up as a fundamental relationship connecting both η ̃ + and η ̃ − ⁠ . A special factorization η + = η − † η − is discussed in the constant mass case, and some Bäcklund transformations are derived.},

We find that when the permutation defining the perturbed ensemble has only long cycles, the answer is universal and approaches the corresponding moment of the circular unitary ensemble with a particularly fast rate: the error is of order 1/ N 3 and the terms of orders 1/ N and 1/ N 2 disappear due to cancellations. We prove this rate of convergence using Weingarten calculus and classifying the contributing Weingarten functions first in terms of a graph model and then algebraically.},

From this, a statistically valid correlation tensor is obtained that returns a Reynolds stress tensor model that satisfies realizability conditions. The number of hypotheses used is kept to a minimum, which allows a flexible use of the model in the applications. The Kelvin–Townsend equations allow us to construct the solution and prove its properties by means of a factorization approach. Since the RDT spectral tensor model is a system of transport equations plus an algebraic restriction due to incompressibility, we deal with the existence, uniqueness, and persistence of solutions in a specific set of functions by using DiPerna–Lions renormalization techniques.},

The system is assumed to evolve in discrete time steps. The most distinctive feature of the model is that the equations of motion can be irregular. After an analysis of the arising constraints and the symplectic form, we introduce adjusted coordinates on the phase space, which uncover its internal structure and result in a trivial form of the Hamiltonian evolution map. For illustration, the formalism is applied to the example of a massless scalar field on a two-dimensional spacetime lattice.},

We determine the two-point function of a deformed free scalar quantum field, which differs from the undeformed one, in contrast to the results in deformed Minkowski spacetime where they coincide.

It is proven that these walks exhibit NCG at and near the continuum limit. For the purely discrete regime, two illustrative walks of different complexities are studied in full detail. The most complex walk does exhibit NCG, but the simplest, most degenerate one does not. Thus, NCG can be simulated by QWs, not only in the continuum limit but also in the purely discrete regime.},

  abstract     = {Communication over a quantum broadcast channel with cooperation between the receivers is considered. The first form of cooperation addressed is classical conferencing, where receiver 1 can send classical messages to receiver 2. Another cooperation setting involves quantum conferencing, where receiver 1 can teleport a quantum state to receiver 2. When receiver 1 is not required to recover information and its sole purpose is to help the transmission to receiver 2, the model reduces to the quantum primitive relay channel. The quantum conferencing setting is intimately related to quantum repeaters as the sender, receiver 1, and receiver 2 can be viewed as the transmitter, the repeater, and the destination receiver, respectively. We develop lower and upper bounds on the capacity region in each setting. In particular, the cutset upper bound and the decode-forward lower bound are derived for the primitive relay channel. Furthermore, we present an entanglement-formation lower bound, where a virtual channel is simulated through the conference link. At last, we show that as opposed to the multiple access channel with entangled encoders, entanglement between decoders does not increase the classical communication rates for the broadcast dual.},

The Holevo bound is defined by a solution of a minimization problem, and in general, an explicit solution is not known. When the dimension of Hilbert space is 2 and the number of parameters is 2, an explicit form of the Holevo bound was given by Suzuki. In this paper, we focus on a logarithmic derivative that lies between the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative parameterized by β ∈ [0, 1] to obtain lower bounds of the weighted trace of covariance of an unbiased estimator. We introduce the maximum logarithmic derivative bound as the maximum of bounds with respect to β . We show that all monotone metrics induce lower bounds, and the maximum logarithmic derivative bound is the largest bound among them. We show that the maximum logarithmic derivative bound has explicit solution when the d dimensional model has d + 1 dimensional D invariant extension of the SLD tangent space. Furthermore, when d = 2, we show that the maximization problem to define the maximum logarithmic derivative bound is the Lagrangian duality of the minimization problem to define the Holevo bound and is the same as the Holevo bound. This explicit solution is a generalization of the solution for a two-dimensional Hilbert space given by Suzuki. We also give examples of families of quantum states to which our theory can be applied not only for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces.},

Additional results focus on the spectral gap and other spectral properties of random quantum channels and their invariant states. We compute the mean values of several quantities characterizing a given quantum channel, including its unitarity, the average output purity, and the 2-norm coherence of a channel, averaged over the entire set of the quantum channels with respect to the uniform measure. An ensemble of classical stochastic matrices obtained due to super-decoherence of random quantum stochastic maps is analyzed, and their spectral properties are studied using the Bloch representation of a classical probability vector.},

For classical spin systems, the positivity of such constants follows from a mixing condition for the Gibbs measure via quasi-factorization results for the entropy. Inspired by the classical case, we present a strategy to derive the positivity of the modified logarithmic Sobolev constant associated with the dynamics of certain quantum systems from some clustering conditions on the Gibbs state of a local, commuting Hamiltonian. In particular, we show that for the heat-bath dynamics of 1D systems, the modified logarithmic Sobolev constant is positive under the assumptions of a mixing condition on the Gibbs state and a strong quasi-factorization of the relative entropy.},

In particular, we consider local decay of solutions to the linear Schrödinger and wave equations on curved backgrounds that exhibit trapping. A particular application is waves on a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. We elaborate on Price’s law of local decay that accelerates with the angular momentum, which has recently been settled by Hintz, also in the much more difficult Kerr black hole setting.

By introducing suitable Lyapunov functionals, using the multiplier method, and constructing convex differential inequality, we establish an explicit and general decay rate result. This improves previous decay results concerning the problem. We also get a finite time blow-up result of solution with positive initial energy under suitable conditions on the initial data and positive memory function. This is the first result for blow-up of the problem with nonlocal nonlinear boundary damping.},

Explicit formulas for stationary charges are given, which are used to investigate the existence and geometry of stable equilibria arising in this setting. In particular, symbolic computations and computer experiments reveal that for an isosceles triangle T , the set S ( T ) of points P that are stable equilibria of their stationary charges is a non-empty open set containing the incenter of a triangle T . For a regular triangle, using symbolic computations, it appears possible to verify that the formulas for stationary charges define a stable mapping in the sense of Whitney having a deltoid caustic with three ordinary cusps. An interpretation of our results in terms of electrostatic ion traps is also given, and several plausible conjectures are presented.},

The rate function for the EPR takes the following explicit form: I ( x ) = x 1 + ℓ 0 ( x ) − 1 2 + 1 2 ∑ k = 1 d α k 2 − β k 2 ℓ 0 ( x ) + α k for x ≥ 0 and I ( x ) = − x 1 + ℓ 0 ( x ) + 1 2 + 1 2 ∑ k = 1 d α k 2 − β k 2 ℓ 0 ( x ) + α k for x &lt; 0, where α k ±i β k are the eigenvalues of A and ℓ 0 ( x ) is the unique solution of the equation x = 1 + ℓ × ∑ k = 1 d β k 2 α k 2 − ℓ β k 2 , − 1 ≤ ℓ &lt; min k = 1 , … , d α k 2 β k 2 ⁠ . Simple closed form formulas for rate functions are rare, and our work identifies an important class of large deviation problems where such formulas are available. The logarithmic moment generating function (the fluctuation function) Λ associated with the LDP is given as Λ ( λ ) = − 1 2 ∑ k = 1 d α k 2 − 4 λ ( 1 + λ ) β k 2 + α k for λ ∈ D and Λ( λ ) = ∞ for λ ∉ D ⁠ , where D is the domain of Λ. The functions Λ( λ ) and I ( x ) satisfy the Cohen–Gallavotti symmetry properties: Λ ( x ) = Λ ( − ( 1 + x ) ) , I ( x ) = I ( − x ) − x , for all x ∈ R ⁠ . In particular, the functions I and Λ do not depend on the diffusion matrix Q and are determined completely by the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of A . Formally, the deterministic system with Q = 0 has zero EPR, and thus, the model exhibits a phase transition in that the EPR changes discontinuously at Q = 0.},

Syst. 13 , 1312–1342 (2020)] as a complex counterpart of the Lohe sphere model. The LHS model describes aggregate dynamics of point particles on the Hermitian sphere H S d lying in C d + 1 ⁠ , and the coupling terms in the LHS model consist of two terms. For an identical ensemble with the same free flow dynamics, we provide a sufficient framework, leading to the complete aggregation in which all point particles form a giant one-point cluster asymptotically. In contrast, for a non-identical ensemble, we also provide a sufficient framework for the practical aggregation. Our sufficient framework is formulated in terms of coupling strengths and initial data. We also provide several numerical examples and compare them with analytical results.},

  abstract     = {A teleparallel geometry is an n -dimensional manifold equipped with a frame basis and an independent spin connection. For such a geometry, the curvature tensor vanishes and the torsion tensor is non-zero. A straightforward approach to characterizing teleparallel geometries is to compute scalar polynomial invariants constructed from the torsion tensor and its covariant derivatives. An open question has been whether the set of all scalar polynomial torsion invariants, I T ⁠ , uniquely characterize a given teleparallel geometry. In this paper, we show that the answer is no and construct the most general class of teleparallel geometries in four dimensions, which cannot be characterized by I T ⁠ . As a corollary, we determine all teleparallel geometries, have vanishing scalar polynomial torsion invariants.},

The quantum Fisher information of these states is proportional to the variance of the excitation energy of the underlying states and characterizes the localizability of the states in the angular direction in the phase space. We analyze the correlation and entanglement between gravitational degrees of freedom using different regions of the phase space plane in bubbling AdS. The correlation between two entangled rings in the phase space plane is related to the area of the annulus between the two rings. We also analyze two types of noisy coherent states, which can be viewed as interpolated states that interpolate between a pure coherent state in the noiseless limit and a maximally mixed state in the large noise limit.},

Fairly weak assumptions are imposed upon the unperturbed matrix [the square-well-simulating spectrum of H 0 ( N ) is not assumed equidistant)] and upon its maximally non-Hermitian N -parametric antisymmetric-matrix perturbations [matrix W ( N ) ( λ ) is not even required to be P T -symmetric]. Despite that, the “physical” parametric domain D [ N ] is (constructively) shown to exist, guaranteeing that in its interior, the spectrum remains real and non-degenerate, rendering the quantum evolution unitary. Among the non-Hermitian degeneracies occurring at the boundary ∂ D [ N ] of the domain of stability, our main attention is paid to their extreme version corresponding to Kato’s exceptional point of order N (EPN). The localization of the EPNs and, in their vicinity, of the quantum-phase-transition boundaries ∂ D [ N ] is found feasible, at the not too large N , using computer-assisted symbolic manipulations, including, in particular, the Gröbner-basis elimination and the high-precision arithmetics.},

For periodic systems with time reversal symmetry, the emergent nodal domains are shown to divide the atomic chains into simpler carbon structures analog to benzene rings, diallyl chains, anthracene (triacene) chains, and tetramethyl-naphthalene skeletal forms. The common electronic levels of these segments are identified as members of degenerate multiplets of the global system. The peculiar degeneracy of Möbius cycloacene is also explained by segmentation. In the last part, it is shown that the multiplicity of energies for cycloacene can be foreseen by studying the continuous limit of the tight-binding model; the degeneracy conditions are put in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. The results obtained in this work have important consequences on the physics of electronic transport in organic wires, together with their artificial realizations.},

In the latter, we also derive a heuristic model for a pure damped motion with suppression of diffusion. For the time-dependent coefficient problem, we give some particular cases that are integrable and derive a second order approximation to the generic case in which all parameters are time-dependent. We additionally explore the solutions of the system when the diffusion processes of the dissipative model lie beyond the weak coupling limit.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we analyze the flow filtration process of slightly compressible fluids in porous media containing fractures with complex geometries. We model the coupled fracture-porous media system where the linear Darcy flow is considered in porous media and the nonlinear Forchheimer equation is used inside the fracture. We develop a model to examine the flow inside fractures with complex geometries and variable thickness on a Riemannian manifold. The fracture is represented as the normal variation of a surface immersed in R 3 ⁠ . Using operators of Laplace–Beltrami type and geometric identities, we model an equation that describes the flow in the fracture. A reduced model is obtained as a low dimensional boundary value problem. We then couple the model with the porous media. Theoretical and numerical analyses have been performed to compare the solutions between the original geometric model and the reduced model in reservoirs containing fractures with complex geometries. We prove that the two solutions are close and, therefore, the reduced model can be effectively used in large scale simulators for long and thin fractures with complicated geometry.},

Furthermore, by Fourier transform and the weighted energy method, we will prove that traveling front solutions with noncritical speeds are also globally exponentially stable in the form of t − 1 2 e − ν t for some positive constant ν when the initial perturbations around these solutions are in some weighted Sobolev spaces.

Current application of the method involves exact and asymptotic evaluation of the generalized Stieltjes transform ∫ 0 a f ( x ) / ( ω + x ) ρ d x under the assumption that the extension of f ( x ) in the complex plane is entire. In this paper, the method is elaborated further and extended to accommodate the presence of competing singularities of the complex extension of f ( x ). Finite-part integration is then applied to derive consequences of known Stieltjes integral representations of the Gauss function and the generalized hypergeometric function that involve Stieltjes transforms of functions with complex extensions having singularities in the complex plane. Transformation equations for the Gauss function are obtained from which known transformation equations are shown to follow. In addition, building on the results for the Gauss function, transformation equations involving the generalized hypergeometric function 3 F 2 are derived.},

We study the behavior of a simpler, one dimensional, XY chain with periodic boundary and strong interactions, but rather than concentrating on the equilibrium measure, we try to understand its dynamics. The equivalent of the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition in this one-dimensional case happens when the interaction strength scales like the size of system N , yet we show that a sharp transition for the dynamics occurs at the scale of log N . When the interactions are weaker than a certain threshold, topological phases could not be observed over long times, while for interactions that are stronger than that threshold, topological phases become metastable, surviving for diverging time scales.},

  abstract     = {Around the large non-constant steady state, we show the existence and uniqueness of the global solution of the three-dimensional Cauchy problem of the semiconductor equations without or with the magnetic field effect. Without the magnetic field effect, we prove that the solution converges to the non-constant steady state exponentially fast as time goes to infinity. With the magnetic field effect, the optimal algebraic time-decay rates of the lower-order derivatives of the solution are obtained. Our results manifest that the degenerate dissipation of the magnetic field slows down the decay rates of the whole solution.},

The degeneracy of this type is sometimes referred to as exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD). Our focus here is on the simplest of our circuits featuring EPDs that are composed of only two LC -loops coupled by a gyrator. These circuits, when near an EPD state, can be used for enhanced sensitivity applications. With that in mind, we develop here a comprehensive perturbation theory for these simple circuits near an EPD. Using this theory, we propose an approach to sensing, allowing one to benefit from the proximity to an EPD on the one hand when providing for stable operation on the other hand. We also address a broader scope of problems related to perturbations of Jordan blocks and their numerical treatment that allow us to effectively detect proximity to Jordan blocks.},

  abstract     = {A correspondence is established between measure-preserving, ergodic dynamics of a classical harmonic oscillator and a quantum mechanical gauge theory on two-dimensional Minkowski space. This correspondence is realized through an isometric embedding of the L 2 ( μ ) space on the circle associated with the oscillator’s invariant measure, μ , into a Hilbert space H of sections of a C -line bundle over Minkowski space. This bundle is equipped with a covariant derivative induced from an SO + (1, 1) gauge field on the corresponding inertial frame bundle, satisfying the Yang–Mills equations. Under this embedding, the Hamiltonian operator of a Lorentz-invariant quantum system, constructed as a geometrical Laplace-type operator on bundle sections, pulls back to the generator of the unitary group of Koopman operators governing the evolution of classical observables of the harmonic oscillator, with Koopman eigenfunctions of zero, positive, and negative eigenfrequencies corresponding to quantum eigenstates of zero (“vacuum”), positive (“matter”), and negative (“antimatter”) energies. The embedding also induces a pair of operators acting on classical observables of the harmonic oscillator, exhibiting canonical position–momentum commutation relationships. These operators have the structure of order-1/2 fractional derivatives and therefore display a form of non-locality. In a second part of this work, we study a quantum mechanical representation of the classical harmonic oscillator using a one-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, K ^ τ ⁠ , associated with the time- τ transition kernel of a fractional diffusion on the circle. As shown in recent work, these spaces are unital Banach * -algebras of functions. It is found that the evolution of classical observables in these spaces takes place via a strongly continuous, unitary Koopman evolution group, which exhibits a stronger form of classical–quantum consistency than the L 2 ( μ ) case. Specifically, for every real-valued classical observable in K ^ τ ⁠ , there exists a quantum mechanical observable, whose expectation value is consistent with classical function evaluation. This allows for a description of classical state space dynamics, classical statistics, and quantum statistics of the harmonic oscillator within a unified framework.},

These contributions capture the long distance or infrared behavior of the amplitude. The boundary parameterizes degenerations of genus g super Riemann surfaces. A holomorphic projection of the supermoduli space onto its reduced space would then provide a way to integrate the holomorphic, superstring measure and thereby give the superstring vacuum amplitude at g -loop order. However, such a projection does not generally exist over the bulk of the supermoduli spaces in higher genera. Nevertheless, certain boundary divisors in ∂ M ̄ g may holomorphically map onto a bosonic space upon composition with universal morphisms, thereby enabling an integration of the holomorphic, superstring measure here. Making use of ansatz factorizations of the superstring measure near the boundary, our analysis shows that the boundary contributions to the three loop vacuum amplitude will vanish in closed oriented type II superstring theory with unbroken spacetime supersymmetry.},

These ensure that the n -shot coherent information is differentiable and allows for the computation of its gradient and Hessian. We show that any tensor products of critical points preserve being a critical point of the coherent information. Furthermore, we show that for any positive integer n , the maximally mixed state is always a critical point for the class of mixed unitary quantum channels with orthogonal, unitary Kraus operators. We determine when the maximally mixed state is a local maximum/minimum or saddle point, including its eigenvectors, for the class of Pauli-erasure channels when n is equal to 1. This class includes the dephrasure channel and Pauli channel and refines potential regions where super-additivity is thought to occur. These techniques can be used to study other optimization problems over density matrices and allow the use of manifold optimization algorithms and a better understanding of the quantum capacity problem by utilizing the first and second order geometry.},

  abstract     = {In this work, it is shown that there is an inherent nonlinear evolution in the dynamics of the so-called generalized coherent states. To show this, the immersion of a classical manifold into the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is employed. Then, one may parameterize the time dependence of the wave function through the variation of parameters in the classical manifold. Therefore, the immersion allows us to consider the so-called principle of analogy , i.e., using the procedures and structures available from the classical setting to employ them in the quantum framework.},

Particularly, we concentrate on the so-called PT-broken phase, where two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian turn out to be a complex-conjugate pair. In this case, we find that the transition probabilities will be unbounded in the limit of infinite time t → + ∞ . However, after performing a connection between a non-Hermitian system, which exhibits passive PT symmetry and global decay, and the neutral-meson system in particle physics, we observe that the diverging behavior of the transition probabilities is actually applicable to the gauge-transformed neutral-meson states, whereas the transition probabilities for physical states are exponentially suppressed by the global decay. We also present a brief review on the situation at the so-called exceptional point, where both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian coalesce.},

This leads to a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering. We explore the utility of this formulation in the study of the low-energy behavior of the scattering data. In particular, for the exponentially decaying potentials, we devise a simple iterative scheme for computing terms of arbitrary order in the series expansion of M in powers of the wavenumber. The coefficients of this series are determined in terms of a pair of solutions of the zero-energy stationary Schrödinger equation. We introduce a transfer matrix for the latter equation, express it in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective two-level quantum system, and use it to obtain a perturbative series expansion for the solutions of the zero-energy stationary Schrödinger equation. Our approach allows for identifying the zero-energy resonances for scattering potentials in both full line and half-line with zeros of the entries of the zero-energy transfer matrix of the potential or its trivial extension to the full line.},

Moreover, the algebra provides the tools for their analysis without having to rely on ad hoc prescriptions for the test of pertinent features, such as the appearance of Bose–Einstein condensates. The method is illustrated in the case of non-interacting systems in any number of spatial dimensions and sheds new light on the appearance of condensates.

Analogous localization properties can also be established for the eigenvectors of a discrete Schrödinger matrix. This note shows, perhaps surprisingly, that one can replace a discrete Schrödinger matrix by any real symmetric Z -matrix and still obtain eigenvector localization estimates. In the case of a real symmetric non-singular M -matrix A (which is a situation that arises in several contexts, including random matrix theory and statistical physics), the landscape function u = A −1 1 plays the role of an effective potential of localization. Starting from this potential, one can create an Agmon-type distance function governing the exponential decay of the eigenfunctions away from the “wells” of the potential, a typical eigenfunction being localized to a single such well.},

In previous works, the expressions for the form factor amplitudes appearing under the integrals were either again represented as multiple integrals or in terms of Fredholm determinants. Here, we obtain a representation which reduces, in the zero-temperature limit, essentially to a product of two determinants of finite matrices whose entries are known special functions.

In the chemo-attractive setting, our results cover and unify separate cases and they are critical to the quite known blow-up results in the existing literature, while, in the chemo-repulsive setting, we find that much wider regimes compared to the attraction case can ensure global existence and boundedness. In comparison to the known results on the dichotomy between global solvability and blow-up for the associated chemo-attraction system, our findings reveal that the strong damping effect of chemo-repulsion prevents blow-up. Furthermore, our 3D local-in-time boundedness moves one step further toward the yet-to-be-proven popular saying that no blow-up would occur in the 3D minimal chemo-repulsion model.},

This system describes the evolution of cells that react on two different chemical signals in a liquid surrounding environment and models a density-suppressed motility in the process of stripe pattern formation through the self-trapping mechanism. The major difficulty in analysis comes from the possible degeneracy of diffusion as c and v tend to infinite. Based on a new weighted energy method, it is proved that under appropriate assumptions on parameter functions, this system possesses a unique global classical solution, which is uniformly-in-time bounded. Moreover, by means of energy functionals, it is shown that the global bounded solution of the system exponentially converges to the constant steady state.},

The local well-posedness of the equation in Besov spaces is derived by using Littlewood–Paley decomposition and transport equation theory. Then, we show that a finite maximal life span for a solution necessarily implies wave breaking for this solution and give a condition on the initial data to ensure wave breaking for this equation by making use of the method of characteristics; otherwise, the equation has a global smooth solution. In addition, we establish persistence results for solutions of the equation in weighted L p spaces for a large class of moderate weights.},

  abstract     = {We study the algebra R of G -invariant representative functions over the N -fold Cartesian product of copies of a compact Lie group G modulo the action of conjugation by the diagonal subgroup. Using the representation theory of G on the Hilbert space H = L 2 ( G N ) G ⁠ , we construct a subset of G -invariant representative functions, which, by standard theorems, span H and thus generate R ⁠ . The elements of this basis will be referred to as quasicharacters. For N = 1, they coincide with the ordinary irreducible group characters of G . The form of the quasicharacters depends on the choice of a certain unitary G -representation isomorphism, or reduction scheme, for every isomorphism class of irreps of G . We determine the multiplication law of R in terms of the quasicharacters with structure constants. Next, we use the one-to-one correspondence between complete bracketing schemes for the reduction of multiple tensor products of G -representations and rooted binary trees. This provides a link to the recoupling theory for G -representations. Using these tools, we prove that the structure constants of the algebra R are given by a certain type of recoupling coefficients of G -representations. For these recouplings, we derive a reduction law in terms of a product over primitive elements of 9 j symbol type. The latter may be further expressed in terms of sums over products of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients of G . For G = SU(2), everything boils down to combinatorics of angular momentum theory. In the final part, we show that the above calculus enables us to calculate the matrix elements of bi-invariant operators occurring in quantum lattice gauge theory. In particular, both the quantum Hamiltonian and the orbit type relations may be dealt with in this way, thus reducing both the construction of the costratification and the study of the spectral problem to numerical problems in linear algebra. We spell out the spectral problem for G = SU(2), and we present sample calculations of matrix elements of orbit type relations for the gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3). The methods developed in this paper may be useful in the study of virtually any quantum model with polynomial constraints related to some symmetry.},

They are eigenvectors of the sinc-kernel operator Q c ⁠ : the time- and band-limiting operator. The corresponding eigenvalues play a key role, and the aim of this paper is to obtain precise non-asymptotic estimates with explicit constants related to the spectrum of Q c ⁠ . This issue is rarely studied in the literature, while the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum of Q c has been well established from the 1960s. However, many recent applications require such non-asymptotic behavior. As applications of our non-asymptotic estimates, we first provide estimates for the constants appearing in the Remez- and Turàn–Nazarov-type concentration inequalities. Then, we give a non-asymptotic upper bound for the gap probability of the sinc determinantal point process. Consequently, one gets a non-asymptotic estimate for the hole probability, associated with bulk scaled asymptotics of a random matrix from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. This last result can be considered as a complement of the various and more involved asymptotic counterparts of this estimate.},

A 278 (1279), 137–174 (1975)], we provide a rigorous semiclassical analysis of the scattering coefficients, the Bohr–Sommerfeld condition for the location of the eigenvalues, and their corresponding norming constants. Our analysis is motivated by the potential applications to the focusing cubic NLS equation, in view of the well-known fact discovered by Zakharov and Shabat [Sov. Phys. JETP 34 (1), 62 (1972)] that the spectral analysis of the Dirac operator is the basis of the solution of the NLS equation via inverse scattering theory.

  abstract     = {This work has two aims. The first is to develop a Lagrange–Hamilton framework for the analysis of multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems in which non-conservative effects are included in the variational principle of least action from the outset. The framework is a generalization of the Bateman approach in which a set of adjoint coordinates is introduced. A function termed the M -function is introduced as the Fourier transform over the momenta of the joint probability density function (JPDF) of the displacements and momenta, and it is shown that for statistical systems, this function can be written as an expectation involving the new principle function and a general dimensional constant ℏ . This leads to a concise derivation of the Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov equation. It is found that the equation governing the M -function can be expressed in terms of the new Hamiltonian by replacing momenta by differential operators, meaning that the function satisfies the same equation as the quantum wave function. This gives rise to the second aim of this work: to explore relations between the developed classical framework and quantum mechanics. It is shown that for an undamped linear system, the solution of the M -function equation yields the response JPDF as a sum of Wigner functions. This classical analysis leads to a number of well-known results from quantum mechanics as ℏ → 0, and the extension of this result to nonlinear systems is discussed. The quantum wave function associated with the Hamiltonian is then considered, and the relevance of this function to the physical system is discussed.},

Using the basic algebraic properties of the electromagnetic field tensor, we examine the motion of a charge in a constant electromagnetic field. Its world line is a combination of hyperbolic and circular orbits that lie in three mutually orthogonal sheets of two dimensions. Within the braneworld scenario, we project the theory on the de Sitter space of four dimensions. As it turns out, spins of elementary particles themselves are manifestations of extra dimensions.},

Under a choice of ansatz for the perturbation and a gauge choice, the linearized vacuum Einstein equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem for a single function. In this work, a suitable rescaling and change of variables is applied, which casts the ODE into a Schrödinger eigenvalue equation to which an energy functional is assigned. It is then shown by direct variational methods that the lowest eigenfunction gives rise to an exponentially growing mode solution, which has admissible behavior at the future event horizon and spacelike infinity. After the addition of a pure gauge solution, this gives rise to a regular exponentially growing mode solution of the linearized vacuum Einstein equation in harmonic/transverse-traceless gauge.},

Although the string tension is generically of a square-root form, it turns out that all existing Bogomol’nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield solutions have a tension that is linear in the magnetic fluxes, which, in turn, are linearly related to the winding numbers. The main result is a series of theorems establishing three different kinds of solutions of the so-called constraint equations, which can be pictured as orthogonal directions to the magnetic flux in SU(2) R space. We further prove for all cases that a seemingly vanishing Bogomol’nyi bound cannot have solutions. Finally, we write down the most general vortex equations in both master form and Taubes-like form.

  abstract     = {The mode solutions of the Dirac equation on N -dimensional de Sitter space–time ( dS N ) with ( N − 1)-sphere spatial sections are obtained by analytically continuing the spinor eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator on the N -sphere ( S N ). The analogs of flat space–time positive frequency modes are identified, and a vacuum is defined. The transformation properties of the mode solutions under the de Sitter group double cover [Spin( N ,1)] are studied. We reproduce the expression for the massless spinor Wightman two-point function in closed form using the mode-sum method. By using this closed-form expression and taking advantage of the maximal symmetry of dS N , we find an analytic expression for the spinor parallel propagator. The latter is used to construct the massive Wightman two-point function in closed form.},

  abstract     = {Metric-affine and generalized geometries are arguably the appropriate mathematical frameworks for Einstein’s theory of gravity and low-energy effective string field theory, respectively. In fact, mathematical structures in a metric-affine geometry are constructed on the tangent bundle, which is itself a Lie algebroid, whereas those in generalized geometries, which form the basis of double field theories, are constructed on Courant algebroids. Lie, Courant, and higher Courant algebroids, which are used in exceptional field theories, are all known to be special cases of pre-Leibniz algebroids. As mathematical structures on these algebroids are essential in string models, it is natural to work on a more unifying geometrical framework. Provided with some additional ingredients, the construction of such geometries can all be carried over to regular pre-Leibniz algebroids. We define below the notions of locality structures and locality projectors, which are some necessary ingredients. In terms of these structures, E -metric-connection geometries are constructed with (possibly) a minimum number of assumptions. Certain small gaps in the literature are also filled as we go along. E -Koszul connections, as a generalization of Levi–Cività connections, are defined and shown to be helpful for some results including a simple generalization of the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry. The existence and non-existence of E -Levi–Cività connections are discussed for certain cases. We also show that metric-affine geometries can be constructed in a unique way as special cases of E -metric-connection geometries. Some aspects of Lie and Lie-type algebroids are studied, where the latter are defined here as a generalization of Lie algebroids. Moreover, generalized geometries are shown to follow as special cases, and various properties of linear generalized-connections are proven in the present framework. Similarly, uniqueness of the locality projector in the case of exact Courant algebroids is proven, a result that explains why the curvature operator, defined with a projector in the double field theory literature, is a necessity.},

Indeed, we argue that the generalized constraints are most restrictive in (effective) few-fermion settings with low Hilbert space dimension.},

In this paper, we consider the classification of GBS sets in C 5 ⊗ C 5 ⁠ . First, two simple and useful characterizations of LU-equivalence of GBS sets are given. Then, one characterization is used to divide all 12 650 sets of four GBSs into eight equivalence classes including six locally distinguishable classes and two classes that cannot be discriminated by one-way local operations and classical communication. The second characterization is powerful and can be used to write a program, by using which all C 25 5 ( = 53 130 ) sets of five GBSs in C 5 ⊗ C 5 are divided into 21 equivalence classes including 9 locally distinguishable classes and 12 locally indistinguishable classes.},

  abstract     = {Non-Abelian geometric phases have been proposed as an essential ingredient in logical gate implementation—their geometric nature guarantees their invariance under reparameterizations of the associated cyclic path in parameter space. However, they are still dependent on deformations of that path due to noise. The first question that we tackle in this work is how to quantify in a meaningful way this effect of noise, focusing, for concreteness, on the nuclear quadrupole resonance Hamiltonian—other systems of this nature can clearly be treated analogously. We consider a precessing magnetic field that drives adiabatically a degenerate doublet and is subjected to noise, the effects of which on the Wilczek–Zee holonomy are computed analytically. A critical review of previous related works reveals a series of assumptions, such as sudden jumps in the field, or the presence of white noise, that might violate adiabaticity. We propose a state-independent measure of the effect and then consider sinusoidal noise in the field of random amplitude and phase. We find that all integer noise frequencies m ≠ 2 behave similarly in a manner reminiscent of the Abelian case, but that noise of frequency m = 2 has a very different and, at the same time, very pronounced effect, which might well affect robustness estimations.},

We discuss a class of nonlocal games called synchronous linear constraint system (syncLCS) games. We unify two algebraic approaches to studying syncLCS games and relate these games to nonlocal games played on graphs, known as graph isomorphism games. In more detail, syncLCS games are nonlocal games that verify whether or not two players share a solution to a given system of equations. Two algebraic objects associated with these games encode information about the existence of perfect strategies. They are called the game algebra and the solution group. Here, we show that these objects are essentially the same, i.e., the game algebra is a suitable quotient of the group algebra of the solution group. We also demonstrate that syncLCS games are equivalent to graph isomorphism games on a pair of graphs parameterized by the linear system.},

From these solutions, some researchers have derived a variety of predictions such as allowed angular frequencies, allowed field intensities, and the like. We also solve the eigenvalue equation numerically by means of the variational Rayleigh–Ritz method and compare the resulting eigenvalues with those provided by the truncation condition.

We then derive a stationary perturbation theory for the radial Schrödinger equation for scattering from a spherically symmetric potential. A resulting advantage over the more commonly used Green function method is that the expression for the interacting state vector is normalized to each order in the coupling constant, unlike, in general, the result of the Green function method. Other authors have applied the unitary transformation concept to time-dependent perturbation theory to give unitarity of the time evolution operator to each order in perturbation theory, with results that show improvement over the standard perturbation theory. In this paper, general formulas are obtained for the phase shifts at the first and second order in the coupling constant. We test the method on a simple system with a known exact solution and find complete agreement between our first- and second-order contributions to the s -wave phase shifts and the corresponding expansion to the second order of the exact solution.},

Making use of the Lévy path integral method, we derive the Lévy path integral amplitude of the particle and take advantage of it to get the solution of the fractional Schrödinger equation for an infinite wall. Then, the infinite wall potential with a delta-function perturbation is also studied. According to Fox’s H -function, we get an equation of bound state energies of a free particle moving in an infinite wall region perturbed by the δ -function for two situations, E 0. We give a transcendental equation that determines energy levels when E 0. The asymptotic behaviors of the center of the delta function approaching to the origin and the infinite are also shown.

Then, it is enhanced to three *-calculi by defining three appropriate involution maps on the quantum super-algebra. Two of the *-structures correspond to quantum complex super-algebra and the other correspond to a quantum real one. An appropriate quantum super-Hopf algebra including two even and two odd generators and also its corresponding quantum super-group are introduced. Compared to the quantum super-algebra, the quantum super-group also has three different *-structures. It is shown that the differential calculus over the quantum super-algebra is left-covariant with respect to the quantum super-group. Besides, it is shown that the graded differential algebra for the case q = 1 is a bicovariant bimodule over the undeformed Hopf supersymmetry algebra.},

This assumption recovers the exponential and polynomial rates when G ( s ) = s p and p covers the full admissible range 1 , 2 ⁠ .

  abstract     = {We consider possible quantum effects for infinite systems implied by variations of the multiplication law in the algebra of observables. Using the algebraic formulation of quantum theory, we study the behavior of states ω under changes in the defining relations of the canonical commutation relations (CCR-algebra). These defining relations of the multiplication law depend explicitly on the symplectic form σ, which encodes commutation relations of canonical field operators. We consider the change in this form given by simple rescaling of σ by a positive parameter h . We analyze to what extent changes in h preserve the original state space (this gives restrictions on the admissible changes in the scaling parameter h ) and which properties have original quantum states ω as states on the new algebra. We answer such questions for the quasi-free states. We show that any universally invariant state can be interpreted as a convex combination of Fock states with different values of constant h . The second important class of states we study is the KMS-state; here, the rescaling alters in a nontrivial way the relevant dynamics. We also show that it is possible to go beyond the limits restricting the changes in h , but then one has to restrict the CCR-algebra to a subalgebra.},

The proof is based on recurrence relations for graph weights related to the Kirkwood–Salsburg integral equation for correlation functions.

For this model, we find a precise asymptotic law for the corresponding zero density functions, in both short range (around the boundary) and long range (far away from the boundary) regimes. As a corollary, we were able to find a logarithmic negative bias for the total nodal length of this ensemble relative to the rotation invariant model of random spherical harmonics. Jean Bourgain’s research, and his enthusiastic approach to the nodal geometry of Laplace eigenfunctions, has made a crucial impact in the field and the current trends within. His works on the spectral correlations {Theorem 2.2 in the work of Krishnapur et al. [Ann. Math. 177 (2), 699–737 (2013)]} and Bombieri and Bourgain [Int. Math. Res. Not.

Furthermore, Bourgain’s work [J. Bourgain, Isr. J. Math. 201 (2), 611–630 (2014)] on toral Laplace eigenfunctions, also appealing to spectral correlations, allowed for inferring deterministic results from their random Gaussian counterparts.},

In this paper, conditions are derived that ensure that an extended configuration—a configuration in a space one-dimension higher—satisfies these ⋁-conditions. Such a construction utilizes the notion of a small orbit, as defined in Serganova [Commun. Algebra, 24 , 4281–4299 (1996)]. Symmetries of such resulting solutions to the WDVV equations are studied, in particular, Legendre transformations. It is shown that these Legendre transformations map extended-rational solutions to trigonometric solutions, and for certain values of the free data, one obtains a transformation from extended ⋁-systems to the trigonometric almost-dual solutions corresponding to the classical extended affine Weyl groups.},

This description, however, proceeded via the exceptional Jordan algebras J 3 ( O ) , J 2 ( O ) and, in this sense, remained indirect. One of the goals of this paper is to provide as explicit a description as possible and also to clarify the underlying geometry. The other goal is to emphasize the role played by different complex structures in the spaces O and O 2 ⁠ . We provide a new characterization of G SM : The group G SM is the subgroup of Spin(9) that commutes with a certain complex structure J R in the space O 2 of Spin(9) spinors. The complex structure J R is parameterized by a choice of a unit imaginary octonion. This characterization of G SM is essentially octonionic in the sense that J R is restrictive because octonions are non-associative. The quaternionic analog of J R is the complex structure in the space H 2 of Spin(5) spinors that commutes with all Spin(5) transformations.},

  abstract     = {The term “particle–hole symmetry” is beset with conflicting meanings in contemporary physics. Conceived and written from a condensed-matter standpoint, the present paper aims to clarify and sharpen the terminology. In that vein, we propose to define the operation of “particle–hole conjugation” as the tautological algebra automorphism that simply swaps single-fermion creation and annihilation operators, and we construct its invariant lift to the Fock space. Particle–hole symmetries then arise for gapful or gapless free-fermion systems at half filling, as the concatenation of particle–hole conjugation with one or another involution that reverses the sign of the first-quantized Hamiltonian. We illustrate that construction principle with a series of examples including the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model and the Kitaev–Majorana chain. For an enhanced perspective, we contrast particle–hole symmetries with the charge-conjugation symmetry of relativistic Dirac fermions. We go on to present two major applications in the realm of interacting electrons. For one, we offer a heuristic argument that the celebrated Haldane phase of antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains is adiabatically connected to a free-fermion topological phase protected by a particle–hole symmetry. For another, we review the recent proposal by Son [Phys. Rev. X 5 , 031027 (2015)] for a particle–hole conjugation symmetric effective field theory of the half-filled lowest Landau level, and we comment on the emerging microscopic picture of the composite fermion.},

  abstract     = {In the network of seed mutations arising from a certain initial seed, an appropriate path emanating from the initial seed is intendedly chosen, noticing periodicity of exchange matrices in the path each of which is assigned to the generalized Cartan matrix of type A N ( 1 ) ⁠ . Then, the dynamical property of seed mutations along the path, which is referred to as of type A N ( 1 ) ⁠ , is intensively investigated. The coefficients assigned to the path form certain N monomials that possess periodicity with period N under seed mutations and enable us to obtain the general terms of the coefficients. The cluster variables assigned to the path of type A N ( 1 ) also form certain N Laurent polynomials possessing the same periodicity as the monomials generated by the coefficients. These Laurent polynomials lead to a sufficient number of conserved quantities of the dynamical system derived from cluster mutations along the path. Furthermore, by virtue of the Laurent polynomials with periodicity, the dynamical system is non-autonomously linearized and its general solution is concretely constructed. Thus, seed mutations along the path of type A N ( 1 ) exhibit discrete integrability.},

We show that they also hold for multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials, which are new orthogonal polynomials obtained by deforming these classical orthogonal polynomials. The discrete orthogonality relations could be considered as a more encompassing characterization of orthogonal polynomials than the three term recurrence relations. As the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials start at a positive degree ℓ D ≥ 1 ⁠ , the three term recurrence relations are broken. The extra ℓ D “lower degree polynomials,” which are necessary for the discrete orthogonality relations, are identified. The corresponding Christoffel numbers are determined. The main results are obtained by the blow-up analysis of the second order differential operators governing the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials around the zeros of these polynomials at a degree ℓ D + N ⁠ . The discrete orthogonality relations are shown to hold for another group of “new” orthogonal polynomials called Krein–Adler polynomials based on the Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials.},

This generalizes earlier results relating determinants and Pfaffians of minors of skew symmetric matrices, with applications to Schur functions and Schur Q -functions. It is deduced using the representations of KP and BKP τ -functions as vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of products of fermionic operators of charged and neutral type, respectively. The lattice is generated by the insertion of products of pairs of charged creation and annihilation operators. The result follows from expanding the product as a sum of monomials in the neutral fermionic generators and applying a factorization theorem for VEVs of products of operators in the mutually commuting subalgebras. Applications include the case of inhomogeneous polynomial τ -functions of KP and BKP type.},

These four structure operators realize special limit cases of the trigonometric degeneration of the original Sklyanin algebra. Finite-dimensional representations of these algebras are obtained from a truncation condition. The corresponding representation bases are finite families of polynomials: the para-Krawtchouk and q -para-Krawtchouk ones. A natural algebraic interpretation of these polynomials that had been missing is thus obtained.

Our working tool is a coordinate system that had many useful properties in considering central configurations of three, four, and five bodies. From this equilateral solution, projecting to three dimensions, we compute concave and convex five-body central configurations of five different positive masses. We discover the possibility of geometric symmetry of these solutions when two of the masses are equal. Then we study the plane symmetric central configurations with a kite figure. This figure has three masses on the symmetry axis of the kite and two equal masses symmetrically placed on a transversal orthogonal line to the axis. Our parameters are now the masses and the distances along the axis of symmetry. The distances are measured with respect to the crossing point of the diagonals. In this paper, we find and solve a linear equation for these three masses in terms of the distances.

In some metals, including the Dirac fluid of nearly charge neutral graphene, microscopic transport is not governed by diffusion, but by a more complicated set of linearized hydrodynamic equations, which form a system of degenerate elliptic equations coupled with the Stokes equation for fluid velocity. In sufficiently inhomogeneous media, these hydrodynamic equations reduce to homogenized diffusion equations. We recast the hydrodynamic transport equations as the infimum of a functional over conserved currents and present a functional framework to model and compute the homogenized diffusion tensor relating electrical and thermal currents to charge and temperature gradients. We generalize to this system to the well-known results in homogenization theory: Tartar’s proof of local convergence to the homogenized theory in periodic and highly oscillatory media and sub-additivity of the above functional in random media with highly oscillatory, stationary, and ergodic coefficients.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the following critical Dirac equation − i ε ∑ k = 1 3 α k ∂ k u + a β u + V ( x ) u = P ( x ) f ( | u | ) u + Q ( x ) | u | u , x ∈ R 3 ⁠ , where ɛ &gt; 0 is a small parameter; a &gt; 0 is a constant; α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , and β are 4 × 4 Pauli–Dirac matrices; and V , P , Q , and f are continuous but are not necessarily of class C 1 ⁠ . We prove the existence and concentration of semiclassical solutions under suitable assumptions on the potentials V ( x ), P ( x ), and Q ( x ) by using variational methods. We also show the semiclassical solutions ω ɛ with maximum points x ɛ of | ω ɛ | concentrating at a special set H P characterized by V ( x ), P ( x ), and Q ( x ) and for any sequence x ε → x 0 ∈ H P , v ε ( x ) ≔ ω ε ( ε x + x ε ) converges in W 1 , q ( R 3 , C 4 ) for q ≥ 2 to a ground state solution u of − i ∑ k = 1 3 α k ∂ k u + a β u + V ( x 0 ) u = P ( x 0 ) f ( | u | ) u + Q ( x 0 ) | u | u , in R 3 ⁠ . Finally, we estimate the exponential decay properties of solutions.},
