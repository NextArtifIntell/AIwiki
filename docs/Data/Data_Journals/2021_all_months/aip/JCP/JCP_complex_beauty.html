  abstract = {Understanding the behavior of a complex gene regulatory network is a fundamental but challenging task in systems biology. How to reduce the large number of degrees of freedom of a specific network and identify its main biological pathway is the key issue. In this paper, we utilized the transition path theory (TPT) and Markov state modeling (MSM) framework to numerically study two typical cell fate decision processes: the lysis–lysogeny transition and stem cell development. The application of TPT to the lysis–lysogeny decision-making system reveals that the competitions of CI and Cro dimer binding play the major role in determining the cell fates. We also quantified the transition rates from the lysogeny to lysis state under different conditions. The overall computational results are consistent with biological intuitions but with more detailed information. For the stem cell developmental system, we applied the MSM to reduce the original dynamics to a moderate-size Markov chain. Further spectral analysis showed that the reduced system exhibits nine metastable states, which correspond to the refinement of the five known typical cell types in development. We further investigated the dominant transition pathways corresponding to the cell differentiation, reprogramming, and trans -differentiation. A similar approach can be applied to study other biological systems.},

  abstract = {The growing interest in the dynamics of self-driven particle motion has brought increased attention to the effects of non-thermal noise on condensed phase diffusion. Thanks to data recently collected by Ferrer et al. on activated dynamics in the presence of memory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 , 108001 (2021)], some of these effects can now be characterized quantitatively . In the present paper, the data collected by Ferrer et al. are used to calculate the extent to which non-thermal white noise alters the time taken by single micron-sized silica particles in a viscoelastic medium to cross the barrier separating the two wells of an optically created bistable potential. The calculation—based on a generalized version of Kramers’s flux-over-population approach—indicates that the added noise causes the barrier crossing rate (compared to the noise-free case) to first increase as a function of the noise strength and then to plateau to a constant value. The precise degree of rate enhancement may depend on how the data from the experiments conducted by Ferrer et al. are used in the flux-over-population approach. As claimed by Ferrer et al. , this approach predicts barrier crossing times for the original silica-fluid system that agree almost perfectly with their experimental counterparts. However, this near-perfect agreement between theory and experiment is only achieved if the theoretical crossing times are obtained from the most probable values of a crossing time distribution constructed from the distributions of various parameters in Kramers’s rate expression. If the mean values of these parameters are used in the expression instead, as would be commonly done, the theoretical crossing times are found to be as much as 1.5 times higher than the experimental values. However, these times turn out to be consistent with an alternative model of viscoelastic barrier crossing based on a mean first passage time formalism, which also uses mean parameter values in its rate expression. The rate enhancements predicted for barrier crossing under non-thermal noise are based on these mean parameter values and are open to experimental verification.},

Here, we study how the transition kinetics of an internal “switch” of responsive macromolecules is modified collectively by their spatial packing. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations of a model of Responsive Colloids, in which an explicit internal degree of freedom—here, the particle size—moving in a bimodal energy landscape self-consistently responds to the density fluctuations of the crowded environment. We demonstrate that populations and transition times for the two-state switching kinetics can be tuned over one order of magnitude by “self-crowding.” An exponential scaling law derived from a combination of Kramers’ and liquid state perturbation theory is in very good agreement with the simulations.},

  abstract = {Ligand coated nanoparticles are complex objects consisting of a metallic or semiconductor core with organic ligands grafted on their surface. These organic ligands provide stability to a nanoparticle suspension. In solutions, the effective interactions between such nanoparticles are mediated through a complex interplay of interactions between the nanoparticle cores, the surrounding ligands, and the solvent molecules. While it is possible to compute these interactions using fully atomistic molecular simulations, such computations are too expensive for studying self-assembly of a large number of nanoparticles. The problem can be made tractable by removing the degrees of freedom associated with the ligand chains and solvent molecules and using the potentials of mean force (PMF) between nanoparticles. In general, the functional dependence of the PMF on the inter-particle distance is unknown and can be quite complex. In this article, we present a method to model the two-body and three-body PMF between ligand coated nanoparticles through a linear combination of symmetry functions. The method is quite general and can be extended to model interactions between different types of macromolecules.},

Stoichiometric QDs having an In:P atom ratio very near unity exhibit simple luminescence kinetics. The photoluminescence (PL) rises with the 40 ps instrument response function and exhibits a decay that is close to a single exponential with a time constant that decreases from 32 to 28 ns with increasing shell thickness. QDs having excess indium (In:P ratio of 1.15–1.63) show a significant component of a slower rise time assigned to transient population of indium-based hole traps in the ZnSe shell. They also have a slower PL decay, attributed to an equilibrium between these traps, which are optically dark, and the emissive valence-band state. This results in a radiative lifetime that increases from 32 to 48 ns with increasing shell thickness. Different treatments of the InP cores prior to shell deposition result in different core/shell interfaces as indicated by resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as differences in the amplitude and timescale of the slow PL rise and the PL decay time. These are interpreted in terms of different radial distributions of the indium-based hole traps, which can be related to differences in the interfacial lattice strain.},

  abstract = {The reasons for the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen adsorption reaction in alkaline media remain a question still to be solved. This information is important to achieve a complete understanding of the mechanistic details that could lead to the production of key catalytic materials necessary for the development of a future hydrogen economy. For a better understanding of this reaction, it is important to acquire information about the thermodynamic parameters characteristic of the different steps in the reaction. Among these, the hydrogen adsorption is a key step in the process of hydrogen evolution. Although some debate still remains about the difference between adsorbed hydrogen in the underpotential deposition (UPD) region and at the overpotential deposition region, there is no doubt that understanding the former can help in the understanding of the latter. Making use of charge density measurements, we report on this paper a thermodynamic study of the hydrogen UPD process on Pt(111) in 0.05M NaOH over the range of temperatures from 283 ≤ T /K ≤ 313. The coulometric features corresponding to H UPD allow for the calculation of the hydrogen coverage and a fit to a Generalized Frumkin isotherm. From these values, different thermodynamic functions for the UPD reaction have been calculated: Δ G ads , Δ S ads , Δ H ads , and the Pt–H bond energy. From extrapolation, a value of Δ S a d s ◦ = − 7.5 ± 4 J mol − 1 K − 1 was found, which is very close to 0, much lower than previously reported measurements both in acid and in alkaline solutions. Such value has an effect on the enthalpy and bond energy calculations, the latter having a decreasing tendency with pH and coverage. This tendency is completely different from the acidic systems and implies that the change in the thermodynamic functions due to the formation of the double layer and the reorganization of interfacial water has a strong influence on the process in high pH solutions.},

Here, we report machine learning-driven simulations of various interfaces between water and lithium manganese oxide (Li x Mn 2 O 4 ), an important electrode material in lithium ion batteries and a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. We employ a high-dimensional neural network potential to compute the energies and forces several orders of magnitude faster than DFT without loss in accuracy. In addition, a high-dimensional neural network for spin prediction is utilized to analyze the electronic structure of the manganese ions. Combining these methods, a series of interfaces is investigated by large-scale molecular dynamics. The simulations allow us to gain insights into a variety of properties, such as the dissociation of water molecules, proton transfer processes, and hydrogen bonds, as well as the geometric and electronic structure of the solid surfaces, including the manganese oxidation state distribution, Jahn–Teller distortions, and electron hopping.},

In this work, the effect of two types of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) molecules, ethylene glycerol and lactic acid (LA), on electrochemical interfaces between the Au electrode and DESs has been investigated by employing voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The anodic dissolution and passivation behaviors of the Au electrode are revealed in both ethaline and ChCl:LA. In ChCl:LA, the anodic dissolution of Au is slowed down, and the passivation film is relatively dense and stable due to the existence of the carboxyl group in HBD molecule LA. In the double layer region, the lifting and formation of Au(111) surface reconstruction and a disorder–order phase transition of the chloride ion adlayer were observed in the two DESs. Moreover, compared with ethaline, an extra pair of current peaks appears in ChCl–LA possibly due to the adsorption and desorption of LA on the Au(111) surface, which might imply the stronger interaction of LA with the Au electrode in ChCl:LA. HBD LA could even have marked an impact on the disorder–order phase transition of the chloride ion adlayer. The above results provide new insight into the significant effect of HBD molecules on the anodic dissolution and the passivation of the Au electrode and the electrochemical behaviors in the double layer region.},

  abstract = {Applying diffusion coupled deformation theory, we investigate how the elastic properties of a solid body are modified when forced to keep its chemical potential aligned with that of its melt. The theory is implemented at the classical level of continuum mechanics, treating materials as simple continua defined by uniform constitutive relations. A phase boundary is a sharp dividing surface separating two continua in mechanical and chemical equilibrium. We closely follow the continuum theory of the swelling of elastomers (gels) but now applied to a simple two phase one-component system. The liquid is modeled by a local free energy density defining a chemical potential and hydrostatic pressure as usual. The model is extended to a solid by adding a non-linear shear elastic energy term with an effective modulus depending on density. Imposing chemomechanical equilibrium with the liquid reservoir reduces the bulk modulus of the solid to zero. The shear modulus remains finite. The stability of the hyper-compressible solid is investigated in a thought experiment. A mechanical load is applied to a rectangular bar under the constraint of fixed lateral dimensions. The linear elastic modulus for axial loading is evaluated and found to be larger than zero, implying that the bar, despite the zero bulk modulus, can support a weight placed on its upper surface. The weight is stabilized by the induced shear stress. The density dependence of the shear modulus is found to be a second order effect reducing the density of the stressed solid (chemostriction).},

The simulation cell—large enough to address the collective properties at the mesoscale—is validated by direct comparison with recent results on the dynamic structure factor in the frequency domain obtained by neutron spectroscopy with polarization analysis [Arbe et al. , Phys. Rev. Res. 2 , 022015 (2020)]. We have not only focused on the acoustic excitations but also on the relaxational contributions to S ( Q , t ). The analysis of the MD-simulation results—including the self- and distinct contributions to the diffusive part of S ( Q , t )—nicely explains why the relaxation process hardly depends on Q in the low Q -range ( Q ≤ 0.4 Å −1 ) and how it crosses over to a diffusion-driven process at Q ≈ Q max . Our simulations also give support to the main assumptions of the model used to fit the experimental data in the above mentioned paper. The application of such a model to the simulation S ( Q , t ) data delivers (i) results for the relaxation component of S ( Q , t ) in agreement with those obtained from neutron experiments and (ii) longitudinal and transverse hydrodynamic-like components with similar features than those identified in previous simulations of the longitudinal and transverse current spectra directly. On the other hand, in general, our MD-simulations results of S ( Q , t ) qualitatively agree with the viscoelastic transition framework habitually used to describe inelastic x-ray scattering results.},

  abstract = {Synchrotron x-ray scattering has been used to investigate three liquid polyalcohols of different sizes (glycerol, xylitol, and D-sorbitol) from above the glass transition temperatures T g to below. We focus on two structural orders: the association of the polar OH groups by hydrogen bonds (HBs) and the packing of the non-polar hydrocarbon groups. We find that the two structural orders evolve very differently, reflecting the different natures of bonding. Upon cooling from 400 K, the O⋯O correlation at 2.8 Å increases significantly in all three systems, indicating more HBs, until kinetic arrests at T g ; the increase is well described by an equilibrium between bonded and non-bonded OH with Δ H = 9.1 kJ/mol and Δ S = 13.4 J/mol/K. When heated above T g , glycerol loses the fewest HBs per OH for a given temperature rise scaled by T g , followed by xylitol and by D-sorbitol, in the same order the number of OH groups per molecule increases (3, 5, and 6). The pair correlation functions of all three liquids show exponentially damped density modulations of wavelength 4.5 Å, which are associated with the main scattering peak and with the intermolecular C⋯C correlation. In this respect, glycerol is the most ordered with the most persistent density ripples, followed by D-sorbitol and by xylitol. Heating above T g causes faster damping of the density ripples with the rate of change being the slowest in xylitol, followed by glycerol and by D-sorbitol. Given the different dynamic fragility of the three liquids (glycerol being the strongest and D-sorbitol being the most fragile), we relate our results to the current theories of the structural origin for the difference. We find that the fragility difference is better understood on the basis of the thermal stability of HB clusters than that of the structure associated with the main scattering peak.},

Lett. 105 , 088305 (2010)], the fluid particles can change in their surroundings, formed by other fluid particles or the matrix particles, their shape within the class of ellipsoids of revolution; such a change in shape is related to a change in energy, which is fed into suitably defined selection rules in the deformation “moves” of the Monte Carlo simulations. This concept represents a simple yet powerful model of realistic, deformable molecules with complex internal structures (such as dendrimers or polymers). For the evaluation of the properties of the system, we have used the well-known quenched-annealed protocol (with its characteristic double average prescription) and have analyzed the simulation data in terms of static properties (the radial distribution function and aspect ratio distribution of the ellipsoids) and dynamic features (notably the mean squared displacement). Our data provide evidence that the degree of deformability of the fluid particles has a distinct impact on the aforementioned properties of the system.},

In this study, we demonstrate that the organic phase structure and phase behavior are fundamentally connected in a way than can be understood with critical phenomena theory. For a series of binary mixtures of trialkyl phosphate extractants with linear alkane diluents, we combine small angle x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate how the organic phase mesostructure over a wide range of compositions is dominated by critical concentration fluctuations associated with the critical point of the third phase formation phase transition. These findings reconcile many longstanding inconsistencies in the literature where small angle scattering features, also consistent with such critical fluctuations, were interpreted as reverse micellar-like particles. Overall, this study shows how the organic phase mesostructure and phase behavior are intrinsically linked, deepening our understanding of both and providing a new framework for using molecular structure and thermodynamic variables to control mesostructure and phase behavior in liquid–liquid extraction.},

  abstract = {Materials with high dielectric constant, ε s , are desirable in a wide range of applications including energy storage and actuators. Recently, zwitterionic liquids have been reported to have the largest ε s of any liquid and, thus, have the potential to replace inorganic fillers to modulate the material ε s . Although the large ε s for zwitterionic liquids is attributed to their large molecular dipole, the role of chemical substituents attached to the zwitterion cation on ε s is not fully understood, which is necessary to enhance the performance of soft energy materials. Here, we report the impact of zwitterionic liquid cation chemical substituents on ε s (50 &lt; ε s &lt; 300 at room temperature). Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy reveals that molecular reorientation is the main contributor to the high ε s . The low Kirkwood factor g calculated for zwitterionic liquids (e.g., 0.1–0.2) suggests the tendency for the antiparallel zwitterion dipole alignment expected from the strong electrostatic intermolecular interactions. With octyl cation substituents, the g is decreased due to the formation of hydrophobic-rich domains that restrict molecular reorientation under applied electric fields. In contrast, when zwitterion cations are functionalized with ethylene oxide (EO) segments, g increases due to the EO segments interacting with the cations, allowing more zwitterion rotation in response to the applied field. The reported results suggest that high ε s zwitterionic liquids require a large molecular dipole, compositionally homogeneous liquids (e.g., no aggregation), a maximized zwitterion number density, and a high g , which is achievable by incorporating polar chemical substituents onto the zwitterion cations.},

  abstract = {Small systems have higher surface area-to-volume ratios than macroscopic systems. The thermodynamics of small systems therefore deviates from the description of classical thermodynamics. One consequence of this is that properties of small systems can be dependent on the system’s ensemble. By comparing the properties in grand canonical (open) and canonical (closed) systems, we investigate how a small number of particles can induce an ensemble dependence. Emphasis is placed on the insight that can be gained by investigating ideal gases. The ensemble equivalence of small ideal gas systems is investigated by deriving the properties analytically, while the ensemble equivalence of small systems with particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones or the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen potential is investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. For all the investigated small systems, we find clear differences between the properties in open and closed systems. For systems with interacting particles, the difference between the pressure contribution to the internal energy, and the difference between the chemical potential contribution to the internal energy, are both increasing with the number density. The difference in chemical potential is, with the exception of the density dependence, qualitatively described by the analytic formula derived for an ideal gas system. The difference in pressure, however, is not captured by the ideal gas model. For the difference between the properties in the open and closed systems, the response of increasing the particles’ excluded volume is similar to the response of increasing the repulsive forces on the system walls. This indicates that the magnitude of the difference between the properties in open and closed systems is related to the restricted movement of the particles in the system. The work presented in this paper gives insight into the mechanisms behind ensemble in-equivalence in small systems, and illustrates how a simple statistical mechanical model, such as the ideal gas, can be a useful tool in these investigations.},

Whole numbers enter chemistry in a different form: atomic oxidation states. They are not directly measurable and are determined instead from an agreed set of rules. Insulating liquids are a remarkable exception; Faraday’s experiment indeed measures the oxidation numbers of each dissociated component in the liquid phase, whose topological values are unambiguous. Ionic conductivity in insulating liquids is expressed in terms of the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating charge current at a given temperature in a zero electric field; topology plays a major role in this important observable as well. The existing literature deals with the above issues by adopting the independent-electron framework; here, I provide the many-body generalization of all the above findings, which, furthermore, allows for compact and very transparent notations and formulas.},

Not known is whether the frequency dispersion or time dependence of the faster processes including the caged molecule dynamics and the Johari–Goldstein (JG) β relaxation possesses the same property. Experimental investigation of this issue is hindered by the lack of an instrument that can cover all three processes. Herein, we report the results from the study of the problem utilizing molecular dynamics simulations of two different glass-forming metallic alloys. The mean square displacement 〈 Δ r 2 t 〉 ⁠ , the non-Gaussian parameter α 2 t ⁠ , and the self-intermediate scattering function F s q , t at various combinations of T and P were obtained over broad time range covering the three processes. Isochronal superpositioning of 〈 Δ r 2 t 〉 ⁠ , α 2 t ⁠ , and F s q , t was observed over the entire time range, verifying that the property holds not only for the α relaxation but also for the caged dynamics and the JG β relaxation. Moreover, we successfully performed density ρ scaling of the time τ α 2 , max T , P at the peak of α 2 t and the diffusion coefficient D ( T , P ) to show both are functions of ρ γ / T with the same γ . It follows that the JG β relaxation time τ β ( T , P ) is also a function of ρ γ / T since τ α 2 , max T , P corresponds to τ β ( T , P ).},

In its original form, the uf -theory interpolates the Helmholtz energy between a first-order f -expansion and first-order u -expansion as (effective) lower and upper bounds. We here replace the f -bound by a new, tighter (effective) lower bound. The resulting equation of state interpolates between a first-order u -expansion at high densities and another first-order u -expansion that is modified to recover the exact second virial coefficient at low densities. The theory merely requires the Helmholtz energy of the reference fluid, the first-order u -perturbation term, and the total perturbation contribution to the second virial coefficient as input. The revised theory—referred to as uv -theory—is thus simpler than the uf -theory but leads to similar accuracy, as we show for fluids with intermolecular pair interactions governed by a Mie potential. The uv -theory is thereby easier to extend to fluid mixtures and provides more flexibility in extending the model to non-spherical or chain-like molecules. The usefulness of the uv -theory for developing equation-of-state models of non-spherical molecules is here exemplified by developing an equation of state for Lennard-Jones dimers.},

These bands mostly relate to stretching vibrations of end-on coordinated N 2 chromophores, a μ 1,end end-on binding motif. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling and detailed analysis of n = 13 complexes are consistent with an icosahedral Fe 13 + core structure. The first adsorbate shell closure at ( n , m ) = (13,12)—as recognized by the accompanying paper on the kinetics of N 2 uptake by cationic iron clusters—comes with extensive IR-PD band broadening resulting from enhanced couplings among adjacent N 2 adsorbates. DFT modeling predicts spin quenching by N 2 adsorption as evidenced by the shift of the computed spin minima among possible spin states (spin valleys). The IR-PD spectrum of (17,1) surprisingly reveals an absence of any structure but efficient non-resonant fragmentation, which might indicate some weakly bound (roaming) N 2 adsorbate. The multiple and broad bands of (17, m ) for all other cases than (17,1) and (17,7) indicate a high degree of variation in N 2 binding motifs and couplings. In contrast, the (17,7) spectrum of six sharp bands suggests pairwise equivalent N 2 adsorbates. The IR-PD spectra of (18, m ) reveal additional features in the 2120–2200 cm −1 region, which we associate with a μ 1,side side-on motif. Some additional features in the (18, m ) spectra at high N 2 loads indicate a μ 1,tilt tilted end-on adsorption motif.},

Two symmetric and antisymmetric Raman modes of stretching vibrations were observed in liquid D 2 O, while only a symmetric stretching vibration mode was observed in ice-Ih D 2 O. Pure Stokes SRS is always collinear with the pump beam along the axial direction. Some ring-like Stokes SRS and CARS shifts, which originate from four-wave mixing processes, can also be observed only in the forward direction along with different angles meeting the phase-matching criteria, respectively. Simultaneously, the temporal behavior of SRS in liquid and ice-Ih D 2 O was examined, and the temporal waveforms of the pump laser pulse, transmitted pump pulse, and the forward SRS pulse were measured. In both cases, SRS was the dominant contributor to stimulated scattering. However, the efficiency values drastically decreased due to the self-termination behavior of SRS in liquid D 2 O, which arose from the thermal self-defocusing of both the pump beam and the SRS beam, owing to the Stokes shift-related opto-heating effect. In contrast, for the SRS process in ice-Ih D 2 O, the thermal self-defocusing influence was negligible, benefitting from a much greater thermal conductivity and a higher conversion efficiency of SRS generation retained under both of the conditions.},

  abstract = {In high orbital angular momentum ( ℓ ≥ 3) Rydberg states, the centrifugal barrier hinders the close approach of the Rydberg electron to the ion-core. As a result, these core-nonpenetrating Rydberg states can be well described by a simplified model in which the Rydberg electron is only weakly perturbed by the long-range electric properties (i.e., multipole moments and polarizabilities) of the ion-core. We have used a long-range model to describe the vibrational autoionization dynamics of high- ℓ Rydberg states of nitric oxide (NO). In particular, our model explains the extensive angular momentum exchange between the ion-core and the Rydberg electron that had been previously observed in vibrational autoionization of f ( ℓ = 3) Rydberg states. These results shed light on a long-standing mechanistic question around these previous observations and support a direct, vibrational mechanism of autoionization over an indirect, predissociation-mediated mechanism. In addition, our model correctly predicts newly measured total decay rates of g ( ℓ = 4) Rydberg states because for ℓ ≥ 4, the non-radiative decay is dominated by autoionization rather than predissociation. We examine the predicted NO + ion rotational state distributions generated by vibrational autoionization of g states and discuss applications of our model to achieve quantum state selection in the production of molecular ions.},

We experimentally determine anion lifetimes using an electron attachment–magnetic sector mass spectrometer instrument. Branching ratios of dissociative electron attachment fragments on longer timescales are determined using the electron attachment–quadrupole mass spectrometer instrument. In all cases, fragmentation is low: Only the Br − and [M–Br] − ions are detected, and [M–H] − is observed only in the case of 4-Br-biphenyl and parent anion lifetimes as long as 165 µ s are observed. Such lifetimes are contradictory to the dissociation rates of 2- and 4-bromobiphenyl, as measured by the pulse radiolysis method to be 3.2 × 10 10 and &gt;5 × 10 10 s −1 , respectively. The discrepancy is plausibly explained by our calculation of the potential energy surface of the dissociating anion. Isolated in vacuum, the bromide anion can orbit the polarized aromatic radical at a long distance. A series of local minima on the potential energy surface allows for a roaming mechanism prolonging the detection time of such weakly bound complex anions.

Numerous methods have been devised to suppress these two impediments; however, either the preparation procedures or the operating conditions are relatively harsh, making them difficult to apply to practical applications. Here, we reported giant suppression of both photoblinking and photobleaching of a single fluorescent molecule, terrylene, via the utilization of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) flakes as substrates. Experimentally, a much-prolonged survival time of terrylene has been determined, which can have a photostable emission over 2 h at room temperature under ambient atmospheres. Compared with single molecules on a SiO 2 /Si substrate or glass coverslip, a more than 100-fold increase in the total number of photons collected from each terrylene on h-BN flakes has been demonstrated. We also proved that the photostability of terrylene molecules can be well maintained for more than 6 months even under ambient conditions without any further protection. Our results demonstrate that the utilization of h-BN flakes to suppress photoblinking and photobleaching of fluorescent molecules has promising applications in the production of high-quality single-photon sources at room temperature.},

In Paper I [F. Gajdos, S. Valner, F. Hoffmann, J. Spencer, M. Breuer, A. Kubas, M. Dupuis, and J. Blumberger, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 10 , 4653 (2014)], we introduced the analytic overlap method (AOM) for this purpose, which is an ultrafast electronic coupling estimator parameterized to and orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT) calculations at a reasonably small loss in accuracy. In this work, we reparameterize and extend the AOM to molecules containing nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and sulfur heteroatoms using 921 dimer configurations from the recently introduced HAB79 dataset. We find again a very good linear correlation between the frontier orbital overlap, calculated ultrafast in an optimized minimum Slater basis, and DFT reference electronic couplings. The new parameterization scheme is shown to be transferable to sulfur-containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons in experimentally resolved dimeric configurations. Our extension of the AOM enables high-throughput screening of very large databases of chemically diverse organic crystal structures and the application of computationally intense non-adiabatic molecular dynamics methods to charge transport in state-of-the-art organic semiconductors, e.g., non-fullerene acceptors.},

  abstract = {Complex environments, such as molecular matrices and biological material, play a fundamental role in many important dynamic processes in condensed phases. Because it is extremely difficult to conduct full quantum dynamics simulations on such environments due to their many degrees of freedom, here, we treat in detail the environment only around the main system of interest (the subenvironment), while the other degrees of freedom needed to maintain the equilibrium temperature are described by a simple harmonic bath, which we call a quantum thermostat. The noise generated by the subenvironment is spatially non-local and non-Gaussian and cannot be characterized by the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. We describe this model by simulating the dynamics of a two-level system (TLS) that interacts with a subenvironment consisting of a one-dimensional XXZ spin chain. The hierarchical Schrödinger equations of motion are employed to describe the quantum thermostat, allowing for time-irreversible simulations of the dynamics at arbitrary temperature. To see the effects of a quantum phase transition of the subenvironment, we investigate the decoherence and relaxation processes of the TLS at zero and finite temperatures for various values of the spin anisotropy. We observed the decoherence of the TLS at finite temperature even when the anisotropy of the XXZ model is enormous. We also found that the population-relaxation dynamics of the TLS changed in a complex manner with the change in the anisotropy and the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic orders of spins.},

  abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins implicitly contain the information connecting the atomistic molecular structure and proteins’ biologically relevant motion, where large-scale fluctuations are deemed to guide folding and function. In the complex multiscale processes described by MD trajectories, it is difficult to identify, separate, and study those large-scale fluctuations. This problem can be formulated as the need to identify a small number of collective variables that guide the slow kinetic processes. The most promising method among the ones used to study the slow leading processes in proteins’ dynamics is the time-structure based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA), which identifies the dominant components in a noisy signal. Recently, we developed an anisotropic Langevin approach for the dynamics of proteins, called the anisotropic Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics or LE4PD-XYZ. This approach partitions the protein’s MD dynamics into mostly uncorrelated, wavelength-dependent, diffusive modes. It associates with each mode a free-energy map, where one measures the spatial extension and the time evolution of the mode-dependent, slow dynamical fluctuations. Here, we compare the tICA modes’ predictions with the collective LE4PD-XYZ modes. We observe that the two methods consistently identify the nature and extension of the slowest fluctuation processes. The tICA separates the leading processes in a smaller number of slow modes than the LE4PD does. The LE4PD provides time-dependent information at short times and a formal connection to the physics of the kinetic processes that are missing in the pure statistical analysis of tICA.},

At a similar predictive quality but significantly reduced cost, they could leverage otherwise barely tractable extensive sampling as in global surface structure determination (SSD). This efficiency is jeopardized though, if an a priori unknown structural and chemical search space as in SSD requires an excessive number of first-principles data for the GAP training. To this end, we present a general and data-efficient iterative training protocol that blends the creation of new training data with the actual surface exploration process. Demonstrating this protocol with the SSD of low-index facets of rutile IrO 2 and RuO 2 , the involved simulated annealing on the basis of the refining GAP identifies a number of unknown terminations even in the restricted sub-space of (1 × 1) surface unit cells. Particularly in an O-poor environment, some of these, then metal-rich terminations, are thermodynamically most stable and are reminiscent of complexions as discussed for complex ceramic materials.},

  abstract = {While chemical systems containing hundreds to thousands of electrons remain beyond the reach of quantum devices, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms present a promising pathway toward a quantum advantage. Hybrid algorithms treat the exponentially scaling part of the calculation—the static correlation—on the quantum computer and the non-exponentially scaling part—the dynamic correlation—on the classical computer. While a variety of algorithms have been proposed, the dependence of many methods on the total wave function limits the development of easy-to-use classical post-processing implementations. Here, we present a novel combination of quantum and classical algorithms, which computes the all-electron energy of a strongly correlated molecular system on the classical computer from the 2-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) evaluated on the quantum device. Significantly, we circumvent the wave function in the all-electron calculations by using density matrix methods that only require input of the statically correlated 2-RDM. Although the algorithm is completely general, we test it with two classical density matrix methods, the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrödinger equation (ACSE) and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theories, using the recently developed quantum ACSE method for simulating the statically correlated 2-RDM. We obtain experimental accuracy for the relative energies of all three benzyne isomers and thereby demonstrate the ability of the developed algorithm to achieve chemically relevant and accurate results on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.},

We find that this new Ansatz solves problems identified in the previous unitary coupled cluster Ansatz for density cumulant theory: the theory is now free of near-zero denominators between occupied and virtual blocks, can correctly describe the dissociation of H 2 , and is rigorously size-extensive. In addition, the new Ansatz has fewer terms than the previous unitary Ansatz , and the optimal orbitals delivered by the exact theory are the natural orbitals. Numerical studies on systems amenable to full configuration interaction show that the amplitudes from the previous ODC-12 method approximate the exact amplitudes predicted by this Ansatz . Studies on equilibrium properties of diatomic molecules show that even with the new Ansatz , it is necessary to include triples to improve the accuracy of the method compared to orbital-optimized linearized coupled cluster doubles. With a simple iterative triples correction, O λ DCT outperforms other orbital-optimized methods truncated at comparable levels in the amplitudes, as well as coupled cluster single and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)]. By adding four more terms to the cumulant parameterization, O λ DCT outperforms CCSDT while having the same O ( V 5 O 3 ) scaling.},

Electronic properties of such hybrid structures are modified due to the interaction between atoms of the components, which can be utilized to tailor the properties of the hybrid structures to suite the application. In this study, we have explored charge (electron) transport through the hybrid structures of single-layer graphene (SLG) and SWCNTs (both metallic and semiconducting) using the nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism within the framework of tight-binding density functional theory. Our calculations show that the electronic transport in hybrid nanostructures is affected by the interactions between SWCNT and SLG in comparison to the individual components. The changes in the electronic structure and the transport properties with increasing interaction in hybrids (captured by decreasing the separation between SWCNT and SLG) are discussed, and it is demonstrated from this analysis that the hybrids with semiconducting SWCNTs and metallic SWCNTs show different behavior in the low bias regime while they show similar behavior at higher biases. The difference in the transport properties of hybrids with semiconducting and metallic SWCNTs is explained in terms of changes in the electronic structure, the local density of states, and the energy dispersion for electrons due to the interaction between atoms of the two components.},

To this end, a plane-wave based implementation to obtain intrinsic atomic orbitals and Wannier functions for arbitrary localization potentials is presented. In our embedding scheme, the localized occupied orbitals allow for a separate treatment of short-range and long-range correlation contributions to the adsorption energy by a fragmentation of the simulation cell. In combination with unoccupied natural orbitals, the coupled cluster ansatz with single, double, and perturbative triple particle–hole excitation operators is used to capture the correlation in local fragments centered around the adsorption process. For the long-range correlation, a seamless embedding into the random phase approximation yields rapidly convergent adsorption energies with respect to the local fragment size. Convergence of computed binding energies with respect to the virtual orbital basis set is achieved employing a number of recently developed techniques. Moreover, we discuss fragment size convergence for a range of approximate many-electron perturbation theories. The obtained benchmark results are compared to a number of density functional calculations.},

  abstract = {Stark spectroscopy experiments are widely used to study the properties of molecular systems, particularly those containing charge-transfer (CT) states. However, due to the small transition dipole moments and large static dipole moments of the CT states, the standard interpretation of the Stark absorption and Stark fluorescence spectra in terms of the Liptay model may be inadequate. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework for calculations of Stark absorption and Stark fluorescence spectra and propose new methods of simulations that are based on the quantum-classical theory. In particular, we use the forward–backward trajectory solution and a variant of the Poisson bracket mapping equation, which have been recently adapted for the calculation of conventional (field-free) absorption and fluorescence spectra. For comparison, we also apply the recently proposed complex time-dependent Redfield theory, while exact results are obtained using the hierarchical equations of motion approach. We show that the quantum-classical methods produce accurate results for a wide range of systems, including those containing CT states. The CT states contribute significantly to the Stark spectra, and the standard Liptay formalism is shown to be inapplicable for the analysis of spectroscopic data in those cases. We demonstrate that states with large static dipole moments may cause a pronounced change in the total fluorescence yield of the system in the presence of an external electric field. This effect is correctly captured by the quantum-classical methods, which should therefore prove useful for further studies of Stark spectra of real molecular systems. As an example, we calculate the Stark spectra for the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex of green sulfur bacteria.},

The rotational motion of the probes under residual stress is found to be more activated than that under mere thermal activation, and the kinetic energy exhibits a monotonic increase with the stress strength. A rough linear dependence of rotational kinetic energy at low stress is found, yielding the value of characteristic volume for the residual stress to activate the motion of the probes. The values of the volume are close to the van der Waals volume of the probes, indicating that the activation of the fast dynamics by residual stress is localized. The activation effect is weakened and vanishes at or above the glass transition temperature due to stress relaxation. The effect is also absent at temperatures far below T g due to the frozen molecular motion with a much higher activation energy.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of one-dimensional active particles confined in a double-well potential, focusing on the escape properties of the system, such as the mean escape time from a well. We first consider a single-particle both in near and far-from-equilibrium regimes by varying the persistence time of the active force and the swim velocity. A non-monotonic behavior of the mean escape time is observed with the persistence time of the activity, revealing the existence of an optimal choice of the parameters favoring the escape process. For small persistence times, a Kramers-like formula with an effective potential obtained within the unified colored noise approximation is shown to hold. Instead, for large persistence times, we developed a simple theoretical argument based on the first passage theory, which explains the linear dependence of the escape time with the persistence of the active force. In the second part of the work, we consider the escape on two active particles mutually repelling. Interestingly, the subtle interplay of active and repulsive forces may lead to a correlation between particles, favoring the simultaneous jump across the barrier. This mechanism cannot be observed in the escape process of two passive particles. Finally, we find that in the small persistence regime, the repulsion favors the escape, such as in passive systems, in agreement with our theoretical predictions, while for large persistence times, the repulsive and active forces produce an effective attraction, which hinders the barrier crossing.},

Based on these findings, we predict principles and strategies for designing microswimmers of special optimized functions under limited energy resource conditions, which will bring new experimental inspiration for designing smart motors.},

Here, we use ab initio molecular dynamics to examine the proton-transfer/diffusion and redox behavior in a water layer confined in the graphene-Ti 3 C 2 O 2 heterostructure. We find that in comparison with the similar interface of water confined between Ti 3 C 2 O 2 layers, the proton redox rate in the dissimilar interface of graphene-Ti 3 C 2 O 2 is much higher, owing to the very different interfacial structure as well as the interfacial electric field induced by an electron transfer in the latter. Water molecules in the dissimilar interface of the graphene-Ti 3 C 2 O 2 heterostructure form a denser hydrogen-bond network with a preferred orientation of water molecules, leading to an increase in proton mobility with proton concentration in the graphene-Ti 3 C 2 O 2 interface. As the proton concentration further increases, proton mobility decreases due to increasingly more frequent surface redox events that slow down proton mobility due to binding with surface O atoms. Our work provides important insights into how the dissimilar interface and their associated interfacial structure and properties impact proton transfer and redox in the confined space.},

  abstract = {Photon upconversion, particularly via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), could prove beneficial in expanding the efficiencies and overall impacts of optoelectronic devices across a multitude of technologies. The recent development of bulk metal halide perovskites as triplet sensitizers is one potential step toward the industrialization of upconversion-enabled devices. Here, we investigate the impact of varying additions of bromide into a lead iodide perovskite thin film on the TTA upconversion process in the annihilator molecule rubrene. We find an interplay between the bromide content and the overall device efficiency. In particular, a higher bromide content results in higher internal upconversion efficiencies enabled by more efficient charge extraction at the interface likely due to a more favorable band alignment. However, the external upconversion efficiency decreases as the absorption cross section in the near infrared is reduced. The highest upconversion performance is found in our study for a bromide content of 5\%. This result can be traced back to a high absorption cross section in the near infrared and higher photoluminescence quantum yield in comparison to the iodide-only perovskite and an increased driving force for charge transfer.},

  abstract = {The modular path integral methodology is used to extend the well-known spin-boson dynamics to finite-length quantum Ising chains, where each spin is coupled to a dissipative harmonic bath. The chain is initially prepared in the ferromagnetic phase where all spins are aligned, and the magnetization is calculated with spin–spin coupling parameters corresponding to the paramagnetic phase, mimicking a quantum quench experiment. The observed dynamics is found to depend significantly on the location of the tagged spin. In the absence of a dissipative bath, the time evolution displays irregular patterns that arise from multiple frequencies associated with the eigenvalues of the chain Hamiltonian. Coupling of each spin to a harmonic bath leads to smoother dynamics, with damping effects that are stronger compared to those observed in the spin-boson model and more prominent in interior spins, a consequence of additional damping from the spin environment. Interior spins exhibit a transition from underdamped oscillatory to overdamped monotonic dynamics as the temperature, spin–bath, or spin–spin coupling is increased. In addition to these behaviors, a new dynamical pattern emerges in the evolution of edge spins with strong spin–spin coupling at low and intermediate temperatures, where the magnetization oscillates either above or below the equilibrium value.},

Previous DFT studies at the GGA level revealed theoretical inconsistencies on the adsorption energies and dissociation barriers of O 2 on Ag(111) in comparison with the experimental conclusion. In this study, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed-revised Vydrov van Voorhis van der Waals correction functional (SCAN-rVV10) method at the meta-GGA level with the nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) force correction was used to reinvestigate the adsorption properties of O 2 on the Ag(111) surface. The SCAN-rVV10 results successfully confirm the experimental observation that both molecular and dissociative adsorptions can exist for oxygen on Ag(111). The calculated adsorption energy for the physisorption state and the relevant dissociation energy barrier are close to the experimental data. It demonstrates that SCAN-rVV10 can outperform functionals at the GGA level for O 2 /Ag(111). Therefore, our findings suggest that SCAN-rVV10 can be the desired method for systems where the correct description of intermediate-ranged vdW forces is essential, such as the physisorption of small molecules on the solid surface.},

  abstract = {Polymorphism is an issue troubling numerous scientific fields. A phenomenon where molecules can arrange in different orientations in a crystal lattice, polymorphism in the field of organic photovoltaic materials can dramatically change electronic properties of these materials. Rubrene is a benchmark photovoltaic material showing high carrier mobility in only one of its three polymorphs. To use rubrene in devices, it is important to quantify the polymorph distribution arising from a particular crystal growth method. However, current methods for characterizing polymorphism are either destructive or inefficient for batch scale characterization. Lattice phonon Raman spectroscopy has the ability to distinguish between polymorphs based on low frequency intermolecular vibrations. We present here the addition of microscopy to lattice phonon Raman spectroscopy, which allows us to not only characterize polymorphs efficiently and nondestructively through Raman spectroscopy but also concurrently gain information on the size and morphology of the polymorphs. We provide examples for how this technique can be used to perform large, batch scale polymorph characterization for crystals grown from solution and physical vapor transport. We end with a case study showing how Raman microscopy can be used to efficiently optimize a green crystal growth method, selecting for large orthorhombic crystals desired for rubrene electronic device applications.},

Based on PL and TRPL results, the non-radiative nature of In 3+ -doping induced localized impurity states is revealed. Furthermore, the impact of In 3+ and Cl − doping on charge transfer (CT) from the NCs to molecular acceptors was investigated and the results indicate that the CT at the interface of NCs can be tuned and promoted by In 3+ and Cl − co-doping. This enhanced CT is attributed to the enlarged energy difference between relevant states of the molecular acceptor and the NCs by In 3+ and Cl − upon co-doping.

In particular, glasses are well known as dense, amorphous materials, whereas gels exist in low-density, disordered states. Recent progress has provided a significant step forward in understanding the material properties of glasses, such as mechanical, vibrational, and transport properties. In contrast, our understanding of particulate physical gels is still highly limited. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we study a simple model of particulate physical gels, the Lennard-Jones (LJ) gels, and provide a comprehensive understanding of their structural, mechanical, and vibrational properties, all of which are markedly different from those of LJ glasses. First, the LJ gels show sparse, heterogeneous structures, and the length scale ξ s of the structures grows as the density is lowered. Second, the LJ gels are extremely soft, with both shear G and bulk K moduli being orders of magnitude smaller than those of LJ glasses. Third, many low-frequency vibrational modes are excited, which form a characteristic plateau with the onset frequency ω * in the vibrational density of states. Structural, mechanical, and vibrational properties, characterized by ξ s , G , K , and ω * , respectively, show power-law scaling behaviors with the density, which establishes a close relationship between them. Throughout this work, we also reveal that LJ gels are multiscale, solid-state materials: (i) homogeneous elastic bodies at long lengths, (ii) heterogeneous elastic bodies with fractal structures at intermediate lengths, and (iii) amorphous structural bodies at short lengths.},

  abstract = {Determining the structure and underlying potential from the experiment data is an important task in the study of disordered systems such as liquids and glasses. In this article, a new approach to tackle this problem is proposed. This method can iteratively refine any interaction potential u with the form of a fixed potential ψ added by a dot product between adjustable parameter θ and some functions of atomic coordinates called features f (i.e., potential u = ψ + θ · f ). The updating rule for parameters is very simple as it only uses the difference of the ensemble mean of f between the simulation box and experiment. The solution found by this method minimizes the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the atomic distribution under the parameterized potential u and the prior potential ψ , subject to the condition that the ensemble mean of f of the simulation box is equal to its experimental value, ensuring that the potential given will be the least biased one from the prior potential but still consistent with the experiment. It is also shown that this method approximately minimizes the squared difference between the parameterized potential and the unknown true potential. Furthermore, the flexibility of the potential functional form allows the potential to be automatically fitted to some convenient forms or to encode additional known properties of the system under study. The method is tested on Lennard-Jones liquid as well as SiO 2 liquid and glass for potential extraction or structure refinement using simulated data and real experiment data. Good results are obtained for both systems.},

  abstract = {Ice accumulation on solid surfaces is a severe problem for safety and functioning of a large variety of engineering systems, and its control is an enormous challenge that influences the safety and reliability of many technological applications. The use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is popular, but as ice nucleation is a rare event when compared to simulation timescales, the simulations need to be accelerated to force ice to form on a surface, which affects the accuracy and/or applicability of the results obtained. Here, we present an alternative seeded MD simulation approach, which reduces the computational cost while still ensuring accurate simulations of ice growth on surfaces. In addition, this approach enables, for the first time, brute-force all-atom water simulations of ice growth on surfaces unfavorable for nucleation within MD timescales. Using this approach, we investigate the effect of surface wettability and structure on ice growth in the crucial surface–ice interfacial region. Our main findings are that the surface structure can induce a flat or buckled overlayer to form within the liquid, and this transition is mediated by surface wettability. The first overlayer and the bulk ice compete to structure the intermediate water layers between them, the relative influence of which is traced using density heat maps and diffusivity measurements. This work provides new understanding on the role of the surface properties on the structure and dynamics of ice growth, and we also present a useful framework for future research on surface icing simulations.},

The spectroscopic simulation program PGOPHER was used to analyze the rotationally resolved spectra. Band origins, rotational constants, and isotope shifts compared with those of 14 N 2 have been obtained for 31 electric-dipole-allowed vibrational states of 14 N 15 N in the aforementioned energy range. These spectroscopic parameters are found to depend on the vibrational quantum number irregularly. Systematic perturbations of the rotational transition energies and predissociation rates within individual absorption bands have also been observed. These are proved to be caused by the strong homogeneous interactions between the valence b ′ 1 Σ u + state and the Rydberg c n ′ 1 Σ u + states, and between the valence b 1 Π u states and the Rydberg o 3 1 Π u states. Heterogeneous interactions between the Rydberg c n 1 Π u states and c n ′ 1 Σ u + states also play an important role.},

  abstract = {Pyrene based molecules are inclined to form excimers through self-association upon photoexcitation. In this work, the pyrene core is functionalized with the N -methylacetamide group at the position 1 or 2 to develop pyren-1-methylacetamide (PyMA1) and pyren-2-methylacetamide (PyMA2), respectively. Upon photoexcitation with 345 nm, a portion of molecules in PyMA1 and PyMA2 solutions at ≥1.0 mM have formed static excimers. The steady state spectroscopic measurements suggest that, whether it is the dimerization of molecules in the ground state (GS) or in excimer formation, characteristic signs are more pronounced in PyMA1 than its isomeric counterpart, PyMA2. The shift of the excimer band in their respective emission spectra suggests that the extent of overlap in π–π stacking is greater for PyMA1 than for PyMA2 in the excited state. The optimized geometry of dimers in toluene shows that the overlapping area between the pyrene moieties in π–π stacking between the dimers is greater for PyMA1 than for PyMA2 in GS. The natural bond orbital analysis with the optimized GS geometries shows that the stabilization/interaction energy between the dimers in π–π stacking is higher in PyMA1 compared to PyMA2 in toluene. The transient absorption (TA) measurements in toluene over the fs–ps regime (fs-TA) showed that the formation of static excimers with pre-associated dimers in PyMA1 happens in ∼700 fs whereas the excimers for the pre-associated dimers in PyMA2 have formed in slightly slower time scale (∼1.95 ps). Contrary to what was observed in solution, the extent of overlap in π–π stacking is lower for PyMA1 dimers (∼17\%) than for PyMA2 dimers (∼37\%) in single crystals.},

  abstract = {It is well known that structure determines property, but obtaining a pair of silver nanoclusters with comparable structures to understand the structure–property relationship is a very challenging task. A new 60-nuclei silver nanocluster ( SD/Ag60a ) protected by a mixed-ligand shell of t BuS − and o -CH 3 OPhCOO − was obtained and characterized. Single crystal x-ray diffraction reveals that SD/Ag60a has an identical metal nuclearity and core–shell structural type to SD/Ag1 previously reported by our group, whereas the compositions of the core and shell have undergone a rearrangement from an Ag 12 cuboctahedron core and an Ag 48 rhombicuboctahedron shell in SD/Ag1 to an Ag 14 rhombic dodecahedron core and an oval Ag 46 shell in SD/Ag60a . The core enlargement from Ag 12 to Ag 14 originates from the replacement of two S 2− in Ag 12 S 15 by two Ag + , which gives a new Ag 14 S 13 core. This result indicates that the metal frameworks of silver nanoclusters have some extent flexibility despite the same nuclearity, which can be influenced by ligands, solvents, anion templates, and others in the embryonic stage of the assembly. Interestingly, different core–shell architectures of Ag 60 nanoclusters also significantly endow the different optical absorption bands, photocurrent-generating properties, and luminesecent behaviors. This work not only realizes the regulation of the core–shell structure of silver nanoclusters with the same nuclearity but also provides a comparable model for investigating the relationship of structure–photoelectric properties.},

  abstract = {Inter-anion hydrogen and halogen bonds have emerged as counterintuitive linkers and inspired us to expand the range of this unconventional bonding pattern. Here, the inter-anion chalcogen bond (IAChB) was proposed and theoretically analyzed in a series of complexes formed by negatively charged bidentate chalcogen bond donors with chloride anions. The kinetic stability of IAChB was evidenced by the minima on binding energy profiles and further supported by ab initio molecular dynamic simulations. The block-localized wave function (BLW) method and its subsequent energy decomposition (BLW-ED) approach were employed to elucidate the physical origin of IAChB. While all other energy components vary monotonically as anions get together, the electrostatic interaction behaves exceptionally as it experiences a Coulombic repulsion barrier. Before reaching the barrier, the electrostatic repulsion increases with the shortening Ch⋯Cl − distance as expected from classical electrostatics. However, after passing the barrier, the electrostatic repulsion decreases with the Ch⋯Cl − distance shortening and subsequently turns into the most favorable trend among all energy terms at short ranges, representing a dominating force for the kinetic stability of inter-anions. For comparison, all energy components exhibit the same trends and vary monotonically in the conventional counterparts where donors are neutral. By comparing inter-anions and their conventional counterparts, we found that only the electrostatic energy term is affected by the extra negative charge. Remarkably, the distinctive (nonmonotonic) electrostatic energy profiles were reproduced using quantum mechanical-based atomic multipoles, suggesting that the crucial electrostatic interaction in IAChB can be rationalized within the classical electrostatic theory just like conventional non-covalent interactions.},

Starting from the analysis of these experimental data, potential energy surfaces, formulated as a function of the separation distance and orientation of propylene oxide with respect to the interacting partners, have been built: The average depth of potential wells (located at intermediate separation distances) has been characterized by analyzing the observed “glory” quantum effects, and the strength of long-range attractions has been obtained from the magnitude and the velocity dependence of the smooth component of measured cross sections. The surfaces, tested and improved against new ab initio calculations of minima interaction energies at the complete basis set level of theory, are defined in the full space of relative configurations. This represents a crucial condition to provide force fields useful to carry out, in general, important molecular property simulations and to evaluate, in the present case, the spectroscopic features and the dynamical selectivity of weakly bound complexes formed by propylene oxide, a prototype chiral species, during collisions in interstellar clouds and winds, in the space and planetary atmospheres. The adopted formulation of the interaction can be readily extended to similar systems, involving heavier noble gases or diatomic molecules (H 2 , O 2 , and N 2 ) as well as to propylene oxide dimers.},

Here, we demonstrate large-scale (50 μ m) single-crystalline silver flakes with a truly atomically smooth surface, which are an ideal platform for vertically assembled silver plasmonic nanoresonators. We investigate crystalline silver nanowires in a sub-2 nm separation to the silver surface and observe narrow plasmonic resonances with a quality factor Q of about 20. We propose a concept toward the observation of the spectral diffusion of the lowest-frequency cavity plasmon resonance and present first measurements.

Plasmon resonance of noble metal nanoparticles and plasmon–exciton interactions are strongly dependent on the particle morphology. Single-particle spectroscopic studies can overcome the ensemble average effects of sample inhomogeneity to unambiguously reveal the effects of the particle morphology. In this work, plasmon modulated emission of MoS 2 in various plasmon–MoS 2 hybrid structures has been studied on the single-particle level. Gold (Au) nanoantennas of different shapes including nanosphere, nanorod, nanocube, and nanotriangle with similar overall dimensions, which have different sharp tips and contact areas with MoS 2 , have been chosen to explore the particle shape effects. Different extent of enhancement in photoluminescence (PL) of MoS 2 was observed for Au nanoantennas of different shapes. It was found that Au nanotriangles gave the highest enhancement factor, while Au nanospheres gave the lowest enhancement factor. The numerical simulation results show that the dominant contribution arises from an increased quantum yield, while enhanced excitation efficiency just plays a minor role. The quantum yield enhancement is affected by both the sharp tips and contact mode of the Au nanoantenna with MoS 2 . Polarization of the MoS 2 emission was also found to be modulated by the plasmon mode of the Au nanoantenna. These single-particle spectroscopic studies allow us to unambiguously reveal the effects of the particle morphology on plasmon enhanced PL in these nanohybrids to provide a better understanding of the plasmon–exciton interactions.},

  abstract = {A new molecular dataset called HAB79 is introduced to provide ab initio reference values for electronic couplings (transfer integrals) and to benchmark density functional theory (DFT) and density functional tight-binding (DFTB) calculations. The HAB79 dataset is composed of 79 planar heterocyclic polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecules frequently encountered in organic (opto)electronics, arranged to 921 structurally diverse dimer configurations. We show that CASSCF/NEVPT2 with a minimal active space provides a robust reference method that can be applied to the relatively large molecules of the dataset. Electronic couplings are largest for cofacial dimers, in particular, sulfur-containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons, with values in excess of 0.5 eV, followed by parallel displaced cofacial dimers. V-shaped dimer motifs, often encountered in the herringbone layers of organic crystals, exhibit medium-sized couplings, whereas T-shaped dimers have the lowest couplings. DFT values obtained from the projector operator-based diabatization (POD) method are initially benchmarked against the smaller databases HAB11 (HAB7-) and found to systematically improve when climbing Jacob’s ladder, giving mean relative unsigned errors (MRUEs) of 27.7\% (26.3\%) for the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional BLYP, 20.7\% (15.8\%) for hybrid functional B3LYP, and 5.2\% (7.5\%) for the long-range corrected hybrid functional omega-B97X. Cost-effective POD in combination with a GGA functional and very efficient DFTB calculations on the dimers of the HAB79 database give a good linear correlation with the CASSCF/NEVPT2 reference data, which, after scaling with a multiplicative constant, gives reasonably small MRUEs of 17.9\% and 40.1\%, respectively, bearing in mind that couplings in HAB79 vary over 4 orders of magnitude. The ab initio reference data reported here are expected to be useful for benchmarking other DFT or semi-empirical approaches for electronic coupling calculations.},

Microtubules, for example, are composed of two globular protein subunits, α -tubulin and β -tubulin, which bind together to form polar dimers that self-assemble a hollow cylinder structure in a process driven by GTPase activity. Inspired by this process, we define a generic self-assembly lattice model containing particles of two subunits, which is driven out-of-equilibrium by a dimer-favoring local driving force. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the ability of this system to restore pre-encoded target structures as a function of the initial seed size, interaction energy, chemical potential, number of target structures, and strength of the nonequilibrium drive. We demonstrate some intriguing consequences of the drive, such as a smaller critical seed and an improved target assembly stability, compared to the equilibrium scenario. Our results can expand the theoretical basis of nonequilibrium self-assembly and provide deeper understanding of how nonequilibrium driving can overcome equilibrium constraints.},

  abstract = {How much time does it take for two molecules to react? If a reaction occurs upon contact, the answer to this question boils down to the classic first-passage time problem: find the time it takes for the two molecules to meet. However, this is not always the case as molecules switch stochastically between reactive and non-reactive states. The reaction is then said to be “gated” by the internal states of the molecules involved, which could have a dramatic influence on kinetics. A unified, continuous-time, approach to gated reactions on networks was presented in a recent paper [Scher and Reuveni, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127 , 018301 (2021)]. Here, we build on this recent advancement and develop an analogous discrete-time version of the theory. Similar to continuous-time, we employ a renewal approach to show that the gated reaction time can always be expressed in terms of the corresponding ungated first-passage and return times, which yields formulas for the generating function of the gated reaction-time distribution and its corresponding mean and variance. In cases where the mean reaction time diverges, we show that the long-time asymptotics of the gated problem is inherited from its ungated counterpart. However, when molecules spend most of their time non-reactive, an interim regime of slower power-law decay emerges prior to the terminal asymptotics. The discretization of time also gives rise to resonances and anti-resonances, which were absent from the continuous-time picture. These features are illustrated using two case studies that also demonstrate how the general approach presented herein greatly simplifies the analysis of gated reactions.},

  abstract = {A family of coordination complexes of the type [Ru(SO 2 )(NH 3 ) 4 X] m+ Y n − (m, n = 1 or 2) exhibit optical switching capabilities in their single-crystal states. This striking effect is caused by the light-induced formation of SO 2 -linkage photoisomers, which are metastable if kept at suitably cool temperatures. We modeled the dark- and light-induced states of these large crystalline complexes via plane-wave (PW)- and molecular-orbital (MO)-based density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT in order to calculate their structural and optical properties; the calculated results are compared with experimental data. We show that the PW-DFT-based periodic models replicate the structural properties of these complexes more effectively than the MO-DFT-based molecular-fragment models, observing only small deviations in key bond lengths relative to the experimentally derived crystal structures. The periodic models were also found to more effectively simulate trends seen in experimental optical absorption spectra, with optical absorbance and coverage of the visible region increasing with the formation of the photoinduced geometries. The contribution of the metastable photoisomeric species more heavily focuses on the lower-energy end of the spectra. Spectra generated from the molecular-fragment models are limited by the geometry of the fragment used and the number of excited-state roots considered in those calculations. In general, periodic models outperform the molecular-fragment models owing to their ability to better appreciate the periodic phenomena that are present in these crystalline materials as opposed to MO approaches, which are finite methods. We thus demonstrate that PW-DFT-based periodic models should be considered as a more than viable method for simulating the optical and electronic properties of these single-crystal optical switches.},

  abstract = {The atomization energies of molecules from first-principles density functional approximations improve from the local spin-density approximation to the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, and their sensitivities to non-spherical components of the density increase in the same order. Thus, these functional advances increase density sensitivity and imitate the exact constrained search over correlated wavefunctions better than that over ensembles. The diatomic molecules studied here, singlet C 2 and F 2 plus triplet B 2 and O 2 , have cylindrically symmetric densities. Because the densities of the corresponding atoms are non-spherical, the approximate Kohn–Sham potentials for the atoms have a lower symmetry than that of the external (nuclear) potential so that the non-interacting wavefunctions are not eigenstates of the square of total orbital angular momentum, breaking a symmetry that yields a feature of the exact ground-state density. That spatial symmetry can be preserved by a non-self-consistent approach in which a self-consistent equilibrium-ensemble calculation is followed by integer re-occupation of the Kohn–Sham orbitals as the first of several steps. The symmetry-preserving approach is different from symmetry restoration based on projection. First-step space- (and space-spin-) symmetry preservation in atoms is shown to have a small effect on the atomization energies of molecules, quantifying earlier observations by Fertig and Kohn. Thus, the standard Kohn–Sham way of calculating atomization energies, with self-consistent symmetry breaking to minimize the energy, is justified at least for the common cases where the molecules cannot break symmetry. Unless symmetry breaking is allowed in the molecule, SCAN strongly underestimates the atomization energy of strongly correlated singlet C 2 .},

  abstract = {The fitting of physical models is often done only using a single target observable. However, when multiple targets are considered, the fitting procedure becomes cumbersome, there being no easy way to quantify the robustness of the model for all different observables. Here, we illustrate that one can jointly search for the best model for each desired observable through multi-objective optimization. To do so, we construct the Pareto front to study if there exists a set of parameters of the model that can jointly describe multiple, or all, observables. To alleviate the computational cost, the predicted error for each targeted objective is approximated with a Gaussian process model as it is commonly done in the Bayesian optimization framework. We applied this methodology to improve three different models used in the simulation of stationary state cis – trans photoisomerization of retinal in rhodopsin, a significant biophysical process. Optimization was done with respect to different experimental measurements, including emission spectra, peak absorption frequencies for the cis and trans conformers, and energy storage. Advantages and disadvantages of previously proposed models are exposed.},

Previous multicomponent studies have only implemented a subset of the full contributions, and the present implementation is the first multicomponent many-body method to include any connected triples contribution to the electron–proton correlation energy. The multicomponent MP3 method is shown to be comparable in accuracy to the multicomponent coupled-cluster doubles method for the calculation of proton affinities, while the multicomponent MP4 method is of similar accuracy as the multicomponent coupled-cluster singles and doubles method. From the results in this study, it is hypothesized that the relative accuracy of multicomponent methods is more similar to their single-component counterparts than previously assumed. It is demonstrated that for multicomponent MP4, the fourth-order triple-excitation contributions can be split into electron–electron and electron–proton contributions and the electron–electron contributions ignored with very little loss of accuracy of protonic properties.},

  abstract = {In this study, we extend the multicomponent heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) method to excited states. Previous multicomponent HCI studies have been performed using only the variational stage of the HCI algorithm as they have largely focused on the calculation of protonic densities. Because this study focuses on energetic quantities, a second-order perturbative correction after the variational stage is essential. Therefore, this study implements the second-order Epstein–Nesbet correction to the variational stage of multicomponent HCI for the first time. Additionally, this study introduces a new procedure for calculating reference excitation energies for multicomponent methods using the Fourier-grid Hamiltonian (FGH) method, which should allow the one-particle electronic basis set errors to be better isolated from errors arising from an incomplete description of electron–proton correlation. The excited-state multicomponent HCI method is benchmarked by computing protonic excitations of the HCN and FHF − molecules and is shown to be of similar accuracy to previous excited-state multicomponent methods such as the multicomponent time-dependent density-functional theory and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory relative to the new FGH reference values.},

  abstract = {Quantum computation promises to provide substantial speedups in many practical applications with a particularly exciting one being the simulation of quantum many-body systems. Adiabatic state preparation (ASP) is one way that quantum computers could recreate and simulate the ground state of a physical system. In this paper, we explore a novel approach for classically simulating the time dynamics of ASP with high accuracy and with only modest computational resources via an adaptive sampling configuration interaction scheme for truncating the Hilbert space to only the most important determinants. We verify that this truncation introduces negligible error and use this new approach to simulate ASP for sets of small molecular systems and Hubbard models. Furthermore, we examine two approaches to speeding up ASP when performed on quantum hardware: (i) using the complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) wave function instead of the Hartree–Fock initial state and (ii) a nonlinear interpolation between the initial and target Hamiltonians. We find that starting with a CASCI wave function with a limited active space yields substantial speedups for many of the systems examined, while nonlinear interpolation does not. In additional, we observe interesting trends in the minimum gap location (based on the initial state) as well as how state preparation time can depend on certain molecular properties, such as the number of valence electrons. Importantly, we find that the required state preparation times do not show an immediate exponential wall that would preclude an efficient run of ASP on actual hardware.},

One way to deal with this problem is to represent tensors using a tensor format. In this paper, we use the canonical polyadic (CP) format. Energy levels are computed by building a basis from vectors obtained by solving linear equations. The method can be thought of as a CP realization of a block inverse iteration method with multiple shifts. The CP rank of the tensors is fixed, and the linear equations are solved with an method. There is no need for rank reduction and no need for orthogonalization, and tensors with a rank larger than the fixed rank used to solve the linear equations are never generated. The ideas are tested by computing vibrational energy levels of a 64-D bilinearly coupled model Hamiltonian and of acetonitrile (12-D).},

It is also shown that the residual terms arising in the case of an approximate complete active space configuration interaction solution and containing even the fifth-order density matrix for two excitation classes can be evaluated with little additional effort by choosing again a favorable factorization of the corresponding matrix elements. An analogous argument is also provided for avoiding the fourth-order density matrix in complete active space second-order perturbation theory.

After some preliminary tests on small molecules, we obtain the vibrational frequencies of glycine improving on pre-existing SC calculations.

For systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such a universal theoretical framework is missing. For a restricted class of driven systems governed by Markov dynamics and local detailed balance, stochastic thermodynamics has evolved to fill this gap and to provide fundamental constraints and guiding principles. The next step is to advance stochastic thermodynamics from simple model systems to complex systems with tens of thousands or even millions of degrees of freedom. Biomolecules operating in the presence of chemical gradients and mechanical forces are a prime example for this challenge. In this Perspective, we give an introduction to isothermal stochastic thermodynamics geared toward the systematic multiscale modeling of the conformational dynamics of biomolecular and synthetic machines, and we outline some of the open challenges.},

MCPS predictions relate the experimental measurements to the underlying surfactant aggregate size distribution by fitting either the component concentrations or the average C–H frequency to MCPS predictions, and thus determine the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and estimate the corresponding micelle size and polydispersity. The Raman-MCR spectra of aqueous 1,2-hexanediol, sodium octanoate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, measured both below and above CMC, provide critical tests of the assumed functional form of the MCPS and the presence of low-order premicellar aggregates. Our results indicate that the low-order aggregate population gradually emerges as the CMC is approached and then remains nearly concentration-independent after the appearance of micelles.},

  abstract = {Theories of strongly stretched polymer brushes, particularly the parabolic brush theory, are valuable for providing analytically tractable predictions for the thermodynamic behavior of surface-grafted polymers in a wide range of settings. However, the parabolic brush limit fails to describe polymers grafted to convex curved substrates, such as the surfaces of spherical nanoparticles or the interfaces of strongly segregated block copolymers. It has previously been shown that strongly stretched curved brushes require a boundary layer devoid of free chain ends, requiring modifications of the theoretical analysis. While this “end-exclusion zone” has been successfully incorporated into the descriptions of brushes grafted onto the outer surfaces of cylinders and spheres, the behavior of brushes on surfaces of arbitrary curvature has not yet been studied. We present a formulation of the strong-stretching theory for molten brushes on the surfaces of arbitrary curvature and identify four distinct regimes of interest for which brushes are predicted to possess end-exclusion zones, notably including regimes of positive mean curvature but negative Gaussian curvature. Through numerical solutions of the strong-stretching brush equations, we report predicted scaling of the size of the end-exclusion zone, the chain end distribution, the chain polarization, and the free energy of stretching with mean and Gaussian surface curvatures. Through these results, we present a comprehensive picture of how the brush geometry influences the end-exclusion zones and exact strong-stretching free energies, which can be applied, for example, to model the full spectrum of brush geometries encountered in block copolymer melt assembly.},

  abstract = {The structure of the water/Pt(111) interface has been a subject of debate over the past decades. Here, we report the results of a room temperature molecular dynamics study based on neural network potentials, which allow us to access long time scale simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy. We find that the water/Pt(111) interface is characterized by a double layer composed of a primary, strongly bound adsorption layer with a coverage of ∼ 0.15 ML, which is coupled to a secondary, weakly bound adsorption layer with a coverage of ∼ 0.58 ML. By studying the order of the primary adsorption layer, we find that there is an effective repulsion between the adsorbed water molecules, which gives rise to a dynamically changing, semi-ordered interfacial structure, where the water molecules in the primary adsorption layer are distributed homogeneously across the interface, forming frequent hydrogen bonds to water molecules in the secondary adsorption layer. We further show that these conclusions are beyond the time scales accessible to ab initio molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {We design and synthesize a set of homologous organic molecules by taking advantage of facile and tailorable Suzuki cross coupling reactions to produce triarylbenzene derivatives. By adjusting the number and the arrangement of conjugated rings, the identity of heteroatoms, lengths of fluorinated alkyl chains, and other interaction parameters, we create a library of glassformers with a wide range of properties. Measurements of the glass transition temperature ( T g ) show a power-law relationship between T g and molecular weight ( M W ), with of the molecules, with an exponent of 0.3 ± 0.1, for T g values spanning a range of 300–450 K. The trends in indices of refraction and expansion coefficients indicate a general increase in the glass density with M W , consistent with the trends observed in T g variations. A notable exception to these trends was observed with the addition of alkyl and fluorinated alkyl groups, which significantly reduced T g and increased the dynamical fragility (which is otherwise insensitive to M W ). This is an indication of reduced density and increased packing frustrations in these systems, which is also corroborated by the observations of the decreasing index of refraction with increasing length of these groups. These data were used to launch a new database for glassforming materials, glass.apps.sas.upenn.edu .},

  abstract = {Combining differential scanning calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy studies, we ascertain the glass transition of aqueous ethylene glycol (EG) solutions, in particular the effects of partial crystallization on their glassy slowdown. For the completely liquid solutions in the weakly supercooled regime, it is found that the dynamics of the components occur on very similar time scales, rotational and translational motions are coupled, and the structural ( α ) relaxation monotonously slows down with increasing EG concentration. Upon cooling, partial crystallization strongly alters the glassy dynamics of EG-poor solutions; in particular, it strongly retards the α relaxation of the remaining liquid fraction, causing a non-monotonous concentration dependence, and it results in a crossover from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius temperature dependence. In the deeply supercooled regime, a recrossing of the respective α -relaxation times results from the Arrhenius behaviors of the partially frozen EG-poor solutions together with the non-Arrhenius behavior of the fully liquid EG-rich solutions. Exploiting the isotope selectivity of nuclear magnetic resonance, we observe different rotational dynamics of the components in this low-temperature range and determine the respective contributions to the ν relaxation decoupling from the α relaxation when the glass transition is approached. The results suggest that the ν process, which is usually regarded as a water process, actually also involves the EG molecules. In addition, we show that various kinds of partially crystalline aqueous systems share a common relaxation process, which is associated with the frozen fraction and differs from that of bulk hexagonal ice.},

We faced this issue when dealing with the spectroscopic fingerprint of 4-methylacetophenone (4MAP), recently investigated in the microwave region, which we here extended into the millimeterwave region. The methyl group attached to the phenyl ring in 4MAP undergoes internal rotation with a very low barrier of only 22 cm −1 . The acetyl methyl group features a much higher barrier of about 580 cm −1 . The performances of a program using the so-called “local” approach in terms of Herschbach’s perturbative treatment, SPFIT , as well as three programs XIAM , ERHAM , and ntop , representing “global” fits, were tested. The results aim at helping spectroscopists in the decision on how to tackle their own internal rotation problems.},

The present study bridges the gap between the intermolecular dimerization-induced and the carbonyl stretching fundamentals that have already been reexamined using jet-cooled or high-resolution spectroscopy. This completes the characterization of the jet-cooled vibrational (HCOOH) 2 spectrum below the complex OH (CH) stretching fundamentals, and we report resonance-induced FAD combination/overtone transitions that will serve as a valuable reference for a theoretical modeling of its vibrational dynamics. As a by-product, several new formic acid trimer fundamentals are identified in the jet spectra and assigned with the help of second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2). The polar formic acid dimer still eludes detection in a supersonic jet, but we are able to estimate an experimental upper-bound of the polar dimer-to-trimer-to-cyclic dimer intensity ratio to about 1:10:100 under typical expansion conditions. Using VPT2 with resonance treatment (VPT2+K), we reinvestigate the notorious ν 22 resonance triad. Generally, we find that VPT2, which is, of course, inadequate for modeling the resonance-rich OH stretching spectrum of FAD, is performing very satisfactorily in predicting fundamental and two-quantum state term values for the slower modes below 1500 cm −1 . As these modes are the building blocks for the ultrafast energy dissipation in the OH stretching region, the present work opens the door for its quantitative understanding.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of molecular translational diffusion as measured by pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR (PGSE NMR) can be complicated by the presence of chemical exchange and/or dipolar cross-relaxation (including relayed cross-relaxation via spin diffusion). The magnitude of influence depends on the kinetics of exchange and/or dipolar cross-relaxation present within the system as well as the PGSE NMR sequences chosen for measurements. First, we present an exchange induced zero-crossing phenomenon for signal attenuation of water in lipidic cubic phases (formed by a mixture of monoolein and water) in the presence of pulsed gradients observed using a standard STimulated Echo (STE) sequence. This magnetization exchange induced zero-crossing phenomenon, a pseudo-negative diffraction-like feature, resembles that reported previously for restricted diffusion when locally anisotropic pores are polydisperse or randomly oriented. We then demonstrate the elimination of these exchange and/or dipolar cross-relaxation induced effects with the use of a chemical shift selective STE (CHESS-STE) sequence, adapted from the previously reported band-selective short transient STE sequence, along with results obtained from the bipolar pulse pair STE sequence for comparison. The CHESS-STE sequence introduced here represents a generic form of PGSE NMR sequences for obtaining water diffusion coefficients free from the influence of exchange and/or dipolar cross-relaxation in complex systems. It has potential applications in measuring translational diffusion of water in biopolymer mixtures as well as probing the microscopic structure in materials via water restricted diffusion measured by PGSE NMR, particularly when the potential presence of exchange/cross-relaxation is of concern.},

Isotopic substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium introduces minimal change to molecular structures and can be coupled with CARS microscopy to increase chemical contrast. Here, we investigate HeLa cells incubated with non-deuterated or deuterium-labeled fatty acids, using an in-house-developed hyperspectral CARS microscope coupled with an unsupervised quantitative data analysis algorithm, to retrieve Raman susceptibility spectra and concentration maps of chemical components in physically meaningful units. We demonstrate that our unsupervised analysis retrieves the susceptibility spectra of the specific fatty acids, both deuterated and non-deuterated, in good agreement with reference Raman spectra measured in pure lipids. Our analysis, using the cell-silent spectral region, achieved excellent chemical specificity despite having no prior knowledge and considering the complex intracellular environment inside cells. The quantitative capabilities of the analysis allowed us to measure the concentration of deuterated and non-deuterated fatty acids stored within cytosolic lipid droplets over a 24 h period. Finally, we explored the potential use of deuterium-labeled lipid droplets for non-invasive cell tracking, demonstrating an effective application of the technique for distinguishing between cells in a mixed population over a 16 h period. These results further demonstrate the chemically specific capabilities of hyperspectral CARS microscopy to characterize and distinguish specific lipid types inside cells using an unbiased quantitative data analysis methodology.},

  abstract = {Embedding theory is a powerful computational chemistry approach to exploring the electronic structure and dynamics of complex systems, with Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) being the prime example. A challenge arises when trying to apply embedding methodology to systems with diffusible particles, e.g., solvents, if some of them must be included in the QM region, for example, in the description of solvent-supported electronic states or reactions involving proton transfer or charge-transfer-to-solvent: without a special treatment, inter-diffusion of QM and MM particles will eventually lead to a loss of QM/MM separation. We have developed a new method called Flexible Boundary Layer using Exchange (FlexiBLE) that solves the problem by adding a biasing potential to the system that closely maintains QM/MM separation. The method rigorously preserves ensemble averages by leveraging their invariance to an exchange of identical particles. With a careful choice of the biasing potential and the use of a tree algorithm to include only important QM and MM exchanges, we find that the method has an MM-forcefield-like computational cost and thus adds negligible overhead to a QM/MM simulation. Furthermore, we show that molecular dynamics with the FlexiBLE bias conserves total energy, and remarkably, sub-diffusional dynamical quantities in the inner QM region are unaffected by the applied bias. FlexiBLE thus widens the range of chemistry that can be studied with embedding theory.},

The results indicate that, as the number of trajectories in each class increases from the ten- to five-class model, the five-class model converges the fastest and the prediction success rate increases. The number of trajectories in each experiment to get the predictive models converged is 100, 100, and 70, respectively.

  abstract = {Circularly polarized light (CPL) carrying spin angular momentum is crucial to many applications, such as quantum computing, optical communication, novel displays, and biosensing. Nonetheless, the emission from chiral molecules contains comparable CPL components with opposite handedness, resulting in low levels of CPL overall with a small dissymmetry factor and fixed handedness consistent with the handedness of the molecules. Nanoantennas have proved to be useful tools for controlling the emission properties of quantum emitters. In particular, dielectric resonators support electric and magnetic modes, which implies unparalleled opportunities to interact with chiral molecules whose emission originates from both electric and magnetic dipole transitions. In this work, we theoretically study the effects of a spherical dielectric nanoantenna on the directionality and polarization of emission from a chiral molecule. With exact analytical solutions based on generalized Mie theory, we show that directional chiral light emission and nontrivial polarization modulation, such as handedness reversal or chirality enhancement, can be achieved simultaneously for a chiral dipole tangentially coupled with a silicon nanosphere. The influence of the relative strength and orientation between the electric and magnetic dipole moments is also discussed. Our results suggest a new approach to controlling chiral dipolar emission and could benefit the development of chiral light sources.},

  abstract = {Fermi–Löwdin orbitals (FLOs) are a special set of localized orbitals, which have become commonly used in combination with the Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (SIC) in the FLO-SIC method. The FLOs are obtained for a set of occupied orbitals by specifying a classical position for each electron. These positions are known as Fermi-orbital descriptors (FODs), and they have a clear relation to chemical bonding. In this study, we show how FLOs and FODs can be used to initialize, interpret, and justify SIC solutions in a common chemical picture, both within FLO-SIC and in traditional variational SIC, and to locate distinct local minima in either of these approaches. We demonstrate that FLOs based on Lewis theory lead to symmetry breaking for benzene—the electron density is found to break symmetry already at the symmetric molecular structure—while ones from Linnett’s double-quartet theory reproduce symmetric electron densities and molecular geometries. Introducing a benchmark set of 16 planar cyclic molecules, we show that using Lewis theory as the starting point can lead to artifactual dipole moments of up to 1 D, while Linnett SIC dipole moments are in better agreement with experimental values. We suggest using the dipole moment as a diagnostic of symmetry breaking in SIC and monitoring it in all SIC calculations. We show that Linnett structures can often be seen as superpositions of Lewis structures and propose Linnett structures as a simple way to describe aromatic systems in SIC with reduced symmetry breaking. The role of hovering FODs is also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Spin–orbit coupling and vibronic coupling are both closely related to orbital degeneracy of electronic states. Both types of coupling play significant roles in determining properties of heavy element compounds and shall be treated on the same footing. In this work, we derive a unified one-electron Hamiltonian formalism for spin–orbit and vibronic interactions for systems in all axial symmetries. The one-electron formalism is usually adequate as the spin–orbit interaction can often be approximated as a one-electron interaction. For the first time, the formalism covers spin–orbit and vibronic couplings in all axial symmetries from C 1 to D ∞h , arbitrary types of vibrational modes in those symmetries, and an arbitrary number of those modes and gives Hamiltonian expansions up to an arbitrary order.},

  abstract = {A method for the computation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shieldings with second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is presented which allows to efficiently compute the entire set of shieldings for a given molecular structure. The equations are derived using Laplace-transformed atomic orbital second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory as a starting point. The Z-vector approach is employed for minimizing the number of coupled-perturbed self-consistent-field equations that need to be solved. In addition, the method uses the resolution-of-the-identity approximation with an attenuated Coulomb metric and Cholesky decomposition of pseudo-density matrices. The sparsity in the three-center integrals is exploited with sparse linear algebra approaches, leading to reduced computational cost and memory demands. Test calculations show that the deviations from NMR shifts obtained with canonical MP2 are small if appropriate thresholds are used. The performance of the method is illustrated in calculations on DNA strands and on glycine chains with up to 283 atoms and 2864 basis functions.},

  abstract = {We extend our linear-scaling approach for the calculation of Hartree–Fock exchange energy using localized in situ optimized orbitals [Dziedzic et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 139 , 214103 (2013)] to leverage massive parallelism. Our approach has been implemented in the onetep (Order-N Electronic Total Energy Package) density functional theory framework, which employs a basis of non-orthogonal generalized Wannier functions (NGWFs) to achieve linear scaling with system size while retaining controllable near-complete-basis-set accuracy. For the calculation of Hartree–Fock exchange, we use a resolution-of-identity approach, where an auxiliary basis set of truncated spherical waves is used to fit products of NGWFs. The fact that the electrostatic potential of spherical waves (SWs) is known analytically, combined with the use of a distance-based cutoff for exchange interactions, leads to a calculation cost that scales linearly with the system size. Our new implementation, which we describe in detail, combines distributed memory parallelism (using the message passing interface) with shared memory parallelism (OpenMP threads) to efficiently utilize numbers of central processing unit cores comparable to, or exceeding, the number of atoms in the system. We show how the use of multiple time-memory trade-offs substantially increases performance, enabling our approach to achieve superlinear strong parallel scaling in many cases and excellent, although sublinear, parallel scaling otherwise. We demonstrate that in scenarios with low available memory, which preclude or limit the use of time-memory trade-offs, the performance degradation of our algorithm is graceful. We show that, crucially, linear scaling with system size is maintained in all cases. We demonstrate the practicability of our approach by performing a set of fully converged production calculations with a hybrid functional on large imogolite nanotubes up to over 1400 atoms. We finish with a brief study of how the employed approximations (exchange cutoff and the quality of the SW basis) affect the calculation walltime and the accuracy of the obtained results.},

  abstract = {Modeling nonadiabatic dynamics in complex molecular or condensed-phase systems has been challenging, especially for the long-time dynamics. In this work, we propose a time series machine learning scheme based on the hybrid convolutional neural network/long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) framework for predicting the long-time quantum behavior, given only the short-time dynamics. This scheme takes advantage of both the powerful local feature extraction ability of CNN and the long-term global sequential pattern recognition ability of LSTM. With feature fusion of individually trained CNN-LSTM models for the quantum population and coherence dynamics, the proposed scheme is shown to have high accuracy and robustness in predicting the linearized semiclassical and symmetrical quasiclassical mapping dynamics as well as the mixed quantum-classical Liouville dynamics of various spin-boson models with learning time up to 0.3 ps. Furthermore, if the hybrid network has learned the dynamics of a system, this knowledge is transferable that could significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting the dynamics of a similar system. The hybrid CNN-LSTM network is thus believed to have high predictive power in forecasting the nonadiabatic dynamics in realistic charge and energy transfer processes in photoinduced energy conversion.},

  abstract = {Doping compounds can be considered a perturbation to the nuclear charges in a molecular Hamiltonian. Expansions of this perturbation in a Taylor series, i.e., quantum alchemy, have been used in the literature to assess millions of derivative compounds at once rather than enumerating them in costly quantum chemistry calculations. So far, it was unclear whether this series even converges for small molecules, whether it can be used for geometry relaxation, and how strong this perturbation may be to still obtain convergent numbers. This work provides numerical evidence that this expansion converges and recovers the self-consistent energy of Hartree–Fock calculations. The convergence radius of this expansion is quantified for dimer examples and systematically evaluated for different basis sets, allowing for estimates of the chemical space that can be covered by perturbing one reference calculation alone. Besides electronic energy, convergence is shown for density matrix elements, molecular orbital energies, and density profiles, even for large changes in electronic structure, e.g., transforming He 3 into H 6 . Subsequently, mixed alchemical and spatial derivatives are used to relax H 2 from the electronic structure of He alone, highlighting a path to spatially relaxed quantum alchemy. Finally, the underlying code that allows for arbitrarily accurate evaluation of restricted Hartree–Fock energies and arbitrary order derivatives is made available to support future method development.},

  abstract = {Domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster (DLPNO-CC) has become increasingly popular to calculate relative energies (e.g., reaction energies and reaction barriers). It can be applied within a multi-level DLPNO-CC-in-DLPNO-CC ansatz to reduce the computational cost and focus the available computational resources on a specific subset of the occupied orbitals. We demonstrate how this multi-level DLPNO-CC ansatz can be combined with our direct orbital selection (DOS) approach [M. Bensberg and J. Neugebauer, J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 214106 (2019)] to automatically select orbital sets for any multi-level calculation. We find that the parameters for the DOS procedure can be chosen conservatively such that they are transferable between reactions. The resulting automatic multi-level DLPNO-CC method requires no user input and is extremely robust and accurate. The computational cost is easily reduced by a factor of 3 without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method for a total of 61 reactions containing up to 174 atoms and use it to predict the relative stability of conformers of a Ru-based catalyst.},

Although a hexatic phase is expected when the exclusion range is large, it has not been seen earlier in hard core lattice gases with short range exclusion. In this paper, by numerically determining the entropies for all densities, we show that there is only a single phase transition in the system between a low-density fluid phase and a high density ordered sublattice phase and that a hexatic phase is absent. The transition is shown to be first order in nature, and the critical parameters are determined accurately.},

The model is validated against mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations and is based on kinetic equations accounting for scission and synthesis processes of blobs of surfactants. A long relaxation time scale is reached with both thermal quenches and small perturbations of the system. The scaling of this relaxation time is exponential with the free energy of an end cap and with the branching free energy. We argue that the subtle end-recombination dynamics might yield effects that are difficult to detect in rheology experiments, with possible underestimates of the typical time scales of viscoelastic fluids.},

  abstract = {Ionic microcapsules are hollow shells of hydrogel, typically 10–1000 nm in radius, composed of cross-linked polymer networks that become charged and swollen in a good solvent. The ability of microcapsules to swell/deswell in response to changes in external stimuli (e.g., temperature, pH, and ionic strength) suits them to applications, such as drug delivery, biosensing, and catalysis. The equilibrium swelling behavior of ionic microcapsules is determined by a balance of electrostatic and elastic forces. The electrostatic component of the osmotic pressure of a microcapsule—the difference in the pressure between the inside and outside of the particle—plays a vital role in determining the swelling behavior. Within the spherical cell model, we derive exact expressions for the radial pressure profile and for the electrostatic and gel components of the osmotic pressure of a microcapsule, which we compute via Poisson–Boltzmann theory and molecular dynamics simulation. For the gel component, we use the Flory–Rehner theory of polymer networks. By combining the electrostatic and gel components of the osmotic pressure, we compute the equilibrium size of ionic microcapsules as a function of particle concentration, shell thickness, and valence. We predict concentration-driven deswelling at relatively low concentrations at which steric interactions between particles are weak and demonstrate that this response can be attributed to crowding-induced redistribution of counterions. Our approach may help to guide the design and applications of smart stimuli-responsive colloidal particles.},

Here, we develop a theory based on the Rouse model for the dynamic structure factor of a single polyampholyte chain in the weak coupling regime (negligible intramolecular electrostatics) or subjected to weak external electric fields (governed by linear response). Neglecting effects of small ions, we find deviations in scaling from the classic Rouse theory and make predictions for scattering experiments performed on polyampholytes. We find that, under weak coupling with arbitrarily strong fields, the dynamics are highly dependent on the charge distribution and consequently look at two representative examples—random charge densities and periodic charge densities—with different scaling properties. Under weak fields, the dynamics are largely independent of charge distribution. Finally, we investigate the influence of hydrodynamic effects and the implications of including inertial effects in the model.},

  abstract = {Semicrystalline polymers are ubiquitous, yet despite their fundamental and industrial importance, the theory of homogeneous nucleation from a melt remains a subject of debate. A key component of the controversy is that polymer crystallization is a non-equilibrium process, making it difficult to distinguish between effects that are purely kinetic and those that arise from the underlying thermodynamics. Due to computational cost constraints, simulations of polymer crystallization typically employ non-equilibrium molecular dynamics techniques with large degrees of undercooling that further exacerbate the coupling between thermodynamics and kinetics. In a departure from this approach, in this study, we isolate the near-equilibrium nucleation behavior of a simple model of a melt of short, semiflexible oligomers. We employ several Monte Carlo methods and compute a phase diagram in the temperature–density plane along with two-dimensional free energy landscapes (FELs) that characterize the nucleation behavior. The phase diagram shows the existence of ordered nematic and crystalline phases in addition to the disordered melt phase. The minimum free energy path in the FEL for the melt–crystal transition shows a cooperative transition, where nematic order and monomer positional order move in tandem as the system crystallizes. This near-equilibrium phase transition mechanism broadly agrees with recent evidence that polymer stiffness plays an important role in crystallization but differs in the specifics of the mechanism from several recent theories. We conclude that the computation of multidimensional FELs for models that are larger and more fine-grained will be important for evaluating and refining theories of homogeneous nucleation for polymer crystallization.},

  abstract = {The self-assembly of binary colloidal mixtures provides a bottom-up approach to create novel functional materials. To elucidate the effect of composition, temperature, and pressure on the self-assembly behavior of size-asymmetric mixtures, we performed extensive dynamics simulations of a simple model of polymer-grafted colloids. We have used a core-softened interaction potential and extended it to represent attractive interactions between unlike colloids and repulsions between like colloids. Our study focused on size-asymmetric mixtures where the ratio between the sizes of the colloidal cores was fixed at σ B σ A = 0.5 ⁠ . We have performed extensive simulations in the isothermal–isobaric and canonical (NVT) ensembles to elucidate the phase behavior and dynamics of mixtures with different stoichiometric ratios. Our simulation results uncovered a rich phase behavior, including the formation of hierarchical structures with many potential applications. For compositions where small colloids are the majority, sublattice melting occurs for a wide range of densities. Under these conditions, large colloids form a well-defined lattice, whereas small colloids can diffuse through the system. As the temperature is decreased, the small colloids localize, akin to a metal–insulator transition, with the small colloids playing a role similar to electrons. Our results are summarized in terms of phase diagrams.},

An accurate characterization of the frontier energy level alignment at these interfaces is key in the fundamental understanding of the charge transfer dynamics between the two photon absorbers. Here, we employ the first-principles substrate screening GW approach to quantitatively characterize the quasiparticle electronic structure of a series of interfaces: metal-free phthalocyanine (H 2 Pc) adsorbed on monolayer MX 2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) adsorbed on MoX 2 (X = S, Se). Furthermore, we reveal the dielectric screening effect of the commonly used α -quartz (SiO 2 ) substrate on the H 2 Pc:MoS 2 interface using the dielectric embedding GW approach. Our calculations furnish a systematic set of GW results for these interfaces, providing the structure–property relationship across a series of similar systems and benchmarks for future experimental and theoretical studies.},

  abstract = {The wetting state of surfaces can be rendered to a highly hydrophobic state by the deposition of hydrophilic gas phase synthesized Ag nanoparticles (NPs). The aging of Ag NPs leads to an increase in their size, which is also associated with the presence of Ag adatoms on the surface between the NPs that have a strong effect on the wetting processes. Furthermore, surface airborne hydrocarbons were removed by UV–ozone treatment, providing deeper insight into the apparent mobility of the NPs on different surfaces and their subsequent ripening and aging. In addition, the UV–ozone treatment revealed the presence of adatoms during the magnetron sputtering process. This surface treatment lowers the initial contact angle of the substrates and facilitates the mobility of Ag NPs and adatoms on the surface of substrates. Adatoms co-deposited on clean high surface energy substrates will nucleate on Ag NPs that will remain closely spherical and preserve the pinning effect due to the water nanomeniscus. If the adatoms are co-deposited on a UV–ozone cleaned low surface energy substrate, their mobility is restricted, and they will nucleate in two-dimensional islands and/or nanoclusters on the surface instead of connecting to existing Ag NPs. This growth results in a rough surface without overhangs, where the wetting state is reversed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Finally, different material surfaces of transmission electron microscopy grids revealed strong differences in the sticking coefficient for the Ag NPs, suggesting another factor that can strongly affect their wetting properties.},

  abstract = {Low-pressure ice forms, such as hexagonal and cubic ice, expand on cooling below temperature 60 K. This negative thermal expansivity has been explored in terms of phonon frequency modulation with varying volume and attributed to the negative Grüneisen parameters unique mostly to tetrahedrally coordinated substances. However, an underlying mechanism for the negative Grüneisen parameters has not been known except some schematic analyses. We investigate in this study the characteristics of the intermolecular vibrational modes whose Grüneisen parameters are negative by examining the individual vibrational modes rigorously. It is found that the low frequency modes below 100 cm −1 , which we explicitly show are mostly bending motions of three hydrogen-bonded molecules, necessarily accompany elongation of the hydrogen bond length at peak amplitudes compared with that at the equilibrium position in executing the vibrational motions. The elongation gives rise to a decrease in the repulsive interaction while an increase in the Coulombic one. The decrease in the repulsive interaction is relaxed substantially by expansion due to its steep slope against molecular separation compared with the sluggish increase in the Coulombic one, and therefore, the negative Grüneisen parameters are obtainable. This scenario is tested against some variants of cubic ice with various water potential models. It is demonstrated that four interaction-site models are suitable to describe the intermolecular vibrations and the thermal expansivity because of the moderate tendency to favor the tetrahedral coordination.},

  abstract = {The structural changes of water upon deep supercooling were studied through wide-angle x-ray scattering at SwissFEL. The experimental setup had a momentum transfer range of 4.5 Å −1 , which covered the principal doublet of the x-ray structure factor of water. The oxygen–oxygen structure factor was obtained for temperatures down to 228.5 ± 0.6 K. Similar to previous studies, the second diffraction peak increased strongly in amplitude as the structural change accelerated toward a local tetrahedral structure upon deep supercooling. We also observed an anomalous trend for the second peak position of the oxygen–oxygen structure factor ( q 2 ). We found that q 2 exhibits an unprecedented positive partial derivative with respect to temperature for temperatures below 236 K. Based on Fourier inversion of our experimental data combined with reference data, we propose that the anomalous q 2 shift originates from that a repeat spacing in the tetrahedral network, associated with all peaks in the oxygen–oxygen pair-correlation function, gives rise to a less dense local ordering that resembles that of low-density amorphous ice. The findings are consistent with that liquid water consists of a pentamer-based hydrogen-bonded network with low density upon deep supercooling.},

Localized surface plasmon resonances of metallic nanostructures have the capability of enhancing an impinging electromagnetic radiation in the proximity of their surface, with evident consequences both on absorption and emission of molecules placed in the same region. We propose a theoretical analysis of these phenomena in order to interpret TEPL experiments on single molecules, including a quantum mechanical description of the target molecule equilibrated with the presence of two nanostructures representative of the nanocavity usually employed in STMs. The approach has been applied to the zinc phthalocyanine molecule, previously considered in recent TEPL experiments [Yang et al. , Nat. Photonics 14 , 693–699 (2020)]. This work has the aim of providing a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the experimental results, particularly focusing on the investigation of the tip features that majorly influence the excitation and fluorescence processes of the molecule, such as the geometry, the dielectric function, and the tip–molecule distance.},

  abstract = {Atoms remaining as recognizably distinct constituents of bulk condensed phases can have properties modified from those of the isolated species. Dense helium bubbles at high pressures are a common form of radiation damage degrading the mechanical and electrical properties of host materials. Detailed knowledge is critical for predicting their long term performance. Modifications of the ground and first singlet excited states of confined compressed helium are investigated using an entirely non-empirical theory based on the results of ab initio self-consistent field calculations with corrections for the effects of electron correlation. For finite sized portions representing bulk condensed fcc and bcc phases of helium atoms, Hartree–Fock wavefunctions, energies, and charge distributions were computed as a function of different atomic densities using two models. The first model for the first excited state localizes the excitation on the central atom; in the second model, this is partially delocalized over the closest atomic neighbors. Total energies for the finite size portions are derived by adding the inter-atomic dispersive attractions and a density functional description of the short-range inter-atomic correlation energy. The experimental energy of the first allowed electronic transition increases with density being larger than in an isolated atom. The intra-atomic correlation energy does not contribute to this energy shift. The calculated energy shifts agree well with experiment for both bulk solid and liquid helium. The 2p orbital is increasingly compressed by density enhancement, thus generating the energy shifts. Consequently, calculations of the inelastic electron scattering cross sections are substantially incorrect if the compression of the final 1s2p state is not included. The character of the excitations is examined, and it is argued that these are of Frenkel rather than the Wannier type.},

  abstract = {Infrared photothermal heterodyne imaging (IR-PHI) is an all-optical table top approach that enables super-resolution mid-infrared microscopy and spectroscopy. The underlying principle behind IR-PHI is the detection of photothermal changes to specimens induced by their absorption of infrared radiation. Because detection of resulting refractive index and scattering cross section changes is done using a visible (probe) laser, IR-PHI exhibits a spatial resolution of ∼300 nm. This is significantly below the mid-infrared diffraction limit and is unlike conventional infrared absorption microscopy where spatial resolution is of order ∼ 5 μ m. Despite having achieved mid-infrared super-resolution, IR-PHI’s spatial resolution is ultimately limited by the visible probe laser’s diffraction limit. This hinders immediate application to studying samples residing in spatially congested environments. To circumvent this, we demonstrate further enhancements to IR-PHI’s spatial resolution using a deep learning network that addresses the Abbe diffraction limit as well as background artifacts, introduced by experimental raster scanning. What results is a twofold improvement in feature resolution from 300 to ∼ 150 nm.},

The experimental data were interpreted by means of models derived from the Solomon–Bloembergen–Morgan theory. The data analysis was performed assuming the orbital angular momentum L = 0 for Gd-DOTA and the aqua ion [Mn(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ and L ≠ 0 for Dy-, Tb-, and Er-DOTA. A refined estimation of the zero-field-splitting barrier Δ and of the modulation correlation time τ v was obtained for [Mn(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ by extending the fitting of nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profiles to the low-field regime. The Gd-DOTA fitting parameters resulted in good agreement with the literature, and the fit of transverse relaxivity data confirmed the negligibility of the scalar interaction in the nuclear relaxation mechanism. Larger transverse relaxivities of Dy-DOTA and Tb-DOTA (∼10 mM −1 s −1 ) with respect to Er-DOTA (∼1 mM −1 s −1 ) were observed at 16 T. Such higher values are suggested to be due to a shorter residence time τ m that is possibly linked to the fluctuations of the hyperfine interaction and the different shape of the magnetic anisotropy. The possible employment of Dy-DOTA, Tb-DOTA, and Er-DOTA as negative magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for high-field applications was envisaged by collecting spin-echo images at 7 T. Particularly in Dy- and Tb-derivatives, the transverse relaxivity at 16 T is of the order of the Gd-one at 1.5 T.},

  abstract = {The H-atom dissociation of formaldehyde on the lowest triplet state ( T 1 ) is studied by quasi-classical molecular dynamic simulations on the high-dimensional machine-learning potential energy surface (PES) model. An atomic-energy based deep-learning neural network (NN) is used to represent the PES function, and the weighted atom-centered symmetry functions are employed as inputs of the NN model to satisfy the translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries, and to capture the geometry features of each atom and its individual chemical environment. Several standard technical tricks are used in the construction of NN-PES, which includes the application of clustering algorithm in the formation of the training dataset, the examination of the reliability of the NN-PES model by different fitted NN models, and the detection of the out-of-confidence region by the confidence interval of the training dataset. The accuracy of the full-dimensional NN-PES model is examined by two benchmark calculations with respect to ab initio data. Both the NN and electronic-structure calculations give a similar H-atom dissociation reaction pathway on the T 1 state in the intrinsic reaction coordinate analysis. The small-scaled trial dynamics simulations based on NN-PES and ab initio PES give highly consistent results. After confirming the accuracy of the NN-PES, a large number of trajectories are calculated in the quasi-classical dynamics, which allows us to get a better understanding of the T 1 -driven H-atom dissociation dynamics efficiently. Particularly, the dynamics simulations from different initial conditions can be easily simulated with a rather low computational cost. The influence of the mode-specific vibrational excitations on the H-atom dissociation dynamics driven by the T 1 state is explored. The results show that the vibrational excitations on symmetric C–H stretching, asymmetric C–H stretching, and C=O stretching motions always enhance the H-atom dissociation probability obviously.},

  abstract = {Increased electricity usage over the past several decades has accelerated the need for efficient high-voltage power transmission with reliable insulating materials. Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) prepared via dicumyl peroxide (DCP) cross-linking has emerged as the insulator of choice for modern power cables. Although DCP cross-linking generates the desired XLPE product in high yield, other by-products are also produced. One such by-product, acetophenone, is particularly intriguing due to its aromaticity and positive electron affinity. In this work, constrained density functional theory (C-DFT) was utilized to develop an e-ReaxFF force field suitable for describing the acetophenone radical anion. Initial parameters were taken from the 2021 Akbarian e-ReaxFF force field, which was developed to describe XLPE chemistry. Then, C-DFT geometry optimizations were performed wherein an excess electron was constrained to each atom of acetophenone. The resulting C-DFT energy values for the various electronic positions were added to the e-ReaxFF training set. Next, an analogous set of structures was energy-minimized using e-ReaxFF, and equilibrium mixture compositions for the two methods were compared at multiple temperatures. Iterative fitting against C-DFT energy data was performed until satisfactory agreement was achieved. To test force field performance, molecular dynamics simulations were performed in e-ReaxFF and the resulting electronic distributions were qualitatively compared to unconstrained-DFT spin density data. By expanding our e-ReaxFF force field for XLPE, namely, adding the capability to describe acetophenone and its interactions with an excess electron, we move one step closer to a comprehensive molecular understanding of XLPE chemistry in a high-voltage power cable.},

  abstract = {This work introduces a new permutation-symmetry-adapted machine learning diabatization procedure, termed the diabatization by equivariant neural network (DENN). In this approach, the permutation symmetric and anti-symmetric elements in diabatic potential energy metrics (DPEMs) were simultaneously simulated by the equivariant neural network. The diabatization by deep neural network scheme was adopted for machine learning diabatization, and non-zero diabatic coupling was included to increase accuracy in the near degenerate region. Based on DENN, the global DPEMs for 1 1 A ′ and 2 1 A ′ states of MgH 2 have been constructed. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first global DPEMs for the MgH 2 system. The root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) for diagonal elements ( H 11 and H 22 ) and the off-diagonal element ( H 12 ) around the conical intersection region were 5.824, 5.307, and 5.796 meV, respectively. The RMSEs of global adiabatic energies for two adiabatic states were 4.613 and 12.755 meV, respectively. The spectroscopic calculations of the 1 1 A ′ state in the linear HMgH region are in good agreement with the experiment and previous theoretical results. The differences between calculated frequencies and corresponding experiment values are 1.38 and 1.08 cm −1 for anti-symmetric stretching fundamental vibrational frequency and first overtone. The global DPEMs obtained in this work should be useful for further quantum mechanics dynamic simulations on the MgH 2 system.},

  abstract = {In mixed quantum-classical nonadiabatic molecular dynamics methods, the anchoring of the electronic wave function to a single nuclear geometry results in both quantitative and qualitative errors in the dynamics. In the context of both Ehrenfest and trajectory surface hopping methods, methods for incorporating decoherence are widely used to eliminate these errors. However, the accuracy of these methods often depends strongly on the parameterization of the decoherence time and/or other related quantities. Here, we present a refinement of the recently introduced collapse to a block (TAB) scheme for incorporating decoherence into Ehrenfest dynamics. The proposed approach incorporates an approximation to the history of the population dynamics and treats the coherence decay as Gaussian, rather than exponential. This method uses parameters that can be obtained from first principles, rather than empirical fitting. Application to one-dimensional models indicates excellent agreement with numerically exact simulations. We also introduce a second refinement to the TAB method: a robust linear least-squares algorithm for determining collapse probabilities.},

Despite large differences in electronic properties between the closed shell stoichiometric Ti n O 2n clusters and the suboxide Ti n O 2n−x (x = 1–3) clusters, the transient responses for all clusters contain a fast response of 35 fs followed by a sub-picosecond (ps) excited state lifetime. In this non-scalable size regime, subtle changes in the sub-ps lifetimes are attributed to variations in the coordination of Ti atoms and localization of charge carriers following UV photoexcitation. In general, clusters exhibit longer lifetimes with increased size and also with the addition of O atoms. This suggests that the removal of O atoms develops stronger Ti–Ti interactions as the system transitions from a semiconducting character to a fast metallic electronic relaxation mechanism.},

We then consider a population balance partial differential equation (PDE) on the phase size distribution and solve it analytically. Then, by relating this PDE solution to the transformed fraction of phase, we are able to derive initial conditions to the differential equation relating nucleation rate, growth rate, and transformed fraction.},

  abstract = {The complexity of gas and condensed phase chemical reactions has generally been uncovered either approximately through transition state theories or exactly through (analytic or computational) integration of trajectories. These approaches can be improved by recognizing that the dynamics and associated geometric structures exist in phase space, ensuring that the propagator is symplectic as in velocity-Verlet integrators and by extending the space of dividing surfaces to optimize the rate variationally, respectively. The dividing surface can be analytically or variationally optimized in phase space, not just over configuration space, to obtain more accurate rates. Thus, a phase space perspective is of primary importance in creating a deeper understanding of the geometric structure of chemical reactions. A key contribution from dynamical systems theory is the generalization of the transition state (TS) in terms of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) whose geometric phase-space structure persists under perturbation. The NHIM can be regarded as an anchor of a dividing surface in phase space and it gives rise to an exact non-recrossing TS theory rate in reactions that are dominated by a single bottleneck. Here, we review recent advances of phase space geometrical structures of particular relevance to chemical reactions in the condensed phase. We also provide conjectures on the promise of these techniques toward the design and control of chemical reactions.},

In the present theoretical study, we show that hydrophobic hydration at the Au(100)/water interface actively contributes to the reaction free energy by up to several hundreds of meV. This occurs either in adsorption/desorption reaction steps, where the vertical distance from the surface changes in going from reactants to products, or in addition and elimination reaction steps, where two small reactants merge into a larger product and vice versa. We find that size and position effects cannot be captured by treating them as independent variables. Instead, their simultaneous evaluation allows us to map the important contributions, and we provide examples of their combinations for which interfacial reactions can be either favored or disfavored. By taking a N 2 and a CO 2 reduction pathway as test cases, we show that explicitly considering hydrophobic effects is important for the selectivity and rate of these relevant interfacial processes.},

Continuum electrostatics offer a simple description of the induced charge density at the electrode surface. However, such a simple description does not take into account features related to the atomic structure of the solid and to the molecular nature of the solvent and of the dissolved ions. In order to illustrate such effects and assess the ability of continuum electrostatics to describe the induced charge distribution, we investigate the behavior of a gold electrode interacting with sodium or chloride ions fixed at various positions, in a vacuum or in water, using all-atom constant-potential classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our analysis highlights important similarities between the two approaches, especially under vacuum conditions and when the ion is sufficiently far from the surface, as well as some limitations of the continuum description, namely, neglecting the charges induced by the adsorbed solvent molecules and the screening effect of the solvent when the ion is close to the surface. While the detailed features of the charge distribution are system-specific, we expect some of our generic conclusions on the induced charge density to hold for other ions, solvents, and electrode surfaces. Beyond this particular case, the present study also illustrates the relevance of such molecular simulations to serve as a reference for the design of improved implicit solvent models of electrode–electrolyte interfaces.},

  abstract = {The performance of catalysts depends on their nanoscale properties, and local variations in structure and composition can have a dramatic impact on the catalytic reactivity. Therefore, probing the localized reactivity of catalytic surfaces using high spatial resolution vibrational spectroscopy, such as infrared (IR) nanospectroscopy and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, is essential for mapping their reactivity pattern. Two fundamentally different scanning probe IR nanospectroscopy techniques, namely, scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR), provide the capabilities for mapping the reactivity pattern of catalytic surfaces with a spatial resolution of ∼20 nm. Herein, we compare these two techniques with regard to their applicability for probing the vibrational signature of reactive molecules on catalytic nanoparticles. For this purpose, we use chemically addressable self-assembled molecules on Au nanoparticles as model systems. We identified significant spectral differences depending on the measurement technique, which originate from the fundamentally different working principles of the applied methods. While AFM-IR spectra provided information from all the molecules that were positioned underneath the tip, the s-SNOM spectra were more orientation-sensitive. Due to its field-enhancement factor, the s-SNOM spectra showed higher vibrational signals for dipoles that were perpendicularly oriented to the surface. The s-SNOM sensitivity to the molecular orientation influenced the amplitude, position, and signal-to-noise ratio of the collected spectra. Ensemble-based IR measurements verified that differences in the localized IR spectra stem from the enhanced sensitivity of s-SNOM measurements to the adsorption geometry of the probed molecules.},

  abstract = {Understanding the formation of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ion batteries is an ongoing area of research due to its high degree of complexity and the difficulties encountered by experimental studies. Herein, we investigate the initial stage of SEI growth, the reduction reaction of ethylene carbonate (EC), from both a thermodynamic and a kinetic approach with theory and molecular simulations. We employed both the potential distribution theorem and the Solvation Method based on Density (SMD) to EC solvation for the estimation of reduction potentials of Li + , EC, and Li + -solvating EC (s-EC) as well as reduction rate constants of EC and s-EC. We find that solvation effects greatly influence these quantities of interest, particularly the Li + /Li reference electrode potential in EC solvent. Furthermore, we also compute the inner- and outer-sphere reorganization energies for both EC and s-EC at the interface of liquid EC and a hydroxyl-terminated graphite surface, where total reorganization energies are predicted to be 76.6 and 88.9 kcal/mol, respectively. With the computed reorganization energies, we estimate reduction rate constants across a range of overpotentials and show that EC has a larger electron transfer rate constant than s-EC at equilibrium, despite s-EC being more thermodynamically favorable. Overall, this manuscript demonstrates how ion solvation effects largely govern the prediction of reduction potentials and electron transfer rate constants at the electrode–electrolyte interface.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) at electrode/electrolyte interfaces includes inelastic light scattering not only by molecular vibrations in the electrolyte phase but also by conduction electrons in the metal electrode phase. While the former, i.e., vibrational SERS (VSERS), is widely used to obtain chemical information on electrode surfaces, the latter, i.e., electronic SERS (ESERS), is still under discussion as a possible origin of the SERS background. Given that electronic Raman scattering is essentially sensitive to the surface charge density of a metal, we conducted a thorough comparison of electrochemical potential dependence of SERS signals in both acidic and alkaline media. Significant intensity changes in the SERS background were observed close to the respective potentials of zero charge in acidic and alkaline media, supporting the contention that the generation of the SERS background can be explained by the ESERS mechanism. Moreover, the ESERS intensities, as the SERS background, were reversibly varied by anion adsorption/desorption at the electrochemical interfaces in conjunction with VSERS features originated from surface-adsorbate vibrations. The sensitivity to the surface charge was much higher in this method than in the conventional combined method of reflectance and SERS. In situ monitoring of both chemical and electronic structures at electrode/electrolyte interfaces using a single spectroscopic probe can avoid various experimental uncertainties caused by combined application of different spectroscopic methods leading to facilitation of our deeper understanding of electrode processes.},

The first-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory show that the beta-XTe exhibit good stability, high electron carrier mobility, and ultralow Κ L . The subsequent analyses show that the ultralow Κ L stems from the coexistence of resonant bonding, weak bonding, and lone-pair electrons in beta-XTe, which leads to large anharmonicities. On the other hand, the lowest energy conduction band of beta-GeTe and beta-SnTe show the convergence of the low-lying Ʃ band, which is the source of the high-power factor in the two systems. The calculated maximum ZT of beta-XTe (X = Ge, Sn, Pb) are 3.08, 1.60, and 0.57 at 300 K, respectively, which is significantly greater than that of the previously reported high-symmetry 2D alpha-XTe and the commercial thermoelectrics.

  abstract = {It has long been thought that shear band (SB) formation in amorphous solids initiates from relatively “soft” regions in the material in which large-scale non-affine deformations become localized. The test of this hypothesis requires an effective means of identifying “soft” regions and their evolution as the material is deformed to varying degrees, where the metric of “softness” must also account for the effect of temperature on local material stiffness. We show that the mean square atomic displacement on a caging timescale ⟨ u 2 ⟩, the “Debye–Waller factor,” provides a useful method for estimating the shear modulus of the entire material and, by extension, the material stiffness at an atomic scale. Based on this “softness” metrology, we observe that SB formation indeed occurs through the strain-induced formation of localized soft regions in our deformed metallic glass free-standing films. Unexpectedly, the critical strain condition for SB formation occurs when the softness (⟨ u 2 ⟩) distribution within the emerging soft regions approaches that of the interfacial region in its undeformed state, initiating an instability with similarities to the transition to turbulence. Correspondingly, no SBs arise when the material is so thin that the entire material can be approximately described as being “interfacial” in nature. We also quantify relaxation in the glass and the nature and origin of highly non-Gaussian particle displacements in the dynamically heterogeneous SB regions at times longer than the caging time.},

In general, to compute the coefficient of the overall binding process, we need to consider both the diffusion of reactants and barrier crossing to reach the bound state. Here, we develop a methodology of quantifying the rate coefficient of binding based on molecular dynamics simulation and returning probability (RP) theory proposed by Kim and Lee [J. Chem. Phys. 131 , 014503 (2009)]. RP theory provides a tractable formula of the rate coefficient in terms of the thermodynamic stability and kinetics of the intermediate state on a predefined reaction coordinate. In this study, the interaction energy between reactants is utilized as the reaction coordinate, enabling us to effectively describe the reactants’ relative position and orientation on one-dimensional space. Application of this method to the host–guest binding systems, which consist of β -cyclodextrin and small guest molecules, yields the rate coefficients consistent with the experimental results.},

  abstract = {Liquid–liquid phase separation of fluids exhibiting interconversion between alternative states has been proposed as an underlying mechanism for fluid polyamorphism and may be of relevance to the protein function and intracellular organization. However, molecular-level insight into the interplay between competing forces that can drive or restrict phase separation in interconverting fluids remains elusive. Here, we utilize an off-lattice model of enantiomers with tunable chiral interconversion and interaction properties to elucidate the physics underlying the stabilization and tunability of phase separation in fluids with interconverting states. We show that introducing an imbalance in the intermolecular forces between two enantiomers results in nonequilibrium, arrested phase separation into microdomains. We also find that in the equilibrium case, when all interaction forces are conservative, the growth of the phase domain is restricted only by the system size. In this case, we observe phase amplification, in which one of the two alternative phases grows at the expense of the other. These findings provide novel insights on how the interplay between dynamics and thermodynamics defines the equilibrium and steady-state morphologies of phase transitions in fluids with interconverting molecular or supramolecular states.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have shown that the repulsive force between atomically flat, like-charged surfaces confining room-temperature ionic liquids or concentrated electrolytes exhibits an anomalously large decay length. In our previous publication [J. Zeman, S. Kondrat, and C. Holm, Chem. Commun. 56 , 15635 (2020)], we showed by means of extremely large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that this so-called underscreening effect might not be a feature of bulk electrolytes. Herein, we corroborate these findings by providing additional results with more detailed analyses and expand our investigations to ionic liquids under confinement. Unlike in bulk systems, where screening lengths are computed from the decay of interionic potentials of mean force, we extract such data in confined systems from cumulative charge distributions. At high concentrations, our simulations show increasing screening lengths with increasing electrolyte concentration, consistent with classical liquid state theories. However, our analyses demonstrate that—also for confined systems—there is no anomalously large screening length. As expected, the screening lengths determined for ionic liquids under confinement are in good quantitative agreement with the screening lengths of the same ionic systems in bulk. In addition, we show that some theoretical models used in the literature to relate the measured screening lengths to other observables are inapplicable to highly concentrated electrolytes.},

Commun. 9 , 3352 (2018)] of a surprisingly contracted 60-atom hollow shell of chiral-icosahedral symmetry ( I -Au 60 ) of remarkable rigidity and electronegativity, we have explored, via first-principles density functional theory calculations, its physico-chemical interactions with internal and external shells, enabling conclusions regarding its robustness and identifying composite forms in which an identifiable I -Au 60 structure may be realized as a product of natural or laboratory processes. The dimensions and rigidity of I -Au 60 suggest a templating approach; e.g., an I h -C 60 fullerene fits nicely within its interior, as a nested cage. In this work, we have focused on its susceptibility, i.e., the extent to which the unique structural and electronic properties of I -Au 60 are modified by incorporation into selected multi-shell structures. Our results confirm that the I -Au 60 shell is robustly maintained and protected in various bilayer structures: I h -C 60 @ I -Au 60 , I h -Au 32 @ I - A u 60 2 + ⁠ , Au 60 (MgCp) 12 , and their silver analogs. A detailed analysis of the structural and electronic properties of the selected I -Au 60 shell-based nanostructures is presented. We found that the I -Au 60 shell structure is quite well retained in several robust forms. In all cases, the I -symmetry is preserved, and the I -Au 60 shell is slightly deformed only in the case of the I h -C 60 @ I -Au 60 system. This analysis serves to stimulate and provide guidance toward the identification and isolation of various I -Au 60 shell-based nanostructures, with much potential for future applications. We conclude with a critical comparative discussion of these systems and of the implications for continuing theoretical and experimental investigations.},

Various theoretical analyses for these reactions, such as metallicity ξ( r b ), ellipticity ε, total local energy density H ( r b ), stress tensor polarizability ℙ σ , stress tensor eigenvalue λ 3σ , and bond-path length, display differently for non-competitive and competitive reactions as well as for the conrotatory preferences either it is the transition state outward conrotatory (TS out ) or transition state inward conrotatory (TS in ) directions by presenting degeneracy or non-degeneracy in their results. The ellipticity profile provides the motion of the bond critical point locations due to the different substituents of cyclobutene. In agreement with experimental results, examinations demonstrated that N1 is a competitive reaction and N2–N3 are non-competitive reactions with TS out and TS in preference directions, respectively.

After initial excitation to the first excited singlet state, S 1 , the radical dissociation proceeds largely via the first excited triplet state, T 1 , at excitation energies above the T 1 barrier. By combining velocity-mapped ion imaging with high-level theory, we place this barrier at 368.3 ± 2.4 kJ mol −1 (30 780 ± 200 cm −1 ). After exciting to S 1 at energies below this barrier, the dissociation proceeds exclusively via the ground electronic state, S 0 . The dissociation threshold is determined to be 335.7 ± 1.8 kJ mol −1 (28 060 ± 150 cm −1 ).

The present method successfully reproduced very similar photoabsorption spectra as experiments from the viewpoint of the peak positions and relative peak heights. We also performed exciton analysis with the exciton wave functions for several lowest singlet and triplet exciton states to reveal the details of the optical properties. We applied this to not only the present six CzBN derivatives but also 18 other TADF molecules and proposed a new exciton map to classify the molecules as the TADF active/inactive by using the exciton binding energy in the vertical axis and the ratio of electron and hole delocalization in the horizontal axis. Our results suggest two possible TADF mechanisms: spatially less localized hole states than the electron states where the exciton binding energy is proportional to the ratio of hole and electron delocalization and spatially more localized hole states than the electron states where the exciton binding energy should be large.},

  abstract = {Silicon nanophotonics has attracted significant attention because of its unique optical properties such as efficient light confinement and low non-radiative loss. For practical applications such as all-optical switch, optical nonlinearity is a prerequisite, but the nonlinearity of silicon is intrinsically weak. Recently, we discovered a giant nonlinearity of scattering from a single silicon nanostructure by combining Mie resonance enhanced photo-thermal and thermo-optic effects. Since scattering and absorption are closely linked in Mie theory, we expect that absorption, as well as heating, of the silicon nanostructure shall exhibit similar nonlinear behaviors. In this work, we experimentally measure the temperature rise of a silicon nanoblock by in situ Raman spectroscopy, explicitly demonstrating the connection between nonlinear scattering and nonlinear heating. The results agree well with finite-element simulation based on the photo-thermo-optic effect, manifesting that the nonlinear effect is the coupled consequence of the red shift between scattering and absorption spectra. Our work not only unravels the nonlinear absorption in a silicon Mie-resonator but also offers a quantitative analytic model to better understand the complete photo-thermo-optic properties of silicon nanostructures, providing a new perspective toward practical silicon photonics applications.},

  abstract = {The reaction path Hamiltonian (RPH) can be used to calculate chemical reaction rate constants, going beyond transition-state theory in taking account of recrossing by providing an approximation to the dynamic transmission coefficient. However, the RPH necessitates the calculation of the Hessian matrix at a number of points along the minimum energy path; the associated computational cost stands as a bottleneck in RPH calculations, especially if one is interested in using high-accuracy electronic structure methods. In this work, four different Hessian update schemes (symmetric rank-1, Powell-symmetric Broyden, Bofill, and TS-BFGS updates) are assessed to see whether or not they reliably reproduce calculated transmission coefficients for three different chemical reactions. Based on the reactions investigated, the symmetric rank-1 Hessian update was the least appropriate for RPH construction, giving different transmission coefficients from the standard analytical Hessian approach, as well as inconsistent frequencies and coupling properties. The Bofill scheme, the Powell-symmetric Broyden scheme, and the TS-BFGS scheme were the most reliable Hessian update methods, with transmission coefficients that were in good agreement with those calculated by the standard RPH calculations. The relative accuracy of the different Hessian update schemes is further rationalized by investigating the approximated Coriolis and curvature coupling terms along the reaction-path, providing insight into when these schemes would be expected to work well. Furthermore, the associated computational cost associated with the RPH calculations was substantially reduced by the tested update schemes. Together, these results provide useful rules-of-thumb for using Hessian update schemes in RPH simulations.},

  abstract = {Computing ab initio molecular linear response properties, e.g., electronic excitation energies and transition dipole moments, requires the solution of large eigenvalue problems or large systems of equations. These large eigenvalue problems or large systems of equations are commonly solved iteratively using Krylov space algorithms, such as the Davidson algorithm for eigenvalue problems. A critical ingredient in Krylov space algorithms is the preconditioner, which is used to generate optimal update vectors in each iteration. We propose to use semiempirical approximations as preconditioners to accelerate the calculation of ab initio properties. The crucial advantage to improving the preconditioner is that the converged result is unchanged, so there is no trade-off between accuracy and speedup. We demonstrate our approach by accelerating the calculation of electronic excitation energies and electric polarizabilities from linear response time-dependent density functional theory using the simplified time-dependent density functional theory semiempirical model. For excitation energies, the semiempirical preconditioner reduces the number of iterations on average by 37\% and up to 70\%. The semiempirical preconditioner reduces the number of iterations for computing the polarizability by 15\% on average and up to 33\%. Moreover, we show that the preconditioner can be further improved by tuning the empirical parameters that define the semiempirical model, leading to an additional reduction in the number of iterations by about 20\%. Our approach bridges the gap between semiempirical models and ab initio methods and charts a path toward combining the speed of semiempirical models with the accuracy of ab initio methods.},

  abstract = {We introduce a practical method for compacting the time evolution of the quantum state of a closed physical system. The density matrix is specified as a function of a few time-independent observables where their coefficients are time-dependent. The key mathematical step is the vectorization of the surprisal, the logarithm of the density matrix, at each time point of interest. The time span used depends on the required spectral resolution. The entire course of the system evolution is represented as a matrix where each column is the vectorized surprisal at the given time point. Using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of this matrix, we generate realistic approximations for the time-independent observables and their respective time-dependent coefficients. This allows for a simplification of the algebraic procedure for determining the dominant constraints (the time-independent observables) in the sense of the maximal entropy approach. A non-stationary coherent initial state of a Morse oscillator is used to introduce the approach. We derive the analytical exact expression for the surprisal as a function of time, and this offers a benchmark for comparison with the accurate but approximate SVD results. We discuss two examples of a Morse potential of different anharmonicities, H 2 and I 2 molecules. We further demonstrate the approach for a two-coupled electronic state problem, the well-studied non-radiative decay of pyrazine from its bright state. Five constraints are found to be enough to capture the ultrafast electronic population exchange and to recover the dynamics of the wave packet in both electronic states.},

Here, we propose to overcome the limitations of the explicit split-operator algorithm by abandoning its explicit nature. We describe a family of high-order implicit split-operator algorithms that are norm-conserving, time-reversible, and very efficient. The geometric properties of the integrators are proven analytically and demonstrated numerically on the local control of a two-dimensional model of retinal. Although they are only applicable to separable Hamiltonians, the implicit split-operator algorithms are, in this setting, more efficient than the recently proposed integrators based on the implicit midpoint method.},

This is achieved by rewriting the electronic density as a sum of a “warm” component complemented by “colder” correction(s). Since the warm component is larger in magnitude but faster to evaluate, we use many more stochastic orbitals for its evaluation than for the smaller-sized colder correction(s). This results in a significant reduction in the statistical fluctuations and systematic deviation compared to sDFT for the same computational effort. We demonstrate the method’s performance on large hydrogen-passivated silicon nanocrystals, finding a reduction in the systematic deviation in the energy by more than an order of magnitude, while the systematic deviation in the forces is also quenched. Similarly, the statistical fluctuations are reduced by factors of ≈4–5 for the total energy and ≈1.5–2 for the forces on the atoms. Since the embedding in t-sDFT is fully stochastic, it is possible to combine t-sDFT with other variants of sDFT such as energy-window sDFT and embedded-fragmented sDFT.},

The model is a message-passing graph neural network that uses symmetry-adapted atomic orbital features from a low-cost quantum calculation to predict the energy of a molecule. OrbNet Denali is trained on a vast dataset of 2.3 × 10 6 DFT calculations on molecules and geometries. This dataset covers the most common elements in biochemistry and organic chemistry (H, Li, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Br, and I) and charged molecules. OrbNet Denali is demonstrated on several well-established benchmark datasets, and we find that it provides accuracy that is on par with modern DFT methods while offering a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude. For the GMTKN55 benchmark set, OrbNet Denali achieves WTMAD-1 and WTMAD-2 scores of 7.19 and 9.84, on par with modern DFT functionals. For several GMTKN55 subsets, which contain chemical problems that are not present in the training set, OrbNet Denali produces a mean absolute error comparable to those of DFT methods. For the Hutchison conformer benchmark set, OrbNet Denali has a median correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.90 compared to the reference DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculation and R 2 = 0.97 compared to the method used to generate the training data ( ω B97X-D3/def2-TZVP), exceeding the performance of any other method with a similar cost. Similarly, the model reaches chemical accuracy for non-covalent interactions in the S66x10 dataset. For torsional profiles, OrbNet Denali reproduces the torsion profiles of ω B97X-D3/def2-TZVP with an average mean absolute error of 0.12 kcal/mol for the potential energy surfaces of the diverse fragments in the TorsionNet500 dataset.},

  abstract = {Quantum master equations provide a general framework for describing the dynamics of electronic observables within a complex molecular system. One particular family of such equations is based on treating the off-diagonal coupling terms between electronic states as a small perturbation within the framework of second-order perturbation theory. In this paper, we show how different choices of projection operators, as well as whether one starts out with the time-convolution or the time-convolutionless forms of the generalized quantum master equation, give rise to four different types of such off-diagonal quantum master equations (OD-QMEs), namely, time-convolution and time-convolutionless versions of a Pauli-type OD-QME for only the electronic populations and an OD-QME for the full electronic density matrix (including both electronic populations and coherences). The fact that those OD-QMEs are given in terms of the interaction picture makes it non-trivial to obtain Schrödinger picture electronic coherences from them. To address this, we also extend a procedure for extracting Schrödinger picture electronic coherences from interaction picture populations recently introduced by Trushechkin in the context of time-convolutionless Pauli-type OD-QME to the other three types of OD-QMEs. The performance of the aforementioned four types of OD-QMEs is explored in the context of the Garg–Onuchic–Ambegaokar benchmark model for charge transfer in the condensed phase across a relatively wide parameter range. The results show that time-convolution OD-QMEs can be significantly more accurate than their time-convolutionless counterparts, particularly in the case of Pauli-type OD-QMEs, and that rather accurate Schrödinger picture coherences can be obtained from interaction picture electronic inputs.},

  abstract = {Glassy solids exhibit a wide variety of generic thermomechanical properties, ranging from universal anomalous specific heat at cryogenic temperatures to nonlinear plastic yielding and failure under external driving forces, which qualitatively differ from their crystalline counterparts. For a long time, it has been believed that many of these properties are intimately related to nonphononic, low-energy quasilocalized excitations (QLEs) in glasses. Indeed, recent computer simulations have conclusively revealed that the self-organization of glasses during vitrification upon cooling from a melt leads to the emergence of such QLEs. In this Perspective, we review developments over the past three decades toward understanding the emergence of QLEs in structural glasses and the degree of universality in their statistical and structural properties. We discuss the challenges and difficulties that hindered progress in achieving these goals and review the frameworks put forward to overcome them. We conclude with an outlook on future research directions and open questions.},

  abstract = {Amide I spectroscopy probes the backbone C=O stretch vibrations of peptides and proteins. Amide I spectra are often collected in deuterated water (D 2 O) since this provides a cleaner background in the amide I frequency range; such data are often referred to as amide I′ spectra since deuteration induces changes in the mode structure, including a roughly ∼10 cm −1 redshift. For biological samples, however, deuteration is often not possible. As amide I frequency maps are increasingly applied to quantitative protein structural analysis, this raises the interesting challenge of drawing direct connections between amide I and amide I′ data. We here analyze amide I and amide I′ peak frequencies for a series of dipeptides and related compounds. Changes in protonation state induce large electrostatic shifts in the peak frequencies, allowing us to amass a sizable library of data points for direct amide I/amide I′ comparison. While we find an excellent linear correlation between amide I and amide I′ peak frequencies, the deuteration-induced shift is smaller for more red-shifted vibrations, indicating different electrostatic tuning rates in the two solvents. H 2 O/D 2 O shifts were negligible for proline-containing dipeptides that lack exchangeable amide hydrogens, indicating that the intrinsic properties of the solvent do not strongly influence the H/D shift. These findings indicate that the distinct tuning rates observed for the two vibrations arise from modifications to the intrinsic properties of the amide bond and provide (at least for solvated dipeptides) a simple, linear “map” for translating between amide I and amide I′ frequencies.},

  abstract = {Mesoscopic clusters composed of oppositely charged particles are ubiquitous in synthetic and biological soft materials. The effective interaction between these clusters is influenced by their polarizability, that is, the ability of their constituent charges to re-arrange in response to an external electrical field. Here, using coarse-grained simulations, we show that the polarizability of electrically neutral ionic clusters decreases as the number of constituent charges increases and/or their Coulombic interaction strength increases for various ion valencies, ion densities, and degrees of cluster boundary hardness. For clusters of random ionomers and their counterions, their polarizability is shown to depend on the number of polymer chains. The variation of the cluster polarizability with the cluster size indicates that throughout the assembly, the induced-dipole interactions between the clusters may be reduced substantially as they acquire more charges while maintaining zero net charge. Under certain conditions, the induced-dipole interactions may become repulsive, as inferred from our simulations with a polarizable solvent. As a result, the dipole-induced related interactions can serve as a counterbalancing force that contributes to the self-limiting aggregation of charge-containing assemblies.},

Many applications, however, still rely on static interfacial water models, e.g., for the computation of (electro)chemical reaction barriers and focus on a single, prototypical structure. In this work, we systematically study the relation between density functional theory-derived static and dynamic interfacial water models with specific focus on the water–Pt(111) interface. We first introduce a general construction protocol for static 2D water layers on any substrate, which we apply to the low index surfaces of Pt. Subsequently, we compare these with structures from a broad selection of reference works based on the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptor. The analysis reveals some structural overlap between static and dynamic water ensembles; however, static structures tend to overemphasize the in-plane hydrogen bonding network. This feature is especially pronounced for the widely used low-temperature hexagonal ice-like structure. In addition, a complex relation between structure, work function, and adsorption energy is observed, which suggests that the concentration on single, static water models might introduce systematic biases that are likely reduced by averaging over consistently created structural ensembles, as introduced here.},

A Lorentz oscillator model is used to explicitly describe the time dependence of plasmon-enhanced optical fields. These temporal characteristics are required for a density matrix based description of all plasmon-enhanced nonlinear molecular spectroscopies. Dispersive vibrational line shapes in PE-SRG/L and PE-FSRS spectra are shown to result primarily from terms proportional to the square of the complex optical field enhancement factor. The dependence on the plasmon resonance, picosecond and femtosecond pulse characteristics, and molecular vibrational properties are evident in the density matrix derived PE-FSRS intensity expression. The difference in signal detection mechanisms accounts for the lack of dispersive line shapes in PE spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. This density matrix treatment of PE-FSRS line shapes is compared with prior coupled wave results.},

  abstract = {The structure of a concentrated solution of NaCl in D 2 O was investigated by in situ high-pressure neutron diffraction with chlorine isotope substitution to give site-specific information on the coordination environment of the chloride ion. A broad range of densities was explored by first increasing the temperature from 323 to 423 K at 0.1 kbar and then increasing the pressure from 0.1 to 33.8 kbar at 423 K, thus mapping a cyclic variation in the static dielectric constant of the pure solvent. The experimental work was complemented by molecular dynamics simulations using the TIP4P/2005 model for water, which were validated against the measured equation of state and diffraction results. Pressure-induced anion ordering is observed, which is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the Cl–O and O–O coordination numbers. With the aid of bond-distance resolved bond-angle maps, it is found that the increased coordination numbers do not originate from a sizable alteration to the number of either Cl⋯D–O or O⋯D–O hydrogen bonds but from the appearance of non-hydrogen-bonded configurations. Increased pressure leads to a marked decrease in the self-diffusion coefficients but has only a moderate effect on the ion–water residence times. Contact ion pairs are observed under all conditions, mostly in the form of charge-neutral NaCl 0 units, and coexist with solvent-separated Na + –Na + and Cl − –Cl − ion pairs. The exchange of water molecules with Na + adopts a concerted mechanism under ambient conditions but becomes non-concerted as the state conditions are changed. Our findings are important for understanding the role of extreme conditions in geochemical processes.},

  abstract = {Atomic transport properties of liquid iron are important for understanding the core dynamics and magnetic field generation of terrestrial planets. Depending on the sizes of planets and their thermal histories, planetary cores may be subject to quite different pressures ( P ) and temperatures ( T ). However, previous studies on the topic mainly focus on the P – T range associated with the Earth’s outer core; a systematic study covering conditions from small planets to massive exoplanets is lacking. Here, we calculate the self-diffusion coefficient D and viscosity η of liquid iron via ab initio molecular dynamics from 7.0 to 25 g/cm 3 and 1800 to 25 000 K. We find that D and η are intimately related and can be fitted together using a generalized free volume model. The resulting expressions are simpler than those from previous studies where D and η were treated separately. Moreover, the new expressions are in accordance with the quasi-universal atomic excess entropy ( S ex ) scaling law for strongly coupled liquids, with normalized diffusivity D ⋆ = 0.621 exp(0.842 S ex ) and viscosity η ⋆ = 0.171 exp(−0.843 S ex ). We determine D and η along two thermal profiles of great geophysical importance: the iron melting curve and the isentropic line anchored at the ambient melting point. The variations of D and η along these thermal profiles can be explained by the atomic excess entropy scaling law, demonstrating the dynamic invariance of the system under uniform time and space rescaling. Accordingly, scale invariance may serve as an underlying mechanism to unify planetary dynamos of different sizes.},

Knowledge about the structures and properties of Al–Ce alloys at the liquid state is vital for optimizing the manufacture process to produce desired alloys. However, reliable molecular dynamics simulation of Al–Ce alloy systems remains a great challenge due to the lack of accurate Al–Ce interatomic potential. Here, an artificial neural network (ANN) deep machine learning (ML) method is used to develop a reliable interatomic potential for Al–Ce alloys. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation data on the Al–Ce liquid with a small unit cell (∼200 atoms) and on the known Al–Ce crystalline compounds are collected to train the interatomic potential using ANN-ML. The obtained ANN-ML model reproduces well the energies, forces, and atomic structure of the Al 90 Ce 10 liquid and crystalline phases of Al–Ce compounds in comparison with the ab initio results. The developed ANN-ML potential is applied in molecular dynamics simulations to study the structures and properties of the metallic Al 90 Ce 10 liquid, which would provide useful insight into the guiding experimental process to produce desired Al–Ce alloys.},

  abstract = {We study the kinetics of crystallization in deeply supercooled liquid silicon employing computer simulations and the Stillinger–Weber three-body potential. The free energy barriers to crystallization are computed using umbrella sampling Monte Carlo simulations and from unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations using a mean first passage time formulation. We focus on state points that have been described in earlier work [S. Sastry and C. A. Angell, Nat. Mater. 2 , 739 (2003)] as straddling a liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) between two metastable liquid states. It was argued subsequently [Ricci et al. , Mol. Phys. 117 , 3254 (2019)] that the apparent transition is due to the loss of metastability of the liquid state with respect to the crystalline state. The presence of a barrier to crystallization for these state points is therefore of importance to ascertain, which we investigate, with due attention to ambiguities that may arise from the choice of order parameters. We find a well-defined free energy barrier to crystallization and demonstrate that both umbrella sampling and mean first passage time methods yield results that agree quantitatively. Our results thus provide strong evidence against the possibility that the liquids at state points close to the reported LLPT exhibit slow, spontaneous crystallization, but they do not address the existence of a LLPT (or lack thereof). We also compute the free energy barriers to crystallization at other state points over a broad range of temperatures and pressures and discuss the effect of changes in the microscopic structure of the metastable liquid on the free energy barrier heights.},

  abstract = {We examine and compare the local stress autocorrelation in the inherent states of a fragile and a strong glass: the Kob–Andersen (KA) binary mixture and the Beest–Kramer–Santen model of silica. For both systems, local (domain-averaged) stress fluctuations asymptotically reach the normal inverse-volume decay in the large domain limit; accordingly, the real-space stress autocorrelation presents long-range power law tails. However, in the case of silica, local stress fluctuations display a high degree of hyperuniformity, i.e., their asymptotic (normal) decay is disproportionately smaller than their bond level amplitude. This property causes the asymptotic power law tails of the real-space stress autocorrelation to be swamped, up to very large distances (several nanometers), by an intermediate oscillatory-exponential decay regime. Similar contributions exist in the KA stress autocorrelation, but they never can be considered as dominating the power law decay and fully disappear when stress is coarse-grained beyond one interatomic distance. Our observations document that the relevance of power-law stress correlation may constitute a key discriminating feature between strong and fragile glasses. Meanwhile, they highlight that the notion of local stress in atomistic systems involves by necessity a choice of observation (coarse-graining) scale, the relevant value of which depends, in principle, on both the model and the phenomenon studied.},

By combining the beam chopper and pulsed laser ionization detection, the time-of-flight of the hydrogen beam was measured, and the dependence of the beam profile on the velocity was acquired, which was consistent with the beam trajectory simulations. The spin polarization of the beam was analyzed by using the Stern–Gerlach-type magnet in combination with the spatial scan of the detection laser. The spin polarization was about 95\% at a focusing condition due to the hexapole magnet. The polarization was, on the other hand, reduced to about 70\% for the beam at higher velocities, which is consistent with simulation results.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly, the process by which interacting components form well-defined and often intricate structures, is typically thought of as a spontaneous process arising from equilibrium dynamics. When a system is driven by external nonequilibrium forces, states statistically inaccessible to the equilibrium dynamics can arise, a process sometimes termed direct self-assembly. However, if we fix a given target state and a set of external control variables, it is not well-understood (i) how to design a protocol to drive the system toward the desired state nor (ii) the cost of persistently perturbing the stationary distribution. In this work, we derive a bound that relates the proximity to the chosen target with the dissipation associated with the external drive, showing that high-dimensional external control can guide systems toward target distribution but with an inevitable cost. Remarkably, the bound holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Second, we investigate the performance of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and provide evidence for the realizability of complex protocols that stabilize otherwise inaccessible states of matter.},

  abstract = {The study of alloys using computational methods has been a difficult task due to the usually unknown stoichiometry and local atomic ordering of the different structures experimentally. In order to combat this, first-principles methods have been coupled with statistical methods such as the cluster expansion formalism in order to construct the energy hull diagram, which helps to determine if an alloyed structure can exist in nature. Traditionally, density functional theory (DFT) has been used in such workflows. In this paper, we propose to use chemically accurate many-body variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods to construct the energy hull diagram of an alloy system due to the fact that such methods have a weaker dependence on the starting wavefunction and density functional, scale similarly to DFT with the number of electrons, and have had demonstrated success for a variety of materials. To carry out these simulations in a high-throughput manner, we propose a method called Jastrow sharing , which involves recycling the optimized Jastrow parameters between alloys with different stoichiometries. We show that this eliminates the need for extra VMC Jastrow optimization calculations and results in significant computational cost savings (on average 1/4 savings of total computational time). Since it is a novel post-transition metal chalcogenide alloy series that has been synthesized in its few-layer form, we used monolayer GaS x Se 1− x as a case study for our workflow. By extensively testing our Jastrow sharing procedure for monolayer GaS x Se 1− x and quantifying the cost savings, we demonstrate how a pathway toward chemically accurate high-throughput simulations of alloys can be achieved using many-body VMC and DMC methods.},

  abstract = {The osmotic pressure of dilute electrolyte solutions containing charged macro-ions as well as counterions can be computed directly from the particle distribution via the well-known cell model . Originally derived within the Poisson–Boltzmann mean-field approximation, the cell model considers a single macro-ion centered into a cell, together with counterions needed to neutralize the total cell charge, while it neglects the phenomena due to macro-ion correlations. While extensively applied in coarse-grained Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of continuum solvent systems, the cell model, in its original formulation, neglects the macro-ion shape anisotropy and details of the surface charge distribution. In this paper, by comparing one-body and two-body coarse-grained MC simulations, we first establish an upper limit for the assumption of neglecting correlations between macro-ions, and second, we validate the approximation of using a non-spherical macro-ion. Next, we extend the cell model to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and show that protein concentration-dependent osmotic pressures can be obtained by confining counterions in a virtual , spherical subspace defining the protein number density. Finally, we show the possibility of using specific interaction parameters for the protein–ion and ion–ion interactions, enabling studies of protein concentration-dependent ion-specific effects using merely a single protein molecule.},

The importance of accounting for the rotational contribution is to be emphasized since it has not previously been considered in GOS calculations. Although largely neglected due to its small effect on various properties, the rotational resolution proved to be fundamental in the study of certain phenomena, such as the interference between rotational states in a molecule. As the general goal of this work is to obtain theoretical values comparable to high resolution experiments, special care was taken on the calculation of the electronic part of the scattering amplitude, particularly in what concerns the choice of the atomic basis set. Accordingly, even-tempered basis sets have proved to lead to good results. The helium atom was taken as a model system for this aspect of the problem. Then, GOS and DCS, for explicit vibrational and rotational transitions, were calculated for hydrogen and nitrogen molecules. For higher accuracy, a non-Franck–Condon approach was used to obtain transitions involving vibrational states. The resultant values have shown good agreement with the available experimental data.},

  abstract = {Conformational sampling of biomolecules using molecular dynamics simulations often produces a large amount of high dimensional data that makes it difficult to interpret using conventional analysis techniques. Dimensionality reduction methods are thus required to extract useful and relevant information. Here, we devise a machine learning method, Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (GMVAE), that can simultaneously perform dimensionality reduction and clustering of biomolecular conformations in an unsupervised way. We show that GMVAE can learn a reduced representation of the free energy landscape of protein folding with highly separated clusters that correspond to the metastable states during folding. Since GMVAE uses a mixture of Gaussians as its prior, it can directly acknowledge the multi-basin nature of the protein folding free energy landscape. To make the model end-to-end differentiable, we use a Gumbel-softmax distribution. We test the model on three long-timescale protein folding trajectories and show that GMVAE embedding resembles the folding funnel with folded states down the funnel and unfolded states outside the funnel path. Additionally, we show that the latent space of GMVAE can be used for kinetic analysis and Markov state models built on this embedding produce folding and unfolding timescales that are in close agreement with other rigorous dynamical embeddings such as time independent component analysis.},

It was found that the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) have a significant impact on the structure of hydrogen bonds in close contact, not only in the ambient condition but also in the sub- and supercritical conditions. The NQEs on the structure beyond the hydrogen bond contact are important in ambient water, but not much for water in the sub- and supercritical conditions. The NQEs are furthermore important for determining the number of hydrogen bonds in the ambient conditions, and this role is, however, diminished in the sub- and supercritical conditions. The NQEs do, nevertheless, show their importance in determining the intramolecular structure of water and the close contact structures of the hydrogen bonds, even at sub- and supercritical conditions. Using the RPBE-D3 functional, the computed radial distribution functions for ambient water are in excellent agreement with experimental data, upgrading our previous results using the BLYP-D2 functional [Machida et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 102324 (2018)]. The computed radial distribution functions for water in the sub- and supercritical conditions were carefully compared with experiment.

  abstract = {The Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) model plays an important role in simulating nanopore systems. In nanopore simulations, the large-size nanopore system and convection-domination Nernst–Planck (NP) equations will bring convergence difficulties and numerical instability problems. Therefore, we propose an improved finite element method (FEM) with an inverse averaging technique to solve the three-dimensional PNP model, named inverse averaging FEM (IAFEM). At first, the Slotboom variables are introduced aiming at transforming non-symmetric NP equations into self-adjoint second-order elliptic equations with exponentially behaved coefficients. Then, these exponential coefficients are approximated with their harmonic averages, which are calculated with an inverse averaging technique on every edge of each tetrahedral element in the grid. Our scheme shows good convergence when simulating single or porous nanopore systems. In addition, it is still stable when the NP equations are convection domination. Our method can also guarantee the conservation of computed currents well, which is the advantage that many stabilization schemes do not possess. Our numerical experiments on benchmark problems verify the accuracy and robustness of our scheme. The numerical results also show that the method performs better than the standard FEM when dealing with convection-domination problems. A successful simulation combined with realistic chemical experiments is also presented to illustrate that the IAFEM is still effective for three-dimensional interconnected nanopore systems.},

While this behavior always holds for finite systems, it does not hold for mesoscopic ones, such as quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) electron gas or Q2D crystals.

It provides, within a simple model, a unified framework that includes the deep (nuclear) tunneling limit of electron transfer and the associated heat transfer when the donor and acceptor sites are seated in environments characterized by different local temperatures. The electron transfer induced heat conduction is shown to go through a maximum at some intermediate average temperature where quantum effects are already appreciable, and it approaches zero when the average temperature is very high (the classical limit) or very low (deep tunneling).},

Our simulation results witness distinct escape mechanisms depending on the relative amplitudes of the thermal length and self-propulsion length compared to the cavity and pore sizes. For exceedingly large self-propulsion lengths, overdamped active particles diffuse on the cavity surface, and rotational dynamics solely governs the exit process. On the other hand, the escape kinetics of a very weakly damped active particle is largely dictated by bouncing effects on the cavity walls irrespective of the amplitude of self-propulsion persistence lengths. We show that the exit rate can be maximized for an optimal self-propulsion persistence length, which depends on the damping strength, self-propulsion velocity, and cavity size. However, the optimal persistence length is insensitive to the opening windows’ size, number, and arrangement. Numerical results have been interpreted analytically based on qualitative arguments. The present analysis aims at understanding the transport controlling mechanism of active matter in confined structures.},

In contrast to most previous studies, we account for the full quantum dynamics of the combined excitonic and vibrational system. For our simulations, we choose a numerically unbiased representation of the molecule’s wave function, enabling us to compare with experiments, exhibiting good agreement. Having access to the full wave function allows us to study in detail the post-quench dynamics of the excitons. Here, one of our main findings is the identification of a time scale t 0 ≈ 35 fs dominated by coherent dynamics. It is within this time scale that the larger fraction of the singlet fission yield is generated. We also report on a reduced number of phononic modes that play a crucial role in the energy transfer between excitonic and vibrational systems. Notably, the oscillation frequency of these modes coincides with the observed electronic coherence time t 0 . We extend our investigations by also studying the dependency of the dynamics on the excitonic energy levels that, for instance, can be experimentally tuned by means of the solvent polarity. Here, our findings indicate that the singlet fission yield can be doubled, while the electronic coherence time t 0 is mainly unaffected.},

  abstract = {The interaction of divalent copper ions (Cu 2+ ) with cell membranes is crucial for a variety of physiological processes of cells, such as hormone synthesis and cellular energy production. These interactions would not be possible without membrane hydration. However, the role of water has not received a lot of attention in membrane studies. Here, we use high-throughput wide-field second harmonic (SH) microscopy to study the interaction between Cu 2+ and hydrated freestanding Montal–Müller lipid membranes. The symmetric lipid membranes are composed of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and either 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate or 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho L-serine and are brought into contact with divalent Cu 2+ , which are added to one leaflet while maintaining the ionic strength balance. We observe transient domains of high SH intensity. In these areas, Cu 2+ ions bind to the charged head groups, leading to charge neutralization on one side of the membrane. This exposes the ordered water at the non-interacting side of the membrane interface, which can be used to compute the interfacial membrane potential difference. We find that the domains of lipids with phosphatidic acid head groups display a higher interfacial membrane potential than those with phosphatidylserine head groups, which converts into higher dynamic electrostatic free energies and binding constants.},

  abstract = {Carbon–carbon supercapacitors are high power electrochemical energy storage systems, which store energy through reversible ion adsorption at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Due to the complex structure of the porous carbons used as electrodes, extracting structure–property relationships in these systems remains a challenge. In this work, we conduct molecular simulations of two model supercapacitors based on nanoporous electrodes with the same average pore size, a property often used when comparing porous materials, but different morphologies. We show that the carbon with the more ordered structure, and a well defined pore size, has a much higher capacitance than the carbon with the more disordered structure and a broader pore size distribution. We analyze the structure of the confined electrolyte and show that the ions adsorbed in the ordered carbon are present in larger quantities and are also more confined than for the disordered carbon. Both aspects favor a better charge separation and thus a larger capacitance. In addition, the disordered electrodes contain a significant amount of carbon atoms, which are never in contact with the electrolyte, carry a close to zero charge, and are thus not involved in the charge storage. The total quantities of adsorbed ions and degrees of confinement do not change much with the applied potential, and as such, this work opens the door to computationally tractable screening strategies.},

This work elucidates the conditions for this breakdown. We show that the breakdown within the pore results from the response of the electric field within the dielectric. Namely, we show that this response is highly sensitive to the boundary condition at the dielectric edge. The standard Neumann boundary condition of no-flux predicts that the breakdown does not occur. However, a Dirichlet boundary condition for a zero-potential predicts a breakdown. Within this latter scenario, the breakdown exhibits a dependence on the thickness of the dielectric material. Specifically, infinite thickness dielectrics do not exhibit a breakdown, while dielectrics of finite thickness do exhibit a breakdown. Numerical simulations confirm theoretical predictions. The breakdown outcomes are discussed with regard to single pore systems and multiple pore systems.},

Density functional theory calculations in bulk 1-propanol identified both linear and ring-like associations composed of up to five repeat units. The simulation results revealed that the ring structures, with a low dipole moment (∼2 D), are energetically preferred over the linear assemblies with a dipole moment of 2.18 D per repeat unit. Under confinement in nanoporous alumina (in templates with pore diameters ranging from 400 to 20 nm), all dynamic processes were found to speed up irrespective of the molecular architecture. The characteristic freezing temperatures of the α and the Debye-like processes followed the pore size dependence: T a , D = T a , D b u l k − A / d 1 / 2 ⁠ , where d is the pore diameter. The characteristic “freezing” temperatures for the Debye-like (the slow process for confined 1-propanol is non-Debye) and the α-processes decrease, respectively, by 6.5 and 13 K in confined 1-propanol, by 9.5 and 19 K in confined 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and by 9 and 23 K in confined 4-methyl-3-heptanol within the same 25 nm pores. In 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, confinement reduced the number of linearly associated repeats from approximately heptamers in the bulk to dimers within 25 pores. In addition, the slower process in bulk 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 4-methyl-3-heptanol, where the signal is dominated by ring-like supramolecular assemblies, is clearly non-Debye. The results suggest that the effect of confinement is dominant in the latter assemblies.},

They arise from the interplay between weak hydrogen bonds and nuclear quantum fluctuations, making theoretical calculations challenging. Here, we employ the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation to investigate how thermal and quantum fluctuations affect the physical properties of ice XI with ab initio accuracy. Regarding the anomalous VIE, our work reveals that quantum effects on hydrogen are so strong to be in a nonlinear regime: When progressively increasing the mass of hydrogen from protium to infinity (classical limit), the volume first expands and then contracts, with a maximum slightly above the mass of tritium. We observe an anharmonic renormalization of about 10\% in the bending and stretching phonon frequencies probed in IR and Raman experiments. For the first time, we report an accurate comparison of the low-energy phonon dispersion with the experimental data, possible only thanks to high-level accuracy in the electronic correlation and nuclear quantum and thermal fluctuations, paving the way for the study of thermal transport in ice from first-principles and the simulation of ice under pressure.},

  abstract = {We obtain activity coefficients in NaCl and KCl solutions from implicit-water molecular dynamics simulations, at 298.15 K and 1 bar, using two distinct approaches. In the first approach, we consider ions in a continuum with constant relative permittivity ( ɛ r ) equal to that of pure water; in the other approach, we take into account the concentration-dependence of ɛ r , as obtained from explicit-water simulations. Individual ion activity coefficients (IIACs) are calculated using gradual insertion of single ions with uniform neutralizing backgrounds to ensure electroneutrality. Mean ionic activity coefficients (MIACs) obtained from the corresponding IIACs in simulations with constant ɛ r show reasonable agreement with experimental data for both salts. Surprisingly, large systematic negative deviations are observed for both IIACs and MIACs in simulations with concentration-dependent ɛ r . Our results suggest that the absence of hydration structure in implicit-water simulations cannot be compensated by correcting for the concentration-dependence of the relative permittivity ɛ r . Moreover, even in simulations with constant ɛ r for which the calculated MIACs are reasonable, the relative positioning of IIACs of anions and cations is incorrect for NaCl. We conclude that there are severe inherent limitations associated with implicit-water simulations in providing accurate activities of aqueous electrolytes, a finding with direct relevance to the development of electrolyte theories and to the use and interpretation of implicit-solvent simulations.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present NENCI-2021, a benchmark database of ∼8000 Non-Equilibirum Non-Covalent Interaction energies for a large and diverse selection of intermolecular complexes of biological and chemical relevance. To meet the growing demand for large and high-quality quantum mechanical data in the chemical sciences, NENCI-2021 starts with the 101 molecular dimers in the widely used S66 and S101 databases and extends the scope of these works by (i) including 40 cation– π and anion– π complexes, a fundamentally important class of non-covalent interactions that are found throughout nature and pose a substantial challenge to theory, and (ii) systematically sampling all 141 intermolecular potential energy surfaces (PESs) by simultaneously varying the intermolecular distance and intermolecular angle in each dimer. Designed with an emphasis on close contacts, the complexes in NENCI-2021 were generated by sampling seven intermolecular distances along each PES (ranging from 0.7× to 1.1× the equilibrium separation) and nine intermolecular angles per distance (five for each ion– π complex), yielding an extensive database of 7763 benchmark intermolecular interaction energies ( E int ) obtained at the coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples/complete basis set [CCSD(T)/CBS] level of theory. The E int values in NENCI-2021 span a total of 225.3 kcal/mol, ranging from −38.5 to +186.8 kcal/mol, with a mean (median) E int value of −1.06 kcal/mol (−2.39 kcal/mol). In addition, a wide range of intermolecular atom-pair distances are also present in NENCI-2021, where close intermolecular contacts involving atoms that are located within the so-called van der Waals envelope are prevalent—these interactions, in particular, pose an enormous challenge for molecular modeling and are observed in many important chemical and biological systems. A detailed symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT)-based energy decomposition analysis also confirms the diverse and comprehensive nature of the intermolecular binding motifs present in NENCI-2021, which now includes a significant number of primarily induction-bound dimers (e.g., cation– π complexes). NENCI-2021 thus spans all regions of the SAPT ternary diagram, thereby warranting a new four-category classification scheme that includes complexes primarily bound by electrostatics (3499), induction (700), dispersion (1372), or mixtures thereof (2192). A critical error analysis performed on a representative set of intermolecular complexes in NENCI-2021 demonstrates that the E int values provided herein have an average error of ±0.1 kcal/mol, even for complexes with strongly repulsive E int values, and maximum errors of ±0.2–0.3 kcal/mol (i.e., ∼±1.0 kJ/mol) for the most challenging cases. For these reasons, we expect that NENCI-2021 will play an important role in the testing, training, and development of next-generation classical and polarizable force fields, density functional theory approximations, wavefunction theory methods, and machine learning based intra- and inter-molecular potentials.},

The experimental findings are supported by density functional theory calculations of the virtual orbital energies and energetics of the dissociative decays. Long-lived molecular negative ions F4-TCNQ − are detected in a wide electron energy range (0–3 eV) with electron detachment times in the range of milliseconds. Although plenty of decay channels are observed, their intensities are found to be very small (two to four orders of magnitude relative to the F4-TCNQ − signal). These findings prove that the structure of this strong electron-accepting molecule bearing an excess electron is robust in its electronic ground state, even when highly (up to 6 eV) vibrationally excited. As many as nine metastable fragment anions formed slowly (in the 16–23 µ s range) are found in the negative ion mass spectrum of F4-TCNQ, as never observed before in compounds possessing high electron-accepting ability.

  abstract = {We have developed a graphical processing unit (GPU) accelerated implementation of our recently introduced rank-reduced coupled-cluster singles and doubles (RR-CCSD) method. RR-CCSD introduces a low-rank approximation of the doubles amplitudes. This is combined with a low-rank approximation of the electron repulsion integrals via Cholesky decomposition. The result of these two low-rank approximations is the replacement of the usual fourth-order CCSD tensors with products of second- and third-order tensors. In our implementation, only a single fourth-order tensor must be constructed as an intermediate during the solution of the amplitude equations. Owing in large part to the compression of the doubles amplitudes, the GPU-accelerated implementation shows excellent parallel efficiency (95\% on eight GPUs). Our implementation can solve the RR-CCSD equations for up to 400 electrons and 1550 basis functions—roughly 50\% larger than the largest canonical CCSD computations that have been performed on any hardware. In addition to increased scalability, the RR-CCSD computations are faster than the corresponding CCSD computations for all but the smallest molecules. We test the accuracy of RR-CCSD for a variety of chemical systems including up to 1000 basis functions and determine that accuracy to better than 0.1\% error in the correlation energy can be achieved with roughly 95\% compression of the ov space for the largest systems considered. We also demonstrate that conformational energies can be predicted to be within 0.1 kcal mol −1 with efficient compression applied to the wavefunction. Finally, we find that low-rank approximations of the CCSD doubles amplitudes used in the similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian prior to a conventional equation-of-motion CCSD computation will not introduce significant errors (on the order of a few hundredths of an electronvolt) into the resulting excitation energies.},

  abstract = {Empirical, highly accurate non-relativistic electronic total atomization energies (eTAEs) are established by combining experimental or computationally converged treatments of the nuclear motion and relativistic contributions with the total atomization energies of HF, CO, N 2 , and H 2 O obtained from the Active Thermochemical Tables. These eTAEs, which have estimated (2 σ ) uncertainties of less than 10 cm −1 (0.12 kJ mol −1 ), form the basis for an analysis of high-level ab initio quantum chemical calculations that aim at reproducing these eTAEs for the title molecules. The results are then employed to analyze the performance of the high-accuracy extrapolated ab initio thermochemistry, or High-Accuracy Extrapolated Ab Initio Thermochemistry (HEAT), family of theoretical methods. The method known as HEAT-345(Q), in particular, is found to benefit from fortuitous error cancellation between its treatment of the zero-point energy, extrapolation errors in the Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster contributions, neglect of post-(T) core-correlation, and the basis-set error involved in higher-level correlation corrections. In addition to shedding light on a longstanding curiosity of the HEAT protocol—where the cheapest HEAT-345(Q) performs comparably to the theoretically more complete HEAT-456QP procedure—this study lays the foundation for extended HEAT variants that offer substantial improvements in accuracy relative to the established approaches.},

  abstract = {We consider the longitudinal quadrupole relaxation rate enhancement (QRE) of a 1 H nucleus due to the time fluctuations of the local dipolar magnetic field created by a close quadrupole 14 N nucleus, the electric-field gradient (EFG) Hamiltonian of which changes with time because of vibrations/distortions of its chemical environment. The QRE is analytically expressed as a linear combination of the cosine Fourier transforms of the three quantum time auto-correlation functions G AA (t) of the 14 N spin components along the principal axes A = X, Y, and Z of the mean (time-averaged) EFG Hamiltonian. Denoting the three transition frequencies between the energy levels of this mean Hamiltonian by ν A , the functions G AA (t) oscillate at frequencies ν A + s A /(2π) with mono-exponential decays of relaxation times τ A , where the frequency dynamic shifts s A and the relaxation times τ A are closed expressions of the magnitude of the fluctuations of the instantaneous EFG Hamiltonian about its mean and of the characteristic fluctuation time. Thus, the theoretical QRE is the sum of three Lorentzian peaks centered at ν A + s A /(2π) with full widths at half maxima 1/(πτ A ). The predicted peak widths are nearly equal. The predicted dynamic shifts of the peaks are much smaller than their widths and amazingly keep proportional to the transition frequencies ν A for reasonably fast EFG fluctuations. The theory is further improved by correcting the transition frequencies by the 14 N Zeeman effects of second order. It is successfully applied to reinterpret the QRE pattern measured by Broche, Ashcroft, and Lurie [Magn. Reson. Med. 68 , 358 (2012)] in normal cartilage.},

The Gaussians are orthogonalized to the gausslets, which are already orthonormal, and approximations are introduced to maintain the diagonal property of the two electron part of the Hamiltonian so that it continues to scale as the second power of the number of basis functions rather than the fourth. We introduce several corrections to the Hamiltonian designed to enforce certain exact properties, such as the values of certain two-electron integrals. We also introduce a simple universal energy correction that compensates for the incompleteness of the basis stemming from the electron–electron cusps based on the measured double occupancy of each basis function. We perform a number of Hartree Fock and full configuration interaction (full-CI) test calculations on two electron systems and Hartree Fock on a ten-atom hydrogen chain to benchmark these techniques. The inclusion of the cusp correction allows us to obtain complete basis set full-CI results for the two electron cases at the level of several micro-Hartrees, and we see similar apparent accuracy for Hartree Fock on the ten-atom hydrogen chain.},

However, the mechanisms of these processes remain not well understood, mostly because the existing theoretical descriptions are not fully accounting for the role of the surfaces. Here, we present a theoretical investigation on the dynamics of surface-assisted trapping by specific active sites. In our model, a diffusing particle can occasionally reversibly bind to the surface and diffuse on it before reaching the final target site. An approximate theoretical framework is developed, and its predictions are tested by Brownian dynamics computer simulations. It is found that the surface diffusion can be crucial in mediating trapping by active sites. Our theoretical predictions work reasonably well as long as the area of the active site is much smaller than the overall surface area. Potential applications of our approach are discussed.},

This revision, which is based on the introduction of time scaling along with flexibility of a discrete-time velocity attenuation parameter, provides a direct link between the ABO splitting formalism and the GJ methods. This link brings about the conclusion that any GJ method has at least weak second order accuracy in the applied time step. It further helps identify a novel half-step velocity, which simultaneously produces both correct kinetic statistics and correct transport measures for any of the statistically sound GJ methods. Explicit algorithmic expressions are given for the integration of the new half-step velocity into the GJ set of methods. Numerical simulations, including quantum-based molecular dynamics (QMD) using the QMD suite Los Alamos Transferable Tight-Binding for Energetics, highlight the discussed properties of the algorithms as well as exhibit the direct application of robust, time-step-independent stochastic integrators to QMD.},

From the relation between the macroscopic velocity distribution function and the microscopic molecular passage across a fixed control plane, we derived a method to calculate the basic properties of the macroscopic momentum conservation law including the density, the velocity, the momentum flux, and the two terms of the stress tensor, i.e., the interaction and the kinetic terms, defined on a surface with a finite area. Any component of the streaming velocity can be obtained on a control surface, which enables the separation of the kinetic momentum flux into the advection and stress terms in the framework of MoP, and this enables strict satisfaction of the mass and momentum conservation for an arbitrary closed control volume (CV) set in NEMD systems. We validated the present method through the extraction of the density, velocity, and stress distributions in a quasi-one-dimensional steady-state Couette flow system and in a quasi-2D steady-state NEMD system with a moving contact line. We showed that with the present MoP, in contrast to the volume average method, the conservation law was satisfied even for a CV set around the moving contact line, which was located in a strongly inhomogeneous region.},

Here, we study how softness in the particle interaction affects the emergent transport behavior. To this end, we investigate the driven Brownian motion of particles in a periodic potential. The particles interact via a repulsive softcore potential with a shape corresponding to a smoothed rectangular barrier. This shape allows us to elucidate effects of mutual particle penetration and particle crossing in a controlled manner. We find that even weak deviations from the hardcore case can have a strong impact on the particle current. Despite this fact, knowledge about the transport in a corresponding hardcore system is shown to be useful to describe and interpret our findings for the softcore case. This is achieved by assigning a thermodynamic effective size to the particles based on the equilibrium density functional of hard spheres.},

A detailed analysis has shown that unstable steady states result from four destabilizing feedback cycles, among which the cycle involving hydroquinone, an electron acceptor, and its semi-reduced form is the dominant one responsible for the existence of saddle-node and Andronov–Hopf bifurcations.

Obtaining precise measurements of their mechanical properties is highly dependent on accurate instrument calibration. Therefore, instrumental drift or inaccurate calibration may prevent reaching an accuracy at the theoretical limit and may lead to incorrect conclusions. Commonly encountered sources of error include inaccuracies in the detector sensitivity and trap stiffness and neglecting the non-harmonicity of an optical trap at higher forces. Here, we first quantify the impact of these artifacts on force-extension data and find that a small deviation of the calibration parameters can already have a significant downstream effect. We then develop a method to identify and remove said artifacts based on differences in the theoretical and measured noise of bead fluctuations. By applying our procedure to both simulated and experimental data, we can show how effects due to miscalibration and trap non-linearities can be successfully removed. Most importantly, this correction can be performed post-measurement and could be adapted for data acquired using any force spectroscopy technique.},

  abstract = {Although macromolecules such as polymers are in widespread industrial use, pure formulations rarely have precisely the properties new applications demand. Pure polymer is often too brittle and inflexible, necessitating plasticizers to soften or toughen films and bulk polymer materials. In practice, new formulations are developed by extensive trial-and-error methods, as no general molecular explanations exist for the mechanism of plasticization to aid in determining the optimal structure and concentration of plasticizers. Here, through atomistic molecular simulations augmented with advanced sampling techniques, we develop an atomic-level picture of the processes in plasticization by directly calculating free energies that govern the interaction between polymers and small-molecule plasticizers. This work focuses on the influence of two common plasticizer molecules—glycerol and sorbitol—interacting with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a frequently used component of polymer films. In particular, we focus on conformational and hydrogen bond structure changes induced in globules of PVA by the plasticizer molecules, with the hypothesis that hydrogen bonding plays a role in the incorporation of these plasticizers into PVA and, thus, in the observed mechanical properties. While we focus on nanoscopic systems, we observe distinct preferences in the conformational free energy that can be connected to the performance of polymer materials at laboratory and industrial scales. This work presents a new molecular perspective from which effective plasticizers can be developed and presents a firm basis from which important analyses of plasticization in complex chemical environments relevant to industry may be developed.},

Here, we introduce a machine learning (ML) approach in which the degrees of freedom of the microscopic species are integrated out and the mesoscopic particles interact with effective many-body potentials, which we fit as a function of all colloid coordinates with a set of symmetry functions. We apply this approach to a colloid–polymer mixture. Remarkably, the ML potentials can be assumed to be effectively state-independent and can be used in direct-coexistence simulations. We show that our ML method reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude compared to a numerical evaluation and accurately describes the phase behavior and structure, even for state points where the effective potential is largely determined by many-body contributions.},

  abstract = {We examine the mobility gradient in the interfacial region of substrate-supported polymer films using molecular dynamics simulations and interpret these gradients within the string model of glass-formation. No large gradients in the extent of collective motion exist in these simulated films, and an analysis of the mobility gradient on a layer-by-layer basis indicates that the string model provides a quantitative description of the relaxation time gradient. Consequently, the string model indicates that the interfacial mobility gradient derives mainly from a gradient in the high-temperature activation enthalpy Δ H 0 and entropy Δ S 0 as a function of depth z , an effect that exists even in the high-temperature Arrhenius relaxation regime far above the glass transition temperature. To gain insight into the interfacial mobility gradient, we examined various material properties suggested previously to influence Δ H 0 in condensed materials, including density, potential and cohesive energy density, and a local measure of stiffness or u 2 ( z ) −3/2 , where u 2 ( z ) is the average mean squared particle displacement at a caging time (on the order of a ps). We find that changes in local stiffness best correlate with changes in Δ H 0 ( z ) and that Δ S 0 ( z ) also contributes significantly to the interfacial mobility gradient, so it must not be neglected.},

  abstract = {We report a state-prepared, state-resolved study of rotational scattering of a diatomic molecule from a solid surface. Specifically, H 2 molecules with 80 meV kinetic energy are rotationally aligned in the j = 3 rotational state via stimulated Raman pumping and then scattered from a Si(100) surface at normal incidence. The rotational alignment of the scattered molecules is determined by measuring, for both the incident and scattered molecules, the ionization yield of a probe laser, tuned to selectively ionize molecules in the j = 3 rotation level, as the probe laser polarization is rotated. The measurement is performed for two initial rotational alignments: a “helicoptering” alignment with the bonds constrained to lie primarily parallel to the surface and a “cartwheeling” alignment with the bonds lying primarily normal to the surface. For both initial alignments, the modulation of the probe ionization yield with laser polarization for the scattered molecules is pronounced, although significantly weaker than the modulation measured for the incident molecules. This indicates a significant modification but not a complete elimination of the initial alignment. The modulation is found to be stronger for the scattered molecules originating in the cartwheeling alignment than for the helicoptering alignment. These results contribute toward an improved understanding of the role of rotational motion in molecule–surface dynamics.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) are defects originating in multi-crystalline silicon during crystal growth for device Si solar cell fabrication. The presence of GBs changes the coordination of Si, making it advantageous for charge carriers to recombine, which brings a significant reduction of carrier lifetimes. Therefore, GBs can be highly detrimental for device performances. Furthermore, GBs easily form vacancies with deep defect electronic states and are also preferential segregation sites for various impurity species, such as C, N, and O. We studied from first principles the correlation between structural, energetics, and electronic properties of the Σ3{111} Si GB with and without vacancies, and the segregation of C, N, and O atoms. C and O atoms strongly increase their ability to segregate when vacancies are present. However, the electronic properties of the Σ3{111} Si GB are not affected by the presence of O, while they can strongly change in the case of C. For N atoms, it is not possible to find a clear trend in the energetics and electronic properties both with and without vacancies in the GB. In fact, as N is not isovalent with Si, as C and O, it is more flexible in finding new chemical arrangements in the GB structure. This implies a stronger difficulty in controlling the properties of the material in the presence of N impurity atoms compared to C and O impurities.},

  abstract = {Graphene is an ideal material for biosensors due to the large surface area for multiple bonding sites, the high electrical conductivity allowing for high sensitivity, and the high tensile strength providing durability in fabricated sensor devices. For graphene to be successful as a biosensing platform, selectivity must be achieved through functionalization with specific chemical groups. However, the device performance and sensor sensitivity must still be maintained after functionalization, which can be challenging. We compare phenyl amine and 1,5-diaminonaphthalene functionalization methods for chemical vapor deposition grown graphene, both used to obtain graphene modified with amine groups—which is required for surface attachment of highly selective antibody bio-receptors. Through atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging of co-located areas, the chemistry, thickness, and coverage of the functional groups bound to the graphene surface have been comprehensively analyzed. We demonstrate the modification of functionalized graphene using AFM, which unexpectedly suggests the removal of covalently bonded functional groups, resulting in a “recovered” graphene structure with reduced disorder, confirmed with Raman spectroscopy. This removal explains the decrease in the I D / I G ratio observed in Raman spectra from other studies on functionalized graphene after mechanical strain or a chemical reaction and reveals the possibility of reverting to the non-functionalized graphene structure. Through this study, preferred functionalization processes are recommended to maintain the performance properties of graphene as a biosensor.},

Surface structures are optimized with density functional theory using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional augmented with the many-body dispersion scheme of Tkatchenko (PBE+MBD). Whereas the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) predicts a clear preference of about 5 kJ mol −1 for the hcp tripod compared to the top monopod structure, in agreement with vibrational spectra, PBE+MBD predicts about equal stability for the two adsorption structures. For the hcp tripod, RPA yields an adsorption energy of −14.5 kJ mol −1 , which is converged to within 1.0 ± 0.5 kJ mol −1 with respect to the plane wave energy cutoff (500 eV), the k -point mesh (4 × 4 × 1), the vacuum layer (about 10.3 Å, with extrapolation to infinite distance), and the number of Pt layers (3).

  abstract = {Nanofluids—dispersions of nanometer-sized particles in a liquid medium—have been proposed for a wide variety of thermal management applications. It is known that a solid-like nanolayer of liquid of typical thicknesses of 0.5–1 nm surrounding the colloidal nanoparticles can act as a thermal bridge between the nanoparticle and the bulk liquid. Yet, its effect on the nanofluid viscosity has not been elucidated so far. In this article, we compute the local viscosity of the nanolayer using equilibrium molecular dynamics based on the Green–Kubo formula. We first assess the validity of the method to predict the viscosity locally. We apply this methodology to the calculation of the local viscosity in the immediate vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle for a wide range of solid–liquid interaction strength, where a nanolayer of thickness 1 nm is observed as a result of the interaction with the nanoparticle. The viscosity of the nanolayer, which is found to be higher than its corresponding bulk value, is directly dependent on the solid–liquid interaction strength. We discuss the origin of this viscosity enhancement and show that the liquid density increment alone cannot explain the values of the viscosity observed. Rather, we suggest that the solid-like structure of the distribution of the liquid atoms in the vicinity of the nanoparticle contributes to the nanolayer viscosity enhancement. Finally, we observe a failure of the Stokes–Einstein relation between viscosity and diffusion close to the wall, depending on the liquid–solid interaction strength, which we rationalize in terms of the hydrodynamic slip.},

The binary mixture of solvents is a common situation in experiments, but theoretical studies are limited to the use of continuum models. Here, we use explicit solvent molecules, and specific solute–solvent interaction is analyzed and seen to play an important role. Effects of the electronic polarization of solute by the environment were included using a reliable iterative scheme. The results illustrate that the monomers, dimers, and tetramers are preferably solvated by methanol, but the composition of the mixture in the vicinity of the solute molecules is different from the bulk composition with a preferential microsolvation (hydrogen bonds) in water for most species considered. It is observed that the short-range electrostatic polarization effects of the hydrogen bonds lead to a slight blue shift of the excitation energies when the concentration of water in the mixture is enhanced. For the same species, there is an enhancement of the higher-energy absorption intensity caused by long-range electrostatic interactions with the environment and that the behavior of the experimental spectrum, which is characterized by a nearly monotonic decay from the ultraviolet to the infrared, is qualitatively reproduced by the superposition of the absorption spectra of monomers, dimers, and tetramers in the liquid phase.},

  abstract = {Thermodiffusion (or thermophoresis) is the phenomenon by which the spatial distributions of constituents of liquid or gas phases become inhomogeneous in response to a temperature gradient. It has been evidenced in a variety of systems and has many practical applications as well as implications in the context of the origins of life. A complete molecular picture of thermophoresis is still missing, and phenomenological approaches are often employed to account for the experimental observations. In particular, the amplitude of the resulting concentration-gradients (quantified by the Soret coefficient) depends on many factors that are not straightforwardly rationalized. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations appear as an exquisite tool to shed light on the molecular origins for this phenomenon in molecular systems, but the practical implementation of thermophoretic settings in silico poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a robust approach to tackle thermophoresis in dilute realistic solutions at the molecular level. We rely on a recent enhanced heat-exchange algorithm to generate temperature-gradients. We carefully assess the convergence of thermophoretic simulations in dilute aqueous solutions. We show that simulations typically need to be propagated on long timescales (hundreds of nanoseconds). We find that the magnitude of the temperature gradient and the box sizes have little effect on the measured Soret coefficients. Practical guidelines are derived from such observations. Provided with this reliable setup, we discuss the results of thermophoretic simulations on several examples of molecular, neutral solutes, which we find in very good agreement with experimental measurements regarding the concentration-, mass-, and temperature-dependence of the Soret coefficient.},

In its supercooled liquid regime, the applied techniques yield good agreement regarding the characteristic structural (alpha) relaxation times of this material. In addition, the generalized Gemant–DiMarzio–Bishop model provides a good conversion between the frequency-dependent dielectric and shear mechanical responses in its viscous state, allowing for an assessment of imidacloprid’s molecular hydrodynamic radius. In order to characterize the molecular dynamics in its glassy regime, we employ several approaches. These include the application of frequency–temperature superposition (FTS) to its isostructural dielectric and rheological responses as well as use of dielectric and calorimetric physical aging and the Adam–Gibbs–Vogel model. While the latter approach and dielectric FTS provide relaxation times that are close to each other, the other methods predict notably longer times that are closer to those reflecting a complete recovery of ergodicity. This seemingly conflicting dissimilarity demonstrates that the molecular dynamics of glassy imidacloprid strongly depends on its thermal history, with high relevance for the use of this insecticide as an active ingredient in technological applications.},

The spectra were analyzed by considering the feasible tunneling motions, and transitions were fitted to independent asymmetric rotors for each tunneling state. The rotational constants of the four tunneling components of N 2 –D 2 O were retrieved for the excited vibrational states. A two order of magnitude increase in the tunneling splittings is observed for the asymmetric O–D stretch ( ν 3 in D 2 O) excitation compared to the symmetric stretch ( ν 1 in D 2 O) and to the ground vibrational state.

  abstract = {Perovskites attract attention as efficient light absorbers for solar cells due to their high-power conversion efficiency (up to 24\%). The high photoelectric conversion efficiency is greatly affected by a suitable band structure. Cation substitution can be an effective approach to tune the electronic band structure of lead halide perovskites. In this work, superalkali cations were introduced to replace the Cs + cation in the CsPbBr 3 material. The bimetallic superalkalis (LiMg, NaMg, LiCa, and NaCa) were inserted since they are structurally simple systems and have a strong tendency to lose one electron to achieve a closed-shell cation. The cation substitution in the lead halide perovskite leads to changes in the shape of both valence and conduction bands compared to CsPbBr 3 . Introducing superalkali cations produces extra electronic states close to the Fermi level, which arise from the formation of alkali earth metal states at the top of the valence band. Our first-principles computations reveal that bimetallic superalkali substitution decreases the bandgap of the perovskite. The bandgaps of MgLi–PbBr 3 (1.35 eV) and MgNa–PbBr 3 (1.06 eV) are lower than the bandgap of CsPbBr 3 (2.48 eV) and within the optimal bandgap (i.e., 1.1–1.4 eV) for single-junction solar cells. Thus, the MgLi–PbBr 3 and MgNa–PbBr 3 inorganic perovskites are promising candidates for high-efficiency solar cells.},

A linear structure for these tagged complexes was predicted. The Rg binding energies for Rg–HCO + are also examined at the CCSD(T) level. It was found that the binding interaction increases from He–HCO + to Xe–HCO + . A multilevel potential energy surface built at the CCSD(T) and second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation levels of theory were used to study these species’ vibrational spectra. By changing the Rg in the first-solvation shell for HCO + , the Fermi resonance interaction between the first H + bend overtone and the asymmetric and symmetric H–C–O stretches can be modulated. This Fermi resonance modulation is demonstrated by examining a series of rare gas solvated HCO + .},

Electronic excitation of MVK-oxide results in dissociation to O ( 1 D) products that are characterized using velocity map imaging. Electronic excitation of MVK-oxide on the first π* ← π transition associated primarily with the carbonyl oxide group at λ &gt; 300 nm results in a prompt dissociation and yields broad total kinetic energy release (TKER) and anisotropic angular distributions for the O ( 1 D) + methyl vinyl ketone products. By contrast, electronic excitation at λ ≤ 300 nm results in bimodal TKER and angular distributions, indicating two distinct dissociation pathways to O ( 1 D) products. One pathway is analogous to that at λ &gt; 300 nm, while the second pathway results in very low TKER and isotropic angular distributions indicative of internal conversion to the ground electronic state and statistical unimolecular dissociation.},

This value, when combined with the literature value of the samarium ionization energy, indicates that the chemi-ionization reaction of atomic Sm with atomic oxygen is endothermic by 0.048 ± 0.004 eV, which has important implications on the reactivity of Sm atoms released into the upper atmosphere. The SmO + ion was prepared by electrospray ionization followed by collisional breakup of two different precursors and characterized by the vibrational spectrum of the He-tagged ion. The UV photodissociation threshold is similar for the 10 K bare ion and the He tagged ion, which rules out the possible role of metastable electronically excited states.

However, the density distributions of other molecules contain analogous positive regions that lie out of the molecular plane known as π-holes, which are likewise capable of engaging in noncovalent bonds. Quantum calculations are applied to study such π-hole bonds that involve linear molecules, whose positive region is a circular belt surrounding the molecule, rather than the more restricted area of a σ-hole. These bonds are examined in terms of their most fundamental elements arising from the spatial dispositions of their relevant molecular orbitals and the π-holes in both the total electron density and the electrostatic potential to which they lead. Systems examined comprise tetrel, chalcogen, aerogen, and triel bonds, as well as those involving group II elements, with atoms drawn from various rows of the Periodic Table.

  abstract = {The shuttling effect is a crucial obstacle to the practical deployment of lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs). This can be ascribed to the generation of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) redox intermediates that are soluble in the electrolyte. The detailed mechanism of the shuttling, including the chemical structures responsible for the loss of effective mass and the dynamics/kinetics of the redox reactions, are not clear so far. To obtain this microscopic information, characterization techniques with high spatial and temporal resolutions are required. Here, we propose that resonance Raman spectroscopy combined with ultrafast broadband pulses is a powerful tool to reveal the mechanism of the shuttling effect. By combining the chemical bond level spatial resolution of resonance Raman and the femtosecond scale temporal resolution of the ultrafast pulses, this novel technique holds the potential of capturing the spectroscopic fingerprints of the LiPS intermediates during the working stages of LSBs. Using ab initio simulations, we show that, in addition to the excitation energy selective enhancement, resonance Raman signals of different LiPS intermediates are also characteristic and distinguishable. These results will facilitate the real-time in situ monitoring of LiPS species and reveal the underlying mechanism of the shuttling effect.},

The wavelength of the Yb-laser (1030 nm) is advantageous, since it assures almost perfect phase matching in GaP for THz generation and detection and since the dispersion in the transmissive echelons is minimal. 2D-Raman-THz test measurements on liquid bromoform (CHBr 3 ) are reported.

Overall, QCMD works as well for ammonia as for water, reducing or eliminating blue shifts from the classical spectrum without introducing the artificial red shifts or broadening associated with other imaginary-time path-integral methods. However, QCMD gives only a modest improvement over the classical spectrum for the position of the symmetric bend mode, which is highly anharmonic (since it correlates with the inversion pathway). We expect QCMD to have similar problems with large-amplitude degrees of freedom in other molecules but otherwise to work as well as for water.},

  abstract = {Full multiple spawning (FMS) offers an exciting framework for the development of strategies to simulate the excited-state dynamics of molecular systems. FMS proposes to depict the dynamics of nuclear wavepackets by using a growing set of traveling multidimensional Gaussian functions called trajectory basis functions (TBFs). Perhaps the most recognized method emanating from FMS is the so-called ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS). In AIMS, the couplings between TBFs—in principle exact in FMS—are approximated to allow for the on-the-fly evaluation of required electronic-structure quantities. In addition, AIMS proposes to neglect the so-called second-order nonadiabatic couplings and the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer corrections. While AIMS has been applied successfully to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics of numerous complex molecules, the direct influence of these missing or approximated terms on the nonadiabatic dynamics when approaching and crossing a conical intersection remains unknown to date. It is also unclear how AIMS could incorporate geometric-phase effects in the vicinity of a conical intersection. In this work, we assess the performance of AIMS in describing the nonadiabatic dynamics through a conical intersection for three two-dimensional, two-state systems that mimic the excited-state dynamics of bis(methylene)adamantyl, butatriene cation, and pyrazine. The population traces and nuclear density dynamics are compared with numerically exact quantum dynamics and trajectory surface hopping results. We find that AIMS offers a qualitatively correct description of the dynamics through a conical intersection for the three model systems. However, any attempt at improving the AIMS results by accounting for the originally neglected second-order nonadiabatic contributions appears to be stymied by the hermiticity requirement of the AIMS Hamiltonian and the independent first-generation approximation.},

In the simulation, dynamical atomic point charges follow equations of motion of classical free electrons that include Coulomb interactions with the oscillating field and surrounding atomic sites and collision effects from nearby electrons and ions. This scheme allows us to simulate an interacting system of metals with molecules using an ordinary polarizable force-field and preserves energy conservation in the case without applying an external electric field. As the first applications, we show that the presented simulation accurately reproduces (i) the classical image potential in a metal–charge interaction system and (ii) the dielectric function of bulk metal. We also demonstrate (iii) calculations of absorption spectra of metal nano-particles with and without a water solvent at room temperature, showing reasonable red-shift by the solvent effect, and (iv) plasmon resonant excitation of the metal nano-particle in solution under the visible light pulse and succeeding energy relaxation of the absorbed light energy from electrons to atoms on the metal and to the water solvent.

Networks once trained are able to make highly accurate predictions at a fraction of the cost of experiments or first-principles calculations of comparable accuracy. However, these networks typically rely on large databases of labeled experiments to train the model. In scenarios where data are scarce or expensive to obtain, this can be prohibitive. By building a neural network that provides confidence on the predicted properties, we are able to develop an active learning scheme that can reduce the amount of labeled data required by identifying the areas of chemical space where the model is most uncertain. We present a scheme for coupling a graph neural network with a Gaussian process to featurize solid-state materials and predict properties including a measure of confidence in the prediction. We then demonstrate that this scheme can be used in an active learning context to speed up the training of the model by selecting the optimal next experiment for obtaining a data label. Our active learning scheme can double the rate at which the performance of the model on a test dataset improves with additional data compared to choosing the next sample at random. This type of uncertainty quantification and active learning has the potential to open up new areas of materials science, where data are scarce and expensive to obtain, to the transformative power of graph neural networks.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider the existence and topography of seams of conical intersections (CIs) for two key singlet–triplet systems, including a uniformly scaled spin–orbit interaction. The basic one triplet and one singlet state system denoted as (S 0 ,T 1 ) and the two singlets and one triplet system denoted as (S 0 ,S 1 ,T 1 ) are treated. Essential to this analysis are realistic electronic structure data taken from a recently reported neural network fit for the 1,2 1 A and 1 3 A states of NH 3 , including H sf (spin-free) and H so (spin–orbit) surfaces derived from high quality ab initio wavefunctions. Three types of seams for the (S 0 ,S 1 ,T 1 ) system are reported, which depend on the choice of the electronic Hamiltonian, H e . The nonrelativistic CI seam [H e = H sf , (S 0 ,S 1 )], the energy minimized nonrelativistic singlet–triplet intersection seam [H e = H sf , (S 0 ,T 1 )], and the fully relativistic seam in the spin-diabatic representation (H e = H tot = H sf + H so ) are reported as functions of R(N–H). The derivative couplings are computed using H e = H tot and H sf from the fit data. The line integral of the derivative coupling is employed to juxtapose the geometric phase in the relativistic, H e = H tot , and nonrelativistic, H e = H sf , cases. It is found for the (S 0 ,T 1 ) system that there is no CI in the spin-adiabatic representation, while for the (S 0 ,S 1 ,T 1 ) system, CI can only be formed for two pairs of spin-adiabatic electronic states. The geometric phase effect thus needs to be handled with care when it comes to spin-nonconserving dynamics simulations.},

Lett. 119 , 223003 (2017) and J. E. Deustua, J. Shen, and P. Piecuch, J. Chem.

The advantages of the resulting CIPSI-driven CC( P ; Q ) methodology are illustrated by a few molecular examples, including the dissociation of F 2 and the automerization of cyclobutadiene, where we recover the electronic energies corresponding to the CC calculations with a full treatment of singles, doubles, and triples based on the information extracted from compact CI wave functions originating from relatively inexpensive Hamiltonian diagonalizations.},

This includes orbital basis sets for valence only (cc-pV n Z-PP-F12, n = D, T, Q) and outer core–valence (cc-pCV n Z-PP-F12) correlation, along with both of these augmented with additional high angular momentum diffuse functions. Matching auxiliary basis sets required for density fitting and resolution-of-the-identity approaches to conventional and F12 integrals have also been optimized. All of the basis sets are to be used in conjunction with small-core relativistic pseudopotentials [Figgen et al. , Chem. Phys. 311 , 227 (2005)]. The accuracy of the basis sets is determined through benchmark calculation at the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster level of theory for various properties of atoms and diatomic molecules. The convergence of the properties with respect to the basis set is dramatically improved compared to conventional coupled-cluster calculations, with cc-pVTZ-PP-F12 results close to conventional estimates of the complete basis set limit. The patterns of convergence are also greatly improved compared to those observed from the use of conventional correlation consistent basis sets in F12 calculations.},

  abstract = {Understanding charge storage in low-dimensional electrodes is crucial for developing novel ecologically friendly devices for capacitive energy storage and conversion and water desalination. Exactly solvable models allow in-depth analyses and essential physical insights into the charging mechanisms. So far, however, such analytical approaches have been mainly limited to lattice models. Herein, we develop a versatile, exactly solvable, one-dimensional off-lattice model for charging single-file pores. Unlike the lattice model, this model shows an excellent quantitative agreement with three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. With analytical calculations and simulations, we show that the differential capacitance can be bell-shaped (one peak), camel-shaped (two peaks), or have four peaks. Transformations between these capacitance shapes can be induced by changing pore ionophilicity, by changing cation–anion size asymmetry, or by adding solvent. We find that the camel-shaped capacitance, characteristic of dilute electrolytes, appears for strongly ionophilic pores with high ion densities, which we relate to charging mechanisms specific to narrow pores. We also derive a large-voltage asymptotic expression for the capacitance, showing that the capacitance decays to zero as the inverse square of the voltage, C ∼ u −2 . This dependence follows from hard-core interactions and is not captured by the lattice model.},

In this work, we propose to incorporate the stochastic fields, which resolve just the nonlinear environment coupling terms, into the dissipaton-equation-of-motion (DEOM) construction. The stochastic fields are introduced via the Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation. After the transformation, the resulted stochastic-fields-dressed (SFD) total Hamiltonian contains only linear environment coupling terms. On the basis of that, SFD-DEOM can then be constructed. The resultant SFD-DEOM, together with the ensemble average over the stochastic fields, constitutes an exact and nonperturbative approach to quantum dissipation under nonlinear environment couplings. It is also of relatively high efficiency and stability due to the fact that only nonlinear environment coupling terms are dealt with stochastic fields, while linear couplings are still treated as the usual DEOM. Numerical performance and demonstrations are presented with a two-state model system.},

  abstract = {The direct variational optimization of the two-electron reduced density matrix (2RDM) can provide a reference-independent description of the electronic structure of many-electron systems that naturally capture strong or nondynamic correlation effects. Such variational 2RDM approaches can often provide a highly accurate description of strong electron correlation, provided that the 2RDMs satisfy at least partial three-particle N -representability conditions (e.g., the T2 condition). However, recent benchmark calculations on hydrogen clusters [N. H. Stair and F. A. Evangelista, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 104108 (2020)] suggest that even the T2 condition leads to unacceptably inaccurate results in the case of two- and three-dimensional clusters. We demonstrate that these failures persist under the application of full three-particle N -representability conditions (3POS). A variety of correlation metrics are explored in order to identify regimes under which 3POS calculations become unreliable, and we find that the relative squared magnitudes of the cumulant three- and two-particle reduced density matrices correlate reasonably well with the energy error in these systems. However, calculations on other molecular systems reveal that this metric is not a universal indicator for the reliability of the reduced-density-matrix theory with 3POS conditions.},

These instabilities arise from singularities in the equations of motion (EOMs) and necessitate the use of regularization of the EOMs. The Projector Splitting Integrator (PSI) has previously been presented as an approach for evolving ML-MCTDH wavefunctions that is free of singularities. Here, we will discuss the implementation of the multi-layer PSI with a particular focus on how the steps required relate to those required to implement standard ML-MCTDH. We demonstrate the efficiency and stability of the PSI for large ML-MCTDH wavefunctions containing up to hundreds of thousands of nodes by considering a series of spin-boson models with up to 10 6 bath modes and find that for these problems, the PSI requires roughly 3–4 orders of magnitude fewer Hamiltonian evaluations and 2–3 orders of magnitude fewer Hamiltonian applications than standard ML-MCTDH and 2–3/1–2 orders of magnitude fewer evaluations/applications than approaches that use improved regularization schemes. Finally, we consider a series of significantly more challenging multi-spin-boson models that require much larger numbers of single-particle functions with wavefunctions containing up to ∼ 1.3 × 1 0 9 parameters to obtain accurate dynamics.},

These alternative conditions result in an expansion of the wavefunction in terms of a set of potentially arbitrary orthonormal functions, rather than in terms of a set of non-orthonormal and potentially linearly dependent functions, as is the case for standard ML-MCTDH. We show that the EOMs used in the projector splitting integrator (PSI) and the invariant EOM approaches are two special cases of this family obtained from different choices for the dynamic gauge condition, with the invariant EOMs making use of a choice that introduces potentially unbounded operators into the EOMs. As a consequence, all arguments for the existence of parallelizable integration schemes for the invariant EOMs can also be applied to the PSI EOMs.},

  abstract = {Excited states relaxation in complex molecules often involves two types of nonradiative transitions, internal conversion (IC) and intersystem crossing (ISC). In the situations when the timescales of IC and ISC are comparable, an interplay between these two types of transitions can lead to complex nonadiabatic dynamics on multiple electronic states of different characters and spin multiplicities. We demonstrate that the generalized ab initio multiple spawning (GAIMS) method interfaced with the fast graphics processing unit-based TeraChem electronic structure code can be used to model such nonadiabatic dynamics involving both the IC and ISC transitions in molecules of moderate size. We carried out 1500 fs GAIMS simulations leading to the creation of up to 2500 trajectory basis functions to study the excited states relaxation in 2-cyclopentenone. After a vertical excitation from the ground state to the bright S 2 state, the molecule quickly relaxes to the S 1 state via conical intersection. The following relaxation proceeds along two competing pathways: one involves IC to the ground state, and the other is dominated by ISC to the low-lying triplet states. The time constants describing the population transfer between the six lowest singlet and triplet states predicted by the GAIMS dynamics are in good agreement with the characteristic times of IC and ISC obtained from the analysis of the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum.},

  abstract = {In solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, frequency-selective homonuclear dipolar recoupling is key to quantitative distance measurement or selective enhancement of correlations between atoms of interest in multiple-spin systems, which are not amenable to band-selective or broadband recoupling. Previous frequency-selective recoupling is mostly based on the so-called rotational resonance (R 2 ) condition that restricts the application to spin pairs with resonance frequencies differing in integral multiples of the magic-angle spinning (MAS) frequency. Recently, we have proposed a series of frequency-selective homonuclear recoupling sequences called SPR (short for Selective Phase-optimized Recoupling), which have been successfully applied for selective 1 H– 1 H or 13 C– 13 C recoupling under from moderate (∼10 kHz) to ultra-fast (150 kHz) MAS frequencies. In this study, we fully analyze the average Hamiltonian theory of SPR sequences and reveal the origin of frequency selectivity in recoupling. The theoretical description, as well as numerical simulations and experiments, demonstrates that the frequency selectivity can be easily controlled by the flip angle ( p ) in the ( p ) ϕk ( p ) ϕk+π unit in the p SPR- N n sequences. Small flip angles lead to frequency-selective recoupling, while large flip angles may lead to broadband recoupling in principle. The result shall shed new light on the design of homonuclear recoupling sequences with arbitrary frequency bandwidths.},

  abstract = {We theoretically investigate the nucleation of liquid droplets from vapor in the presence of a charged spherical particle. Due to field gradients, sufficiently close to the critical point of the vapor–gas system, the charge destabilizes the vapor phase and initiates a phase transition. The fluid’s free energy is described by the van der Waals expression augmented by electrostatic energy and a square-gradient term. We calculate the equilibrium density profile at arbitrary temperatures, particle charges, and vapor densities. In contrast to classical nucleation theory, here, both liquid and vapor phases are different from the bulk phases because they are spatially nonuniform. In addition, the theory applies to both sharp and diffuse interfaces and calculates the surface tension self-consistently. We find the composition profiles and integrate them to get the adsorption near the particle. We find that the adsorption changes discontinuously at a first-order phase transition line. This line becomes a second-order phase transition at high enough temperatures. We describe the transition point numerically and provide approximate analytical expressions for it. Similarly to prewetting, the adsorption diverges at the binodal phase boundary. We construct a phase diagram indicating changes in the binodal, spinodal, and critical temperature. It is shown that the field gradient enlarges the range of temperature and vapor density where liquid can nucleate.},

  abstract = {There are opportunities for the application of chemical physics style thinking to models central to solid state physics. Solid state physics has largely been left to its own devices by the chemical physics theory community, which is a shame. I will show here that cross fertilization of ideas is real and beneficial to science. This essay is written with the hope of encouraging young theorists with a chemical physics background to enter this rich and promising area. There are many low hanging fruit available essentially because condensed matter physics traditions, models, and standards for progress are so much different than in chemical physics. By way of a warning label, right now neither community is supporting this endeavor. I am hoping this article will help, a little. I make the apology for using mainly (but not exclusively) my own narrow experience and contributions to illustrate this essay. I understand it is only a small piece of the pie, but I do believe the message here is larger: a chemical physics mindset is complementary to the condensed matter physics mindset, and they would work best together.},

  abstract = {Numerous linear and non-linear spectroscopic techniques have been developed to elucidate structural and functional information of complex systems ranging from natural systems, such as proteins and light-harvesting systems, to synthetic systems, such as solar cell materials and light-emitting diodes. The obtained experimental data can be challenging to interpret due to the complexity and potential overlapping spectral signatures. Therefore, computational spectroscopy plays a crucial role in the interpretation and understanding of spectral observables of complex systems. Computational modeling of various spectroscopic techniques has seen significant developments in the past decade, when it comes to the systems that can be addressed, the size and complexity of the sample types, the accuracy of the methods, and the spectroscopic techniques that can be addressed. In this Perspective, I will review the computational spectroscopy methods that have been developed and applied for infrared and visible spectroscopies in the condensed phase. I will discuss some of the questions that this has allowed answering. Finally, I will discuss current and future challenges and how these may be addressed.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have suggested that enzymes and other small molecules chemotax toward their substrates. However, the physical forces driving this chemotaxis are currently debated. In this work, we consider a simple thermodynamic theory for molecular chemotaxis that is based on the McMillan–Mayer theory of dilute solutions and Schellman’s theory for macromolecular binding. Even in the absence of direct interactions, the chemical binding equilibrium introduces a coupling term into the relevant free energy, which then reduces the chemical potential of both enzymes and their substrates. Assuming a local thermodynamic equilibrium, this binding contribution to the chemical potential generates an effective thermodynamic force that promotes chemotaxis by driving each solute toward its binding partner. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that, although small, this thermodynamic force is qualitatively consistent with several experimental studies. Thus, our study may provide additional insight into the role of the thermodynamic binding free energy for molecular chemotaxis.},

In this study, the film of poly(ethyl methacrylate) doped with the azobenzene derivative Disperse Red 1 (DR1) has been irradiated with the linearly polarized light of 546 nm. The time profiles of optical anisotropy and absorbance measured during irradiation have been analyzed using a kinetic model. Based on the analysis of the time profiles, we conclude that the light-induced reorientation of DR1 molecules occurs in confined environments where trans → cis isomerization is hindered, while in roomy environments, there is no reorientation. In the confined environment, reorientation occurs due to the environmental changes caused by the isomerization attempts of the DR1 molecule. The polymer environment affects thermal cis → trans and light-induced trans → cis isomerizations of the DR1 molecule differently, suggesting that the spatial requirements for these processes to proceed are different. The thermal isomerization does not result in the reorientation of DR1 molecules in roomy environments.},

Simulations predict a significant effect that, for sufficiently small particles, can be simply rationalized by the depolarization factor. The crystal size and the refractive index of the medium in which the nanoparticles are embedded are also found to have an effect on the absorption spectra. All factors mentioned are found to influence also the spectra of scattered light. These effects, already broadly documented for metallic nanoparticles, are here demonstrated theoretically for the first time for crystalline organic nanoparticles, providing novel insight into the optical response of such particles. The effects are expected to be displayed by all organic nanoparticles, as long as they have a well-defined crystal structure and are large enough for the optical properties to be understandable using a macroscopic dielectric tensor. The effects demonstrated here should be taken into account when rationalizing differences in absorption spectra of a substance in solution and in nanoparticle form, e.g., in deducing the type of intermolecular packing. The effects are much less pronounced for optically isotropic nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {The properties of semiconductor surfaces can be modified by the deposition of metal clusters consisting of a few atoms. The properties of metal clusters and of cluster-modified surfaces depend on the number of atoms forming the clusters. Deposition of clusters with a monodisperse size distribution thus allows tailoring of the surface properties for technical applications. However, it is a challenge to retain the size of the clusters after their deposition due to the tendency of the clusters to agglomerate. The agglomeration can be inhibited by covering the metal cluster modified surface with a thin metal oxide overlayer. In the present work, phosphine-protected Au clusters, Au 9 (PPh 3 ) 8 (NO 3 ) 3 , were deposited onto RF-sputter deposited TiO 2 films and subsequently covered with a Cr 2 O 3 film only a few monolayers thick. The samples were then heated to 200 °C to remove the phosphine ligands, which is a lower temperature than that required to remove thiolate ligands from Au clusters. It was found that the Cr 2 O 3 covering layer inhibited cluster agglomeration at an Au cluster coverage of 0.6\% of a monolayer. When no protecting Cr 2 O 3 layer was present, the clusters were found to agglomerate to a large degree on the TiO 2 surface.},

  abstract = {Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods are frequently used for mechanistic studies of thermally driven heterogeneous catalysis systems but are underused for electrocatalysis. Here, we develop a lattice KMC approach for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The work is motivated by a prior experimental report that performed electroreduction of a mixed feed of 12 CO 2 and 13 CO on Cu; differences in the 13 C content of C2 products ethylene and ethanol (Δ 13 C) were interpreted as evidence of site selectivity. The lattice KMC model considers the effect of surface diffusion on this system. In the limit of infinitely fast diffusion (mean-field approximation), the key intermediates 12 CO* and 13 CO* would be well mixed on the surface and no evidence of site selectivity could have been observed. Using a simple two-site model and adapting a previously reported microkinetic model, we assess the effects of diffusion on the relative isotope fractions in the products using the estimated surface diffusion rate of CO* from literature reports. We find that the size of the active sites and the total surface adsorbate coverage can have a large influence on the values of Δ 13 C that can be observed. Δ 13 C is less sensitive to the CO* diffusion rate as long as it is within the estimated range. We further offer possible methods to estimate surface distribution of intermediates and to predict intrinsic selectivity of active sites based on experimental observations. This work illustrates the importance of considering surface diffusion in the study of electrochemical CO 2 reduction to multi-carbon products. Our approach is entirely based on a freely available open-source code, so will be readily adaptable to other electrocatalytic systems.},

However, it has not been explained why the binding energies are homogeneous although the pair interaction energy of hydrogen-bonded dimers distributes widely. Here, we provide a rationale for this phenomenon. The topological constraints imposed by the ice rules, in which water molecules form directed cyclic paths of hydrogen bonds, cancel out the variability of local interactions. We also show that the cancellation mechanism does not work due to some imperfect cyclic paths on the surface of ice. Such water molecules do not enjoy homogeneity in the bulk state and suffer from a wide spectrum in the binding energy.},

  abstract = {Impulsive stimulated thermal scattering (ISTS) allows one to access the structural relaxation dynamics in supercooled molecular liquids on a time scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. Till now, a heuristic semi-empirical model has been commonly adopted to account for the ISTS signals. This model implicitly assumes that the relaxation of specific heat, C , and thermal expansion coefficient, γ , occur on the same time scale and accounts for them via a single stretched exponential. This work proposes two models that assume disentangled relaxations, respectively, based on the Debye and Havriliak–Negami assumptions for the relaxation spectrum and explicitly accounting for the relaxation of C and γ separately in the ISTS response. A theoretical analysis was conducted to test and compare the disentangled relaxation models against the stretched exponential. The former models were applied to rationalize the experimental ISTS signals acquired on supercooled glycerol. This allows us to simultaneously retrieve the frequency-dependent specific heat and thermal expansion up to the sub-100 MHz frequency range and further to compare the fragility and time scale probed by thermal, mechanical, and dielectric susceptibilities.},

  abstract = {Kinetics of ozone destruction due to the recombination of oxygen atoms produced by pulsed 266 nm laser photolysis of O 3 /M (M = CO 2 and/or N 2 ) mixtures was studied using the absorption and emission spectroscopy to follow time evolutions of O 3 and electronically excited molecules O 2 * formed in the recombination process 2O( 3 P) + M → O 2 * + M. An unexpected high ozone destruction rate was observed when O 2 * was present in the system. The kinetic model developed for the oxygen nightglow on the terrestrial planets was adapted to interpret the detected temporal profiles of the ozone number density and the O 2 * emission intensities. It was deduced that the vibrationally excited singlet delta oxygen molecule O 2 ( a 1 Δ, υ ) formed in the secondary processes reacts efficiently with ozone in the process O 2 ( a 1 Δ, υ ≥ 3) + O 3 → 2O 2 + O, and the rate constant of this process was estimated to be 3 × 10 −11 cm 3 s −1 . Ab initio calculations at the CASPT2(14, 12)/cc-pVTZ/UωB97XD/cc-pVTZ level of theory were applied to find the reaction pathway from the reactants to products on the O 5 potential energy surface. These calculations revealed that the O 2 ( a 1 Δ) + O 3 reaction is likely to proceed via singlet–triplet intersystem crossing exhibiting an energy barrier of 9.6 kcal/mol, which lies between two and three quanta of vibrational excitation of O 2 ( a 1 Δ), and hence, O 2 ( a 1 Δ, υ ) with υ ≥ 3 could rapidly react with ozone.},

Recently, a very efficient way to increase its amplitude has been demonstrated near the first-order spin–orbit coupling regime. Within the first-order regime, the anisotropic spin Hamiltonian involving the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya operator becomes inappropriate. Nevertheless, in order to approach this regime and identify the spin Hamiltonian limitations, it is necessary to characterize the underlying physics. To this end, we have developed a simple electronic and spin–orbit model describing the first-order regime and used ab initio calculations to conduct a thorough methodological study.},

It has been found that the Br 2 + product ion preferentially originates from the cis isomer rather than from trans . The Boltzmann-type isotropic low kinetic energy components of the Br + and Br 2 + product state distributions seem to be most likely from the unimolecular reactions of the vibrationally hot cationic ground state generated by the three-photon absorption at the photon energy below ∼38 000 cm −1 . The highly anisotropic kinetic energy components of Br + and Br 2 + start to appear at the photon energy above ∼38 000 cm −1 , where the D n ( n ≥ 1) − D 0 transition is facilitated within the same ps laser pulse as the parent molecule is efficiently ionized by the two-photon absorption. The transition dipole moment of the D 4 − D 0 transition of the strongest oscillator strength has been theoretically predicted to be parallel to the C–Br bond or C=C bond axis for the trans or cis isomer, respectively. The fast anisotropic with the (β ∼ +2) component in the Br + product distribution is thus likely from the trans isomer, whereas that of Br 2 + (β ∼ −0.5) should be the consequence of the photodissociation of the cis isomer. The isomer-specific reactivity found here in the picosecond multiphoton excitation of 1,2-DBE provides a nice platform for the better understanding of the structure–reactivity relationship under the harsh condition of the strong or ultrashort optical field.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of carbon condensation, or carbon clustering, in detonation of carbon-rich high explosives is modeled by solving a system of rate equations for concentrations of carbon particles. Unlike previous efforts, the rate equations account not only for the aggregation of particles but also for their fragmentation in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Numerical simulations are performed, yielding the distribution of particle concentrations as a function of time. In addition to that, analytical expressions are obtained for all the distinct steps and regimes of the condensation kinetics, which facilitates the analysis of the numerical results and allows one to study the sensitivity of the kinetic behavior to the variation of system parameters. The latter is important because the numerical values of many parameters are not reliably known at present. The theory of the kinetics of first-order phase transitions is found adequate to describe the general kinetic trends of carbon condensation, as described by the rate equations. Such physical phenomena and processes as the coagulation, nucleation, growth, and Ostwald ripening are observed, and their dependence on various system parameters is studied and reported. It is believed that the present work will become useful when analyzing the present and future results for the kinetics of carbon condensation, obtained from experiments or atomistic simulations.},

  abstract = {The spectrum of triatomic molecules with close rovibrational opposite parity levels is sensitive to the P , T -odd effects. This makes them a convenient platform for the experimental search of a new physics. Among the promising candidates, one may distinguish YbOH as a non-radioactive compound with a heavy atom. The energy gap between levels of opposite parity, l -doubling, is of great interest as it determines the electric field strength required for the full polarization of the molecule. Likewise, the influence of the bending and stretching modes on the sensitivities to the P , T -violation requires a thorough investigation since the measurement would be performed on the excited vibrational states. This motivates us to obtain the rovibrational nuclear wavefunctions, taking into account the anharmonicity of the potential. As a result, we get the values of E eff and E s for the lowest excited vibrational state and determine the l -doubling.},

  abstract = {Conventional ion spectroscopy is inapplicable for ions produced in low concentrations or with low spectral resolutions. Hence, we constructed a high-resolution vacuum ultraviolet mass-analyzed threshold ionization (HR VUV-MATI) spectrometer composed of a four-wave frequency mixing cell capable of generating long-lasting and intense VUV laser pulses of ∼1 × 10 10 photons/pulse at wavelengths of 123.6–160.0 nm, a space-focused linear time-of-flight photoionization chamber with a new ion-source assembly, and a compact molecular beam chamber with a temperature-controlled pulsed nozzle for ion spectroscopy. The ion-source assembly and pulsing schemes enabled an ∼15- μ s-delayed but extremely weak pulsed-field-ionization of the molecules in the zero-kinetic-energy (ZEKE) states and first-order space focusing of the generated MATI ions. These ZEKE states were effectively generated by a minute electric jitter from the high-lying Rydberg states, which were initially prepared via VUV photoexcitation. The spectral and mass resolutions (∼5 cm −1 and 2400, respectively) and the signal strength were simultaneously enhanced using this spectrometer. Moreover, it could be used to measure the fine vibrational spectrum from the zero-point level of the cation and the exact adiabatic ionization energy of the neutral molecule. Additionally, it could be used to measure the appearance energies of the photoproducts and elucidate the vibrational structures of the cationic isotopomers, utilizing other pulsing schemes. Furthermore, this spectrometer could be used to analyze the congested vibrational spectrum of a cation with multiple conformations. Thus, the HR VUV-MATI spectrometer—a potential alternative to photoelectron spectrometers—can be used to analyze the conformational structure-dependent reactivities.},

Here, this limitation is overcome by optical Kerr gating of the SFG signal to discriminate against fluorescence. The new approach is demonstrated on the excited state dynamics of malachite green at the water/air interface, in the presence of a highly fluorescent coumarin dye, and on the photo-oxidation of the phenolate anion at the water/air interface.

This work revisits the theory, clarifies the key assumptions involved in the rate expression, and provides a generalization for the cases where the effects of temperature dependence and low-frequency modes cannot be ignored. For a specific example where the low-frequency vibrational and/or solvation responses can be modeled as an Ohmic spectral density, a simple generalization of the EG law is provided. Test calculations demonstrate that this generalized EG law brings significant improvement over the original EG law. Both the original and generalized EG laws are also compared with the stationary phase approximations developed for electron transfer theory, which suggests the possibility of a simple interpolation formula valid for any value of EG.},

Given its success on small molecular systems, in this work, we point out that the accuracy of structure retrieval is constrained by the availability of a wide range of experimental data in the momentum space in all molecular systems. To mitigate the limitations, for laser-induced electron diffraction, here we retrieve molecular structures using two-dimensional (energy and angle) electron momentum spectra in the laboratory frame for a number of small molecular systems, which have previously been studied with 1D methods. Compared to the conventional single-energy or single-angle analysis, our 2D methods effectively expand the momentum range of the measured data. Besides utilization of the 2D data, two complementary methods are developed for consistency check on the retrieved results. The 2D nature of our methods also offers a way of estimating the error from retrieval, which has never been explored before. Comparing with results from prior experiments, our findings show evidence that our 2D methods outperform the conventional 1D methods. Paving the way to the retrieval of large molecular systems, in which their tunneling ionization rates are challenging to obtain, we estimate the error of using the isotropic model in place of including the orientation-dependent ionization rate.},

As an example, a series of actinide chlorides AnCl 3 (An = U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, and Cf) was used. The crystal-field multiplet formalism was applied to calculate the 3 d -4 f RIXS maps, and the HERFD-XAS spectra were extracted as cuts of these RIXS maps along the incident energy axis at the constant emitted energy, corresponding to the maximum of the RIXS intensity. A relation between HERFD and conventional XAS methods was also examined. Despite some differences between profiles of the An M 5 HERFD and conventional XAS spectra of trivalent actinides, the results of calculations indicate that the HERFD method can be used at the An M 5 edge for monitoring even small variations in the An chemical state. As a whole, better agreement between the HERFD and XAS spectra was found for the An M 4 edges as compared to the An M 5 edges. By using the point charge electrostatic model, the dependence of the An M 4,5 HERFD-XAS spectra on the An coordination number was studied, which indicates the significant sensitivity of the distribution of the An 5 f states to the ligand structural arrangement around the An sites.},

  abstract = {Simulating solids with quantum chemistry methods and Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) has been gaining popularity. Nonetheless, there are few systematic studies that assess the basis set incompleteness error (BSIE) in these GTO-based simulations over a variety of solids. In this work, we report a GTO-based implementation for solids and apply it to address the basis set convergence issue. We employ a simple strategy to generate large uncontracted (unc) GTO basis sets that we call the unc-def2-GTH sets. These basis sets exhibit systematic improvement toward the basis set limit as well as good transferability based on application to a total of 43 simple semiconductors. Most notably, we found the BSIE of unc-def2-QZVP-GTH to be smaller than 0.7 m E h per atom in total energies and 20 meV in bandgaps for all systems considered here. Using unc-def2-QZVP-GTH, we report bandgap benchmarks of a combinatorially designed meta-generalized gradient approximation (mGGA) functional, B97M-rV, and show that B97M-rV performs similarly (a root-mean-square-deviation of 1.18 eV) to other modern mGGA functionals, M06-L (1.26 eV), MN15-L (1.29 eV), and Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) (1.20 eV). This represents a clear improvement over older pure functionals such as local density approximation (1.71 eV) and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) (1.49 eV), although all these mGGAs are still far from being quantitatively accurate. We also provide several cautionary notes on the use of our uncontracted bases and on future research on GTO basis set development for solids.},

We find that neural network potentials based on local representations of atomic environments are capable of describing some properties of liquid–vapor interfaces but typically fail for properties that depend on unbalanced long-ranged interactions that build up in the presence of broken translation symmetry. These same interactions cancel in the translationally invariant bulk, allowing local neural network potentials to describe bulk properties correctly. By incorporating explicit models of the slowly varying long-ranged interactions and training neural networks only on the short-ranged components, we can arrive at potentials that robustly recover interfacial properties. We find that local neural network models can sometimes approximate a local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn. Generally, we find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier to train and have higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in a simple model of an asymmetric dipolar fluid, where the exact long-ranged interaction is known, and in an ab initio water model, where it is approximated.},

Among several parameters evaluated, the addition of a large excess of exchange thiol (2-PET) to the organic phase was identified as the key factor for the structure conversion. After exchange, the nature of the clusters was determined by UV–vis, electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared, and extended x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy. The obtained Au 16 (2-PET) 14 clusters proved to be exceptionally stable in solution, showing only slightly diminished UV–vis absorption features after 3 days, even when exposed to an excess of thiol ligands.},

Although nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is powerful in determining the yields of hydrogenation, it is still challenging to use NMR for chirality-related analysis. Herein, we applied parahydrogen-induced hyperpolarization (PHIP) NMR to determine the enantioselectivity of asymmetric hydrogenation and the absolute chirality of products. We hyperpolarized two types of unsaturated amino acid precursors, i.e., methyl- α -acetoamido cinnamate and (E)-ethyl 3-acetamidobut-2-enoate. Hydrogenation of prochiral substrates with parahydrogen gave temporary hyperpolarized diastereoisomers, which exhibit different PHIP patterns distinguishable in 1 H NMR. After assigning the NMR peaks by density functional theory calculations, we simulated the PHIP patterns of all the possible temporary hyperpolarized diastereoisomers and unambiguously assigned the chirality of the products and the enantioselectivity of asymmetric hydrogenation. Our work demonstrates the application and potential of PHIP in revealing the mechanism of asymmetric hydrogenation.},

  abstract = {Biological membranes that play major roles in diverse functions are composed of numerous lipids and proteins, making them an important target for coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Recently, we have developed the CG implicit solvent lipid force field (iSoLF) that has a resolution compatible with the widely used Cα protein representation [D. Ugarte La Torre and S. Takada, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 205101 (2020)]. In this study, we extended it and developed a lipid–protein interaction model that allows the combination of the iSoLF and the Cα protein force field, AICG2+. The hydrophobic–hydrophilic interaction is modeled as a modified Lennard-Jones potential in which parameters were tuned partly to reproduce the experimental transfer free energy and partly based on the free energy profile normal to the membrane surface from previous all-atom MD simulations. Then, the obtained lipid–protein interaction is tested for the configuration and placement of transmembrane proteins, water-soluble proteins, and peripheral proteins, showing good agreement with prior knowledge. The interaction is generally applicable and is implemented in the publicly available software, CafeMol.},

  abstract = {Polymer-mediated colloidal interactions control the stability and phase properties of colloid–polymer mixtures that are critical for a wide range of important applications. In this work, we develop a versatile self-consistent field theory (SCFT) approach to study this type of interaction based on a continuum confined polymer solution model with explicit solvent and confining walls. The model is formulated in the grand canonical ensemble, and the potential of mean force for the polymer-mediated interaction is computed from grand potentials. We focus on the case of non-adsorbing linear polymers and present a systematic investigation on depletion effects using SCFT. The properties of confined polymer solutions are probed, and mean-field profiles of induced interactions are shown across different physical regimes. We expose a detailed parametric dependence of the interaction, concerning both attractive and repulsive parts, on polymer concentration, chain length, and solvent quality and explore the effect of wall surface roughness, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach. Our findings show good agreement with previous numerical studies and experiments, yet extend prior work to new regimes. Moreover, the mechanisms of depletion attraction and repulsion, along with the influence of individual control factors, are further discussed. We anticipate that this study will provide useful insights into depletion forces and can be readily extended to examine more complex colloid–polymer mixtures.},

Due to the continuous energy input by the rotating field, these clusters are at a state of dissipative nonequilibrium. Dissipative viscoelastic shear waves traveling around their interface enable the rotation of isotropic binary clusters. The angular velocity of a binary cluster is much slower than that of the magnetic field; it increases with the concentration of big particles, and it saturates at a concentration threshold. We generalize an earlier theoretical model to successfully account for the observed effect of cluster composition on cluster rotation. We also investigate the evolution of the internal distribution of the two particle types, reminiscent of segregation in a drop of two immiscible liquids, and the effect of this internal structure on rotation dynamics. The binary clusters exhibit short-range order, which rapidly vanishes at a larger scale, consistent with the clusters’ viscoelastic liquid behavior.},

  abstract = {Experimental data on the interaction between two knots in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) confined in nanochannels produced two particular behaviors of knot pairs along the DNA molecules: (i) widely separated knots experience an attractive interaction but only remain in close proximity for several seconds and (ii) knots tend to remain separated until one of the knots unravels at the chain end. The associated free energy profile of the knot–knot separation distance for an ensemble of DNA knots exhibits a global minimum when knots are separated, indicating that the separated knot state is more stable than the intertwined knot state, with dynamics in the separated knot state that are consistent with independent diffusion. The experimental observations of knot–knot interactions under nanochannel confinement are inconsistent with previous simulation-based and experimental results for stretched polymers under tension wherein the knots attract and then stay close to each other. This inconsistency is postulated to result from a weaker fluctuation-induced attractive force between knots under confinement when compared to the knots under tension, the latter of which experience larger fluctuations in transverse directions.},

Sharing the same technical framework of RT-TDDFT, imaginary-time time-dependent density functional theory (it-TDDFT) is a recently developed robust-convergence ground state method. Presented here are high-precision all-electron RT-TDDFT and it-TDDFT implementations within a numerical atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis function framework in the FHI-aims code. We discuss the theoretical background and technical choices in our implementation. First, RT-TDDFT results are validated against linear-response TDDFT results. Specifically, we analyze the NAO basis sets’ convergence for Thiel’s test set of small molecules and confirm the importance of the augmentation basis functions for adequate convergence. Adopting a velocity-gauge formalism, we next demonstrate applications for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Taking advantage of the all-electron full-potential implementation, we present applications for core level spectra. For it-TDDFT, we confirm that within the all-electron NAO formalism, it-TDDFT can successfully converge systems that are difficult to converge in the standard self-consistent field method. We finally benchmark our implementation for systems up to ∼500 atoms. The implementation exhibits almost linear weak and strong scaling behavior.},

  abstract = {Autonomous computing materials for data storage and computing offer an opportunity for next generation of computing devices. Patchy nanoparticle networks, for example, have been suggested as potential candidates for emulating neuronal networks and performing brain-like computing. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to show that stable dimers, trimers, and tetramers can be built from citrate capped gold nanoparticles (cit-AuNPs) linked by poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) chains. We use different lengths of PAHs to build polymer-networked nanoparticle assemblies that can emulate a complex neuronal network linked by axons of varying lengths. We find that the tetramer structure can accommodate up to 11 different states when the AuNP pairs are connected by either of two polymer linkers, PAH 200 and PAH 300 . We find that the heavy AuNPs contribute to the assembly’s structure stability. To further illustrate the stability, the AuNP–AuNP distances in dimer, trimer, and tetramer structures are reduced by steering the cit-AuNPs closer to each other. At different distances, these steered structures are all locally stable in a 10 ns MD simulation time scale because of their connection to the AuNPs. We also find that the global potential energy minimum is at short AuNP–AuNP distances where AuNPs collapse because the - NH 3 + and –COO − attraction reduces the potential energy. The stability and application of these fundamental structures remain to be further improved through the use of alternative polymer linkers and nanoparticles.},

The calculated results are compared with those of the excited H-bonded OH in bulk liquid water reported previously. In the case of pure water, the relaxation timescale (vibrational lifetime) of the excited H-bonded OH at the interface is T 1 = 0.13 ps, which is slightly larger than that in the bulk ( T 1 = 0.11 ps). Conversely, in the case of isotopically diluted water, the relaxation timescale of T 1 = 0.74 ps in the bulk decreases to T 1 = 0.26 ps at the interface, suggesting that the relaxation dynamics of the H-bonded OH are strongly dependent on the surrounding H-bond environments particularly for the isotopically diluted conditions. The relaxation paths and their rates are estimated by introducing certain constraints on the vibrational modes except for the target path in the NE-AIMD simulation to decompose the total energy relaxation rate into contributions to possible relaxation pathways. It is found that the main relaxation pathway in the case of pure water is due to intermolecular OH⋯OH vibrational coupling, which is similar to the relaxation in the bulk. In the case of isotopically diluted water, the main pathway is due to intramolecular stretch and bend couplings, which show more efficient relaxation than in the bulk because of strong H-bonding interactions specific to the air/water interface.},

The ongoing rapid growth of open-access bandgap databases can benefit such model construction not only by expanding their domain of applicability but also by requiring constant updating of the model. Here, we build a new state-of-the-art multi-fidelity graph network model for bandgap prediction of crystalline compounds from a large bandgap database of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) computed bandgaps with over 806 600 entries (1500 experimental, 775 700 low-fidelity DFT, and 29 400 high-fidelity DFT). The model predicts bandgaps with a 0.23 eV mean absolute error in cross validation for high-fidelity data, and including the mixed data from all different fidelities improves the prediction of the high-fidelity data. The prediction error is smaller for high-symmetry crystals than for low symmetry crystals. Our data are published through a new cloud-based computing environment, called the “Foundry,” which supports easy creation and revision of standardized data structures and will enable cloud accessible containerized models, allowing for continuous model development and data accumulation in the future.},

  abstract = {Strong light–matter coupling to form exciton– and vibropolaritons is increasingly touted as a powerful tool to alter the fundamental properties of organic materials. It is proposed that these states and their facile tunability can be used to rewrite molecular potential energy landscapes and redirect photophysical pathways, with applications from catalysis to electronic devices. Crucial to their photophysical properties is the exchange of energy between coherent, bright polaritons and incoherent dark states. One of the most potent tools to explore this interplay is transient absorption/reflectance spectroscopy. Previous studies have revealed unexpectedly long lifetimes of the coherent polariton states, for which there is no theoretical explanation. Applying these transient methods to a series of strong-coupled organic microcavities, we recover similar long-lived spectral effects. Based on transfer-matrix modeling of the transient experiment, we find that virtually the entire photoresponse results from photoexcitation effects other than the generation of polariton states. Our results suggest that the complex optical properties of polaritonic systems make them especially prone to misleading optical signatures and that more challenging high-time-resolution measurements on high-quality microcavities are necessary to uniquely distinguish the coherent polariton dynamics.},

  abstract = {Water diffusion through membrane proteins is a key aspect of cellular function. Essential processes of cellular metabolism are driven by osmotic pressure, which depends on water channels. Membrane proteins such as aquaporins (AQPs) are responsible for enabling water permeation through the cell membrane. AQPs are highly selective, allowing only water and relatively small polar molecules to cross the membrane. Experimentally, estimation of water flux through membrane proteins is still a challenge, and hence, accurate simulations of water permeation are of particular importance. We present a numerical study of water diffusion through AQP1 comparing three water models: TIP3P, OPC, and TIP4P/2005. Bulk diffusion, diffusion permeability, and osmotic permeability are computed and compared among all models. The results show that there are significant differences between TIP3P (a particularly widespread model for simulations of biological systems) and the more recently developed TIP4P/2005 and OPC models. We demonstrate that OPC and TIP4P/2005 reproduce protein–water interactions and dynamics in very good agreement with experimental data. From this study, we find that the choice of the water model has a significant effect on the computed water dynamics as well as its molecular behavior within a biological nanopore.},

In this work, we have investigated the interactions of benzothiadiazine with the basic components of cell membranes and solvents, such as phospholipids, cholesterol, ions, and water. The analysis of the mutual microscopic interactions is of central importance to elucidate the local structure of benzothiadiazine as well as the mechanisms responsible for the access of benzothiadiazine to the interior of the cell. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of benzothiadiazine embedded in three different model zwitterionic bilayer membranes made by dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, and cholesterol inside aqueous sodium-chloride solution in order to systematically examine microscopic interactions of benzothiadiazine with the cell membrane at liquid-crystalline phase conditions. From data obtained through radial distribution functions, hydrogen-bonding lengths, and potentials of mean force based on reversible work calculations, we have observed that benzothiadiazine has a strong affinity to stay at the cell membrane interface although it can be fully solvated by water in short periods of time. Furthermore, benzothiadiazine is able to bind lipids and cholesterol chains by means of single and double hydrogen-bonds of different characteristic lengths.},

The effect of five normal-mode excitations of ethane on the reactivity, the mechanism, and the post-reaction energy flow is followed through a wide range of collision energies. Promoting effects of vibrational excitations and interaction time, related to the slightly submerged barrier, are found to be suppressed by the early-barrier-induced translational enhancement, in contrast to the slightly late-barrier Cl + C 2 H 6 reaction. The excess vibrational energy mostly converts into ethyl internal excitation while collision energy is transformed into product separation. The substantial reaction energy excites the HF vibration, which tends to show mode-specificity and translational energy dependence as well. With increasing collision energy, direct stripping becomes dominant over the direct rebound and indirect mechanisms, being basically independent of reactant excitation.},

A 107 , 7125 (2003)] that additionally accounts for the proton-exchange reaction between HeH + and He. It is shown that the exchange channel contributes nearly as much as the inelastic channel to the vibrational excitation and de-excitation processes and that the total rate constants pertaining to the purely inelastic processes are largely of the same magnitude as those obtained when both inelastic and reactive channels are included in the dynamics. The inelastic rovibrational rate coefficients involving this astrophysical cation are also found to be much larger than those obtained for anions present in similar interstellar environments.},

Transitions between the singlet state and one of the triplet states may be driven by an oscillating low-frequency magnetic field, in the presence of couplings to a third nuclear spin, and a weak bias magnetic field. The oscillating field is in the same direction as the bias field and is called a WOLF (Weak Oscillating Low Field) pulse. Application of a WOLF pulse allows for the generation of strong nuclear hyperpolarization of 13 C nuclei, starting from the nuclear singlet polarization of a 1 H spin pair, associated with the enriched para -spin isomer of hydrogen gas.

  abstract = {The emerging fields of citizen science and gamification reformulate scientific problems as games or puzzles to be solved. Through engaging the wider non-scientific community, significant breakthroughs may be made by analyzing citizen-gathered data. In parallel, recent advances in virtual reality (VR) technology are increasingly being used within a scientific context and the burgeoning field of interactive molecular dynamics in VR (iMD-VR) allows users to interact with dynamical chemistry simulations in real time. Here, we demonstrate the utility of iMD-VR as a medium for gamification of chemistry research tasks. An iMD-VR “game” was designed to encourage users to explore the reactivity of a particular chemical system, and a cohort of 18 participants was recruited to playtest this game as part of a user study. The reaction game encouraged users to experiment with making chemical reactions between a propyne molecule and an OH radical, and “molecular snapshots” from each game session were then compiled and used to map out reaction pathways. The reaction network generated by users was compared to existing literature networks demonstrating that users in VR capture almost all the important reaction pathways. Further comparisons between humans and an algorithmic method for guiding molecular dynamics show that through using citizen science to explore these kinds of chemical problems, new approaches and strategies start to emerge.},

The implementation heavily relies on the use of sparse matrix algebra, density fitting techniques for the short-range Coulomb interactions, while a Fourier transformation in spherical coordinates is used for the long-range part of the potential. Localized molecular orbitals are employed for the occupied space, whereas orbital specific virtual orbitals associated with localized molecular orbitals are obtained from the exchange matrix associated with specific localized occupied orbitals. The range separated potential is crucial to achieve efficient treatment of the direct term in the MP2, while extensive screening is employed to reduce the expense of the exchange contribution in MP2. The focus of this paper is on controllable accuracy and linear scaling of the data entering the algorithm.},

Discrete optimization is performed using simulated annealing in order to identify sequences of code-lines, operating on the program inputs that can reproduce the expected ground-state wavefunctions ψ ( x ) for a set of target PESs. The outcome of this optimization is not simply a mathematical function approximating ψ ( x ) but is, instead, a complete algorithm that converts the input vectors describing the system into a ground-state solution of the Schrödinger equation.

Site-directed mutations can modify this local spectroscopic tuning, providing critical insight into native photosynthetic functions and offering the tantalizing prospect of creating rationally designed Chl proteins with customized optical properties. Unfortunately, at present, no proven methods exist for reliably predicting mutation-induced frequency shifts in advance, limiting the method’s utility for quantitative applications. Here, we address this challenge by constructing a series of point mutants in the water-soluble chlorophyll protein of Lepidium virginicum and using them to test the reliability of a simple computational protocol for mutation-induced site energy shifts. The protocol uses molecular dynamics to prepare mutant protein structures and the charge density coupling model of Adolphs et al. [Photosynth. Res. 95 , 197–209 (2008)] for site energy prediction; a graphical interface that implements the protocol automatically is published online at http://nanohub.org/tools/pigmenthunter . With the exception of a single outlier (presumably due to unexpected structural changes), we find that the calculated frequency shifts match the experiment remarkably well, with an average error of 1.6 nm over a 9 nm spread in wavelengths. We anticipate that the accuracy of the method can be improved in the future with more advanced sampling of mutant protein structures.},

The conformer-selected IR spectrum of DAH + (H 2 O) 3 is measured by IR dip spectroscopy, and its structure is assigned with the help of quantum chemical calculations. The excited state lifetime of DAH + is much shorter than 20 ps, the cross correlation of the ps lasers, revealing a fast relaxation dynamics. The minimal energy path along the NH → π proton transfer coordinate exhibits a low energy barrier in the monomer, while this path is blocked by the high energy barrier in DAH + (H 2 O) 3 .

  abstract = {With the rapid development of quantum technology, one of the leading applications that has been identified is the simulation of chemistry. Interestingly, even before full scale quantum computers are available, quantum computer science has exhibited a remarkable string of results that directly impact what is possible in a chemical simulation with any computer. Some of these results even impact our understanding of chemistry in the real world. In this Perspective, we take the position that direct chemical simulation is best understood as a digital experiment. While on the one hand, this clarifies the power of quantum computers to extend our reach, it also shows us the limitations of taking such an approach too directly. Leveraging results that quantum computers cannot outpace the physical world, we build to the controversial stance that some chemical problems are best viewed as problems for which no algorithm can deliver their solution, in general, known in computer science as undecidable problems. This has implications for the predictive power of thermodynamic models and topics such as the ergodic hypothesis. However, we argue that this Perspective is not defeatist but rather helps shed light on the success of existing chemical models such as transition state theory, molecular orbital theory, and thermodynamics as models that benefit from data. We contextualize recent results, showing that data-augmented models are a more powerful rote simulation. These results help us appreciate the success of traditional chemical theory and anticipate new models learned from experimental data. Not only can quantum computers provide data for such models, but they can also extend the class and power of models that utilize data in fundamental ways. These discussions culminate in speculation on new ways for quantum computing and chemistry to interact and our perspective on the eventual roles of quantum computers in the future of chemistry.},

This idea has resulted from the concept that most molecular solvents are homogeneous. In a deep eutectic solvent (DES), however, both components can be ionic or non-ionic, polar or non-polar. By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior. The liquids often contain significant short-length order, and preferential solvation of one component often occurs. The addition of small polar molecules such as water or alcohols results in non-homogeneous liquids, which have significantly decreased viscosity and increased ionic conductivity. Accordingly, the areas covered in this special issue focus on structure and dynamics, solvation, the mobility of charged species, and the ability to obtain controllable phase behavior by adding polar diluents or using hydrophobic DESs.},

Previous studies on shape dynamics have modeled biomolecular condensates as purely viscous, but recent data have shown them to be viscoelastic. Here, we present an exact analytical solution for the shape recovery dynamics of deformed biomolecular droplets. The shape recovery of viscous droplets has an exponential time dependence, with the time constant given by the “viscocapillary” ratio, i.e., viscosity over interfacial tension. In contrast, the shape recovery dynamics of viscoelastic droplets is multi-exponential, with shear relaxation yielding additional time constants. During shape recovery, viscoelastic droplets exhibit shear thickening (increase in apparent viscosity) at fast shear relaxation rates but shear thinning (decrease in apparent viscosity) at slow shear relaxation rates. These results highlight the importance of viscoelasticity and expand our understanding of how material properties affect condensate dynamics in general, including aging.},

The nucleotides and nucleotide analog drugs, which are triphosphorylated and negatively charged in the cell, approach the capsid via diffusion and are absorbed into it. In this study, we performed a long-time molecular dynamics calculation of the entire HBV capsid containing pregenome RNA to investigate the interactions between the capsid and negatively charged substances. Electric field analysis demonstrated that negatively charged substances can approach the HBV capsid by thermal motion, avoiding spikes. The substances then migrate all over the floor of the HBV capsid. Finally, they find pores through which they can pass through the HBV capsid shell. Free energy profiles were calculated along these pores for small ions to understand their permeability through the pores. Anions (Cl − ) showed higher free energy barriers than cations (Na + and K + ) through all pores, and the permeation rate of Cl − was eight times slower than that of K + or Na + . Furthermore, the ions were more stable in the capsid than in the bulk water. Thus, the HBV capsid exerts ion selectivity for uptake and provides an environment for ions, such as nucleotides and nucleotide analog drugs, to be stabilized within the capsid.},

In prior experimental work, systems of microscale plate-like particles in the presence of a nanoscale depletion agent have been shown to form polymer-like columnar chains; restoring depletion torques act to align lithographically-structured platelets within a chain orientationally about the chain’s axis. We consider depletion torques corresponding to parallel, face-to-face, near-contact pair interactions for complex-shaped, plate-like, prismatic lithographic particles in colloidal dispersions containing a spherical nanoscale depletion agent. We calculate depletion torques for a wide variety of such particles, including rotationally symmetric, asymmetric, achiral, chiral, and elongated particles. Moreover, we determine depletion torques between two non-parallel proximate square platelets connected by a lossless hinge along a common edge. Our investigations show that depletion torques can be tailored through lithographic or synthetic design of specific geometrical features in the shapes of particles.},

  abstract = {The interaction between two ligated nanoparticles depends on whether they are isolated or immersed in a liquid solvent. However, very little is known about the influence of solvent vapor on the interaction between two ligated nanoparticles. Recent experiments yield the surprising result that the cyclic exposure of solvent free suspended monolayers of dodecane thiol ligated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to water vapor and dry nitrogen generates reversible cyclic decreases and increases in Young’s modulus of the monolayer, implying corresponding cyclic changes in the AuNP–AuNP interaction. We examine how water vapor interacts with an isolated dodecane thiol dressed AuNP and how water vapor affects the interaction between a pair of nanoparticles, using all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations. We find that there is condensation of water molecules onto the ligand shell of an AuNP in the form of clusters of 100–2000 molecules that partially cover the shell, with most of the water in a few large clusters. A water cluster bridges the AuNPs, with a sensibly constant number of water molecules for AuNP–AuNP separations from the edge-to-edge contact up to center-to-center separations of 100 Å. The wet AuNP–AuNP interaction has a slightly deeper and wider asymmetric well than does the dry interaction, a change that is qualitatively consistent with that implied by the observed water vapor induced change in Young’s modulus of a monolayer of these AuNPs. We find that macroscopic analyses of water drop–deformable surface interactions and dynamics provide both guidance to understanding and qualitatively correct predictions of the phenomena observed in our simulations.},

  abstract = {A gradient in refractive index that is linear in magnitude with depth into the film is used to fit ellipsometric data for thin polymer films of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polystyrene (PS), and poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP). We find that the linear gradient model fits provide more physically realistic refractive index values for thin films compared with the commonly used homogeneous Cauchy layer model, addressing recent reports of physically unrealistic density increases. Counter to common expectations of a simple free volume correlation between density and dynamics, we find that the direction of refractive index (density) gradient indicates a higher density near the free surface, which we rationalize based on the observed faster free surface dynamics needed to create vapor deposited stable glasses with optimized denser molecular packings. The magnitude of refractive index gradient is observed to be three times larger for PMMA than for PS films, while P2VP films exhibit a more muted response possibly reflective of a decoupling in free surface and substrate dynamics in systems with strong interfacial interactions.},

  abstract = {Efforts to improve energy storage depend greatly on the development of efficient electrode materials. Recently, strain has been employed as an alternate approach to improve ion mobility. While lattice strain has been well-researched in catalytic applications, its effects on electrochemical energy storage are largely limited to computational studies due to complexities associated with strain control in nanomaterials as well as loss of strain due to the phase change of the active material during charging–discharging. In this work, we overcome these challenges and investigate the effects of strain on supercapacitor performance in Li-ion-based energy devices. We synthesize epitaxial Fe 3 O 4 @MnFe 2 O 4 (core@shell) nanoparticles with varying shell thickness to control the lattice strain. A narrow voltage window for electrochemical testing is used to limit the storage mechanism to lithiation–delithiation, preventing a phase change and maintaining structural strain. Cyclic voltammetry reveals a pseudocapacitive behavior and similar levels of surface charge storage in both strained - and unstrained -MnFe 2 O 4 samples; however, diffusive charge storage in the strained sample is twice as high as the unstrained sample. The strained -MnFe 2 O 4 electrode exceeds the performance of the unstrained -MnFe 2 O 4 electrode in energy density by ∼33\%, power density by ∼28\%, and specific capacitance by ∼48\%. Density functional theory shows lower formation energies for Li-intercalation and lower activation barrier for Li-diffusion in strained -MnFe 2 O 4 , corresponding to a threefold increase in the diffusion coefficient. The enhanced Li-ion diffusion rate in the strained-electrodes is further confirmed using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. This work provides a starting point to using strain engineering as a novel approach for designing high performance energy storage devices.},

  abstract = {Metal nanoparticles are excellent acoustic resonators and their vibrational spectroscopy has been widely investigated. However, the coupling between vibrational modes of different nanoparticles is less explored. For example, how the intervening medium affects the coupling strength is not known. Here, we investigate how different polymers affect coupling in Au nanoplate–polymer–Au nanoplate sandwich structures. The coupling between the breathing modes of the Au nanoplates was measured using single-particle pump–probe spectroscopy, and the polymer dependent coupling strength was determined experimentally. Analysis of the acoustic mode coupling gives the effective spring constant for the polymers. A relative motion mode was also observed for the stacked Au nanoplates. The frequency of this mode is strongly correlated with the coupling constant for the breathing modes. The breathing mode coupling and relative motion mode were analyzed using a coupled oscillator model. This model shows that both these effects can be described using the same spring constant for the polymer. Finally, we present a new type of mass balance using the strongly coupled resonators. We show that the resonators have a mass detection limit of a few femtograms. We envision that further understanding of the vibrational coupling in acoustic resonators will improve the coupling strength and expand their potential applications.},

In all the simulations, the systems had sufficient numbers of hyperspheres to capture the first coordination shells, and the larger simulations also included the complete second coordination shell. The equations of state, for densities spanning the fluid, metastable fluid, and solid regimes, were determined. Using molecular dynamics simulations with the hyperspheres tethered to lattice sites allowed the computation of the free energy for each of the crystal lattices relative to the fluid phase. From these free energies, the fluid–crystal coexistence region was determined for the E 6 , D 6 , and A 6 lattices. Pair correlation functions for all the examined states were computed. Interestingly, for all the states examined, the pair correlation functions displayed neither a split second peak nor a shoulder in the second peak. These behaviors have been previously used as a signature of the freezing of the fluid phase for hard hyperspheres in two to five dimensions.},

  abstract = {Despite the emergence of a molecular picture of urea’s protein unfolding mechanism in the past few decades, less is known about its action mechanism on protein aggregation. This is especially relevant for understanding the aggregation of amyloid proteins and peptides, implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. While urea is believed to weaken the hydrophobic effect, a picture consistent with the decrease in the excess chemical potential of sufficiently large alkanes, interactions with protein polar side chains and backbone atoms are also important. Here, we study, through molecular dynamics, the hydration and aggregation of several alkanes and amphiphilic “mutants” of n -dodecane, in an 8M aqueous urea solution, aiming at getting insight into urea’s mode of action. A size-dependent crossover temperature is found, above which the hydration of the alkanes is favored in the aqueous urea solution. The hydration of the alkanes is enhanced via entropy, with the enthalpy opposing hydration, consistent with experiments. The reason is that although solute–solvent interactions are favorable, these are overwhelmed by urea–water and urea–urea interactions. In contrast, water–water interactions and entropy are favored by a water depletion around the solute and a reduced water depletion around methane explains its exceptional solubility decrease. Furthermore, we show that while urea favors the hydration of n -dodecane and the amphiphilic mutants, it slightly enhances and reduces, respectively, the aggregation of the alkanes and the amphiphilic mutants. Thus, opposite to the common view, our results show that urea does not necessarily weaken hydrophobic interactions despite solvation being favored.},

Understanding the diffusion mechanisms at the atomic level is therefore a key issue in the study of the thermodynamic behavior of these systems and, in particular, of their evolution from out-of-equilibrium chemical ordering types often obtained in the experiments. Here, the diffusion is studied in the case of a single-atom impurity of Ag or Au moving within otherwise pure magic-size icosahedral clusters of Cu or Co by means of two different computational techniques, i.e., molecular dynamics and metadynamics. Our simulations reveal unexpected diffusion pathways, in which the displacement of the impurity is coupled with the creation of vacancies in the central part of the cluster. We show that the observed mechanism is quite different from the vacancy-mediated diffusion processes identified so far, and we demonstrate that it can be related to the presence of non-homogeneous compressive stress in the inner part of the icosahedral structure.},

In addition, the ionization energy of TmO was measured by the observation of a threshold for one-color two-photon ionization of this species, resulting in IE(TmO) = 6.56(2) eV. The observation of a sharp predissociation threshold for EuO was initially surprising because the half-filled 4f 7 subshell of Eu in its ground state generates fewer potential energy curves than in the other molecules we have studied by this method. The observation of a sharp predissociation threshold in YbO was even more surprising, given that the ground state of Yb is nondegenerate (4f 14 6s 2 , 1 S g ) and the lowest excited state of Yb is over 2 eV higher in energy. It is suggested that these molecules possess a high density of electronic states at the energy of the ground separated atom limit because ion-pair states drop below the ground limit, providing a sufficient electronic state density to allow predissociation to set in at the thermochemical threshold.},

The MCAI sections of the mass spectra for clusters containing 3700 and 26 000 atoms are dominated by Ar n+ with 7 ≤ n ≤ 9, extending to Ar 14+ . While the distributions of the MCAIs remain largely constant throughout the intensity range of the laser, the abundance of Ar + relative to the abundances of the MCAIs increases dramatically with increasing laser intensity. Consequently, exponential fittings of the yields result in a larger exponent for Ar + than for MCAIs, and the exponents of MCAIs with 2 ≤ n ≤ 8 are similar, with only slight variations for different charge states. The width of the arrival time and, hence, the corresponding kinetic energy of Ar + also increases with increasing laser intensities, while the width of the arrival time of MCAIs remains constant throughout the range of measurements.

The solutions for bulk transverse and longitudinal magnetization presented here are used to investigate the average behavior of the transverse and longitudinal magnetization in forming a steady state and are used to derive new expressions for the steady state longitudinal magnetization. These solutions can be applied to a noninteracting spin 1/2 ensemble undergoing free diffusion exposed to an arbitrary NMR pulse sequence containing arbitrary magnetic field gradient waveforms.

Among others, piperidine, pyrrolidine, and pyrroline radicals specifically synthesized for this study, along with some well-established commercially available nitroxides, were investigated. Isotope-substituted variants, some sterically shielded reduction-resistant nitroxides, and some biradicals were included in the measurements. The maximal achievable enhancement, E max , and the radio frequency power, P 1/2 , needed for reaching E max /2 were measured. Physico-chemical features such as molecular weight, spectral linewidth, heterocyclic structure, different types of substituents, deuteration, and 15 N-labeling as well as the difference between monoradicals and biradicals were investigated. For the unmodified nitroxide radicals, the E max values correlate with the molecular weight. The P 1/2 values correlate with the spectral linewidth and are additionally influenced by the type of substituents neighboring the nitroxide group. The nitroxide biradicals with high intramolecular spin–spin coupling show low performance. Nitroxides enriched with 15 N and/or 2 H afford significantly higher | E max | and require lower power to do so, compared to their unmodified counterparts containing at natural abundance predominantly 14 N and 1 H. The results allow for a correlation of chemical features with physical hyperpolarization-related properties and indicate that small nitroxides with narrow spectral lines have clear advantages for the use in Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. Perdeuteration and 15 N-labeling can be used to additionally boost the spin probe performance.},

  abstract = {We present a beam-scanning multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microspectroscopy system using parallel excitation and parallel detection schemes based on an elliptical focal spot, which enables highly efficient signal acquisition even for short exposures. The elliptical focal spot was used to simultaneously observe the CARS signals of an enlarged region and reduce the peak irradiance. The developed system realized an acquisition rate of 34 139 spectra/s and enabled ultrahigh-speed acquisition of a vibrational spectroscopic image, covering the fingerprint region of 930–1 830 cm −1 with 256 ( x ) × 256 ( y ) × 512 ( spectrum ) pixels in 1.92 s or with 128 ( x ) × 128 ( y ) × 256 ( spectrum ) pixels in 0.54 s. We demonstrated ultrahigh-speed hyperspectral imaging of a mixture of polymer beads in liquid linoleic acid and living adipocytes using the developed system. All of the present demonstrations were performed with a low-peak irradiance excitation of ∼19 GW/cm 2 , which has been reported in previous studies to cause less photodamage to living cells. The label-free and ultrahigh-speed identification and visualization of various molecules made possible by the present system will accelerate the development of practical live-cell investigation.},

  abstract = {Modeling linear absorption spectra of solvated chromophores is highly challenging as contributions are present both from coupling of the electronic states to nuclear vibrations and from solute–solvent interactions. In systems where excited states intersect in the Condon region, significant non-adiabatic contributions to absorption line shapes can also be observed. Here, we introduce a robust approach to model linear absorption spectra accounting for both environmental and non-adiabatic effects from first principles. This model parameterizes a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) Hamiltonian directly from energy gap fluctuations calculated along molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the chromophore in solution, accounting for both anharmonicity in the potential and direct solute–solvent interactions. The resulting system dynamics described by the LVC Hamiltonian are solved exactly using the thermalized time-evolving density operator with orthogonal polynomials algorithm (T-TEDOPA). The approach is applied to the linear absorption spectrum of methylene blue in water. We show that the strong shoulder in the experimental spectrum is caused by vibrationally driven population transfer between the bright S 1 and the dark S 2 states. The treatment of the solvent environment is one of many factors that strongly influence the population transfer and line shape; accurate modeling can only be achieved through the use of explicit quantum mechanical solvation. The efficiency of T-TEDOPA, combined with LVC Hamiltonian parameterizations from MD, leads to an attractive method for describing a large variety of systems in complex environments from first principles.},

In this setup, the time scale problem is overcome by using enhanced sampling methods, in casu metadynamics, whereas the impact of finite size effects can be naturally circumvented by reconstructing the free energy surface from an appropriate ensemble. Approximations from classical nucleation theory are avoided.

  abstract = {Determining the 3D orientation of a single molecule or particle, encoded in its polar and azimuthal angles, is of interest for a variety of fields, being relevant to a range of questions in elementary chemical reactivity, biomolecular motors, and nanorheology. A popular experimental method, known as division-of-amplitude polarimetry, for determining the real-time orientation of a single particle is to split the emitted/scattered light into multiple polarizations and to measure the light intensity using point detectors at these polarizations during a time interval Δ t . Here, we derive the Cramér–Rao lower bounds for this method from the perspective of information theory in the cases of utilizing a chromophore or a scattering particle as a 3D orientation probe. Such Cramér–Rao lower bounds are new for using this experimental method to measure the full 3D orientation in both the scattering case and the fluorescence case. These results show that, for a scatterer, the information content of one photon is 1.16 deg −2 in the polar and 58.71 deg −2 in the azimuthal angles, respectively. For a chromophore, the information content of one photon is 2.54 deg −2 in the polar and 80.29 deg −2 in the azimuthal angles. In addition, the Cramér–Rao lower bound scales with the square root of the total signal photons. To determine orientation to an uncertainty of one degree requires 7.40 × 10 4 and 2.34 × 10 3 photons for the polar and the azimuthal angles, respectively, for fluorescence, whereas it takes 1.62 × 10 5 and 3.20 × 10 3 photons for scattering. This work provides experimentalists new guidelines by which future experiments can be designed and interpreted.},

  abstract = {Several pool-based active learning (AL) algorithms were employed to model potential-energy surfaces (PESs) with a minimum number of electronic structure calculations. Theoretical and empirical results suggest that superior strategies can be obtained by sampling molecular structures corresponding to large uncertainties in their predictions while at the same time not deviating much from the true distribution of the data. To model PESs in an AL framework, we propose to use a regression version of stochastic query by forest, a hybrid method that samples points corresponding to large uncertainties while avoiding collecting too many points from sparse regions of space. The algorithm is implemented with decision trees that come with relatively small computational costs. We empirically show that this algorithm requires around half the data to converge to the same accuracy in comparison to the uncertainty-based query-by-committee algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm is fully automatic and does not require any prior knowledge of the PES. Simulations on a 6D PES of pyrrole(H 2 O) show that &lt;15 000 configurations are enough to build a PES with a generalization error of 16 cm −1 , whereas the final model with around 50 000 configurations has a generalization error of 11 cm −1 .},

  abstract = {Lattice models are a useful tool to simulate the kinetics of surface reactions. Since it is expensive to propagate the probabilities of the entire lattice configurations, it is practical to consider the occupation probabilities of a typical site or a cluster of sites instead. This amounts to a moment closure approximation of the chemical master equation. Unfortunately, simple closures, such as the mean-field and the pair approximation (PA), exhibit weaknesses in systems with significant long-range correlation. In this paper, we show that machine learning (ML) can be used to construct accurate moment closures in chemical kinetics using the lattice Lotka–Volterra model as a model system. We trained feedforward neural networks on kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) results at select values of rate constants and initial conditions. Given the same level of input as PA, the ML moment closure (MLMC) gave accurate predictions of the instantaneous three-site occupation probabilities. Solving the kinetic equations in conjunction with MLMC gave drastic improvements in the simulated dynamics and descriptions of the dynamical regimes throughout the parameter space. In this way, MLMC is a promising tool to interpolate KMC simulations or construct pretrained closures that would enable researchers to extract useful insight at a fraction of the computational cost.},

  abstract = {Double ionization (DI) is a fundamental process that despite its apparent simplicity provides rich opportunities for probing and controlling the electronic motion. Even for the simplest multielectron atom, helium, new DI mechanisms are still being found. To first order in the field strength, a strong external field doubly ionizes the electrons in helium such that they are ejected into the same direction (front-to-back motion). The ejection into opposite directions (back-to-back motion) cannot be described to first order, making it a challenging target for control. Here, we address this challenge and optimize the field with the objective of back-to-back double ionization using a (1 + 1)-dimensional model. The optimization is performed using four different control procedures: (1) short-time control, (2) derivative-free optimization of basis expansions of the field, (3) the Krotov method, and (4) control of the classical equations of motion. All four procedures lead to fields with dominant back-to-back motion. All the fields obtained exploit essentially the same two-step mechanism leading to back-to-back motion: first, the electrons are displaced by the field into the same direction. Second, after the field turns off, the nuclear attraction and the electron–electron repulsion combine to generate the final motion into opposite directions for each electron. By performing quasi-classical calculations, we confirm that this mechanism is essentially classical.},

Switching is performed along a fictitious classical degree of freedom whose value determines the mixing ratio of the two potentials on a time scale determined by its associated mass. We propose to choose this associated fictitious mass adaptively so as to ensure a constant time scale for all switching processes. For different model systems, including a harmonic oscillator and a Lennard-Jones fluid, we investigate the window of switching time scales that guarantees the conservation of the extended Hamiltonian for a large number of switching events. The methodology is first applied in the microcanonical ensemble and then generalized to the canonical ensemble using a Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat. It is shown that the method is stable for thousands of consecutive switching events during a single simulation, with constant temperature and a conserved extended Hamiltonian. A slight modification of the original Hamiltonian is introduced to avoid accumulation of small numerical errors incurred after each switching process.},

  abstract = {Heavy-atom alkaline earth monofluoride molecules are considered as prospective systems to study spatial parity or spatial parity and time-reversal symmetry violating effects such as the nuclear anapole moment or the electron electric dipole moment. A comprehensive and highly accurate theoretical study of the electronic structure properties and transition energies in such systems can simplify the preparation and interpretation of the experiments. However, almost no attempts to calculate quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects’ contribution into characteristics of these neutral heavy-atom molecules have been performed. Recently, we have formulated and implemented such an approach to calculate QED contributions to transition energies of molecules [L. V. Skripnikov, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 201101 (2021)]. In this paper, we perform a benchmark theoretical study of the transition energies in the Ba + cation and BaF molecule. The deviation of the calculated values from the experimental ones is of the order 10 cm −1 and is more than an order of magnitude better than the “chemical accuracy,” 350 cm −1 . The achievement of such an agreement has been provided, in particular, by the inclusion of the QED effects. The latter appeared to be not less important than the high-order correlation effects beyond the coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple cluster amplitude level. We compare the role of QED effects for transition energies with heavier molecules—RaF and E120F, where E120 is the superheavy Z = 120 homolog of Ra.},

  abstract = {Proteins achieve their functional, active, and operative three dimensional native structures by overcoming the possibility of being trapped in non-native energy minima present in the energy landscape. The enormous and intricate interactions that play an important role in protein folding also determine the stability of the proteins. The large number of stabilizing/destabilizing interactions makes proteins to be only marginally stable as compared to the other competing structures. Therefore, there are some possibilities that they become trapped in the non-native conformations and thus get misfolded. These misfolded proteins lead to several debilitating diseases. This work performs a comparative study of some existing foldability criteria in the computational design of misfold resistant protein sequences based on self-consistent mean field theory. The foldability criteria selected for this study are E f , Δ, and Φ that are commonly used in protein design procedures to determine the most efficient foldability criterion for the design of misfolding resistant proteins. The results suggest that the foldability criterion Δ is significantly better in designing a funnel energy landscape stabilizing the target state. The results also suggest that inclusion of negative design features is important for designing misfolding resistant proteins, but more information about the non-native conformations in terms of Φ leads to worse results compared to even simple positive design. The sequences designed using Δ show better resistance to misfolding in the Monte Carlo simulations performed in the study.},

Different ways of deriving this factor are evaluated for a simple one-parameter LH based on the local density approximation. While the direct derivation from the LH NDC term fails due to known deficiencies, hybrid approaches, where the factor is determined from the B13 NDC term as in KP16/B13 itself, provide remarkable improvements. In particular, a modified B13 NDC expression using Patra’s exchange-hole curvature showed promising results. When applied to the simple LH as a first attempt, it reduces atomic fractional-spin errors and deficiencies of spin-restricted bond dissociation curves to a similar extent as the KP16/B13 functional itself while maintaining the good accuracy of the underlying LH for atomization energies and reaction barriers in weakly correlated situations. The performance of different NDC expressions in deriving strong-correlation corrections is analyzed, and areas for further improvements of strong-correlation corrected LHs and related approaches are identified.

  abstract = {Finite Markov chains, memoryless random walks on complex networks, appear commonly as models for stochastic dynamics in condensed matter physics, biophysics, ecology, epidemiology, economics, and elsewhere. Here, we review exact numerical methods for the analysis of arbitrary discrete- and continuous-time Markovian networks. We focus on numerically stable methods that are required to treat nearly reducible Markov chains, which exhibit a separation of characteristic timescales and are therefore ill-conditioned. In this metastable regime, dense linear algebra methods are afflicted by propagation of error in the finite precision arithmetic, and the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate paths is unfeasibly inefficient. Furthermore, iterative eigendecomposition methods fail to converge without the use of nontrivial and system-specific preconditioning techniques. An alternative approach is provided by state reduction procedures, which do not require additional a priori knowledge of the Markov chain. Macroscopic dynamical quantities, such as moments of the first passage time distribution for a transition to an absorbing state, and microscopic properties, such as the stationary, committor, and visitation probabilities for nodes, can be computed robustly using state reduction algorithms. The related kinetic path sampling algorithm allows for efficient sampling of trajectories on a nearly reducible Markov chain. Thus, all of the information required to determine the kinetically relevant transition mechanisms, and to identify the states that have a dominant effect on the global dynamics, can be computed reliably even for computationally challenging models. Rare events are a ubiquitous feature of realistic dynamical systems, and so the methods described herein are valuable in many practical applications.},

  abstract = {We investigate the conformational properties of “ideal” nanogel particles having a lattice network topology by molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the influence of polymer topology on the solution properties of this type of branched molecular architecture. In particular, we calculate the mass scaling of the radius of gyration ( R g ), the hydrodynamic radius, as well as the intrinsic viscosity with the variation of the degree of branching, the length of the chains between the branched points, and the average mesh size within these nanogel particles under good solvent conditions. We find competing trends between the molecular characteristics, where an increase in mesh size or degree of branching results in the emergence of particle-like characteristics, while an increase in the chain length enhances linear polymer-like characteristics. This crossover between these limiting behaviors is also apparent in our calculation of the form factor, P ( q ), for these structures. Specifically, a primary scattering peak emerges, characterizing the overall nanogel particle size. Moreover, a distinct power-law regime emerges in P ( q ) at length scales larger than the chain size but smaller than R g of the nanogel particle, and the R g mass scaling exponent progressively approaches zero as the mesh size increases, the same scaling as for an infinite network of Gaussian chains. The “fuzzy sphere” model does not capture this feature, and we propose an extension to this popular model. These structural features become more pronounced for values of molecular parameters that enhance the localization of the branching segments within the nanogel particle.},

  abstract = {Simulations of flow fields around microscopic objects typically require methods that both solve the Navier–Stokes equations and also include thermal fluctuations. One such method popular in the field of soft-matter physics is the particle-based simulation method of multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD). However, in contrast to the typically incompressible real fluid, the fluid of the traditional MPCD methods obeys the ideal-gas equation of state. This can be problematic because most fluid properties strongly depend on the fluid density. In a recent article, we proposed an extended MPCD algorithm and derived its non-ideal equation of state and an expression for the viscosity. In the present work, we demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency for the simulations of the flow fields of single squirmers and of the collective dynamics of squirmer rods. We use two exemplary squirmer-rod systems for which we compare the outcome of the extended MPCD method to the well-established MPCD version with an Andersen thermostat. First, we explicitly demonstrate the reduced compressibility of the MPCD fluid in a cluster of squirmer rods. Second, for shorter rods, we show the interesting result that in simulations with the extended MPCD method, dynamic swarms are more pronounced and have a higher polar order. Finally, we present a thorough study of the state diagram of squirmer rods moving in the center plane of a Hele-Shaw geometry. From a small to large aspect ratio and density, we observe a disordered state, dynamic swarms, a single swarm, and a jammed cluster, which we characterize accordingly.},

  abstract = {The electrostatic screening length predicted by Debye–Hückel theory decreases with increasing ionic strength, but recent experiments have found that the screening length can instead increase in concentrated electrolytes. This phenomenon, referred to as underscreening, is believed to result from ion–ion correlations and short-range forces such as excluded volume interactions among ions. We use Brownian Dynamics to simulate a version of the Restrictive Primitive Model for electrolytes over a wide range of ion concentrations, ionic strengths, and ion excluded volume radii for binary electrolytes. We measure the decay of the charge–charge correlation among ions in the bulk and compare it against scaling trends found experimentally and determined in certain weak coupling theories of ion–ion correlation. Moreover, we find that additional large scale ion structures emerge at high concentrations. In this regime, the frequency of oscillations computed from the charge–charge correlation function is not dominated by electrostatic interactions but rather by excluded volume interactions and with oscillation periods on the order of the ion diameter. We also find the nearest neighbor correlation of ions sharing the same charge transitions from negative at small concentrations to positive at high concentrations, representing the formation of small, like-charge ion clusters. We conclude that the increase in local charge density due to the formation of these clusters and the topological constraints of macroscopic charged surfaces can help explain the degree of underscreening observed experimentally.},

Interestingly, we find that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity decreases with the increasing rotation rate of the electrode. As we increase the rotation (mass transport) rate, the locally generated hydroxyl ions (2H 2 O +2e − → H 2 + 2OH − ) are transported away from the electrode surface at an accelerated rate. This results in decreasing local pH and, because of the need to satisfy local electroneutrality, decreasing near-surface cation concentration. This decrease in the near-surface cation concentration results in the suppression of HER. This is because the cations near the surface play a central role in stabilizing the transition state for the rate determining Volmer step (*H–OH δ− –cat + ). Furthermore, we present a detailed analytical model that qualitatively captures the observed mass transport dependence of HER solely based on the principle of electroneutrality. Finally, we also correlate the cation identity dependence of HER on gold (Li + &lt; Na + &lt; K + ) to the changes in the effective concentration of the cations in the double layer with the changes in their solvation energy.},

Polymeric MIECs are attractive from the standpoint that their structure can be controlled and anticipated to have mechanically robust properties. Here, we prepare and investigate conjugated copolymers containing thiophene and selenophene repeat units and their homopolymer counterparts. Specifically, thiophene bearing a triethylene glycol (EG 3 ) side chain was polymerized and copolymerized with dodecyl thiophene/selenophene monomers. The synthesis leads to a class of copolymers that contain either S or Se and are blocky in nature. The Li-ion conductivity of ionically doped copolymers, P3DDT- s -P3(EG 3 )T and P3DDS- s -P3(EG 3 )T (9.7 × 10 −6 and 8.2 × 10 −6 S/cm, respectively), was 3–4 fold higher than that of the ionically doped constituent homopolymer, P3(EG 3 )T (2.2 × 10 −6 S/cm), at ambient conditions. The electronic conductivity of the oxidatively doped copolymers was significantly higher than that of the constituent homopolymer P3(EG 3 )T , and most notably, P3DDS- s -P3(EG 3 )T reached ∼7 S/cm, which is the same order of magnitude as poly(3-dodecylthiophene) and poly(3-dodecylselenophene), which are the highest oxidatively doped conductors based on control experiments. Our findings provide implications for designing new MIECs based on copolymerization and the incorporation of heavy atom heterocycles.},

However, most of the previous simulations are related to the key intermediates of *COOH and *CO using the computational hydrogen electrode approach under vacuum conditions, and the details of the CO 2 activation are usually ignored due to the model simplicity. Here, we study the CO 2 activation at the Au–water interfaces by considering the dynamics of an explicit water solvent, where both regular ab initio molecular dynamics and constrained ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to explore the CO 2 adsorption/desorption reactions from the atomic level. By introducing K + cations into Au(110)–water interfacial models, an electrochemical environment under reducing potentials is constructed, where the reaction free energy (0.26 eV) and activation energy (0.61 eV) are obtained for CO 2 adsorption based on the thermodynamic integration. Moreover, the Bader charge analysis demonstrates that CO 2 adsorption is activated by the first-electron transfer, forming the adsorbed CO 2 − anion initiating the overall catalytic reaction.},

In this paper, we analyze the structure and dynamics of electrolyte molecules in multi-component electrolyte with varying species compositions combinatorially paired with four different graphitic surfaces terminated with hydrogen, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl to explore the interplay between surface chemistry and electrolyte dynamics at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Addition of dimethyl carbonate and fluoroethylene carbonate brought substantial changes in the ethylene carbonate (EC) and LiPF 6 surface population density for hydroxyl and carbonyl surfaces. Strong density oscillation and drastic slowing of the dynamics of the electrolyte molecules at the interface are reported for all the systems. While these observations are universal, carboxyl surfaces have the strongest local and long-range effects. Characterization of the average dipole direction at the interface shows strong orientational preferences of ethylene carbonate molecules. EC molecules are preferred to be oriented either almost parallel or perpendicular to the hydroxyl surface, are tilted between parallel and perpendicular with a higher angle of incidence of the dipole vs surface normal on the carbonyl surface than on the hydroxyl surface, and are oriented perpendicularly against the carboxyl surface. These differences highlight the significant effect of graphite surface termination on the dynamics of the electrolytes and provide insight into the complex interplays between electrolyte species and graphite anode in LIBs.},

Within a simple description, which is based on the eigenstates of the aggregate, absorption spectra are calculated for the near field created by this dipole. We find that the spatial patterns of the spectra have a strong dependence on the orientation of this tip-dipole, which can be understood by considering three basic functions that only depend on the arrangement of the aggregate and the molecule tip distance, but not on the orientation of the tip-dipole. This allows direct access to spatial dependence of the aggregate eigenstates. For the important cases of one- and two-dimensional systems with parallel molecules, we discuss these spectra in detail.

Here, we report that the CMT vibrational probe reveals solvent dependences in both the spectral diffusion and the IVR time scales, where each slows with increased alkyl chain length. In order to assess the degree to which solute–solvent interactions can be correlated with bulk solvent properties, we compared our results with low-frequency dynamics obtained from optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectroscopy—performed by others—on the same nitrile solvent series. We find excellent correlation between our spectral diffusion results and the orientational dynamics time scales from OKE. We also find a correlation between our IVR time scales and the amplitudes of the low-frequency spectral densities evaluated at the 90-cm −1 energy difference, corresponding to the gap between the two strong vibrational modes of the carbonyl probe. 2D-IR and OKE provide complementary perspectives on condensed phase dynamics, and these findings provide experimental evidence that at least at the level of dynamical correlations, some aspects of a solute vibrational dynamics can be inferred from properties of the solvent.},

  abstract = {Among different thermodynamic properties of liquids, the entropy is one of the hardest quantities to estimate. Therefore, the development of models allowing accurate estimations of the entropy for different mechanisms of interatomic interactions represents an important problem. Here, we propose a method for estimating the excess entropy of simple liquids not too far from the liquid–solid phase transition. The method represents a variant of cell theory, which particularly emphasizes relations between liquid state thermodynamics and collective modes properties. The method is applied to calculate the excess entropy of inverse-power-law fluids with ∝ r − n repulsive interactions. The covered range of potential softness is extremely wide, including the very soft Coulomb ( n = 1) case, much steeper n = 6 and n = 12 cases, and the opposite hard-sphere interaction limit ( n = ∞ ). An overall reasonably good agreement between the method’s outcome and existing “exact” results is documented at sufficiently high fluid densities. Its applicability condition can be conveniently formulated in terms of the excess entropy itself. The method is also applied to the Lennard-Jones potential but demonstrates considerably lower accuracy in this case. Our results should be relevant to a broad range of liquid systems that can be described with isotropic repulsive interactions, including liquid metals, macromolecular systems, globular proteins, and colloidal suspensions.},

Such calculations are important for planning and interpretation of possible future experiments aimed at stringent tests of the standard model through the observation of PV effects in NSR spectroscopy. An exploratory application of this theory to the chiral molecules H 2 X 2 ( X = 17 O, 33 S, 77 Se, 125 Te, and 209 Po) illustrates the dramatic effect of relativity on these contributions. In particular, spin-free and spin–orbit effects are even of opposite signs for some dihedral angles, and the latter fully dominate for the heavier nuclei.

In the case of tryptophan, the tryptophan radical that is produced by electron ejection also plays an important role in numerous redox reactions in biology, although studies of its ultrafast molecular dynamics are limited. Here, we employ femtosecond optical pump–probe spectroscopy to elucidate the ultrafast structural rearrangement dynamics that accompany the photodetachment of the aqueous tryptophan anion by intense, ∼5-fs laser pulses. The observed vibrational wave packet dynamics, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, identify the vibrational modes of the tryptophan radical, which participate in structural rearrangement upon photodetachment. Aside from intramolecular vibrational modes, our results also point to the involvement of intermolecular modes that drive solvent reorganization about the N–H moiety of the indole sidechain. Our study offers new insight into the ultrafast molecular dynamics of ionized biomolecules and suggests that the present experimental approach can be extended to investigate the photoionization- or photodetachment-induced structural dynamics of larger biomolecules.},

  abstract = {Exciton diffusion plays an important role in many opto-electronic processes and phenomena. Understanding the interplay of intermolecular coupling, static energetic disorder, and dephasing caused by environmental fluctuations (dynamic disorder) is crucial to optimize exciton diffusion under various physical conditions. We report on a systematic analysis of the exciton diffusion constant in linear aggregates using the Haken–Strobl–Reineker model to describe this interplay. We numerically investigate the static-disorder scaling of (i) the diffusion constant in the limit of small dephasing rate, (ii) the dephasing rate at which the diffusion is optimized, and (iii) the value of the diffusion constant at the optimal dephasing rate. Three scaling regimes are found, associated with, respectively, fully delocalized exciton states (finite-size effects), weakly localized states, and strongly localized states. The scaling powers agree well with analytically estimated ones. In particular, in the weakly localized regime, the numerical results corroborate the so-called quantum Goldilocks principle to find the optimal dephasing rate and maximum diffusion constant as a function of static disorder, while in the strong-localization regime, these quantities can be derived fully analytically.},

  abstract = {The deformation of clay minerals is an important phenomenon that is relevant to many problems, particularly those that occur in subsurface geological formations. The salinity of the formations and external shear stress applied to them are two important factors that contribute to the deformation of such porous media. To gain a deeper understanding of such phenomena, we have carried out extensive molecular dynamics simulations using the Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) structure as the model of clay minerals and have studied the effect of salt concentration on its swelling. As the NaCl concentration increases, so also does the basal spacing. We demonstrate the effect of the coupling between the applied shear stress and NaCl salinity on the swelling behavior of Na-MMT, namely, deformation of the interlayer space that results in swelling. According to the results, the extent of Na-MMT deformation depends on both the brine salinity and the shear rate.},

  abstract = {Collisional data for the excitation of NH by H 2 are key to accurately derive the NH abundance in astrophysical media. We present a new four-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) for the NH–H 2 van der Waals complex. The ab initio calculations of the PES were carried out using the explicitly correlated partially spin-restricted coupled cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [RCCSD(T)-F12a] with the augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence triple zeta basis set. The PES was represented by an angular expansion in terms of coupled spherical harmonics. The global minimum corresponds to the linear structure with a well depth D e = 149.10 cm −1 . The calculated dissociation energy D 0 is found to be 30.55 and 22.11 cm −1 for ortho -H 2 and para -H 2 complexes, respectively. These results are in agreement with the experimental values. Then, we perform quantum close-coupling calculations of the fine structure resolved excitation cross sections of NH induced by collisions with ortho -H 2 and para -H 2 for collisional energies up to 500 cm −1 . We find strong differences between collisions induced by ortho -H 2 and para -H 2 . Propensity rules are discussed. The cross sections are larger for fine structure conserving transitions than for fine structure changing ones, as predicted by theory. These new results should help in interpreting NH interstellar spectra and better constrain the abundance of NH in interstellar molecular clouds.},

  abstract = {Within periodic boundary conditions, the traditional quantum mechanical position operator is ill-defined, necessitating the use of alternative methods, most commonly the Berry phase formulation in the modern theory of polarization. Since any information about local properties is lost in this change of framework, the Berry phase formulation can only determine the total electric polarization of a system. Previous approaches toward recovering local electric dipole moments have been based on applying the conventional dipole moment operator to the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs). Recently, another approach to local electric dipole moments has been demonstrated in the field of subsystem density functional theory (DFT) embedding. We demonstrate in this work that this approach, aside from its use in ground state DFT-based molecular dynamics, can also be applied to obtain electric dipole moments during real-time propagated time-dependent DFT (RT-TDDFT). Moreover, we present an analogous approach to obtain local electric dipole moments from MLWFs, which enables subsystem analysis in cases where DFT embedding is not applicable. The techniques were implemented in the quantum chemistry software CP2K for the mixed Gaussian and plane wave method and applied to cis -diimide and water in the gas phase, cis -diimide in aqueous solution, and a liquid mixture of dimethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate to obtain absorption and infrared spectra decomposed into localized subsystem contributions.},

  abstract = {Systematic reduction of the dimensionality is highly demanded in making a comprehensive interpretation of experimental and simulation data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for reducing the dimensionality of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, which assists our understanding of MD simulation data. Here, we propose an approach that incorporates time dependence in the PCA algorithm. In the standard PCA, the eigenvectors obtained by diagonalizing the covariance matrix are time independent . In contrast, they are functions of time in our new approach, and their time evolution is implemented in the framework of Car–Parrinello or Born–Oppenheimer type adiabatic dynamics. Thanks to the time dependence, each of the step-by-step structural changes or intermittent collective fluctuations is clearly identified, which are often keys to provoking a drastic structural transformation but are easily masked in the standard PCA. The time dependence also allows for reoptimization of the principal components (PCs) according to the structural development, which can be exploited for enhanced sampling in MD simulations. The present approach is applied to phase transitions of a water model and conformational changes of a coarse-grained protein model. In the former, collective dynamics associated with the dihedral-motion in the tetrahedral network structure is found to play a key role in crystallization. In the latter, various conformations of the protein model were successfully sampled by enhancing structural fluctuation along the periodically optimized PC. Both applications clearly demonstrate the virtue of the new approach, which we refer to as time-dependent PCA.},

  abstract = {Equilibrium phase instability of colloids is robustly predicted by the Vliegenthart–Lekkerkerker (VL) critical value of the second virial efficient, but no such general criterion has been established for suspensions undergoing flow. A transition from positive to negative osmotic pressure is one mechanical hallmark of a change in phase stability in suspensions and provides a natural extension of the equilibrium osmotic pressure encoded in the second virial coefficient. Here, we propose to study the non-Newtonian rheology of an attractive colloidal suspension using the active microrheology framework as a model for focusing on the pair trajectories that underlie flow stability. We formulate and solve a Smoluchowski relation to understand the interplay between attractions, hydrodynamics, Brownian motion, and flow on particle microstructure in a semi-dilute suspension and utilize the results to study the viscosity and particle-phase osmotic pressure. We find that an interplay between attractions and hydrodynamics leads to dramatic changes in the nonequilibrium microstructure, which produces a two-stage flow-thinning of viscosity and leads to pronounced flow-induced negative osmotic pressure. We summarize these findings with an osmotic pressure heat map that predicts where hydrodynamic enhancement of attractive bonds encourages flow-induced aggregation or phase separation. We identify a critical isobar—a flow-induced critical pressure consistent with phase instability and a nonequilibrium extension of the VL criterion.},

An important aspect of this problem is correctly reproducing the Pauli potential, the response of the Pauli kinetic energy to a change in density. We analyze the behavior of the Pauli potential of non-relativistic neutral atoms under Lieb–Simon scaling—the process of taking nuclear charge and particle number to infinity, in which the kinetic energy tends to the Thomas–Fermi limit. We do this by mathematical analysis of the near-nuclear region and by calculating the exact orbital-dependent Pauli potential using the approach of Levy and Ouyang for closed-shell atoms out to element Z = 976. In rough analogy to Lieb and Simon’s own findings for the charge density, we find that the potential does not converge smoothly to the Thomas–Fermi limit on a point-by-point basis but separates into several distinct regions of behavior. Near the nucleus, the potential approaches a constant given by the difference in energy between the lowest and highest occupied eigenvalues. We discover a transition region in the outer core where the potential deviates unexpectedly and predictably from both the Thomas–Fermi potential and the gradient expansion correction to it. These results may provide insight into the semi-classical description of Pauli statistics and new constraints to aid the improvement of orbital-free density functional theory functionals.},

  abstract = {Recently, a new type of orbital-dependent functional for the Kohn–Sham (KS) correlation energy, σ -functionals, was introduced. Technically, σ -functionals are closely related to the well-known direct random phase approximation (dRPA). Within the dRPA, a function of the eigenvalues σ of the frequency-dependent KS response function is integrated over purely imaginary frequencies. In σ -functionals, this function is replaced by one that is optimized with respect to reference sets of atomization, reaction, transition state, and non-covalent interaction energies. The previously introduced σ -functional uses input orbitals and eigenvalues from KS calculations with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). Here, σ -functionals using input orbitals and eigenvalues from the meta-GGA TPSS and the hybrid-functionals PBE0 and B3LYP are presented and tested. The number of reference sets taken into account in the optimization of the σ -functionals is larger than in the first PBE based σ -functional and includes sets with 3d-transition metal compounds. Therefore, also a reparameterized PBE based σ -functional is introduced. The σ -functionals based on PBE0 and B3LYP orbitals and eigenvalues reach chemical accuracy for main group chemistry. For the 10 966 reactions from the highly accurate W4-11RE reference set, the B3LYP based σ -functional exhibits a mean average deviation of 1.03 kcal/mol compared to 1.08 kcal/mol for the coupled cluster singles doubles perturbative triples method if the same valence quadruple zeta basis set is used. For 3d-transition metal chemistry, accuracies of about 2 kcal/mol are reached. The computational effort for the post-self-consistent evaluation of the σ -functional is lower than that of a preceding PBE0 or B3LYP calculation for typical systems.},

Non-interacting fermionic and bosonic systems share the same one-body density dynamics when evolving from the same initial many-body state. The MM classical mapping is exact for non-interacting bosons, and therefore, it yields the exact time-dependent one-body density for non-interacting fermions as well. Starting from this observation, the MM mapping is compared to different mappings specific for fermionic systems, namely, the spin mapping with and without including a Jordan–Wigner transformation and the Li–Miller mapping (LMM). For non-interacting systems, the inclusion of fermionic anti-symmetry through the Jordan–Wigner transform does not lead to any improvement in the performance of the mappings, and instead, it worsens the classical description. For an interacting impurity model and for models of excitonic energy transfer, the MM and LMM mappings perform similarly, and in some cases, the former outperforms the latter when compared to a full quantum description. The classical mappings are able to capture interference effects, both constructive and destructive, that originate from equivalent energy transfer pathways in the models.},

This equivalence allows for a transfer of bosonic many-body MCTDH as introduced by Wang and Thoss to the finite temperature framework of thermal quasi-particle TFD. As an application, we study temperature effects on the ultrafast internal conversion dynamics in pyrazine. We show that finite temperature effects can be efficiently accounted for in the construction of multilayer expansions of thermofield states in the framework presented herein.

Addressing transport properties, for instance calculating thermal conductivity from PIMC, however, is substantially more difficult. Although correlation functions of current operators can be determined by PIMC from analytic continuation on the imaginary time axis, Bayesian methods are usually employed for the numerical inversion back to real time response functions. This task not only strongly relies on the accuracy of the PIMC data but also introduces noticeable dependence on the model used for the inversion. Here, we address both difficulties with care. In particular, we first devise improved estimators for current correlations, which substantially reduce the variance of the PIMC data. Next, we provide a neat statistical approach to the inversion problem, blending into a fresh workflow the classical stochastic maximum entropy method together with recent notions borrowed from statistical learning theory. We test our ideas on a single harmonic oscillator and a collection of oscillators with a continuous distribution of frequencies and provide indications of the performance of our method in the case of a particle in a double well potential. This work establishes solid grounds for an unbiased, fully quantum mechanical calculation of transport properties in solids.},

  abstract = {A framework for performant Brownian Dynamics (BD) many-body simulations with adaptive timestepping is presented. Contrary to the Euler–Maruyama scheme in common non-adaptive BD, we employ an embedded Heun–Euler integrator for the propagation of the overdamped coupled Langevin equations of motion. This enables the derivation of a local error estimate and the formulation of criteria for the acceptance or rejection of trial steps and for the control of optimal stepsize. Introducing erroneous bias in the random forces is avoided by rejection sampling with memory due to Rackauckas and Nie, which makes use of the Brownian bridge theorem and guarantees the correct generation of a specified random process even when rejecting trial steps. For test cases of Lennard-Jones fluids in bulk and in confinement, it is shown that adaptive BD solves performance and stability issues of conventional BD, already outperforming the latter even in standard situations. We expect this novel computational approach to BD to be especially helpful in long-time simulations of complex systems, e.g., in non-equilibrium, where concurrent slow and fast processes occur.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of electron–hole recombination in pristine and defect-containing monolayer black phosphorus (ML-BP) has been studied computationally by several groups relying on the one-particle description of electronic excited states. Our recent developments enabled a more sophisticated and accurate treatment of excited states dynamics in systems with pronounced excitonic effects, including 2D materials such as ML-BP. In this work, I present a comprehensive characterization of optoelectronic properties and nonadiabatic dynamics of the ground state recovery in pristine and divacancy-containing ML-BP, relying on the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory description of excited states combined with several trajectory surface hopping methodologies and decoherence correction schemes. This work presents a revision and new implementation of the decoherence-induced surface hopping methodology. Several popular algorithms for nonadiabatic dynamics algorithms are assessed. The kinetics of nonradiative relaxation of lower-lying excited states in ML-BP systems is revised considering the new methodological developments. A general mechanism that explains the sensitivity of the nonradiative dynamics to the presence of divacancy defect in ML-BP is proposed. According to this mechanism, the excited states’ relaxation may be inhibited by the presence of energetically close higher-energy states if electronic decoherence is present in the system.},

We consider trajectories that are conditioned to transition between regions of configuration space in finite time, such as those relevant in the study of reactive events, and trajectories exhibiting rare fluctuations of time-integrated quantities in the long time limit, such as those relevant in the calculation of large deviation functions. In both cases, reinforcement learning techniques are used to optimize an added force that minimizes the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the conditioned trajectory ensemble and a driven one. Under the optimized added force, the system evolves the rare fluctuation as a typical one, affording a variational estimate of its likelihood in the original trajectory ensemble. Low variance gradients employing value functions are proposed to increase the convergence of the optimal force. The method we develop employing these gradients leads to efficient and accurate estimates of both the optimal force and the likelihood of the rare event for a variety of model systems.},

Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 8922 (2020)] on the same system, we report accurate full configuration interaction (FCI) frozen-core correlation energy estimates for 12 five- and six-membered ring molecules (cyclopentadiene, furan, imidazole, pyrrole, thiophene, benzene, pyrazine, pyridazine, pyridine, pyrimidine, s-tetrazine, and s-triazine) in the standard correlation-consistent double- ζ Dunning basis set (cc-pVDZ). Our FCI correlation energy estimates, with an estimated error smaller than 1 millihartree, are based on energetically optimized-orbital selected configuration interaction calculations performed with the configuration interaction using a perturbative selection made iteratively algorithm. Having at our disposal these accurate reference energies, the respective performance and convergence properties of several popular and widely used families of single-reference quantum chemistry methods are investigated. In particular, we study the convergence properties of (i) the Møller–Plesset perturbation series up to fifth-order (MP2, MP3, MP4, and MP5), (ii) the iterative approximate coupled-cluster series CC2, CC3, and CC4, and (iii) the coupled-cluster series CCSD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ. The performance of the ground-state gold standard CCSD(T) as well as the completely renormalized CC model, CR-CC(2,3), is also investigated. We show that MP4 provides an interesting accuracy/cost ratio, while MP5 systematically worsens the correlation energy estimates. In addition, CC3 outperforms CCSD(T) and CR-CC(2,3), as well as its more expensive parent CCSDT. A similar trend is observed for the methods including quadruple excitations, where the CC4 model is shown to be slightly more accurate than CCSDTQ, both methods providing correlation energies within 2 millihartree of the FCI limit.},

In contrast to the general pseudo-potential approach, we have used accurate ab initio potentials for the positron–atom interaction. The ansatz includes an assumed form of the potential, resulting from an average over fluid atoms, and we propose four different options for this. By comparing the different options to literature data for an effective electron number ( Z eff ), we find that agreement can be obtained for light elements but fails for heavy elements. We suspect that the strong polarizability of the heavy elements makes the simple potential averaging, as assumed in the WS model, insufficient to fit the measurements without also making use of pseudo-potentials. We also raise our suspicion that the comparison of annihilation rates between ground-state calculations and experimental values is not appropriate. Furthermore, the congruence of V 0 to Z eff values predicted by a contact potential approximation appears to be invalidated by our results.},

  abstract = {Dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) allows the description of microscopic dynamical processes on the molecular scale extending classical DFT to non-equilibrium situations. Since DDFT and DFT use the same Helmholtz energy functionals, both predict the same density profiles in thermodynamic equilibrium. We propose a molecular DDFT model, in this work also referred to as hydrodynamic DFT, for mixtures based on a variational principle that accounts for viscous forces as well as diffusive molecular transport via the generalized Maxwell–Stefan diffusion. Our work identifies a suitable expression for driving forces for molecular diffusion of inhomogeneous systems. These driving forces contain a contribution due to the interfacial tension. The hydrodynamic DFT model simplifies to the isothermal multicomponent Navier–Stokes equation in continuum situations when Helmholtz energies can be used instead of Helmholtz energy functionals, closing the gap between micro- and macroscopic scales. We show that the hydrodynamic DFT model, although not formulated in conservative form, globally satisfies the first and second law of thermodynamics. Shear viscosities and Maxwell–Stefan diffusion coefficients are predicted using an entropy scaling approach. As an example, we apply the hydrodynamic DFT model with a Helmholtz energy density functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state to droplet and bubble coalescence in one dimension and analyze the influence of additional components on coalescence phenomena.},

In this work, we present a novel approach to include explicit water and salt in sequence-dependent coarse-grained (CG) models for proteins and RNA, enabling the study of biomolecular condensate formation in a salt-dependent manner. Our framework combines a reparameterized version of the HPS protein force field with the monoatomic mW water model and the mW-ion potential for NaCl. We show how our CG model qualitatively captures the experimental radius of the gyration trend of a subset of intrinsically disordered proteins and reproduces the experimental protein concentration and water percentage of the human fused in sarcoma (FUS) low-complexity-domain droplets at physiological salt concentration. Moreover, we perform seeding simulations as a function of salt concentration for two antagonist systems: the engineered peptide PR 25 and poly-uridine/poly-arginine mixtures, finding good agreement with their reported in vitro phase behavior with salt concentration in both cases. Taken together, our work represents a step forward towards extending sequence-dependent CG models to include water and salt, and to consider their key role in biomolecular condensate self-assembly.},

Although the LLPS of proteins is known to occur in a sequence-dependent manner, it is unclear how sequence properties dictate the nature of the phase transition and thereby influence condensed phase morphology. In this work, we have utilized grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for a simple coarse-grained model of disordered proteins to systematically investigate how sequence distribution, sticker fraction, and chain length impact the formation of finite-size aggregates, which can preempt macroscopic phase separation for some sequences. We demonstrate that a normalized sequence charge decoration (SCD) parameter establishes a “soft” predictive criterion for distinguishing when a model protein undergoes macroscopic phase separation vs finite aggregation. Additionally, we find that this order parameter is strongly correlated with the critical density for phase separation, highlighting an unambiguous connection between sequence distribution and condensed phase density. Results obtained from an analysis of the order parameter reveal that at sufficiently long chain lengths, the vast majority of sequences are likely to phase separate. Our results suggest that classical LLPS should be the primary phase transition for disordered proteins when short-ranged attractive interactions dominate and suggest a possible reason behind recent findings of widespread phase separation throughout living cells.},

To determine the input parameters for the simulation, we experimentally characterize the micro-structure and size distribution of carbon black aggregates. We then simulate suspensions of aggregates and determine the percolation threshold as a function of the aggregate size distribution. We observe a quasi-universal relation between the percolation threshold and a weighted average radius of gyration of the aggregate ensemble. Higher order moments of the size distribution do not have an effect on the percolation threshold. We conclude further that the concentration of large carbon black aggregates has a stronger influence on the percolation threshold than the concentration of small aggregates. In the experiment, we disperse the carbon black in a polymer matrix and measure the conductivity of the composite. We successfully test the hypotheses drawn from simulation by comparing composites prepared with the same type of carbon black before and after ball milling, i.e., on changing only the distribution of aggregate sizes in the composites.},

  abstract = {Many-body potential energy functions (MB-PEFs), which integrate data-driven representations of many-body short-range quantum mechanical interactions with physics-based representations of many-body polarization and long-range interactions, have recently been shown to provide high accuracy in the description of molecular interactions from the gas to the condensed phase. Here, we present MB-Fit, a software infrastructure for the automated development of MB-PEFs for generic molecules within the TTM-nrg (Thole-type model energy) and MB-nrg (many-body energy) theoretical frameworks. Besides providing all the necessary computational tools for generating TTM-nrg and MB-nrg PEFs, MB-Fit provides a seamless interface with the MBX software, a many-body energy and force calculator for computer simulations. Given the demonstrated accuracy of the MB-PEFs, particularly within the MB-nrg framework, we believe that MB-Fit will enable routine predictive computer simulations of generic (small) molecules in the gas, liquid, and solid phases, including, but not limited to, the modeling of quantum isomeric equilibria in molecular clusters, solvation processes, molecular crystals, and phase diagrams.},

  abstract = {As part of an extensive study of the interaction between Zn and Au in Zn/Au(111) model systems, we have systematically investigated the low-temperature (LT) nucleation and growth behavior of Zn on the Au(111) surface as well as the thermal stability of the resulting structures toward sintering, intermixing, and dissolution by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Zn deposition at LT, at 105 K (STM) or 80 K (XPS), leads to nucleation and two-dimensional growth of Zn islands mainly at the elbows of the Au(111) herringbone reconstruction, with a slight preference for island formation at pinched-in (pi) rather than bulged-out (bu) elbows. Local surface intermixing during LT Zn deposition leads to local perturbations of the Au(111) herringbone reconstruction, which results in the formation of additional nucleation sites (edge sites). At higher coverages (&gt;0.11 ML), island coalescence sets in. Testing the thermal stability by annealing experiments, we find the structures to be stable up to about 200 K, while at higher temperatures, 2D sintering, intermixing, and dissolution set in, with subtle differences between pi- and bu-elbow islands. This indicates largely comparable activation barriers for the underlying (surface-)diffusion and exchange processes. Upon annealing to 330 K, all island structures dissolved. Compared with previous reports on the growth of other metals on Au(111), Zn shows a rather high tendency for intermixing and can be considered to be typical of metal deposition systems with comparable barriers for 2D Zn detachment/sintering and intermixing/bulk diffusion.},

  abstract = {The complete understanding of the mechanical and thermal responses to strain in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites holds great potential for their proper functionalities in a range of applications, such as in photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, and flexible electronics. In this work, we conduct systematic atomistic simulations on methyl ammonium lead iodide, which is the prototypical hybrid inorganic–organic perovskite, to investigate the changes in their mechanical and thermal transport responses under uniaxial strain. We find that the mechanical response and the deformation mechanisms are highly dependent on the direction of the applied uniaxial strain with a characteristic ductile- or brittle-like failure accompanying uniaxial tension. Moreover, while most materials shrink in the two lateral directions when stretched, we find that the ductile behavior in hybrid perovskites can lead to a very unique mechanical response where negligible strain occurs along one lateral direction while the length contraction occurs in the other direction due to uniaxial tension. This anisotropy in the mechanical response is also shown to manifest in an anisotropic thermal response of the hybrid perovskite where the anisotropy in thermal conductivity increases by up to 30\% compared to the unstrained case before plastic deformation occurs at higher strain levels. Along with the anisotropic responses of these physical properties, we find that uniaxial tension leads to ultralow thermal conductivities that are well below the value predicted with a minimum thermal conductivity model, which highlights the potential of strain engineering to tune the physical properties of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites.},

  abstract = {The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals, by ultrasonic activation of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs), including TiO 2 , has excellent potential for use in sonodynamic therapy and for the sonocatalytic degradation of pollutants. However, TiO 2 NPs have limitations including low yields of generated ROS that result from fast electron–hole recombination. In this study, we first investigated the sonocatalytic activity of TiO 2 -supported Au nanoclusters (NCs) (Au NCs/TiO 2 ) by monitoring the production of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) under ultrasonication conditions. The deposition of Au 144 NCs on TiO 2 NPs was found to enhance sonocatalytic activity for •OH production by approximately a factor of 2. Electron–hole recombination in ultrasonically excited TiO 2 NPs is suppressed by Au 144 NCs acting as an electron trap; this charge separation resulted in enhanced •OH production. In contrast, the deposition of Au 25 NCs on TiO 2 NPs resulted in lower sonocatalytic activity due to less charge separation, which highlights the effectiveness of combining Au 144 NCs with TiO 2 NPs for enhancing sonocatalytic activity. The sonocatalytic action that forms electron–hole pairs on the Au 144 /TiO 2 catalyst is due to both heat and sonoluminescence from the implosive collapse of cavitation bubbles. Consequently, the ultrasonically excited Au 144 (3 wt.\%)/TiO 2 catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity for the production of •OH because of less light shadowing effect, in contrast to the lower catalytic activity when irradiated with only external light.},

  abstract = {The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is a critical constituent of battery technology, which incorporates the use of lithium metals. Since the formation of the SEI is difficult to avoid, the engineering and harnessing of the SEI are absolutely critical to advancing energy storage. One problem is that much fundamental information about SEI properties is lacking due to the difficulty in probing a chemically complex interfacial system. One such property that is currently unknown is the dissolution of the SEI. This process can have significant effects on the stability of the SEI, which is critical to battery performance but is difficult to probe experimentally. Here, we report the use of ab initio computational chemistry simulations to probe the solution state properties of SEI components LiF, Li 2 O, LiOH, and Li 2 CO 3 in order to study their dissolution and other solution-based characteristics. Ab initio molecular dynamics was used to study the solvation structures of the SEI with a combination of radial distribution functions, discrete solvation structure maps, and vibrational density of states, which allows for the determination of free energies. From the change in free energy of dissolution, we determined that LiOH is the most likely component to dissolve in the electrolyte followed by LiF, Li 2 CO 3 , and Li 2 O although none were favored thermodynamically. This indicates that dissolution is not probable, but Li 2 O would make the most stable SEI with regard to dissolution in the electrolyte.},

The model reproduces the nonequilibrium behavior of recent experiments in which a bulk nonequilibrium structure grown by deposition contains regions of orientational order characteristic of the surface equilibrium. This order is deposited, in general, in a nonuniform way because of the emergence of a growth-poisoning mechanism that causes equilibrated surfaces to grow slower than non-equilibrated surfaces. We use evolutionary methods to design oscillatory protocols able to grow nonequilibrium structures with uniform order, demonstrating the potential of protocol design for the fabrication of this class of materials.},

Of the different types of defects that we observe to be involved in melting, a particular kind of 5+7 type defect (type 5) plays a prominent role as it often forms prior to the formation of the initial liquid nucleus and close to the site where the nucleus forms.

We study the nuclear singlet relaxation of 13 C pairs in aqueous solutions of 1,2- 13 C 2 squarate over a range of pH values. The 13 C singlet order is accessed by introducing 18 O nuclei in order to break the chemical equivalence. The squarate dianion is in chemical equilibrium with hydrogen-squarate (SqH − ) and squaric acid (SqH 2 ) characterized by the dissociation constants pK 1 = 1.5 and pK 2 = 3.4. Surprisingly, we observe a striking increase in the singlet decay time constants T S when the pH of the solution exceeds ∼10, which is far above the acid–base equilibrium points. We derive general rate expressions for chemical-exchange-induced nuclear singlet relaxation and provide a qualitative explanation of the T S behavior of the squarate dianion. We identify a kinetic contribution to the singlet relaxation rate constant, which explicitly depends on kinetic rate constants. Qualitative agreement is achieved between the theory and the experimental data. This study shows that infrequent chemical events may have a strong effect on the relaxation of nuclear singlet order.},

Chlorosomes are the light-harvesting organelles of green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria. They are known to be the most efficient light-harvesting systems in nature. Key to this efficiency is the organization of bacteriochlorophyll molecules in large self-assembled aggregates that define the secondary structure inside the chlorosomes. Many studies have been reported to elucidate the morphology of these aggregates and the molecular packing inside them. It is widely believed that tubular aggregates play an important role. Because the size (radius and length) of these aggregates affects the optical and excitation energy transport properties, it is of interest to be able to probe these quantities inside chlorosomes. We show that a combination of single-chlorosome linear polarization resolved spectroscopy and single-chlorosome circular dichroism spectroscopy may be used to access the typical size of the tubular aggregates within a chlorosome and, thus, probe possible variations between individual chlorosomes that may result, for instance, from different stages in growth or different growth conditions.},

Formation of the translationally hot ions of argon Ar + with three modes in kinetic energy distribution has been revealed. The measured dependence of the kinetic energy of Ar + on the pumping photon energy indicates the appearance of Ar + from three channels of the photodissociation of the linear intermediate Ar + –I–I − containing chemically bound argon. These channels are (1) dissociation into Ar + + I 2 − ; (2) three-body dissociation into (Ar + )* + I* + I − , with (Ar + )* and I* being the 2 P 1/2 states of the species; and (3) two-body electron photodetachment, giving rise to Ar + + I 2 + e. Three indicated channels are similar to those established for the photodissociation of trihalide anions. This similarity confirms the conclusion on the formation of the Ar + –I–I − intermediate, which is isoelectronic to the trihalide anion Cl–I–I − . The mechanism of the Ar + –I–I − formation involves two-photon excitation of the complex Ar–I 2 into the Rydberg state of I 2 converted into the ion-pair state and further electron transfer from Ar to I + of the ion-pair state. The self-assembling of the structure making the formation of the Ar + –I–I − intermediate energetically accessible is confirmed by modeling the dynamics in the excited linear complex Ar–I 2 . Photoexcitation of the van der Waals complexes of noble gases with halogens into the ion-pair states of halogen is supposed to be a promising approach for generating the new chemical compounds of noble gas atoms.},

Since out-of-plane methyl wagging modes will be present whenever a methyl group is attached to a planar frame, this type of torsion–vibration interaction is potentially widespread; it is thus important to establish the extent and strength of this type of interaction. 2D-LIF is limited to molecules that fluoresce from excited electronic states, and to explore interactions between torsion and methyl wagging vibrations in a wide range of molecules necessitates developing alternative experimental approaches. Infrared absorption spectroscopy is one such approach. It is shown that for the low torsional barrier case, the torsional sequence bands accompanying the out-of-plane methyl wagging transition provide a sensitive probe of the interaction. As an illustration, the far infrared absorption spectrum of toluene in the region of the M 20 band (∼205 cm −1 ) is presented and analyzed. The torsional sequence structure provides insight into the higher torsional states (up to m = 7) in the ground vibrational state and M 20 . An analysis of these bands enables the torsion–vibration coupling and torsional constants to be extracted. A general method to analyze such spectra is presented.},

  abstract = {Negative ions do not possess Rydberg states but can have Rydberg-like nonvalence excited states near the electron detachment threshold, including dipole-bound states (DBSs) and quadrupole-bound states (QBSs). While DBSs have been studied extensively, quadrupole-bound excited states have been more rarely observed. 4-cyanophenoxide (4CP − ) was the first anion observed to possess a quadrupole-bound exited state 20 cm −1 below its detachment threshold. Here, we report the observation of a DBS in the isoelectronic 4-ethynylphenoxide anion (4EP − ), providing a rare opportunity to compare the behaviors of a dipole-bound and a quadrupole-bound excited state in a pair of very similar anions. Photodetachment spectroscopy (PDS) of cryogenically cooled 4EP − reveals a DBS 76 cm −1 below its detachment threshold. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) at 266 nm shows that the electronic structure of 4EP − and 4CP − is nearly identical. The observed vibrational features in both the PDS and PES, as well as autodetachment from the nonvalence excited states, are also found to be similar for both anions. However, resonant two-photon detachment (R2PD) from the bound vibrational ground state is observed to be very different for the DBS in 4EP − and the QBS in 4CP − . The R2PD spectra reveal that decays take place from both the DBS and QBS to the respective anion ground electronic states within the 5 ns detachment laser pulse due to internal conversion followed by intramolecular vibrational redistribution and relaxation, but the decay mechanisms appear to be very different. In the R2PD spectrum of 4EP − , we observe strong threshold electron signals, which are due to detachment, by the second photon, of highly rotationally excited anions resulted from the decay of the DBS. On the other hand, in the R2PD spectrum of 4CP − , we observe well-resolved vibrational peaks due to the three lowest-frequency vibrational modes of 4CP − , which are populated from the decay of the QBS. The different behaviors of the R2PD spectra suggest unexpected differences between the relaxation mechanisms of the dipole-bound and quadrupole-bound excited states.},

  abstract = {Incorporation of fluorescent proteins into biochemical systems has revolutionized the field of bioimaging. In a bottom-up approach, understanding the photophysics of fluorescent proteins requires detailed investigations of the light-absorbing chromophore, which can be achieved by studying the chromophore in isolation. This paper reports a photodissociation action spectroscopy study on the deprotonated anion of the red Kaede fluorescent protein chromophore, demonstrating that at least three isomers–assigned to deprotomers–are generated in the gas phase. Deprotomer-selected action spectra are recorded over the S 1 ← S 0 band using an instrument with differential mobility spectrometry coupled with photodissociation spectroscopy. The spectrum for the principal phenoxide deprotomer spans the 480–660 nm range with a maximum response at ≈610 nm. The imidazolate deprotomer has a blue-shifted action spectrum with a maximum response at ≈545 nm. The action spectra are consistent with excited state coupled-cluster calculations of excitation wavelengths for the deprotomers. A third gas-phase species with a distinct action spectrum is tentatively assigned to an imidazole tautomer of the principal phenoxide deprotomer. This study highlights the need for isomer-selective methods when studying the photophysics of biochromophores possessing several deprotonation sites.},

  abstract = {Electronic relaxation dynamics of neutral Au 38 (SC 6 H 13 ) 24 monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs), following excitation of the mixed 15 875 cm −1 charge transfer resonance, were studied using femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). The excited carriers relax by three different mechanisms, including an ∼100 fs HOMO −12/−13 to HOMO −4/−6 hole transfer, picosecond HOMO −4/−6 to HOMO hole transfer, and subsequent electron–hole recombination that persisted beyond the hundreds of picoseconds measurement range. The fsTA data revealed two transient bleach components at 15 820 and 15 625 cm −1 , where the lower frequency component exhibited a delayed first-order buildup of 80 ± 25 fs that matched the decay of the high-energy bleach component (110 ± 45 fs). These results suggested that the excited charge carriers internally relax within the exited-state manifold in ≈100 fs. 2DES resolved multiple electronic fine-structure transient peaks that spanned excitation frequencies ranging from 15 500 to 16 100 cm −1 . State-to-state dynamics were understood by the analysis of time-dependent 2DES transient signal amplitudes at numerous excitation-detection frequency combinations. An off-diagonal cross peak at 15 825–15 620 cm −1 excitation-detection signified the HOMO −12/−13 to HOMO −4/−6 hole transfer process. The lowest-frequency (15 620 cm −1 ) 2DES diagonal fine-structure peak exhibited instantaneous amplitude but intensified following a 75 ± 10 fs buildup when compared to diagonal peaks at higher frequencies. This observation indicated that the charge transfer resonance in Au 38 (SC 6 H 13 ) 24 MPCs is comprised of several electronic transitions of unique spectral weights, which may result from different orbital contributions associated with specific cluster domains. The use of 2DES in combination with structurally precise MPCs can provide a platform for understanding structure-dependent electronic dynamics in metal nanoclusters and technologically important metal–chalcogenide interfaces.},

In this work, the phase transition and the interaction mechanism of the 60\% AN–water binary solution (AN–Water) were analyzed by calculating FR parameters and two-dimensional correlation Raman spectroscopy (2DCRS). The change in the ν 2 band and the base bands ν 3 and ν 4 caused energy transfer by anharmonic interaction, which led to a change in FR parameters. With a reduced temperature, the energy transfer was caused by microheterogeneity and the energy transfer effect (293–273 K), the phase separation (263–233 K), and the phase transition of AN (223–173 K). The 2DCRS and Gaussian deconvolution provided more information on FR, which revealed the interaction mechanism of the Fermi doublet. The polarity and binding modes of molecules provided a new perspective for analyzing the transmission of electrons and ions in the electrolyte at different temperatures.},

In the minor retention and induced-inversion pathways, almost the entire available energy transfers into product rotation–vibration, and retention mainly proceeds with indirect, slow double inversion following induced inversion with about 50\% probability.

The new level of control is achieved by shaping the centrifuge spectrum according to the rotational spectra of the centrifuged molecules. The shaped optical centrifuge releases one molecular species earlier than the other, therefore separating their target rotational frequencies and corresponding rotational states. The technique is applicable to molecules with non-overlapping rotational spectra in the frequency range of interest and will expand the utility of rotational control in the studies of the effects of molecular rotation on collisions and chemical reactions.},

  abstract = {Quantum transport simulations often use explicit, yet finite, electronic reservoirs. These should converge to the correct continuum limit, albeit with a trade-off between discretization and computational cost. Here, we study this interplay for extended reservoir simulations, where relaxation maintains a bias or temperature drop across the system. Our analysis begins in the non-interacting limit, where we parameterize different discretizations to compare them on an even footing. For many-body systems, we develop a method to estimate the relaxation that best approximates the continuum by controlling virtual transitions in Kramers turnover for the current. While some discretizations are more efficient for calculating currents, there is little benefit with regard to the overall state of the system. Any gains become marginal for many-body, tensor network simulations, where the relative performance of discretizations varies when sweeping other numerical controls. These results indicate that typical reservoir discretizations have little impact on numerical costs for certain computational tools. The choice of a relaxation parameter is nonetheless crucial, and the method we develop provides a reliable estimate of the optimal relaxation for finite reservoirs.},

Here, we present the first assessment of common XC functionals against exact path-integral Monte Carlo calculations of the harmonically perturbed thermal electron gas. This system is directly related to the numerical modeling of x-ray scattering experiments on warm dense samples. Our assessment yields the parameter space where common XC functionals are applicable. More importantly, we pinpoint where the tested XC functionals fail when perturbations on the electronic structure are imposed. We indicate the lack of XC functionals that take into account the needs of WDM physics in terms of perturbed electronic structures.},

  abstract = {The coupled cluster iteration scheme is analyzed as a multivariate discrete time map using nonlinear dynamics and synergetics. The nonlinearly coupled set of equations to determine the cluster amplitudes are driven by a fraction of the entire set of cluster amplitudes. These driver amplitudes enslave all other amplitudes through a synergistic inter-relationship, where the latter class of amplitudes behave as the auxiliary variables. The driver and the auxiliary variables exhibit vastly different time scales of relaxation during the iteration process to reach the fixed points. The fast varying auxiliary amplitudes are small in magnitude, while the driver amplitudes are large, and they have a much longer time scale of relaxation. Exploiting their difference in relaxation time scale, we employ an adiabatic decoupling approximation, where each of the fast relaxing auxiliary modes is expressed as a unique function of the principal amplitudes. This results in a tremendous reduction in the independent degrees of freedom. On the other hand, only the driver amplitudes are determined accurately via exact coupled cluster equations. We will demonstrate that the iteration scheme has an order of magnitude reduction in computational scaling than the conventional scheme. With a few pilot numerical examples, we would demonstrate that this scheme can achieve very high accuracy with significant savings in computational time.},

  abstract = {We present the first quantum-mechanical derivation of statistical-law formulas to calculate zero- to two-electron transfers (ETs) in proton–molecule reactions. The original statistical derivation assumed that the n-ET probabilities of N electrons in a shell obey an N-trial binomial distribution with success probability equal to an individual one-ET probability; the latter was heuristically identified with the number of transferred electrons from the integrated charge density. The obtained formulas proved accurate to calculate ET cross sections in proton–molecule and proton cancer therapy (PCT) reactions. We adopt the electron nuclear dynamics (END) theory in our quantum-mechanical derivation due to its versatile description of ETs via a Thouless single-determinantal state. Since non-orthogonal Thouless dynamical spin-orbitals pose mathematical difficulties, we first present a derivation for a model system with N ≥ 2 electrons where only two with opposite spins are ET active; in that scheme, the Thouless dynamical spin-orbitals become orthogonal, a fact that facilitates a still intricate derivation. In the end, we obtain the number of transferred electrons from the Thouless state charge density and the ETs probabilities from the Thouless state resolution into projectile–molecule eigenstates describing ETs. We prove that those probabilities and numbers of electrons interrelate as in the statistical-law formulas via their common dependency on the Thouless variational parameters. We review past ET results of proton–molecule and PCT reactions obtained with these formulas in the END framework and present new results of H + + N 2 O. We will present the derivation for systems with N &gt; 2 electrons all active for ETs in a sequel.},

The results show that SF-TDDFT qualitatively describes the photoisomerization of trans - C 5 H 6 N H 2 + ⁠ , with favorable comparison to previous studies using multireference electronic structure methods. In contrast, conventional LR-TDDFT affords qualitatively different photodynamics due to an incorrect excited-state potential surface near the Franck–Condon region. In addition, the photochemistry (involving pre-twisting of the central double bond) appears to be different for SF- and LR-TDDFT, which may be a consequence of different conical intersection topographies afforded by these two methods. The present results contrast with previous surface-hopping studies suggesting that the LR-TDDFT method’s incorrect topology around S 1 /S 0 conical intersections is immaterial to the photodynamics.},

  abstract = {Water fluctuates in a hydrophobic confinement, forming multiple dry and wet hydration states through evaporation and condensation. Transitions between such states are critical to both thermodynamics and kinetics of solute molecular processes, such as protein folding and protein–ligand binding and unbinding. To efficiently predict such dry–wet transition paths, we develop a hybrid approach that combines a variational implicit solvation model, a generalized string method for minimum free-energy paths, and the level-set numerical implementation. This approach is applied to three molecular systems: two hydrophobic plates, a carbon nanotube, and a synthetic host molecule Cucurbit[7]uril. Without an explicit description of individual water molecules, our mesoscale approach effectively captures multiple dry and wet hydration states, multiple dry–wet transition paths, such as those geometrically symmetric and asymmetric paths, and transition states, providing activation energy barriers between different states. Further analysis shows that energy barriers depend on mesoscopic lengths, such as the separation distance between the two plates and the cross section diameter of the nanotube, and that the electrostatic interactions strongly influence the dry–wet transitions. With the inclusion of solute atomic motion, general collective variables as reaction coordinates, and the finite-temperature string method, together with an improved treatment of continuum electrostatics, our approach can be further developed to sample an ensemble of transition paths, providing more accurate predictions of the transition kinetics.},

Currently, MSM/RD lacks a mathematical framework to derive coupling schemes, is limited to isotropic ligands in a single conformational state, and lacks multiparticle extensions. In this work, we address these needs by developing a general MSM/RD framework by coarse-graining molecular dynamics into hybrid switching diffusion processes. Given enough data to parameterize the model, it is capable of modeling protein–protein interactions over large time and length scales, and it can be extended to handle multiple molecules. We derive the MSM/RD framework, and we implement and verify it for two protein–protein benchmark systems and one multiparticle implementation to model the formation of pentameric ring molecules. To enable reproducibility, we have published our code in the MSM/RD software package.},

The overall lowest mean absolute error is obtained with the local hybrid (LH) functional LH12ct-SsirPW92 with individual errors of 0.11 eV (0.11 eV) for singlet (triplet) n → π * excitations and 0.29 eV (0.17 eV) for π → π * excitations. This is slightly better than with the overall best performing global hybrid M06-2X [n → π *: 0.13 eV (0.17 eV), π → π *: 0.30 eV (0.20 eV)], while most other global and range-separated hybrids and some LHs suffer from the “triplet problem” of time-dependent density functional theory. This is exemplified by correlating the errors for singlet and triplet excitations on a state-by-state basis. The excellent performance of LHs based on a common local mixing function, i.e., an LMF constructed from the spin-summed rather than the spin-resolved semilocal quantities, is systematically investigated by the introduction of a spin-channel interpolation scheme that allows us to continuously modulate the fraction of opposite-spin terms used in the LMF. The correlation of triplet and singlet errors is systematically improved for the n → π * excitations when larger fractions of the opposite-spin-channel are used in the LMF, whereas this effect is limited for the π → π * excitations. This strongly supports a previously made hypothesis that attributes the excellent performance of LHs based on a common LMF to cross-spin-channel nondynamical correlation terms.},

In particular, in the case of periodic systems, we use the complex position definition, which was already used in similar contexts for the treatment of both classical and quantum situations. In this study, we show that the localization spread evaluated on a finite ring system of radius R with open boundary conditions leads, in the large R limit, to the same formula derived by Resta and co-workers [C.

  abstract = {Model Hamiltonians constructed from quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are widely used for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics in the condensed phase. The most popular two-state spin-boson model could be built by mapping the all-atom anharmonic Hamiltonian onto a two-level system bilinearly coupled to a harmonic bath using the energy gap time correlation function. However, for more than two states, there lacks a general strategy to construct multi-state harmonic (MSH) models since the energy gaps between different pairs of electronic states are not entirely independent and need to be considered consistently. In this paper, we extend the previously proposed approach for building three-state harmonic models for photoinduced charge transfer to the arbitrary number of electronic states with a globally shared bath and the system–bath couplings are scaled differently according to the reorganization energies between each pair of states. We demonstrate the MSH model construction for an organic photovoltaic carotenoid–porphyrin–C 60 molecular triad dissolved in explicit tetrahydrofuran solvent. Nonadiabatic dynamics was simulated using mixed quantum-classical techniques, including the linearized semiclassical and symmetrical quasiclassical dynamics with the mapping Hamiltonians, mean-field Ehrenfest, and mixed quantum-classical Liouville dynamics in two-state, three-state, and four-state harmonic models of the triad system. The MSH models are shown to provide a general and flexible framework for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics in complex systems.},

Although a severe approximation to the exact solution of the molecular time-dependent Schrödinger equation, Ehrenfest dynamics is symplectic, is time-reversible, and conserves exactly the total molecular energy as well as the norm of the electronic wavefunction. Here, we surpass apparent complications due to the coupling of classical nuclear and quantum electronic motions and present efficient geometric integrators for “representation-free” Ehrenfest dynamics, which do not rely on a diabatic or adiabatic representation of electronic states and are of arbitrary even orders of accuracy in the time step. These numerical integrators, obtained by symmetrically composing the second-order splitting method and exactly solving the kinetic and potential propagation steps, are norm-conserving, symplectic, and time-reversible regardless of the time step used. Using a nonadiabatic simulation in the region of a conical intersection as an example, we demonstrate that these integrators preserve the geometric properties exactly and, if highly accurate solutions are desired, can be even more efficient than the most popular non-geometric integrators.},

This method is totally general and here is applied to the prototypical case of gas phase fragmentation of protonated cyclo-di-glycine. This methodology allows us to analyze the whole set of trajectories in an automatic computer-based way without the need of visual inspection but by getting all the needed information. In particular, we not only determine the appearance of different products and intermediates but also characterize the corresponding kinetics. The use of colored graph and canonical labeling allows for the correct characterization of the chemical species involved. In the present case, the simulations consist of an ensemble of unimolecular fragmentation trajectories at constant energy such that from the rate constants at different energies, the threshold energy can also be obtained for both global and specific pathways. This approach allows for the characterization of ion–molecule complexes, likely through a roaming mechanism, by properly taking into account the elusive nature of such species. Finally, it is possible to directly obtain the theoretical mass spectrum of the fragmenting species if the reacting system is an ion as in the specific example.},

They are constructed in a systematic fashion by augmenting def2 orbital basis sets with diffuse basis functions and minimizing negative static isotropic polarizabilities of lanthanide atoms with respect to basis set exponents within the unrestricted Hartree–Fock method. The basis set quality is assessed using a test set of 70 molecules containing the lanthanides in their common oxidation states and f electron occupations. 5d orbital occupation turns out to be the determining factor for the basis set convergence of polarizabilities in lanthanide atoms and the molecular test set. Therefore, two series of property-optimized basis sets are defined. The augmented def2-SVPD, def2-TZVPPD, and def2-QZVPPD basis sets balance the accuracy of polarizabilities across lanthanide oxidation states. The relative errors in atomic and molecular polarizability calculations are ≤8\% for augmented split-valence basis sets, ≤ 2.5\% for augmented triple-zeta valence basis sets, and ≤1\% for augmented quadruple-zeta valence basis sets. In addition, extended def2-TZVPPDD and def2-QZVPPDD are provided for accurate calculations of lanthanide atoms and neutral clusters.

Such computations are of current interest for the understanding of ion–atom interactions in the ultracold regime. We demonstrate that these CC methods lead to an unphysical long-range barrier for the Rb 2 + system. The barrier is small but spoils the long-range behavior of the PEC. The effect is also found for other X 2 + systems, such as X = Li, Na, and K. Calculations using a flexible framework for obtaining leading perturbative triples corrections derived using an analytic CC singles and doubles energy derivative formulation demonstrate that the origin of this problem lies in the use of T ̂ 3 amplitudes obtained from approximate CC singles, doubles, and triples amplitude equations. It is shown that the unphysical barrier is related to a symmetry instability of the underlying Hartree–Fock mean-field solution, leading to orbitals representing two +0.5-fold charged ions in the limit of separated fragments. This, in turn, leads to a wrong 1/ R asymptote of the interaction potential computed by perturbation-based CC approximations. Physically meaningful perturbative corrections in the long-range tail of the PEC may instead be obtained using symmetry-broken reference determinants.},

  abstract = {The field of cluster science is drawing increasing attention due to the strong size and composition-dependent properties of clusters and the exciting prospect of clusters serving as the building blocks for materials with tailored properties. However, identifying a unifying central paradigm that provides a framework for classifying and understanding the diverse behaviors is an outstanding challenge. One such central paradigm is the superatom concept that was developed for metallic and ligand-protected metallic clusters. The periodic electronic and geometric closed shells in clusters result in their properties being based on the stability they gain when they achieve closed shells. This stabilization results in the clusters having a well-defined valence, allowing them to be classified as superatoms—thus extending the Periodic Table to a third dimension. This Perspective focuses on extending the superatomic concept to ligated metal–chalcogen clusters that have recently been synthesized in solutions and form assemblies with counterions that have wide-ranging applications. Here, we illustrate that the periodic patterns emerge in the electronic structure of ligated metal-chalcogenide clusters. The stabilization gained by the closing of their electronic shells allows for the prediction of their redox properties. Further investigations reveal how the selection of ligands may control the redox properties of the superatoms. These ligated clusters may serve as chemical dopants for two-dimensional semiconductors to control their transport characteristics. Superatomic molecules of multiple metal–chalcogen superatoms allow for the formation of nano-p–n junctions ideal for directed transport and photon harvesting. This Perspective outlines future developments, including the synthesis of magnetic superatoms.},

This is attributed to Wood’s anomalies with the 2400 l/mm grating: one aspect is a loss in light intensity over a range of wavelengths, attributed to a resonance anomaly. Another is the appearance of a “shadow” ZEKE spectrum and PIE curve at apparently higher ionization wavenumbers; under some conditions, a third ZEKE spectrum was observed—these latter observations arise from higher-order dispersion effects, likely caused by a Rayleigh anomaly.

  abstract = {The computer-aided investigation of protein folding has greatly benefited from coarse-grained models, that is, simplified representations at a resolution level lower than atomistic, providing access to qualitative and quantitative details of the folding process that would be hardly attainable, via all-atom descriptions, for medium to long molecules. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of low-resolution models is itself hampered by the presence, in a small but significant number of proteins, of nontrivial topological self-entanglements. Features such as native state knots or slipknots introduce conformational bottlenecks, affecting the probability to fold into the correct conformation; this limitation is particularly severe in the context of coarse-grained models. In this work, we tackle the relationship between folding probability, protein folding pathway, and protein topology in a set of proteins with a nontrivial degree of topological complexity. To avoid or mitigate the risk of incurring in kinetic traps, we make use of the elastic folder model, a coarse-grained model based on angular potentials optimized toward successful folding via a genetic procedure. This light-weight representation allows us to estimate in silico folding probabilities, which we find to anti-correlate with a measure of topological complexity as well as to correlate remarkably well with experimental measurements of the folding rate. These results strengthen the hypothesis that the topological complexity of the native state decreases the folding probability and that the force-field optimization mimics the evolutionary process these proteins have undergone to avoid kinetic traps.},

Here, we discuss the ability of a full polarizable hybrid approach coupled to a standard molecular dynamics scheme to model the behavior in the aqueous phase and at infinite dilution conditions of a standard hydrophobic polyelectrolyte polymer whose charge is neutralized by explicit counterions. Beyond the standard picture of a polyelectrolyte behavior governed by an interplay between opposite intra-polyelectrolyte and inter-polyelectrolyte/counterion Coulombic effects, our simulations show the key role played by both intra-solute polarization effects and long range solute/solvent electrostatics to stabilize compact globular conformations of that polyelectrolyte. Our full polarizable hybrid modeling approach is thus a new theoretical tool well suited to be used in digital strategies for accelerating innovation for green science, for instance.},

Upon increasing the charge fraction of PAA, the chains adopt more extended conformations, and simultaneously, potassium ions bind more strongly (i.e., with more negative Δ G eff ) to the highly charged chains to relieve electrostatic repulsions between charged monomers along the chains. We compare the simulation results with the predictions of a model that describes potassium binding to PAA chains as a reversible reaction whose binding free energy (Δ G eff ) is adjusted from its intrinsic value (Δ G ) by electrostatic correlations, captured by a random phase approximation. The bare or intrinsic binding free energy Δ G , which is an input in the model, depends on the binding species and is obtained from the radial distribution function of K + around the charged monomer of a singly charged, short PAA chain in dilute solutions. We find that the model yields semi-quantitative predictions for Δ G eff and the degree of potassium binding to PAA chains, α , as a function of PAA charge fraction without using fitting parameters.},

  abstract = {While proteins have been treated as particles with a spherically symmetric interaction, of course in reality, the situation is rather more complex. A simple step toward higher complexity is to treat the proteins as non-spherical particles and that is the approach we pursue here. We investigate the phase behavior of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the addition of a non-adsorbing polymer, polyethylene glycol. From small angle x-ray scattering, we infer that the eGFP undergoes dimerization and we treat the dimers as spherocylinders with aspect ratio L / D − 1 = 1.05. Despite the complex nature of the proteins, we find that the phase behavior is similar to that of hard spherocylinders with an ideal polymer depletant, exhibiting aggregation and, in a small region of the phase diagram, crystallization. By comparing our measurements of the onset of aggregation with predictions for hard colloids and ideal polymers [S. V. Savenko and M. Dijkstra, J. Chem. Phys. 124 , 234902 (2006) and Lo Verso et al. , Phys. Rev.

The formation and stability of the C–S–H compound can be understood in terms of the close similarity in effective volumes of the H 2 S and CH 4 components, and denser carbon-bearing S–H phases may form at higher pressures.

  abstract = {Cu-based catalysts currently offer the most promising route to actively and selectively produce value-added chemicals via electrochemical reduction of CO 2 (eCO 2 R); yet further improvements are required for their wide-scale deployment in carbon mitigation efforts. Here, we systematically investigate a family of dilute Cu-based alloys to explore their viability as active and selective catalysts for eCO 2 R through a combined theoretical–experimental approach. Using a quantum–classical modeling approach that accounts for dynamic solvation effects, we assess the stability and activity of model single-atom catalysts under eCO 2 R conditions. Our calculations identify that the presence of eCO 2 R intermediates, such as CO*, H*, and OH*, may dynamically influence the local catalyst surface composition. Additionally, we identify through binding energy descriptors of the CO*, CHO*, and OCCO* dimer intermediates that certain elements, such as group 13 elements (B, Al, and Ga), enhance the selectivity of C 2+ species relative to pure Cu by facilitating CO dimerization. The theoretical work is corroborated by preliminary testing of eCO 2 R activity and selectivity of candidate dilute Cu-based alloy catalyst films prepared by electron beam evaporation in a zero-gap gas diffusion electrode-based reactor. Of all studied alloys, dilute CuAl was found to be the most active and selective toward C 2+ products like ethylene, consistent with the theoretical predictions. We attribute the improved performance of dilute CuAl alloys to more favorable dimerization reaction energetics of bound CO species relative to that on pure Cu. In a broader context, the results presented here demonstrate the power of our simulation framework in terms of rational catalyst design.},

  abstract = {The space charge layer in hematite photoelectrodes has been analyzed by means of Poisson–Boltzmann equations, the Stern model, and density functional theory, in view of its application for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The width of the space charge layer can be smaller than ∼10 Å under experimental conditions. In this regime, a substantial part of the potential drop takes place in the Helmholtz layer, leading to important corrections to the Mott–Schottky behavior of the space charge layer capacitance. These results shed light on an unexpected regime of high photoelectrocatalytic efficiency, different from the classical picture of the electrochemical interface of a semiconducting photocatalyst, which is also amenable to direct study by quantum-mechanical atomistic simulations. Density functional theory has been used to calculate the band bending (BB) in the space charge layer in atomistic models of pristine stoichiometric and hydroxylated surfaces. These surface terminations display BBs of 0.14 and 0.49 eV, respectively, with an increasing width of the space charge layer, however still in the sub-nanometer regime. This work shows that, at high doping, the width of the space charge layer of a hematite photoelectrode can become comparable with interatomic distances.},

Similarly, the vapor phase composition is known for only a few DESs. In this study, for the first time, the vapor pressures and vapor phase compositions of choline chloride urea (ChClU) and choline chloride ethylene glycol (ChClEg) DESs are computed using Monte Carlo simulations. The partial pressures of the DES components were obtained from liquid and vapor phase excess Gibbs energies, computed using thermodynamic integration. The enthalpies of vaporization were computed from the obtained vapor pressures, and the results were in reasonable agreement with the few available experimental data in the literature. It was found that the vapor phases of both DESs were dominated by the most volatile component (hydrogen bond donor, HBD, i.e., urea or ethylene glycol), i.e., 100\% HBD in ChClEg and 88\%–93\% HBD in ChClU. Higher vapor pressures were observed for ChClEg compared to ChClU due to the higher volatility of ethylene glycol compared to urea. The influence of the liquid composition of the DESs on the computed properties was studied by considering different mole fractions (i.e., 0.6, 0.67, and 0.75) of the HBD. Except for the partial pressure of ethylene glycol in ChClEg, all the computed partial pressures and enthalpies of vaporization showed insensitivity toward the liquid composition. The activity coefficient of ethylene glycol in ChClEg was computed at different liquid phase mole fractions, showing negative deviations from Raoult’s law.},

  abstract = {The breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation in supercooled liquids, which is the increase in the ratio τ α τ D between the two macroscopic times for structural relaxation and diffusion on decreasing the temperature, is commonly ascribed to dynamic heterogeneities, but a clear-cut microscopic interpretation is still lacking. Here, we tackle this issue exploiting the single-particle cage-jump framework to analyze molecular dynamics simulations of soft disk assemblies and supercooled water. We find that τ α τ D ∝ ⟨ t p ⟩ ⟨ t c ⟩ ⁠ , where ⟨ t p ⟩ and ⟨ t c ⟩ are the cage-jump times characterizing slow and fast particles, respectively. We further clarify that this scaling does not arise from a simple term-by-term proportionality; rather, the relations τ α ∝ ⟨ t p ⟩ ⟨ Δ r J 2 ⟩ and τ D ∝ ⟨ t c ⟩ ⟨ Δ r J 2 ⟩ effectively connect the macroscopic and microscopic timescales, with the mean square jump length ⟨ Δ r J 2 ⟩ shrinking on cooling. Our work provides a microscopic perspective on the Stokes–Einstein breakdown and generalizes previous results on lattice models to the case of more realistic glass-formers.},

We present comprehensive benchmarks of the thermophysical properties of water for two ReaxFF models, the water-2017 and CHON-2017_weak force fields. These include structural, electrostatic, vibrational, thermodynamic, coexistence, and transport properties at ambient conditions (300 K and 0.997 g cm −3 ) and along the standard pressure (1 bar) isobar. Overall, CHON-2017_weak predicts more accurate thermophysical properties than the water-2017 force field.

For the first time, CCSD(T) geometry optimizations and harmonic vibrational frequency computations with the cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets have been carried out to characterize two unique minima for each isomer along with three transition state structures with C s symmetry. Explicitly correlated CCSD(T) computations were also performed to estimate the relative energetics of these nine stationary points near the complete basis set limit. These benchmark results were used to assess the performance of various density functional theory (DFT) and wave function theory methods, and they will help guide method selection for future studies of alcohols and their radicals. The structures generated by abstracting H from the α C atom have significantly lower electronic energies (by at least 7 kcal mol −1 ) than the CH 3 CH 2 O and CH 2 CH 2 OH radicals. Although previously reported as a minimum on the ground-state surface, the 2 A ″ C s structure of the ethoxy radical was found to be a transition state in this study with MP2, CCSD(T), and a number of DFT methods. An implicit solvation model used in conjunction with DFT and MP2 methods did not qualitatively change the relative energies of the isomers, but the results suggest that the local minima for the CH 3 CHOH and CH 2 CH 2 OH radicals could become more energetically competitive in condensed phase environments, such as liquid water and ethanol.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the pathological behavior of the energetics of dimethyl sulfoxide and related sulfur-containing compounds by providing the computational benchmark energetics of R 2 E 2 species, where R = H/CH 3 and E = O/S, with bent and pyramidal geometries using state-of-the-art methodologies. These 22 geometries were fully characterized with coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)], second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), and 22 density functional theory (DFT) methods with 8, 12, and 12, respectively, correlation consistent basis sets of double-, triple-, or quadruple-ζ quality. The relative energetics were determined at the MP2 and CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limits using 17 basis sets up to sextuple-ζ and include augmented, tight- d , and core–valence correlation consistent basis sets. The relative energies of oxygen-/sulfur-containing compounds exhibit exceptionally slow convergence to the CBS limit with canonical methods as well as significant basis set dependence. CCSD(T) with quadruple-ζ basis sets can give qualitatively incorrect relative energies. Explicitly correlated MP2-F12 and CCSD(T)-F12 methods dramatically accelerate the convergence of the relative energies to the CBS limit for these problematic compounds. The F12 methods with a triple-ζ quality basis set give relative energies that deviate no more than 0.41 kcal mol −1 from the benchmark CBS limit. The correlation consistent Composite Approach (ccCA), ccCA-TM (TM for transition metals), and G3B3 deviated by no more than 2 kcal mol −1 from the benchmark CBS limits. Relative energies for oxygen-/sulfur-containing systems fully characterized with DFT are quite unreliable even with triple-ζ quality basis sets, and 13 out of 45 combinations fortuitously give a relative energy that is within 1 kcal mol −1 on average from the benchmark CCSD(T) CBS limit for these systems.},

We perform quasi-classical trajectory simulations using a recently developed high-level ab initio full-dimensional potential energy surface by exciting five different vibrational modes of ethane at four collision energies. We find that all the studied vibrational excitations, except that of the CC-stretching mode, clearly promote the title reaction, and the vibrational enhancements are consistent with the predictions of the Sudden Vector Projection (SVP) model, with the largest effect caused by the CH-stretching excitations. Intramolecular vibrational redistribution is also monitored for the differently excited ethane molecule. Our results indicate that the mechanism of the reaction changes with increasing collision energy, with no mode-specificity at high energies. The initial translational energy mostly converts into product recoil, while a significant part of the excess vibrational energy remains in the ethyl radical. An interesting competition between translational and vibrational energies is observed for the HCl vibrational distribution: the effect of exciting the low-frequency ethane modes, having small SVP values, is suppressed by translational excitation, whereas a part of the excess vibrational energy pumped into the CH-stretching modes (larger SVP values) efficiently flows into the HCl vibration.},

  abstract = {A representation of the three-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) of the H 2 O–H van der Waals dimer is presented. The H 2 O molecule is treated as a rigid body held at its experimentally determined equilibrium geometry, with the OH bond length set to 1.809 650 34 a 0 and the HOH bond angle set to 1.824 044 93 radians. Ab initio calculations are carried out at the coupled-cluster single, double, and perturbative triple level, with scalar relativistic effects included using the second-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess approximation. The ab initio calculations employ the aug-cc-pVnZ-DK series of basis sets (n = D, T, Q), which are recontracted versions of the aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets that are appropriate for relativistic calculations. The counterpoise method is used to reduce the basis set superposition error; in addition, results obtained using the aug-cc-pVTZ-DK and aug-cc-pVQZ-DK basis sets were extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. The PES is based on calculations carried out at 1054 symmetry-unique H 2 O–H geometries for which the distance R between the H-atom and the H 2 O center of mass ranges from R = 2.5–9.0 Å. The reproduction of the PES along the orientational degrees of freedom was performed using Lebedev quadrature and an expansion in spherical harmonics. The mean absolute error of the reproduced PES is &lt;0.02 cm −1 for R ≥ 3.0 Å and &lt;0.21 cm −1 for R between 2.5 and 3.0 Å. The global minimum for the CBS PES is a coplanar H 2 O–H geometry, with R = 3.41 Å, in which the angle formed between the H 2 O C 2 symmetry axis and the H-atom is 122.25°; the CBS binding energy for this geometry is 61.297 cm −1 . In addition, by utilizing the symmetry of the H 2 O molecule, the spherical harmonic expansion was simplified with no loss in accuracy and a speedup of ∼1.8 was achieved. The reproduced PES can be used in future molecular dynamics simulations.},

The case of the one electronic level of the bridge molecule coupled to a single classical harmonic oscillator is considered within the spin-less model. Based on these equations, we establish some relations between different average values of interest, considering the large bias limit and the limit of the weak electron–oscillator coupling. We derive the analytical expressions for a number of characteristic properties of the tunneling junction in these limiting cases, compare our results with those obtained by the numerically exact calculations, and find that our expressions work very well. In the diabatic regime, the approximate solutions of the classical master equations are suggested, which permit us to introduce the effective temperature T eff and perform rather simple calculations of the average vibrational excitations N and the tunnel current I . It is shown that in the adiabatic regime, the properties of the tunneling junction depend essentially on the effective temperature T eff ad . We obtain the analytical expressions for T eff ad using different approaches for the treatment of the adiabatic regime. For both the diabatic and adiabatic regimes, we calculate T eff , T eff ad , N , and I , compare our results with those available in the literature, and confirm well agreement. The dependence of N and I on the reorganization energy and the position of the electronic level of the bridge molecule is discussed.},

  abstract = {Due to their small size and unique properties, single-molecule electronics have long seen research interest from experimentalists and theoreticians alike. From a theoretical standpoint, modeling these systems using electronic structure theory can be difficult due to the importance of electron correlation in the determination of molecular properties, and this electron correlation can be computationally expensive to consider, particularly multiconfigurational correlation energy. In this work, we develop a new approach for the study of single-molecule electronic systems, denoted NEGF-MCPDFT, which combines multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MCPDFT) with the non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism (NEGF). The use of MCPDFT with NEGF allows for the efficient inclusion of both static and dynamic electron correlations in the description of the junction’s electronic structure. Complete active space self-consistent field wave functions are used as references in the MCPDFT calculation, and as with any active space method, effort must be made to determine the proper orbital character to include in the active space. We perform conductance and transmission calculations on a series of alkanes (predominantly single-configurational character) and benzyne (multiconfigurational character), exploring the role that active space selection has on the computed results. For the alkane junctions explored (where dynamic electron correlation dominates), the MCPDFT-NEGF results agree well with the DFT-NEGF results. For the benzyne junction (which has a significant static correlation), we see clear differences in the MCPDFT-NEGF and DFT-NEGF results and evidence that NEGF-MCPDFT is capturing additional electron correlation effects beyond those provided by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.},

  abstract = {We present an analytical theory of electrostatic interactions of two spherical dielectric particles of arbitrary radii and dielectric constants, immersed into a polarizable ionic solvent (assuming that the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann framework holds) and bearing arbitrary charge distributions expanded in multipolar terms. The presented development entails a novel two-center re-expansion analytical theory that expands upon and improves the existing ones, bypassing the conventional expansions in modified Bessel functions. On this basis, we develop a specific matrix formalism that facilitates the construction of asymptotic expansions in ascending order of Debye screening terms of potential coefficients, which are then employed to find exact closed-form expressions for the total electrostatic energy. In particular, this work allows us to explicitly and precisely quantify the k -screened terms of the potential coefficients and mutual interaction energy. Specific cases of monopolar and dipolar distributions are described in particular detail. Comprehensive numerical examples and tests of series convergence and the relative balance of leading and higher-order terms of the mutual interaction energy are presented depending on the inter-particle distance and particles’ radii. The results of this work find application in soft matter modeling and, in particular, in computational biophysics and colloid science, where the availability of increasingly larger experimental structures at the atomic-level resolution makes numerical treatment challenging and calls for more efficient expressions and an increased range of validity.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology that provides a complete parametric description of the time evolution of the electronically and vibrationally excited states as detected by ultrafast transient absorption (TA). Differently from previous approaches, which started fitting the data after ≈100 fs, no data are left out in our methodology, and the “coherent artifact” and the instrument response function are fully taken into account. In case studies, the method is applied to solvents, the dye Nile blue, and all-trans β-carotene in cyclohexane solution. The estimated Damped Oscillation Associated Spectra (DOAS) and phases express the most important vibrational frequencies present in the molecular system. By global fit alone of the experimental data, it is difficult to interpret in detail the underlying dynamics. Since it is unfeasible to directly fit the data by a theoretical simulation, our enhanced DOAS methodology thus provides a useful “middle ground” where the theoretical description and the fit of the experimental data can meet. β-carotene in cyclohexane was complementarily studied with femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS). The fs–ps dynamics of β-carotene in cyclohexane in TA and FSRS experiments can be described by a sequential scheme S2 → hot S1 → S1′ → S1 → S0 with lifetimes of 167 fs (fixed), 0.35, 1.1, and 9.6 ps. The correspondence of DOAS decaying concomitantly with hot S1 and the Species Associated Difference Spectra of hot S1 in TA and FSRS suggest that we observe here features of the vibrational relaxation and nuclear reorganization responsible for the hot S1 to S1 transition.},

  abstract = {In this work, complementary formulas are presented to compute free-energy differences via perturbation (FEP) methods and thermodynamic integration (TI). These formulas are derived by selecting only the most statistically significant data from the information extractable from the simulated points involved. On the one hand, commonly used FEP techniques based on overlap sampling leverage the full information contained in the overlapping macrostate probability distributions. On the other hand, conventional TI methods only use information on the first moments of those distributions, as embodied by the first derivatives of the free energy. Since the accuracy of simulation data degrades considerably for high-order moments (for FEP) or free-energy derivatives (for TI), it is proposed to consider, consistently for both methods, data up to second-order moments/derivatives. This provides a compromise between the limiting strategies embodied by common FEP and TI and leads to simple, optimized expressions to evaluate free-energy differences. The proposed formulas are validated with an analytically solvable harmonic Hamiltonian (for assessing systematic errors), an atomistic system (for computing the potential of mean force with coordinate-dependent order parameters), and a binary-component coarse-grained model (for tracing a solid–liquid phase diagram in an ensemble sampled through alchemical transformations). It is shown that the proposed FEP and TI formulas are straightforward to implement, perform similarly well, and allow robust estimation of free-energy differences even when the spacing of successive points does not guarantee them to have proper overlapping in phase space.},

Phys. 107 , 432 (1997)]. This ensemble averages over all microstates of a given total spin quantum number, and therefore, it is invariant with respect to SU(2) transformations. As such, all equations may be reformulated in terms of spin-free quantities and they closely resemble those of spin-adapted closed-shell coupled cluster (CC) theory. The current implementation is used to assess the accuracy of various truncated MR-DSRG methods (perturbation theory up to third order and iterative methods with single and double excitations) in computing the constants of 33 first-row diatomic molecules. The accuracy trends for these first-row diatomics are consistent with our previous benchmark on a small subset of closed-shell diatomic molecules. We then present the first MR-DSRG application on transition-metal complexes by computing the spin splittings of the [Fe(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ and [Fe(NH 3 ) 6 ] 2+ molecules. A focal point analysis (FPA) shows that third-order perturbative corrections are essential to achieve reasonably converged energetics. The FPA based on the linearized MR-DSRG theory with one- and two-body operators and up to a quintuple- ζ basis set predicts the spin splittings of [Fe(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ and [Fe(NH 3 ) 6 ] 2+ to be −35.7 and −17.1 kcal mol −1 , respectively, showing good agreement with the results of local CC theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples.},

The latter approach is extended here to derive finite-size correction for the Stokes-shift and reorganization energy applied to electron-transfer reactions. The same correction term, scaling inversely with the box size, adds to the reorganization energy from the energy-gap variance but is subtracted from the reorganization energy calculated from the Stokes shift. Finite-size corrections thus widen the gap between these two quantities, which were recently found to diverge for protein electron transfer.

We derive a general relation that connects the energy transfer rate to the linear charge density–density response function of the slab. This function is explicitly evaluated for the HDM and the local Drude model. We show that a thin metal slab can support a series of higher-frequency surface plasma wave (SPW) modes in addition to the normal SPW modes, thanks to the nonlocal effects. These modes markedly alter the response and the energy transfer process, as revealed in the structure of the energy transfer rate in the parameter space.

  abstract = {The great challenge with biological membrane systems is the wide range of scales involved, from nanometers and picoseconds for individual lipids to the micrometers and beyond millisecond for cellular signaling processes. While solvent-free coarse-grained membrane models are convenient for large-scale simulations and promising to provide insight into slow processes involving membranes, these models usually have unrealistic kinetics. One major obstacle is the lack of an equally convenient way of introducing hydrodynamic coupling without significantly increasing the computational cost of the model. To address this, we introduce a framework based on anisotropic Langevin dynamics, for which major in-plane and out-of-plane hydrodynamic effects are modeled via friction and diffusion tensors from analytical or semi-analytical solutions to Stokes hydrodynamic equations. Using this framework, in conjunction with our recently developed membrane model, we obtain accurate dispersion relations for planar membrane patches, both free-standing and in the vicinity of a wall. We briefly discuss how non-equilibrium dynamics is affected by hydrodynamic interactions. We also measure the surface viscosity of the model membrane and discuss the affecting dissipative mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Anisotropic particles are widely presented in nature, from colloidal to bacterial systems, and control over their interactions is of crucial importance for many applications, from self-assembly of novel materials to microfluidics. Placed in rapidly rotating external electric fields, colloidal particles attain a tunable long-range and many-body part in their interactions. For spherical colloids, this approach has been shown to offer rich capabilities to construct the tunable interactions via designing the internal structure of particles and spatial hodographs of external rotating fields, but in the case of anisotropic particles, the interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we show that tunable interactions between anisotropic rod-like and spheroidal colloidal particles in rotating electric or magnetic fields can be calculated and analyzed with the diagrammatic technique we developed in the present work. With this technique, we considered an in-plane rotating electric field, obtained the long-range asymptotics of the anisotropic interactions, calculated the tunable interactions between particles rotating synchronously, and found conditions for rotator repulsion. We compared the mechanisms providing tunable interactions to those for orientational (Keesom), induction (Debye), and dispersion (London) interactions in molecular systems and found that the tunable interactions between anisotropic particles represent a novel kind of dipole-like interaction. The method can be directly generalized for magnetically induced interactions, 3D systems, and fields with spatial hodographs. The results provide significant advance in theoretical methods for tunable interactions in colloids and, therefore, are of broad interest in condensed matter, chemical physics, physical chemistry, materials science, and soft matter.},

  abstract = {Biomacromolecules manifest dynamic conformational fluctuation and involve mutual interconversion among metastable states. A robust mapping of their conformational landscape often requires the low-dimensional projection of the conformational ensemble along optimized collective variables (CVs). However, the traditional choice for the CV is often limited by user-intuition and prior knowledge about the system, and this lacks a rigorous assessment of their optimality over other candidate CVs. To address this issue, we propose an approach in which we first choose the possible combinations of inter-residue C α -distances within a given macromolecule as a set of input CVs. Subsequently, we derive a non-linear combination of latent space embedded CVs via auto-encoding the unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories within the framework of the feed-forward neural network. We demonstrate the ability of the derived latent space variables in elucidating the conformational landscape in four hierarchically complex systems. The latent space CVs identify key metastable states of a bead-in-a-spring polymer. The combination of the adopted dimensional reduction technique with a Markov state model, built on the derived latent space, reveals multiple spatially and kinetically well-resolved metastable conformations for GB1 β -hairpin. A quantitative comparison based on the variational approach-based scoring of the auto-encoder-derived latent space CVs with the ones obtained via independent component analysis (principal component analysis or time-structured independent component analysis) confirms the optimality of the former. As a practical application, the auto-encoder-derived CVs were found to predict the reinforced folding of a Trp-cage mini-protein in aqueous osmolyte solution. Finally, the protocol was able to decipher the conformational heterogeneities involved in a complex metalloenzyme, namely, cytochrome P450.},

At the same time, they present a challenge for direct computer simulations since sufficiently large portions of the bath have to be included in the computation to accurately compute the Coulomb potential. This article presents a reduced-order approach by deriving an open quantum model for the reduced density matrix. To treat the transient dynamics, the problem is placed in a reduced-order framework. The dynamics described by the Liouville–von Neumann equation is projected to subspaces using a Petrov–Galerkin projection. In order to recover the global electron density profile as a vehicle to compute the Coulomb potential, we propose a domain decomposition approach, where the computational domain also includes segments of the bath that are selected using logarithmic grids. This approach leads to a multi-component self-energy that enters the effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the accuracy of the reduced model using a molecular junction built from lithium chains.},

The computational cost of the DF-OCCD(T) method is compared with that of the conventional OCCD(T). In the conventional OCCD(T) and OCCD(T) Λ methods, one needs to perform four-index integral transformations at each coupled-cluster doubles iterations, which limits its applications to large chemical systems. Our results demonstrate that DF-OCCD(T) provides dramatically lower computational costs compared to OCCD(T), and there are more than 68-fold reductions in the computational time for the C 5 H 12 molecule with the cc-pVTZ basis set. Our results show that the DF-OCCD(T) and DF-OCCD(T) Λ methods are very helpful for the study of single bond-breaking problems. Performances of the DF-OCCD(T) and DF-OCCD(T) Λ methods are noticeably better than that of the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] method for the potential energy surfaces of the molecules considered. Specifically, the DF-OCCD(T) Λ method provides dramatic improvements upon CCSD(T), and there are 8–14-fold reductions in nonparallelity errors. Overall, we conclude that the DF-OCCD(T) Λ method is very promising for the study of challenging chemical systems, where the CCSD(T) fails.},

  abstract = {A new time-dependent configuration interaction method has been developed for simulating strong field sequential double ionization of molecular systems. Ionization of the neutral is simulated by time-dependent configuration interaction with single excitations (TD-CIS) and an absorbing boundary. At each time step, the ionized part of the wavefunction from the TD-CIS calculation is transferred to a second time-dependent configuration interaction simulation for ionization of the cation to the dication. The second simulation uses a CISD-IP wavefunction that consists of singly ionized configurations and singly excited, singly ionized configurations (TD-CISD-IP). The transfer between the TD-CIS and TD-CISD-IP simulations is accomplished by partitioning the first ionization rate into contributions from individual orbitals or by singular value decomposition of the absorbed wavefunction. Sequential double ionization simulations have been carried out for HBr in five cycle 800 nm linearly polarized pulses and HI (with spin–orbit coupling) in four cycle 800 nm circularly polarized pulses, with intensities chosen so that the population of the neutral was depleted by the mid-pulse. The singular value decomposition of the cation produced by the first ionization is dominated by a single component for the two orientations considered. The population of the cation rises and then falls as it is ionized to the dication. Depending on the pulse shape and field strength, the ionization of the cation to the dication can continue for several half cycles.

The present work is an extension of the previously proposed revTM+D3 method with the motivation to design and benchmark the dispersion corrected cost-effective method based on this semilocal approximation. We show that the revised revTM+D3 functional provides various general purpose molecular and solid properties with the closest to experimental findings than its predecessor. The present assessment and benchmarking can be practically useful for performing cost-effective method based simulations of various molecular and solid-state properties.},

This allows us to identify the thermodynamic potential and the thermodynamic forces driving light-reacting chemical systems out-of-equilibrium. We use this framework to treat two paradigmatic photochemical mechanisms describing light-induced unimolecular reactions—namely, the adiabatic and diabatic mechanisms—and highlight the different thermodynamics they lead to. Furthermore, using a thermodynamic coarse-graining procedure, we express our findings in terms of commonly measured experimental quantities, such as quantum yields.},

  abstract = {Nonequilibrium thermodynamics as applied to polymeric liquids is limited by the inability to quantify the configurational entropy. There is no known experimental method to determine it rigorously. Theoretically, entropy is based entirely on the configurational microstate of the material, but for polymer liquids, the number of available configurations is immense and covers long length scales associated with the chain-like nature of the constituent molecules. In principle, however, it should be possible to calculate the entropy from a realistic molecular dynamics simulation that contains positional data for each atomic unit making up the polymer macromolecules. However, there are two challenges in calculating the entropy from an atomistic simulation: it is necessary to relate atomic positions to configurational mesostates, depending on the degree of coarse-graining assumed (if any), and then to entropy, and considerable computational resources are required to determine the three-dimensional probability distribution functions of the configurational mesostates. In this study, a method was developed to calculate nonequilibrium entropy using 3d probability distributions for a linear, entangled polyethylene melt undergoing steady-state shear and elongational flow. An approximate equation expressed in terms of second moments of the 3d distributions was also examined, which turned out to provide almost identical values of entropy as the fully 3d distributions at the mesoscopic level associated with the end-to-end vector of the polymer chains.},

These interactions contribute to an effective self-energy of the bulk ions and mediate ion–ion interactions. For flat interfaces, the self-energy and the mediated interactions are neatly constructed by the image charge method. For other geometries, explicit results are scarce and the problem must be treated via approximations or direct computation. The case of interfaces with roughness is of great practical importance. This article provides analytical results, valid to first-order in perturbation theory, for the self-energy of particles near rough substrates. Explicit formulas are provided for the case of a sinusoidal deformation of a flat surface. Generic deformations can be treated by superposition. In addition to results for the self-energy, the surface polarization charge is presented as a quadrature. The interaction between an ion and the deformed surface is modified by the change in relative distance as well as by the local curvature of the surface. Solid walls, with a lower dielectric constant than the liquid, repel all ions. We show that the repulsion is reduced by local convexity and enhanced by concavity; dimples are more repulsive than pimples.},

However, the understanding of the influence of Si 3 N 4 on the properties of water in CNTs lacks clarity. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of the Si 3 N 4 membrane on water molecules inside CNTs. The internal electric field generated in the CNTs by the point charges of the Si 3 N 4 membrane changes the structure and dynamical properties of water in the nanotubes, causing it to attain a disordered structure. The Si 3 N 4 membrane decreases the diffusivity of water in the CNTs; this is because the Coulomb potential energy (i.e., electrostatic interaction) of water decreases owing to the presence of Si 3 N 4 , whereas the Lennard-Jones potential energy (i.e., van der Waals interaction) does not change significantly. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions make the water structure more stable in the CNTs. As a result, the Si 3 N 4 membrane enhances the separation effect of the water–methanol mixture with CNTs in the presence of an external electric field. Furthermore, the threshold of the external electric field strength to induce water–methanol separation with CNTs is reduced owing to the presence of a silicon nitride membrane.},

  abstract = {The most intriguing hypothesis explaining many water anomalies is a metastable liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) at high pressure and low temperatures, experimentally hidden by homogeneous nucleation. Recent infrared spectroscopic experiments showed that upon addition of hydrazinium trifluoroacetate to water, the supercooled ionic solution undergoes a sharp, reversible LLPT at ambient pressure, possible offspring of that in pure water. Here, we calculate the temperature-dependent signature of the OH-stretching band, reporting on the low/high density phase of water, in neat water and in the same experimentally investigated ionic solution. The comparison between the infrared signature of the pure liquid and that of the ionic solution can be achieved only computationally, providing insight into the nature of the experimentally observed phase transition and allowing us to investigate the effects of ionic compounds on the high to low density supercooled liquid water transition. We show that the experimentally observed crossover behavior in the ionic solution can be reproduced only if the phase transition between the low- and high-density liquid states of water is coupled to a mixing–unmixing transition between the water component and the ions: at low temperatures, water and ions are separated and the water component is a low density liquid. At high temperatures, water and ions get mixed and the water component is a high-density liquid. The separation at low temperatures into ion-rich and ion-poor regions allows unveiling the polyamorphic nature of liquid water, leading to a crossover behavior resembling that observed in supercooled neat water under high pressure.},

Containerless high-energy x-ray scattering experiments made using electrostatic levitation are combined with molecular dynamics simulations to probe the onset of rapid structural ordering as well as the temperature-dependent diffusivity and viscosity in three liquids: Cu 49 Zr 45 Al 6 , Cu 47 Zr 45 Al 8 , and Cu 43 Zr 45 Al 12 . These compositions were chosen because they are reported to have dramatically different glass forming-ability. Experimental data show that the first peak in the x-ray static structure factor displays evidence for a Curie–Weiss type behavior, but also a peak in the effective Curie temperature. The evidence provided here for the onset of cooperativity, marked by a crossover temperature, T A (which is usually above the liquidus temperature), is accompanied by the onset of development of more spatially extended structural order in the liquids. Based on the molecular dynamics simulations, each of the liquids exhibits a clear breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation at a temperature near, but below, the crossover temperature, T A . The breakdown is manifest as a rapid reduction in the relative diffusion coefficients between Cu, Zr, and Al.},

These clusters show shared characteristics in terms of molecular structure, being all E-centered icosahedral species, and electron counting, possessing 170 valence electrons as predicted by the electron-counting rules, based on the cluster-borane analogy, for compounds with such metal geometry. However, in some cases, clusters of similar nuclearity, and beyond, may show multivalence behavior and may be stable with a different electron counting, at least on the time scale of the electrochemical analyses. The experimental results, confirmed by theoretical calculations, showed a remarkable electron-sponge behavior for [Rh 12 Ge(CO) 27 ] 4− ( 1 ), [Rh 12 Sb(CO) 27 ] 3− ( 3 ), and [Rh 12 Bi(CO) 27 ] 3− ( 4 ), with a cluster charge going from −2 to −6 for 1 and 3 and from −2 to −7 for cluster 4 , making them examples of molecular electron reservoirs. The [Rh 12 Sn(CO) 27 ] 4− ( 2 ) derivative, conversely, presents a limited ability to exist in separable reduced cluster species, at least within the experimental conditions, while in the gas phase it appears to be stable both as a penta- and hexa-anion, therefore showing a similar redox activity as its congeners. As a fallout of those studies, during the preparation of [Rh 12 Sb(CO) 27 ] 3− , we were able to isolate a new species, namely, [Rh 11 Sb(CO) 26 ] 2− , which presents a Sb-centered nido-icosahedral metal structure possessing 158 cluster valence electrons, in perfect agreement with the polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory.},

  abstract = {While the mid-infrared spectral region spans more than 3000 cm −1 , ultrafast mid-IR spectroscopies are normally limited to the spectral bandwidth that can be generated in optical parametric amplifiers—typically a few hundred cm −1 . As such, the spectral coverage in conventional two dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy captures only about 1\% of the full potential 2D mid-IR spectrum. Here, we present 2D IR spectra using a continuum source as both the excitation and probe pulses, thus capturing close to the full 2D IR spectrum. While the continuum pulses span the entire mid-IR range, they are currently too weak to efficiently excite molecular vibrational modes but strong enough to induce electronic responses and excite phonons in semiconductors. We demonstrate the full spectrum 2D IR spectroscopy of the mid-IR bandgap semiconductor indium arsenide with a bandgap at 2855 cm −1 . The measured response extends far below the bandgap and is due to field-induced band-shifting, causing probe absorption below the bandgap. While the band-shifting induces an instantaneous response that exists only during pulse overlap, the 2D IR spectra reveal additional off-diagonal features that decay on longer timescales. These longer-lived off-diagonal features result from coherent phonons excited via a Raman-like process at specific excitation frequencies. This study illustrates that the full spectrum 2D IR spectroscopy of electronic states in the mid-IR is possible with current continuum pulse technology and is effective in characterizing semiconductor properties.},

  abstract = {We report a proof-of-principle demonstration of intracavity pump–probe, cavity ringdown (CRD) detection in a three-mirror, traveling-wave cavity. With cavity-enhanced pump power and probe absorption path length , the technique is a generally applicable, high-sensitivity, high-selectivity detection method. In our experiments, the pump radiation is switched off during every other probe ringdown, which allows uncorrelated measurements of analyte and background cavity decay rates. The net, two-color signal from the difference between the pump-on and pump-off decay rates is immune to empty-CRD drifts and spectral overlaps from non-target molecular transitions. The immunity to the ringdown drifts allows longer signal-averaging and, thus, higher detection sensitivity. The ability to compensate for the background absorption enhances the detection selectivity in spectrally congested regions. Our technique is well-suited for trace-detection in the mid-IR region, where pump–probe schemes based on strong rovibrational transitions can be applied. In this work, two-color CRD detection is implemented on a ladder-type, three-level system based on the N 2 O, ν 3 = 1 ← 0, P(19) (pump) and ν 3 = 2 ← 1, R(18) (probe), rovibrational transitions. By frequency-locking two-quantum cascade lasers to the p -polarization (pump, Finesse = 5280) and s -polarization (probe, Finesse = 67 700) cavity modes, we achieve high intracavity pump power (36 W) and high probe ringdown rates (&gt;2 kHz). The observed two-color spectra are simulated by a density-matrix, three-level system model that is solved under the constraints of the cavity resonance conditions. In addition to its background compensation capability, experimental flexibility in the selection of pump–probe schemes and signal insensitivity to intracavity laser power are further features that enhance the utility of our technique for mid-IR trace-detection.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a fast and adaptive correlation guided enhanced sampling method (CORE-MD II). The CORE-MD II technique relies, in part, on partitioning of the entire pathway into short trajectories that we refer to as instances. The sampling within each instance is accelerated by adaptive path-dependent metadynamics simulations. The second part of this approach involves kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) sampling between the different states that have been accessed during each instance. Through the combination of the partition of the total simulation into short non-equilibrium simulations and the kMC sampling, the CORE-MD II method is capable of sampling protein folding without any a priori definitions of reaction pathways and additional parameters. In the validation simulations, we applied the CORE-MD II on the dialanine peptide and the folding of two peptides: TrpCage and TrpZip2. In a comparison with long time equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (MD), 1 µ s replica exchange MD (REMD), and CORE-MD I simulations, we find that the level of convergence of the CORE-MD II method is improved by a factor of 8.8, while the CORE-MD II method reaches acceleration factors of ∼120. In the CORE-MD II simulation of TrpZip2, we observe the formation of the native state in contrast to the REMD and the CORE-MD I simulations. The method is broadly applicable for MD simulations and is not restricted to simulations of protein folding or even biomolecules but also applicable to simulations of protein aggregation, protein signaling, or even materials science simulations.},

By applying the bead-shell method, we determine empirical formulas for the microscopic diffusion coefficients. A comparison of these formulas and established experimental and theoretical results shows remarkable agreement. For example, the maximum relative discrepancy found for dumbbells is less than 5\%. As an application example of the empirical formulas, we perform two-dimensional (2D) BD simulations based on a single dumbbell or spherocylinder in a suspension of spheres and calculate the resulting effective long-time diffusion coefficients. The performed BD simulations can be compared to quasi-2D systems such as colloids confined at the interface of two fluids. We find that the effective diffusion coefficient of translation mostly depends on the sphere area fraction ϕ , while the effective diffusion coefficient of rotation is influenced by the aspect ratio and ϕ . Furthermore, the effective rotational diffusion constant seems to depend on the particle shape with the corresponding implementation of the interactions. In the resolution limit of our methods, the shape-dependent differences of the microscopic diffusion coefficients and the long-time diffusion constant of translation are negligible in the first approximation. The determined empirical formulas for the microscopic diffusion coefficients add to the knowledge of the diffusion of anisotropic particles, and they can be used in countless future studies.},

  abstract = {Reactive molecular dynamics simulations enable a detailed understanding of solvent effects on chemical reaction mechanisms and reaction rates. While classical molecular dynamics using reactive force fields allows significantly longer simulation time scales and larger system sizes compared with ab initio molecular dynamics, constructing reactive force fields is a difficult and complex task. In this work, we describe a general approach following the empirical valence bond framework for constructing ab initio reactive force fields for condensed phase simulations by combining physics-based methods with neural networks (PB/NNs). The physics-based terms ensure the correct asymptotic behavior of electrostatic, polarization, and dispersion interactions and are compatible with existing solvent force fields. NNs are utilized for a versatile description of short-range orbital interactions within the transition state region and accurate rendering of vibrational motion of the reacting complex. We demonstrate our methodology for a simple deprotonation reaction of the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation with acetate to form 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazol-2-ylidene and acetic acid. Our PB/NN force field exhibits ∼1 kJ mol −1 mean absolute error accuracy within the transition state region for the gas-phase complex. To characterize the solvent modulation of the reaction profile, we compute potentials of mean force for the gas-phase reaction as well as the reaction within a four-ion cluster and benchmark against ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the surrounding ionic environment significantly destabilizes the formation of the carbene product, and we show that this effect is accurately captured by the reactive force field. By construction, the PB/NN potential may be directly employed for simulations of other solvents/chemical environments without additional parameterization.},

Geometric gauge choices are discussed and necessary for formulating energy invariant biorthogonal electronic equations. Our method is further applied to characterize vibrationally averaged molecular bonding properties of molecular energetics, bond lengths, and protonic and electron densities. Moreover, post-Hartree–Fock electron correlation can be conveniently computed on the basis of nucleus–electron coupled molecular orbitals, as demonstrated for correlated models of second-order Møllet–Plesset perturbation and full configuration interaction theories.

The approach constitutes a hierarchically organized theory for constructing approximate solvation structures around solutes. Given the assumption of universality of atom cluster-specific solvation, reconstruction of the solvent distribution around arbitrary molecules provides a computationally convenient route to solvation thermodynamics. Previously, such solvent reconstructions usually considered the contribution of the nearest-neighbor distribution only. We extend the pDF reconstruction algorithm to terms including next-nearest-neighbor contribution. As a test, small molecules (alanine and butane) are examined. The analysis is then extended to include the protein myoglobin in the P 6 crystal unit cell. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed, and solvent density distributions around the solute molecules are compared with the results from different pDF reconstruction models. It is shown that the next-nearest-neighbor modification significantly improves the reconstruction of the solvent number density distribution in concave regions and between solute molecules. The probability densities are then used to calculate the solute–solvent non-bonded interaction energies including van der Waals and electrostatic, which are found to be in good agreement with the simulated values.},

Higher accuracy for the numerical integration is obtained with new grids that were developed using global optimization techniques. With our new default grids, the average absolute energy errors are much lower than 0.1 kcal/mol, which is desirable to achieve “chemical accuracy.” Although the size of the new grids is increased by roughly a factor of 2.5, the excellent efficiency of the original COSX implementation is still further improved in most cases. The evaluation of the analytic electrostatic potential integrals was significantly accelerated by a new implementation of rolled-out versions of the Dupuis–Rys–King and Head-Gordon–Pople algorithms. Compared to our earlier implementation, a twofold speedup is obtained for the frequently used triple- ζ basis sets, while up to a 16-fold speedup is observed for quadruple- ζ basis sets. These large gains are a consequence of both the more efficient integral evaluation and the intermediate exchange matrix computation in a partially contracted basis when generally contracted shells occur. With our new RIJCOSX implementation, we facilitate accurate self-consistent field (SCF) binding energy calculations on a large supra-molecular complex composed of 320 atoms. The binding-energy errors with respect to the fully analytic results are well below 0.1 kcal/mol for the cc-pV(T/Q)Z basis sets and even smaller than for RIJ with fully analytic exchange. At the same time, our RIJCOSX SCF calculation even with the cc-pVQZ basis and the finest grid is 21 times faster than the fully analytic calculation.},

The methods considered combine approximate sampling of the quantum thermal distribution with classical time propagation and include Matsubara dynamics, path integral dynamics approaches, linearized initial value representation, and the recently introduced adaptive quantum thermal bath. A perturbative analysis of these different methods enables us to account for the observed numerical performance on prototypes for overtones and combination bands and to draw qualitatively correct trends for the numerical results obtained for Fermi resonances. Our results prove that the unequal performances of these approaches often derive from the method employed to sample initial conditions and not, as usually assumed, from the lack of coherence in the time propagation. Furthermore, as confirmed by the analysis reported in Benson and Althorpe, J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 104107 (2021), we demonstrate, both via the perturbative approach and numerically, that path integral dynamics methods fail to reproduce the intensities of these anharmonic features and follow purely classical trends with respect to their temperature behavior. Finally, the remarkably accurate performance of the adaptive quantum thermal bath approach is documented and motivated.},

  abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics (MD) and imaginary-time path-integral dynamics methods underestimate the infrared absorption intensities of overtone and combination bands by typically an order of magnitude. Plé et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 104108 (2021)] have shown that this is because such methods fail to describe the coupling of the centroid to the Matsubara dynamics of the fluctuation modes; classical first-order perturbation theory (PT) applied to the Matsubara dynamics is sufficient to recover most of the lost intensity in simple models and gives identical results to quantum (Rayleigh–Schrödinger) PT. Here, we show numerically that the results of this analysis can be used as post-processing correction factors, which can be applied to realistic (classical MD or path-integral dynamics) simulations of infrared spectra. We find that the correction factors recover most of the lost intensity in the overtone and combination bands of gas-phase water and ammonia and much of it for liquid water. We then re-derive and confirm the earlier PT analysis by applying canonical PT to Matsubara dynamics, which has the advantage of avoiding secular terms and gives a simple picture of the perturbed Matsubara dynamics in terms of action-angle variables. Collectively, these variables “Matsubara heat” the amplitudes of the overtone and combination vibrations of the centroid to what they would be in a classical system with the oscillators (of frequency Ω i ) held at their quantum effective temperatures [of ℏ Ω i coth( βℏ Ω i /2)/2 k B ]. Numerical calculations show that a similar neglect of “Matsubara heating” causes path-integral methods to underestimate Fermi resonance splittings.},

  abstract = {The input of almost every machine learning algorithm targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale involves a transformation of the list of Cartesian atomic coordinates into a more symmetric representation. Many of the most popular representations can be seen as an expansion of the symmetrized correlations of the atom density and differ mainly by the choice of basis. Considerable effort has been dedicated to the optimization of the basis set, typically driven by heuristic considerations on the behavior of the regression target. Here, we take a different, unsupervised viewpoint, aiming to determine the basis that encodes in the most compact way possible the structural information that is relevant for the dataset at hand. For each training dataset and number of basis functions, one can build a unique basis that is optimal in this sense and can be computed at no additional cost with respect to the primitive basis by approximating it with splines. We demonstrate that this construction yields representations that are accurate and computationally efficient, particularly when working with representations that correspond to high-body order correlations. We present examples that involve both molecular and condensed-phase machine-learning models.},

  abstract = {In single-reference coupled-cluster (CC) methods, one has to solve a set of non-linear polynomial equations in order to determine the so-called amplitudes that are then used to compute the energy and other properties. Although it is of common practice to converge to the (lowest-energy) ground-state solution, it is also possible, thanks to tailored algorithms, to access higher-energy roots of these equations that may or may not correspond to genuine excited states. Here, we explore the structure of the energy landscape of variational CC and we compare it with its (projected) traditional version in the case where the excitation operator is restricted to paired double excitations (pCCD). By investigating two model systems (the symmetric stretching of the linear H 4 molecule and the continuous deformation of the square H 4 molecule into a rectangular arrangement) in the presence of weak and strong correlations, the performance of variational pCCD (VpCCD) and traditional pCCD is gauged against their configuration interaction (CI) equivalent, known as doubly occupied CI, for reference Slater determinants made of ground- or excited-state Hartree–Fock orbitals or state-specific orbitals optimized directly at the VpCCD level. The influence of spatial symmetry breaking is also investigated.},

We present a highly efficient approach to compute electrostatic interactions in simulations employing a constant potential method (CPM) by introducing a particle–particle particle–mesh solver specifically designed for treating long-range interactions in a CPM. Moreover, we present evidence that a dipole correction term—commonly used in simulations with a slab-like geometry—must be used with caution if it is also to be used within a CPM. It is demonstrated that artifacts arising from the usage of the dipole correction term can be circumvented by enforcing a charge neutrality condition in the evaluation of the electrode charges at a given external potential.},

  abstract = {The density-functional theory (DFT) approximations that are the most accurate for the calculation of bandgap of bulk materials are hybrid functionals, such as HSE06, the modified Becke–Johnson (MBJ) potential, and the GLLB-SC potential. More recently, generalized gradient approximations (GGAs), such as HLE16, or meta-GGAs, such as (m)TASK, have also proven to be quite accurate for the bandgap. Here, the focus is on two-dimensional (2D) materials and the goal is to provide a broad overview of the performance of DFT functionals by considering a large test set of 298 2D systems. The present work is an extension of our recent studies [T. Rauch, M. A. L. Marques, and S. Botti, Phys. Rev. B 101 , 245163 (2020); Patra et al. , J. Phys. Chem. C 125 , 11206 (2021)]. Due to the lack of experimental results for the bandgap of 2D systems, G 0 W 0 results were taken as reference. It is shown that the GLLB-SC potential and mTASK functional provide the bandgaps that are the closest to G 0 W 0 . Following closely, the local MBJ potential has a pretty good accuracy that is similar to the accuracy of the more expensive hybrid functional HSE06.},

The changes are based on a previously suggested modification [S. Grimme, Chem. Eur. J. 18 , 9955–9964 (2012)] of the molecular entropy calculation in the gas phase. Here, the low energy vibrational frequencies in the vibrational partition function are treated as hindered rotations instead of vibrations. The new scheme is tested on a set of nine organic solvents for the calculation of the enthalpy and entropy of vaporization. The enthalpies and entropies of vaporization show improvements from 6.5 error to 3.3 kJ mol −1 deviation to experiment and from 28.4 error to 13.5 J mol −1 K −1 deviation to experiment, respectively. The effect of the corrected partition function is visible in the different populations of clusters, which become physically more meaningful in that larger clusters are higher populated in the liquid phase and the gas phase is mainly populated by the monomers. Furthermore, the corrected partition function also overcomes technical difficulties and leads to an increased stability of the calculations in regard to the size of the cluster set.},

These techniques are highly sensitive to surface hydrogen, allowing the change in hydrogen adsorption in response to varying amounts of oxygen exposure to be measured. The chemical composition of a nickel surface during a mixed oxygen and hydrogen exposure was characterized with LEIS and DRS, while the uptake and activation energies of hydrogen on a nickel surface with preadsorbed oxygen were quantified with TDS. By and large, these measurements of how the oxygen and hydrogen surface coverage varied in response to oxygen exposure were found to be consistent with predictions of a simple site-blocking model. This finding suggests that, despite the complexities that arise due to polycrystallinity, the oxygen-induced passivation of a polycrystalline nickel surface against hydrogen uptake can be approximated by a simple site-blocking model.},

We studied single-stranded DNA C 4 AC 4 TC 3 XT 4 with X = guanosine and inosine that form a green fluorescent Ag 10 6+ cluster, but these two hosts are distinguished by their binding sites and the brightness of their Ag 10 6+ adducts. The nucleobase subunits in these oligomers collectively coordinate this cluster, and fs time-resolved infrared spectra previously identified one point of contact between the C2–NH 2 of the X = guanosine, an interaction that is precluded for inosine. Furthermore, this single nucleobase controls the cluster fluorescence as the X = guanosine complex is ∼2.5× dimmer. We discuss the electronic relaxation in these two complexes using transient absorption spectroscopy in the time window 200 fs–400 µ s. Three prominent features emerged: a ground state bleach, an excited state absorption, and a stimulated emission. Stimulated emission at the earliest delay time (200 fs) suggests that the emissive state is populated promptly following photoexcitation. Concurrently, the excited state decays and the ground state recovers, and these changes are ∼2× faster for the X = guanosine compared to the X = inosine cluster, paralleling their brightness difference. In contrast to similar radiative decay rates, the nonradiative decay rate is 7× higher with the X = guanosine vs inosine strand. A minor decay channel via a dark state is discussed. The possible correlation between the nonradiative decay and selective coordination with the X = guanosine/inosine suggests that specific nucleobase subunits within a DNA strand can modulate cluster–ligand interactions and, in turn, cluster brightness.},

It has been demonstrated that the choice of density functionals does not qualitatively affect the properties of Au 23 and Au 25 clusters with Ih and FCC cores. The density of states, molecular orbitals, and natural charges were analyzed in detail using the B3LYP functional. The substantial energy difference in the lowest-energy absorption peaks for the clusters with the Ih and FCC cores is attributed to the difference in the natural charges of the central Au atoms (Au c ) in the Ih and FCC cores, the former of which is more negative than the latter. Natural population analysis demonstrates that the excess negative charge of the Au c atom in clusters with Ih cores occupies the 6 p atomic orbitals. This difference in Au c is attributed to the smaller size of the Ih core compared to the FCC core, as a less bulky ligand allows a smaller core with increased electron density, which, in turn, increases the highest occupied molecular orbital energy and decreases the optical gap.},

Exchange reactions of Ho + with O 2 , CO, and SO 2 and HoO + with CO, as well as collision-induced dissociation (CID) reactions of HoO + with Xe, O 2 , and CO, were performed using GIBMS. Formation of HoO + is exothermic in reactions with O 2 and SO 2 but endothermic for reaction with CO, as is the exchange reaction of HoO + with CO. Quantitative analysis of these reactions and the three CID reactions provides a robust method to determine the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of Ho + –O, 6.02 ± 0.13 eV. BDEs for Ho + –C and OHo + –O are also measured as 2.27 ± 0.19 and 2.70 ± 0.27 eV, respectively. All three measurements are the first direct determinations of these BDEs. By combining the BDE of HoO + with the well-established ionization energy of Ho, the exothermicity of Ho in the title chemi-ionization reaction can also be obtained as 0.00 ± 0.13 eV. All experimental thermochemistry was then compared to quantum chemical calculations for the purpose of establishing benchmarks and validation. BDEs determined via these calculations are in agreement with the experiment within the inherent experimental and theoretical uncertainties, with results obtained at the coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, CCSD(T), using all-electron basis sets yielding the most accurate results.},

These nanoplatelet model systems, passivated with formate and acetate ligands, are used to analyze the effects of quantum confinement in the lateral dimension within an extended monolayer and the effects of thickness when changing from two to three monolayers. Based on the computed cubic structures using density functional theory (DFT), we found good agreement between observed and time-dependent DFT-calculated spectra, revealing little ligand participation to influence the color and intensity of low-energy absorption bands as the structures are laterally extended to eight and seven monolayers for 2-ML and 3-ML systems, respectively. The spectral redshift for 3-ML CdS NPLs is attributed to the electron delocalization due to expansion of the nanoplatelet in the lateral and vertical directions.},

Compared to methods for static samples, this approach has the benefit of higher sensitivity and resolution. Moreover, the PASS experiment has the advantage over previous MAS sequences in the ability to completely separate the shift anisotropy and first-order quadrupolar interactions. However, the main drawback of the pulse sequence is the lower excitation bandwidth. The sequence is comprehensively evaluated using theoretical calculations and numerical simulations and applied experimentally to the 2 H NMR of a range of paramagnetic systems: deuterated nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate, deuterated copper(II) chloride dihydrate, and two forms of deuterated oxyhydride ion conductor BaTiO 3− x H y . Our results show that despite the issue with broadband excitation, the extracted shift and quadrupolar interaction tensors and the Euler angles relating the two tensors match well with the NMR parameters obtained with static NMR methods. Therefore, the new application of the PASS experiment is an excellent addition to the arsenal of NMR experiments for 2 H and potentially 14 N in paramagnetic solids.},

  abstract = {A new approach termed Adaptive Solvent-Scaling (AdSoS) is introduced for performing simulations of a solute embedded in a fine-grained (FG) solvent region itself surrounded by a coarse-grained (CG) solvent region, with a continuous FG ↔ CG switching of the solvent resolution across a buffer layer. Instead of relying on a distinct CG solvent model, the AdSoS scheme is based on CG models defined by a dimensional scaling of the FG solvent by a factor s , accompanied by an s -dependent modulation of the atomic masses and interaction parameters. The latter changes are designed to achieve an isomorphism between the dynamics of the FG and CG models, and to preserve the dispersive and dielectric solvation properties of the solvent with respect to a solute at FG resolution. This scaling approach offers a number of advantages compared to traditional coarse-graining: (i) the CG parameters are immediately related to those of the FG model (no need to parameterize a distinct CG model); (ii) nearly ideal mixing is expected for CG variants with similar s -values (ideal mixing holding in the limit of identical s -values); (iii) the solvent relaxation timescales should be preserved (no dynamical acceleration typical for coarse-graining); (iv) the graining level N G (number of FG molecules represented by one CG molecule) can be chosen arbitrarily (in particular, N G = s 3 is not necessarily an integer); and (v) in an adaptive-resolution scheme, this level can be varied continuously as a function of the position (without requiring a bundling mechanism), and this variation occurs at a constant number of particles per molecule (no occurrence of fractional degrees of freedom in the buffer layer). By construction, the AdSoS scheme minimizes the thermodynamic mismatch between the different regions of the adaptive-resolution system, leading to a nearly homogeneous scaled solvent density s 3 ρ . Residual density artifacts in and at the surface of the boundary layer can easily be corrected by means of a grid-based biasing potential constructed in a preliminary pure-solvent simulation. This article introduces the AdSoS scheme and provides an initial application to pure atomic liquids (no solute) with Lennard-Jones plus Coulomb interactions in a slab geometry.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive and detailed account is presented for the finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory for electrons that expands in power series all thermodynamic functions on an equal footing. Algebraic recursions in the style of the Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory are derived for the grand potential, chemical potential, internal energy, and entropy in the grand canonical ensemble and for the Helmholtz energy, internal energy, and entropy in the canonical ensemble, leading to their sum-over-states analytical formulas at any arbitrary order. For the grand canonical ensemble, these sum-over-states formulas are systematically transformed to sum-over-orbitals reduced analytical formulas by the quantum-field-theoretical techniques of normal-ordered second quantization and Feynman diagrams extended to finite temperature. It is found that the perturbation corrections to energies entering the recursions have to be treated as a nondiagonal matrix, whose off-diagonal elements are generally nonzero within a subspace spanned by degenerate Slater determinants. They give rise to a unique set of linked diagrams—renormalization diagrams—whose resolvent lines are displaced upward, which are distinct from the well-known anomalous diagrams of which one or more resolvent lines are erased. A linked-diagram theorem is introduced that proves the size-consistency of the finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory at any order. General-order algorithms implementing the recursions establish the convergence of the perturbation series toward the finite-temperature full-configuration-interaction limit unless the series diverges. The normal-ordered Hamiltonian at finite temperature sheds light on the relationship between the finite-temperature Hartree–Fock and first-order many-body perturbation theories.},

The conformational distributions yielded the free energy profiles of the DFT functional and basis set combinations. Unlike traditional validations of potential energy and structural parameters, our approach allows the free energy of DFT to be validated. When compared to experimental distributions, the def2-TZVP basis set provides better agreement than a slightly trimmed aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. B3LYP is shown to be better than BP86 and PBE. The glycine model fitted against B3LYP-D3(BJ) with the def2-TZVP basis set is the most accurate and named the AFM2021 model for glycine. The AFM2021 glycine model provides better agreement with experimental J-coupling constants than C36m and ff14SB, although the margin is very small when compared to C36m. Our previously published alanine model is also refitted with the slightly simplified AFM2021 energy expression.

  abstract = {Bottom-up coarse-graining methods provide systematic tools for creating simplified models of molecular systems. However, coarse-grained (CG) models produced with such methods frequently fail to accurately reproduce all thermodynamic properties of the reference atomistic systems they seek to model and, moreover, can fail in even more significant ways when used at thermodynamic state points different from the reference conditions. These related problems of representability and transferability limit the usefulness of CG models, especially those of strongly state-dependent systems. In this work, we present a new strategy for creating temperature-transferable CG models using a single reference system and temperature. The approach is based on two complementary concepts. First, we switch to a microcanonical basis for formulating CG models, focusing on effective entropy functions rather than energy functions. This allows CG models to naturally represent information about underlying atomistic energy fluctuations, which would otherwise be lost. Such information not only reproduces energy distributions of the reference model but also successfully predicts the correct temperature dependence of the CG interactions, enabling temperature transferability. Second, we show that relative entropy minimization provides a direct and systematic approach to parameterize such classes of temperature-transferable CG models. We calibrate the approach initially using idealized model systems and then demonstrate its ability to create temperature-transferable CG models for several complex molecular liquids.},

The approach was successfully realized in a Lennard-Jones system by inserting two movable external walls, each consisting of a single crystal layer, into a bulk crystal to create flat, defect-free surfaces. The cleavage technique designed allowed us to calculate the surface free energy according to its definition and avoid surface premelting. The temperature dependence of γ was determined for the (100) and (110) crystal planes along the whole sublimation line and its metastable extension, up to T = 1.02 · T m , where T m is the melting point. Good agreement with indirect values of γ( T ) was found. The proposed computational cleavage method can be applied to other solids of interest, providing valuable insight into the understanding of chemical and physical surface processes, and demonstrates the successful import of the cleavage method, traditionally used in technical preparation and study of crystal surfaces, into a modern atomistic simulation.},

Phys. 137 , 165102 (2012)] can provide a kinetic description of protein pulling experiments, allowing for a connection to be made between experiment and the atomistic protein structure. BXD theory applied to atomic force microscopy unfolding is similar in spirit to the kinetic two-state model [A. Noy and R. W. Friddle, Methods 60 , 142 (2013)] but with some differences. First, BXD uses a large number of boxes, and therefore, it is not a two-state model. Second, BXD rate coefficients are obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. BXD can describe the dependence of the pulling force on pulling speed. Similar to Shalashilin et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 165102 (2012)], we show that BXD is able to model the experiment at a very long time scale up to seconds, which is way out of reach for standard molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {As first explained by the classic Asakura–Oosawa (AO) model, effective attractive forces between colloidal particles induced by depletion of nonadsorbing polymers can drive demixing of colloid–polymer mixtures into colloid-rich and colloid-poor phases, with practical relevance for purification of water, stability of foods and pharmaceuticals, and macromolecular crowding in biological cells. By idealizing polymer coils as effective penetrable spheres, the AO model qualitatively captures the influence of polymer depletion on thermodynamic phase behavior of colloidal suspensions. In previous work, we extended the AO model to incorporate aspherical polymer conformations and showed that fluctuating shapes of random-walk coils can significantly modify depletion potentials [W. K. Lim and A. R. Denton, Soft Matter 12 , 2247 (2016); J. Chem. Phys. 144 , 024904 (2016)]. We further demonstrated that the shapes of polymers in crowded environments sensitively depend on solvent quality [W. J. Davis and A. R. Denton, J. Chem. Phys. 149 , 124901 (2018)]. Here, we apply Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the influence of solvent quality on depletion potentials in mixtures of hard-sphere colloids and nonadsorbing polymer coils, modeled as ellipsoids whose principal radii fluctuate according to random-walk statistics. We consider both self-avoiding and non-self-avoiding random walks, corresponding to polymers in good and theta solvents, respectively. Our simulation results demonstrate that depletion of polymers of equal molecular weight induces much stronger attraction between colloids in good solvents than in theta solvents and confirm that depletion interactions are significantly influenced by aspherical polymer conformations.},

  abstract = {Tunable interactions between colloidal particles, governed by external rotating electric or magnetic fields, yield rich capabilities for prospective self-assembly technologies of materials and fundamental particle-resolved studies of phase transitions and transport phenomena in soft matter. However, the role of the internal structure of colloidal particles in the tunable interactions has never been systematically investigated. Here, we study the tunable interactions between composite particles with core–shell structure in a rotating electric field and show that the engineering of their internal structure provides an effective tool for designing the interactions. We generalized an integral theory and studied the tunable interactions between core–shell particles with homogeneous cores (layered particles) and cores with nano-inclusions to reveal the main trends in the interactions influenced by the structure. We found that depending on the materials of the core, shell, and solvent, the interactions with the attractive pairwise part and positive or negative three-body part can be obtained, as well as pairwise repulsion with attractive three-body interactions (for triangular triplets). The latter case is observed for the first time, being unattainable for homogeneous particles but feasible with core–shell particles: Qualitatively similar interactions are inherent to charged colloids (repulsive pairwise and attractive three-body energies), known as a model system of globular proteins. The methods and conclusions of our paper can be generalized for magnetic and 3D colloidal systems. The results make a significant advance in the analysis of tunable interactions in colloidal systems, which are of broad interest in condensed matter, chemical physics, physical chemistry, materials science, and soft matter.},

  abstract = {Understanding and manipulating micelle morphology are key to exploiting surfactants in various applications. Recent studies have shown surfactant self-assembly in a variety of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) where both the nature of surfactants and the interaction of the surfactant molecule with the solvent components influence the size, shape, and morphology of the micelles formed. So far, micelle formation has only been reported in type III DESs, consisting solely of organic species. In this work, we have explored the self-assembly of cationic surfactant dodecyl trimethylammonium nitrate/bromide (C 12 TANO 3 /C 12 TAB), anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and non-ionic surfactants hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C 12 EO 6 ) and octaethylene glycol monohexadecyl ether (C 16 EO 8 ) in a type IV DES comprising metal salt, cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate, and a hydrogen bond donor, urea, in the molar ratio 1:3.5. C 12 TANO 3 , C 12 TAB, C 12 EO 6 , and C 16 EO 8 form spherical micelles in the DES with the micelle size dependent on both the surfactant alkyl chain length and the head group, whereas SDS forms cylindrical micelles. We hypothesize that the difference in the micelle shape can be explained by counterion stabilization of the SDS headgroup by polycations in the DES compared to the nitrate/bromide anion interaction in the case of cationic surfactants or molecular interaction of the urea and the salting out effect of (CeNO 3 ) 3 in the DES on the alkyl chains/polyethoxy headgroup for non-ionic surfactants. These studies deepen our understanding of amphiphile self-assembly in this novel, ionic, and hydrogen-bonding solvent, raising the opportunity to use these structures as liquid crystalline templates to generate porosity in metal oxides (ceria) that can be synthesized using these DESs.},

We find that the microswimmer can enhance its success rate in finding the target by tuning its activity and its persistence in response to features of the environment. The target-search patterns of active Brownian particles are counterintuitive and display characteristics robust to changes in the energy landscape. On the contrary, the transition rates and transition-path times are sensitive to the details of the specific energy landscape. In striking contrast to the passive case, the presence of additional local minima does not significantly slow down the active-target-search dynamics.},

However, rubbing does not significantly influence the orientation of the isopropyl group at the end of the polymer side chain.

Specifically, we control the stoichiometry of both anions (P, As, S, and Se) and cations (In and Zn) at the InP/ZnSe core/shell interface and correlate these changes with the resultant steady-state and time-resolved optical properties of the nanocrystals. The use of reactive trimethylsilyl reagents results in surface-limited reactions that shift the nanocrystal stoichiometry to anion-rich and improve epitaxial growth of the shell layer. In general, anion deposition on the InP QD surface results in a redshift in the absorption, quenching of the excitonic photoluminescence, and a relative increase in the intensity of broad trap-based photoluminescence, consistent with delocalization of the exciton wavefunction and relaxation of exciton confinement. Time-resolved photoluminescence data for the resulting InP/ZnSe QDs show an overall small change in the decay dynamics on the ns timescale, suggesting that the relatively low photoluminescence quantum yields may be attributed to the creation of new thermally activated charge trap states and likely a dark population that is inseparable from the emissive QDs. Cluster-model density functional theory calculations show that the presence of core/shell interface anions gives rise to electronic defects contributing to the redshift in the absorption. These results highlight a general strategy to atomistically tune the interfacial stoichiometry of InP QDs using surface-limited reaction chemistry allowing for precise correlations with the electronic structure and photophysical properties.},

  abstract = {Water exchange between the first and second hydration shell is essential for the role of Mg 2+ in biochemical processes. In order to provide microscopic insights into the exchange mechanism, we resolve the exchange pathways by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and transition path sampling. Since the exchange kinetics relies on the choice of the water model and the ionic force field, we systematically investigate the influence of seven different polarizable and non-polarizable water and three different Mg 2+ models. In all cases, water exchange can occur either via an indirect or direct mechanism (exchanging molecules occupy different/same position on the water octahedron). In addition, the results reveal a crossover from an interchange dissociative (I d ) to an associative (I a ) reaction mechanism dependent on the range of the Mg 2+ –water interaction potential of the respective force field. Standard non-polarizable force fields follow the I d mechanism in agreement with experimental results. By contrast, polarizable and long-ranged non-polarizable force fields follow the I a mechanism. Our results provide a comprehensive view on the influence of the water model and the ionic force field on the exchange dynamics and the foundation to assess the choice of the force field in biomolecular simulations.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigated the effects of a single covalent link between hydrogen bond donor species on the behavior of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and shed light on the resulting interactions at molecular scale that influence the overall physical nature of the DES system. We have compared sugar-based DES mixtures, 1:2 choline chloride/glucose [DES (g) ] and 1:1 choline chloride/trehalose [DES (t) ]. Trehalose is a disaccharide composed of two glucose units that are connected by an α-1,4-glycosidic bond, thus making it an ideal candidate for comparison with glucose containing DES (g) . The differential scanning calorimetric analysis of these chemically close DES systems revealed significant difference in their phase transition behavior. The DES (g) exhibited a glass transition temperature of −58 °C and behaved like a fluid at higher temperatures, whereas DES (t) exhibited marginal phase change behavior at −11 °C and no change in the phase behavior at higher temperatures. The simulations revealed that the presence of the glycosidic bond between sugar units in DES (t) hindered free movement of sugar units in trehalose, thus reducing the number of interactions with choline chloride compared to free glucose molecules in DES (g) . This was further confirmed using quantum theory of atoms in molecule analysis that involved determination of bond critical points (BCPs) using Laplacian of electron density. The analysis revealed a significantly higher number of BCPs between choline chloride and sugar in DES (g) compared to DES (t) . The DES (g) exhibited a higher amount of charge transfer between the choline cation and sugar, and better interaction energy and enthalpy of formation compared to DES (t) . This is a result of the ability of free glucose molecules to completely surround choline chloride in DES (g) and form a higher number of interactions. The entropy of formation for DES (t) was slightly higher than that for DES (g) , which is a result of fewer interactions between trehalose and choline chloride. In summary, the presence of the glycosidic bond between the sugar units in trehalose limited their movement, thus resulting in fewer interactions with choline chloride. This limited movement in turn diminishes the ability of the hydrogen bond donor to disrupt the molecular packing within the lattice structure of the hydrogen bond acceptor (and vice versa), a crucial factor that lowers the melting point of DES mixtures. This inability to move due to the presence of the glycosidic bond in trehalose significantly influences the physical state of the DES (t) system, making it behave like a semi-solid material, whereas DES (g) behaves like a liquid material at room temperature.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents as sustainable and new-generation solvents show potential in the field of cellulose dissolution. Although these novel materials are tested for numerous industrial, environmental, and medical applications, little is known about the structural features of cellulose interacting with deep eutectic solvents. In this work, the interplay of cellulose is studied in two deep eutectic solvents: choline acetate mixed with urea and choline chloride mixed with urea using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Dissolution of cellulose in the studied liquids was not observed to be in agreement with experimental work from the literature. However, a slight swelling in the chloride, as compared to the acetate-based solvent, is apparent. A possible rationale might be found in the stronger hydrogen bonding of the chloride anion compared to the acetate anion with the hydrogen atoms of the cellulose. Moreover, chloride approaches the outer glucose units comparatively more, which could be interpreted as the onset of entering and thus dissolving the cellulose as was previously observed. Specific hydrogen bonds between all units are analyzed and discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {The electron impact ionization of helium droplets doped with ethylene molecules and clusters yields diverse C X H Y + cations embedded in the droplets. The ionization primarily produces C 2 H 2 + , C 2 H 3 + , C 2 H 4 + , and CH 2 + , whereas larger carbocations are produced upon the reactions of the primary ions with ethylene molecules. The vibrational excitation of the cations leads to the release of bare cations and cations with a few helium atoms attached. The laser excitation spectra of the embedded cations show well resolved vibrational bands with a few wavenumber widths—an order of magnitude less than those previously obtained in solid matrices or molecular beams by tagging techniques. Comparison with the previous studies of free and tagged CH 2 + , CH 3 + , C 2 H 2 + , C 2 H 3 + , and C 2 H 4 + cations shows that the helium matrix typically introduces a shift in the vibrational frequencies of less than about 20 cm −1 , enabling direct comparisons with the results of quantum chemical calculations for structure determination. This work demonstrates a facile technique for the production and spectroscopic study of diverse carbocations, which act as important intermediates in gas and condensed phases.},

To assess the accuracy and self-consistency of our set, we also review electron swarm transport coefficients in pure NO and admixtures of NO in Ar, for which we perform a multi-term Boltzmann equation analysis. We address observed discrepancies with these experimental measurements by training an artificial neural network to solve the inverse problem of unfolding the underlying electron-NO cross sections while using our initial cross section set as a base for this refinement. In this way, we refine a suitable quasielastic momentum transfer cross section, a dissociative electron attachment cross section, and a neutral dissociation cross section. We confirm that the resulting refined cross section set has an improved agreement with the experimental swarm data over that achieved with our initial set. We also use our refined database to calculate electron transport coefficients in NO, across a large range of density-reduced electric fields from 0.003 to 10 000 Td.},

Twelve lowest-lying vertical IPs were determined through the use of the coupled-cluster level of theory using correlation consistent basis sets with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and consideration of core electron correlation effects. Specifically, the equation-of-motion ionization potential coupled-cluster with single and double excitations method with the aug-cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pCVnZ (n = D and T) basis sets was used. The Feller–Peterson–Dixon (FPD) composite approach was employed to provide accurate IPs, and eight conformations of (H 2 CO) 3 were considered. The FPD IPs determined for (H 2 CO) 3 were found to be systematically lower than those computed for the dimer and monomer of H 2 CO in the pattern IP ( monomer ) &gt; IP ( dimer ) &gt; IP ( trimer ) for a given IP. In addition, the IPs calculated when considering only the more stable conformation (C 0 ) are in good agreement with those obtained using the eight conformations of the H 2 CO trimer, and thus, the actual conformation played only a minor role in determining such properties in the present case. By providing first accurate IP results for the H 2 CO trimer, we hope to motivate future experimental and computational investigations (e.g., studies involving photoionization) that rely on such quantities.},

The RPA shows significant basis set size dependence for binding energies. The order of the relative energies of the water hexamer and dodecamer isomers is predicted correctly by the RPA. The mean absolute deviation for angles and distances for neutral clusters up to the water hexamer are 0.2° and 0.6 pm, respectively, using quintuple- ζ basis sets. The relative energetic order of the hexamer isomers is preserved upon optimization. Vibrational frequencies for these systems are underestimated by several tens of wavenumbers for large basis sets, and deviations increase with the basis set size. Overall, the direct RPA method yields accurate structural parameters but systematically underestimates binding energies and shows strong basis set size dependence.},

Basis set superposition error correction was also considered by the full counterpoise procedure. Gaussian process regression (GPR) was used to map out the potential energy surface, while a multipole expansion method was employed to smooth the ab initio noise of intermolecular potential in the long range. The global minimum of −1248.364 cm −1 was located at the linear configuration with the C atom pointing toward the H atom of the HF molecule. In addition, a local minimum of −602.026 cm −1 was found at another linear configuration with the O atom pointing toward the H atom of the HF molecule. The eigenstates were calculated on the vibrational averaged four-dimensional IPESs with the mixed radial discrete variable representation/angular finite basis representation method and Lanczos propagation algorithm. The dissociation energy D 0 was calculated to be 701.827 cm −1 , well reproducing the experimental value of 732 ± 2 cm −1 . The dipole moment surfaces were also fitted by GPR from 3132 ab initio points calculated using the coupled cluster method [CCSD(T)] with AVTZ basis set plus bond functions. The frequencies and relative line intensities of rovibrational transitions in the HF (DF) and CO stretching bands were further calculated and compared well with the experimental results. These results indicate the high fidelity of the new IPES.},

  abstract = {Designing atom-precise bimetallic clusters with a relatively cost-effective and more abundant metal than Au (i.e., Ag) is desirable for the development of heterogeneous bimetallic cluster catalysts for industrial applications. Atom-precise Ag-based bimetallic clusters, which are analogs of the well-studied Au based clusters, are yet to be fully explored as catalysts. Establishing the Pd loading limit and the position of the Pd dopant in AgPd bimetallic clusters will further give an insight into the structure–activity relationships for these atom-precise AgPd heterogeneous catalysts. In this study, an improved single-pot co-reduction strategy was employed to prepare the bimetallic clusters, which were then characterized by mass spectrometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to identify the loading and position of the dopant metal. Our results show that only a single dopant Pd atom can be incorporated, and in comparison with monometallic Ag 25 clusters, the absorption peaks of Ag 24 Pd 1 (SPhMe 2 ) 18 2− bimetallic clusters are blue shifted due to the incorporation of Pd. The XPS and XAS results show that the Ag 24 Pd 1 (SPhMe 2 ) 18 2− bimetallic clusters have multivalent Ag(0) and Ag(I) atoms and surprisingly show Pd(II) species with significant Pd–S bonding, despite the prevailing wisdom that the Pd dopant should be in the center of the cluster. The XAS results show that the singly doped Pd atom predominantly occupies the staple position, albeit we cannot unambiguously rule out the Pd atom in an icosahedral surface position in some clusters. We discuss the ramifications of these results in terms of possible kinetically vs thermodynamically controlled cluster formation.},

  abstract = {The homonuclear dipolar coupling is the internal spin interaction that contributes the most to the line shapes in magic-angle-spinning (MAS) 1 H NMR spectra of solids, and linewidths typically extend over several hundred Hertz, limiting the 1 H resolution. Understanding and reducing this contribution could provide rich structural information for organic solids. Here, we use average Hamiltonian theory to study two- and three-spin systems in the fast MAS regime. Specifically, we develop analytical expressions to third order in the case of two and three inequivalent spins (I = ½). The results show that the full third-order expression of the Hamiltonian, without secular approximations or truncation to second order, is the description that agrees the best, by far, with full numerical calculations. We determine the effect on the NMR spectrum of the different Hamiltonian terms, which are shown to produce both residual shifts and splittings in the three-spin systems. Both the shifts and splittings have a fairly complex dependence on the spinning rate with the eigenstates having a polynomial ω r dependence. The effect on powder line shapes is also shown, and we find that the anisotropic residual shift does not have zero average so that the powder line shape is broadened and shifted from the isotropic position. This suggests that in 1 H MAS spectra, even at the fastest MAS rates attainable today, the positions observed are not exactly the isotropic shifts.},

Our results showcase the drastic improvement of the accuracy by using the trajectory-adjusted γ -corrections, which outperform the widely used trajectory surface hopping method with decoherence corrections. These calculations provide useful and non-trivial tests to systematically investigate the numerical performance of various diabatic quantum dynamics approaches, going beyond simple diabatic model systems that have been used as the major workhorse in the quantum dynamics field.

The reformulation includes an additional eight-body force that arises from an explicit configuration-dependent term in the potential energy function, resulting in a coarse-grained energy-conserving force field for molecular dynamics simulations of chirality phenomena. In this model, the coarse-grained interaction energy between two tetramers depends on their respective chiralities and is controlled by a parameter λ , where λ 0 gives energetic preference to configurations involving tetramers of the same chirality. We compute the autocorrelation function for a quantitative chirality metric and demonstrate that the multi-body force modifies the interconversion kinetics such that λ ≠ 0 increases the effective barrier for enantiomer inversion. Our simulations reveal that for λ &gt; 0 and temperatures below a sharply defined threshold value, this effect is dramatic, giving rise to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and locking molecules into their chiral identity.},

The use of efficient simulation algorithms, i.e., the complex polarizability polTDDFT approach and the hybrid-diagonal approximation, allows us to employ a variety of exchange-correlation (xc-) functionals at an affordable computational cost. We are thus able to show, first, how the optical response of this prototypical compound, especially but not exclusively in the absorption threshold (low-energy) region, is sensitive to (1) the choice of the xc-functionals employed in the Kohn–Sham equations and the TDDFT kernel and (2) the choice of the MPC geometry. By comparing simulated spectra with precise experimental photoabsorption data obtained from room temperature down to low temperatures, we then demonstrate how a hybrid xc-functional in both the Kohn–Sham equations and the diagonal TDDFT kernel at the crystallographically determined experimental geometry is able to provide a consistent agreement between simulated and measured spectra across the entire optical region. Single-particle decomposition analysis tools finally allow us to understand the physical reason for the failure of non-hybrid approaches.},

The performance of the new method is compared to Kohn–Sham density functional theory and the ab initio complete active space self-consistent field for a selected set of molecules with good reference values. Two density functionals have been considered, the local density approximation srLDA and srPBE from the GGA class of functionals. All srDFT calculations are of Hartree–Fock-type HF-srDFT or complete active space-type CAS-srDFT. In all cases, the calculated SSCC values are of the same quality for srLDA and srPBE functionals, suggesting that one should use the computationally cost-effective srLDA functionals in applications. For all the calculated SSCCs in organic compounds, the best choice is HF-srDFT; the more expensive CAS-srDFT does not provide better values for these single-reference molecules. Fluorine is a challenge; in particular, the FF, FC, and FO couplings have much higher statistical errors than the rest. For SSCCs involving fluorine and a metal atom CAS-srDFT with singlet, generalized Tamm–Dancoff approximation is needed to get good SSCC values although the reference ground state is not a multi-reference case. For V F 6 − 1 ⁠ , all other considered models fail blatantly.},

  abstract = {Accurate modeling of the solvent environment for biological molecules is crucial for computational biology and drug design. A popular approach to achieve long simulation time scales for large system sizes is to incorporate the effect of the solvent in a mean-field fashion with implicit solvent models. However, a challenge with existing implicit solvent models is that they often lack accuracy or certain physical properties compared to explicit solvent models as the many-body effects of the neglected solvent molecules are difficult to model as a mean field. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) and multi-scale coarse graining (CG) in order to learn implicit solvent models that can approximate the energetic and thermodynamic properties of a given explicit solvent model with arbitrary accuracy, given enough training data. Following the previous ML–CG models CGnet and CGSchnet, we introduce ISSNet, a graph neural network, to model the implicit solvent potential of mean force. ISSNet can learn from explicit solvent simulation data and be readily applied to molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the solute conformational distributions under different solvation treatments for two peptide systems. The results indicate that ISSNet models can outperform widely used generalized Born and surface area models in reproducing the thermodynamics of small protein systems with respect to explicit solvent. The success of this novel method demonstrates the potential benefit of applying machine learning methods in accurate modeling of solvent effects for in silico research and biomedical applications.},

Therefore, their potential use in practical quantum-enhanced molecular spectroscopy requires close examination. This Tutorial presents a detailed theoretical study of one- and two-photon absorption by molecules, focusing on how to treat the quantum nature of light. We review some basic quantum optics theory and then we review the density-matrix (Liouville) derivation of molecular optical response, emphasizing how to incorporate quantum states of light into the treatment. For illustration, we treat in detail the TPA of photon pairs created by spontaneous parametric down conversion, with an emphasis on how quantum light TPA differs from that with classical light. In particular, we treat the question of how much enhancement of the TPA rate can be achieved using entangled states. This Tutorial includes a review of known theoretical methods and results as well as some extensions, especially the comparison of TPA processes that occur via far-off-resonant intermediate states only and those that involve off-resonant intermediate states by virtue of dephasing processes. A brief discussion of the main challenges facing experimental studies of entangled two-photon absorption is also given.},

In this work, we evaluate the bandgap predictions of partitioned equation-of-motion MP2 (P-EOM-MP2), which is a second-order approximation to EOM coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations. On a test set of elemental and binary semiconductors and insulators, we find that P-EOM-MP2 overestimates bandgaps by 0.3 eV on average, which can be compared to the underestimation by 0.6 eV on average exhibited by the G 0 W 0 approximation with a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof reference. We show that P-EOM-MP2, when interpreted as a Green’s function-based theory, has a self-energy that includes all first- and second-order diagrams and a few third-order diagrams. We find that the GW approximation performs better for materials with small gaps and P-EOM-MP2 performs better for materials with large gaps, which we attribute to their superior treatment of screening and exchange, respectively.},

We have adopted proline-rich collagen models in line with the high content of proline in natural collagens. Our scaled harmonic vibrational spectra are in very good agreement with the experiments and allow for the peak assignment of the collagen amide I and III bands, supporting or questioning the experimental interpretation by means of vibrational normal modes analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IR spectroscopy in the THz region can detect the small variations inherent to the triple helix helicity (10/3 over 7/2), thus elucidating the packing state of the collagen. So far, identifying the collagen helicity is only possible by means of crystal x-ray diffraction.},

  abstract = {Intercellular fluids in living organisms contain high concentrations of macromolecules such as nucleic acid and protein. Over the past few decades, several studies have examined membraneless organelles in terms of liquid–liquid phase separation. These studies have investigated aggregation/attraction among a rich variety of biomolecules. Here, we studied the association between the polymerization/depolymerization of actin, interconversion between monomeric (G-actin) and filamentous states (F-actin), and water/water phase separation in a binary polymer solution using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (DEX). We found that actin, which is a representative cytoskeleton, changes its distribution in a PEG/DEX binary solution depending on its polymerization state: monomeric G-actin is distributed homogeneously throughout the solution, whereas polymerized F-actin is localized only within the DEX-rich phase. We extended our study by using fragmin, which is a representative actin-severing and -depolymerizing factor. It took hours to restore a homogeneous actin distribution from localization within the DEX-rich phase, even with the addition of fragmin in an amount that causes complete depolymerization. In contrast, when actin that had been depolymerized by fragmin in advance was added to a solution with microphase-separation, F-actin was found in DEX-rich phase droplets. The micro-droplets tended to deform into a non-spherical morphology under conditions where they contained F-actin. These findings suggest that microphase-separation is associated with the dynamics of polymerization and localization of the actin cytoskeleton. We discuss our observations by taking into consideration the polymer depletion effect.},

Here, we investigate the equilibrium state reached by discoidal colloids in a solution of smaller depletant particles.

We test the validity of the model by using Langevin simulations of a system of discs and depletant particles in which the depletion interaction emerges naturally. In addition, we consider the effect of an attractive interaction between depletant and discoidal particles, which we show induces a re-entrant dependence of aggregation with temperature.},

Here, we search for vibrational signatures of the re-entrant behavior in the short-time spatiotemporal dynamics, i.e., dynamics associated with particle motion inside its nearest-neighbor cage. Interestingly, we observe that the anharmonicity of these in-cage vibrations varies non-monotonically with increasing attraction strength, consistent with the non-monotonic long-time structural relaxation dynamics of the re-entrant glass. We also extract effective spring constants between neighboring particles; we find that spring stiffness involving small particles also varies non-monotonically with increasing attraction strength, while stiffness between large particles increases monotonically. Last, from study of depletion-dependent local structure and vibration participation fractions, we gain microscopic insight into the particle-size-dependent contributions to short-time vibrational modes in the glass and supercooled liquid states.},

While both systems exhibit a general tendency toward supramolecular organization in solution, bottlebrush poly(sodium acrylate) solutions exhibit a distinctive “polyelectrolyte peak” in their structure factor, but no such peak is observed in aggrecan solutions. This qualitative difference in scattering properties, and thus polyelectrolyte solution organization, is attributed to a concerted effect of the bottlebrush polymer topology and the solvation of the polymer backbone and counterions. The coupling of the polyelectrolyte topological structure with the counterion distribution about the charged polymer molecules along with direct polymer segmental hydration makes their solution organization and properties “tunable,” a phenomenon that has significant ramifications for biological function and disease as well as for numerous materials applications.},

The three packages, ænet, TINKER, and LAMMPS, are free and open-source software that enable, in combination, accurate simulations of large and complex systems with low computational cost that scales linearly with the number of atoms. Scaling tests show that the parallel efficiency of the ænet–TINKER interface is nearly optimal but is limited to shared-memory systems. The ænet–LAMMPS interface achieves excellent parallel efficiency on highly parallel distributed-memory systems and benefits from the highly optimized neighbor list implemented in LAMMPS. We demonstrate the utility of the two MLP interfaces for two relevant example applications: the investigation of diffusion phenomena in liquid water and the equilibration of nanostructured amorphous battery materials.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of strain on the monomer and dimer diffusion mechanisms and island morphology during the growth of Cu on a biaxially strained Cu(100) substrate. We find an approximately linear dependence of the activation barriers on strain. In particular, while hopping is favored for compressive and/or small (&lt;2\%) tensile strain, for greater than 2\% tensile strain, the exchange mechanism is favored. We then present the results of temperature-accelerated dynamics simulations of submonolayer growth at 200 K. For the case of 2\% compressive strain we find that, as in previous kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of Cu/Ni(100) growth, the competition between island growth and multi-atom relaxation (“pop-out”) events leads to an island morphology with a mixture of open and closed steps. At slightly higher coverage, island coalescence then leads to elongated islands. However, annealing leads to a significant decrease in the number of open steps. In contrast, for the case of 8\% tensile strain, only one large strongly anisotropic island is formed. Surprisingly, we find that despite the large strain, the island anisotropy is not due to energetics but is instead due to anisotropic attachment barriers that favor the exchange-mediated attachment of monomers to corners over close-packed step-edges. An explanation for the asymmetry in attachment barriers is provided. Our results provide a new general kinetic mechanism for the formation of anisotropic islands in the presence of isotropic diffusion and tensile strain.},

  abstract = {We explore the applicability of the lattice model and dynamic mean field theory as a computationally efficient tool to study transport across heterogeneous porous media, such as mixed matrix membranes. As a starting point and to establish some basic definitions of properties analogous to those in the off-lattice systems, we consider transport across simple models of porous materials represented by a slit pore in a chemical potential gradient. Using this simple model, we investigate the distribution of density and flux under steady state conditions, define the permeability across the system, and explore how this property depends on the length of the pore and the solid–fluid interactions. Among other effects, we observe that the flux in the system goes through a maximum as the solid–fluid interaction is varied from weak to strong. This effect is dominated by the behavior of the fluid near the walls and is also confirmed by off-lattice molecular dynamics simulations. We further extend this study to explore transport across heterogeneous slit pore channels composed of two solids with different values of solid–fluid interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the lattice models and dynamic mean field theory provide a useful framework to pose questions on the accuracy and applicability of the classical theories of transport across heterogeneous porous systems.},

  abstract = {We studied the dissociation of water (H 2 O*, with * denoting adspecies) on atomic oxygen (O*)-covered Rh nanoclusters (Rh O * ) supported on a graphene film grown on a Ru(0001) surface [ G/Ru(0001) ] under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions and with varied surface-probe techniques and calculations based on density-functional theory. The graphene had a single rotational domain; its lattice expanded by about 5.7\% to match the Ru substrate structurally better. The Rh clusters were grown by depositing Rh vapors onto G/Ru(0001) ; they had an fcc phase and grew in (111) orientation. Water adsorbed on the Rh clusters was dissociated exclusively in the presence of O*, like that on a Rh(111) single-crystal surface. Contrary to the case on Rh(111) O * , excess O* (even at a saturation level) on small Rh O * clusters (diameter of 30–34 Å) continued to promote, instead of inhibiting, the dissociation of water; the produced hydroxyl (OH*) increased generally with the concentration of O* on the clusters. The difference results from more reactive O* on the Rh O * clusters. O* on Rh O * clusters activated the dissociation via both the formation of hydrogen bonds with H 2 O* and abstraction of H directly from H 2 O*, whereas O* on Rh(111) O * assisted the dissociation largely via the formation of hydrogen bonds, which was readily obstructed with an increased O* coverage. As the disproportionation (2 OH* → H 2 O* + O*) is endothermic on the Rh O * clusters but exothermic on Rh(111) O * , OH* produced on Rh O * clusters showed a thermal stability superior to that on the Rh(111) O * surface—thermally stable up to 400 K.},

  abstract = {Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) are complex solutions that present unique challenges compared to traditional solvents. Unlike most aqueous electrolytes and ionic liquids, DESs have delicate hydrogen bond networks that are responsible for their highly sensitive compositional dependence on the melting point. Prior work has demonstrated a unique nanoscale structure both experimentally and theoretically that brings both challenges and opportunities to their adoption in traditional electrochemical processes. In this study, we use in situ sample-rotated ultra-small angle x-ray scattering to resolve the near-interface solvent structure after electrodepositing Pd nanoparticles onto a glassy carbon electrode in choline chloride:urea and choline chloride:ethylene glycol DESs. Our results indicate that a hierarchical solvent structure can be observed on the meso-scale in the choline chloride:urea and choline chloride:ethylene glycol systems. Importantly, this extended solvent structure increases between −0.3 V and −0.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and remains high until −0.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Experimentally, the nature of this structure is more pronounced in the ethylene glycol system, as evidenced by both the x-ray scattering and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations and dipolar orientation analysis reveal that chloride delocalization near the Pd interface and long-range interactions between the choline and each hydrogen bond donor (HBD) are very different and qualitatively consistent with the experimental data. These results show how the long-range solvent–deposit interactions can be tuned by changing the HBD in the DES and the applied potential.},

In particular, in supercapacitor applications, they can be grafted to ionic liquids to form so-called biredox ionic liquids. To completely understand the structural and transport properties of such systems, an insight at the molecular scale is often required, but few force fields are developed ad hoc for these molecules. Moreover, they do not include polarization effects, which can lead to inaccurate solvation and dynamical properties. In this work, we developed polarizable force fields for redox-active species anthraquinone (AQ) and 2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in their oxidized and reduced states as well as for acetonitrile. We validate the structural properties of AQ, AQ •− , AQ 2− , TEMPO • , and TEMPO + in acetonitrile against density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations and we study the solvation of these redox molecules in acetonitrile. This work is a first step toward the characterization of the role played by AQ and TEMPO in electrochemical and catalytic devices.},

  abstract = {The dramatic slowing down of relaxation dynamics of liquids approaching the glass transition remains a highly debated problem, where the crux of the puzzle resides in the elusive increase in the activation barrier Δ E ( T ) with decreasing temperature T . A class of theoretical frameworks—known as elastic models —attribute this temperature dependence to the variations of the liquid’s macroscopic elasticity, quantified by the high-frequency shear modulus G ∞ ( T ). While elastic models find some support in a number of experimental studies, these models do not take into account the spatial structures, length scales, and heterogeneity associated with structural relaxation in supercooled liquids. Here, we propose and test the possibility that viscous slowing down is controlled by a mesoscopic elastic stiffness κ ( T ), defined as the characteristic stiffness of response fields to local dipole forces in the liquid’s underlying inherent structures. First, we show that κ ( T )—which is intimately related to the energy and length scales characterizing quasilocalized, nonphononic excitations in glasses—increases more strongly with decreasing T than the macroscopic inherent structure shear modulus G ( T ) [the glass counterpart of liquids’ G ∞ ( T )] in several computer liquids. Second, we show that the simple relation Δ E ( T ) ∝ κ ( T ) holds remarkably well for some computer liquids, suggesting a direct connection between the liquid’s underlying mesoscopic elasticity and enthalpic energy barriers. On the other hand, we show that for other computer liquids, the above relation fails. Finally, we provide strong evidence that what distinguishes computer liquids in which the Δ E ( T ) ∝ κ ( T ) relation holds from those in which it does not is that the latter feature highly fragmented/granular potential energy landscapes, where many sub-basins separated by low activation barriers exist. Under such conditions, it appears that the sub-basins do not properly represent the landscape properties relevant for structural relaxation.},

A Rietveld analysis of the powder diffraction patterns shows that the x = 0 and x = 0.4 compositions crystallize into space group-type R 3 ̄ ⁠ , whereas the x = 0.8 composition crystallizes into space group-type R 3 ̄ c. For the as-prepared glass, the pair-distribution functions and 27 Al MAS NMR spectra show the formation of sub-octahedral Ge and Al centered units, which leads to the creation of non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atoms. The influence of these atoms on the ion mobility is discussed. When the as-prepared glass is relaxed by thermal annealing, there is an increase in the Ge and Al coordination numbers that leads to a decrease in the fraction of NBO atoms. A model is proposed for the x = 0 glass in which super-structural units containing octahedral Ge (6) and tetrahedral P (3) motifs are embedded in a matrix of tetrahedral Ge (4) units, where superscripts denote the number of bridging oxygen atoms. The super-structural units can grow in size by a reaction in which NBO atoms on the P (3) motifs are used to convert Ge (4) to Ge (6) units. The resultant P (4) motifs thereby provide the nucleation sites for crystal growth via a homogeneous nucleation mechanism.},

This algorithm is called re-integration with anchor points (REAP) integrator. The REAP integrator starts from a quadratic potential energy surface based on the updated Hessian to propagate the system to the halfway of the MD step that is called the anchor point. Then, an approximate dynamics position for this step is obtained by the propagation based on an interpolated surface using the anchor point and the previous MD point. The approximate dynamics step can be further improved by the re-integration steps, i.e., integration based on the interpolated surface using the calculated energies, gradients, and updated Hessians of the previous step, the anchor point, and the approximate current step. A trajectory only needs one analytical Hessian calculation at the initial geometry, and thereafter, only calculations of gradients are required. This integrator can be considered either as a generalization of Hessian-based predictor–corrector integration with substantial improvement of accuracy and efficiency or as a dynamics on interpolated surfaces that are built on the fly. An automatic correction scheme is implemented by comparing the interpolated energies and gradients to the actual ones to ensure the quality of the interpolations at a certain level. The tests in this work show that the REAP method can increase computational efficiency by more than one order of magnitude than that of the velocity Verlet integrator and more than twice that of Hessian-based predictor–corrector integration.},

  abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures are capable of tailoring the emission of a nearby emitter by increasing (or reducing) the brightness, shortening (or prolonging) the lifetime, and shaping the spectrum. Experimental characterization of such coupled plasmon–exciton (plexciton) systems usually relies on the acquisition and comparison of scattering, absorption, or luminescence spectra. However, theoretical accounts of these optical spectra, which are key to distinguishing between the coupling regimes and to standardizing the coupling criteria, often scatters in different frameworks, varying from classical to quantum-mechanical. Therefore, developing a unified and simple formalism that can simultaneously compare all these spectral signatures in different coupling regimes is nontrivial. Here, we use a temporal coupled-mode formalism to reproduce the scattering, absorption, and luminescence spectra of a plexciton system and find that its luminescence reaches a maximum at a critical coupling point, featuring a light-emitting plexciton with intense brightness and ultrafast lifetime. This simple approach provides a unified and phenomenological treatment of these spectra by simply including or excluding an external driving term. It therefore allows for a direct comparison of different spectroscopic signatures from the plexciton system and provides an easy-to-use guidance for the design of broadband light-emitting devices.},

By including a phenomenological stochastic term in this model, it is possible to obtain thermodynamic equilibrium corresponding to a given temperature by propagating the system in imaginary time. The temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities, such as the internal energy and entropy, is computed and is compared well with experimental reference data for the bulk liquid up to about 2 K, but begins to gradually deviate above that temperature.

  abstract = {Our previous study [S. Wang et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 184102 (2020)] has shown that in a complex dielectric environment, molecular emission power spectra can be expressed as the product of the lineshape function and the electromagnetic environment factor (EEF). In this work, we focus on EEFs in a vacuum–NaCl–silver system and investigate molecular emission power spectra in the strong exciton–polariton coupling regime. A numerical method based on computational electrodynamics is presented to calculate the EEFs of single-molecule emitters in a dispersive and lossy dielectric environment with arbitrary shapes. The EEFs in the far-field region depend on the detector position, emission frequency, and molecular orientation. We quantitatively analyze the asymptotic behavior of the EFFs in the far-field region and qualitatively provide a physical picture. The concept of EEF should be transferable to other types of spectra in a complex dielectric environment. Finally, our study indicates that molecular emission power spectra cannot be simply interpreted by the lineshape function (quantum dynamics of a molecular emitter), and the effect of the EEFs (photon propagation in a dielectric environment) has to be carefully considered.},

Knowledge of ro-vibrational quenching rates is necessary to connect spectral observations to physical properties of warm astrophysical gasses, including exo-atmospheres. For a system of paramount importance in this context, the vibrational bending mode quenching of H 2 O by H 2 , we show here that the exchange of vibrational to rotational and kinetic energy remains a quantum process, despite the large numbers of quantum levels involved and the large vibrational energy transfer. The excitation of the quantized rotor of the projectile is by far the most effective ro-vibrational quenching path of water. To do so, we use a fully quantum first-principles computation, potential and dynamics, converging it at all stages, in a full coupled channel formalism. We present here rates for the quenching of the first bending mode of ortho -H 2 O by ortho -H 2 , up to 500 K, in a fully converged coupled channel formalism.},

  abstract = {We introduce Active Orbital Preservation for Multiconfigurational Self-Consistent Field (AOP-MCSCF), an automated approach to improving the consistency of active space orbitals over multiple molecular configurations. Our approach is based on maximum overlap with a reference set of active space orbitals taken from a single geometry of a chromophore in the gas phase and can be used to automatically preserve the appropriate orbitals of the chromophore across multiple thermally sampled configurations, even when the chromophore is solvated by quantum-mechanically treated water molecules. In particular, using the singular value decomposition of a Molecular Orbital (MO) overlap matrix between the system and reference, we rotate the MOs of the system to align with the reference active space orbitals and use the resulting rotated orbitals as an initial guess to a MCSCF calculation. We demonstrate the approach on aqueous p -hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolinone (HBI) and find that AOP-MCSCF converges to the “correct” orbitals for over 90\% of 3000 thermally sampled configurations. In addition, we compute the linear absorption spectrum and find excellent agreement with new experimental measurements up to 5.4 eV (230 nm). We show that electrostatic contributions to the solvation energy of HBI largely explain the observed state-dependent solvatochromism.},

Herein, we report a microwell array-based method to in operando measure the photocatalytic kinetics of single CdS nanoparticles (NPs) with high TOF. This was realized by sealing individual CdS NPs into separated micrometer-sized polydimethylsiloxane wells, thus eliminating the diffusion of products among individuals in the case of high concentration of reactants. This method allowed us to monitor the activities of single catalysts with an average TOF up to 2.1 × 10 5 s −1 . Interestingly, two types of catalytical behaviors were revealed during single CdS photocatalysis: a rapid decline in activity for most CdS NPs and an initial increase in activity followed by a decrease for a minor population of individuals. The developed method will facilitate the investigation of catalytic activities of single particles under realistic conditions and hold great potential in the fields of photo/electro-catalysts, enzymes, functional bacteria, and so on.},

This model may be thought of as a classical analog of the quantum three-body problem. In the quantum situation, it is known that three identical quantum particles will form a triplet with an infinite tower of bound states at the point where any pair of particles would have zero binding energy. The phase diagram is mapped out, and the different phase transitions are examined using finite-size scaling. We look particularly at the scaling of the DNA model at the equivalent Efimov point for chains up to 10 000 steps in length. We find clear evidence of several bound states in the finite-size scaling. We compare these states with the expected Efimov behavior.},

Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions are one such class of reactions that exhibit nonlinear chemical oscillations due to redox cycles of the metal-ion catalyst by virtue of Hopf bifurcation. Using bifurcation analyses, here we investigate the BZ reactions, catalyzed by 0D–2D catalytic nanomats and bare nanosheets, which are known to exhibit enhanced dynamic response due to catalysts’ heterogeneity. Specifically, we incorporate the nanocatalysts’ activity in the kinetic model of the BZ reactions and, subsequently, use catalysts’ activity as the bifurcation parameter for analyses. By computing higher-order Lyapunov and frequency coefficients, we have revealed new oscillatory regimes in the bifurcation diagram, including re-entrant regions where sustained oscillations are unexpectedly suppressed, even with high catalytic activity. In addition, we also calculate the amplitude and frequency of BZ oscillations in each of these regions as a function of nanocatalysts’ activity. We believe that our current findings can be used to harness the nonlinearity of RD-based dynamical systems to provide unique functionalities to active stimuli-response systems.},

Interestingly, we find that, independent of the relative concentration of the two components, the resulting V eff is additive, i.e., it is well-described by the linear combination of the effective interactions mediated by respective pure co-solutes. However, a breakdown of the additivity occurs when the co-solute mixture is close to the onset of a demixing transition. These results represent a step forward in understanding and predicting colloidal behavior in complex and crowded environments and for exploiting this knowledge to design targeted colloidal superstructures.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is one of the powerful tools for microscopic analysis providing visual images and mean geometrical shapes of the contact line, e.g., of nanoscale droplets on solid surfaces, while profound understanding of wetting demands quantitative evaluation of the solid–liquid (SL) interfacial tension. In the present work, we examined the wetting of water on neutral and regular hydroxylated silica surfaces with five different area densities of OH groups ρ A OH ⁠ , ranging from a non-hydroxylated surface to a fully hydroxylated one through two theoretical methods: thermodynamic integration (TI) and MD simulations of quasi-two-dimensional equilibrium droplets. For the former, the work of adhesion needed to quasi-statically strip the water film off the solid surface was computed by the phantom wall TI scheme to evaluate the SL interfacial free energy, whereas for the latter, the apparent contact angle θ app was calculated from the droplet density distribution. The theoretical contact angle θ YD and the apparent one θ app , both indicating the enhancement of wettability by an increase in ρ A O H ⁠ , presented good quantitative agreement, especially for non-hydroxylated and highly hydroxylated surfaces. On partially hydroxylated surfaces, in which θ YD and θ app slightly deviated, the Brownian motion of the droplet was suppressed, possibly due to the pinning of the contact line around the hydroxyl groups. Relations between work of adhesion, interfacial energy, and entropy loss were also analyzed, and their influence on the wettability was discussed.},

In this study, we assess how strongly coupling to cavity photons affects the excited state dynamics of strongly coupled zinc (II) tetraphenyl porphyrin (ZnTPP) and copper (II) tetraphenyl porphyrin (CuTPP) molecules. By varying the concentration of each chromophore within different Fabry–Pérot (FP) structures, we control the collective vacuum Rabi splitting between the energies of cavity polariton states formed through the strong coupling of molecular electrons and cavity photons. Using ultrafast transient reflectivity and transmission measurements probing optical transitions of individual ZnTPP and CuTPP molecules, we find that the polaritonic states localize into uncoupled excited states of these chromophores through different mechanisms. For ZnTPP, we build a simple kinetic model including a direct channel of relaxation between the polaritonic states. We find that our models necessitate a small contribution from this interpolaritonic relaxation channel to explain both our steady-state and transient optical spectroscopic measurements adequately. In contrast, we propose that strong cavity coupling slows the internal conversion between electronic states of CuTPP not directly interacting with the photons of FP structures. These results suggest that researchers must consider the vibrational structure and excited state properties of the strongly coupled chromophores when attempting to use polariton formation as a tool to control the dynamics of molecules central to photo-sensitizing and light harvesting applications.},

While advances were made regarding their implementation in practical devices, debate exists regarding the physical origin for the delayed water reduction occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Evidently, one difficulty resides in our lack of knowledge regarding ion activity arising from this novel class of electrolytes, which is necessary to estimate the Nernst potential of associated redox reactions, such as Li + intercalation or the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we first measured the potential shift of electrodes selective to Li + , H + , or Zn 2+ ions from diluted to highly concentrated regimes in LiCl or LiTFSI solutions. Observing similar shifts for these different cations and environments, we establish that shifts in redox potentials from diluted to highly concentrated regimes originate in large from an increased junction potential, which is dependent on the ion activity coefficients that increase with the concentration. While our study shows that single ion activity coefficients, unlike mean ion activity coefficients, cannot be captured by any electrochemical means, we demonstrate that the proton concentration increases by one to two orders of magnitude from 1 to 15–20 mol kg −1 solutions. Combined with the increased activity coefficients, this phenomenon increases the activity of protons and thus increases the pH of highly concentrated solutions which appears acidic.},

In turn, the properties of eutectic mixtures are the result of the components’ molar ratio and chemical composition. Owing to the relatively low viscosities displayed by alcohol-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs), their application in industry is more appealing. Modeling the composition–property relationships established in polyalcohol-based mixtures is crucial for both understanding and predicting their behavior. In this work, a physicochemical property–structure comparison study is made between four choline chloride polyalcohol-based DESs, namely, ethaline, propeline, propaneline, and glyceline. Physicochemical properties obtained from molecular dynamic simulations are compared to experimental data, whenever possible. The simulations cover the temperature range from 298.15 to 348.15 K. The simulated and literature experimental data are generally in good agreement for all the studied DESs. Structural properties, such as radial and spatial distribution functions, coordination numbers, hydrogen bond donor (HBD)–HBD aggregate formation, and hydrogen bonding are analyzed in detail. The higher prevalence of HBD:HBD and HBD:anion hydrogen bonds is likely to be the major reason for the relatively high density and viscosity of glyceline as well as for lower DES self-diffusions.},

Motivated by these findings, we construct a minimal empirical model to describe this physics and introduce dynamic facilitation in the trap model, which was initially developed to capture the thermally activated dynamics of glassy systems. We fully characterize the relaxation dynamics of this facilitated trap model varying the functional form of energy distributions and the strength of dynamic facilitation, combining numerical results and analytic arguments. Dynamic facilitation generically accelerates the relaxation of the deepest traps, thus making relaxation spectra strongly asymmetric, with an apparent “excess” signal at high frequencies. For well-chosen values of the parameters, the obtained spectra mimic experimental results for organic liquids displaying an excess wing. Overall, our results identify the minimal physical ingredients needed to describe excess processes in the relaxation spectra of supercooled liquids.},

  abstract = {Two methods for computing the entropy of hard-sphere systems using a spherical tether model are explored, which allow the efficient use of event-driven molecular-dynamics simulations. An intuitive derivation is given, which relates the rate of particle collisions, either between two particles or between a particle and its respective tether, to an associated hypersurface area, which bounds the system’s accessible configurational phase space. Integrating the particle–particle collision rates with respect to the sphere diameter (or, equivalently, density) or the particle–tether collision rates with respect to the tether length then directly determines the volume of accessible phase space and, therefore, the system entropy. The approach is general and can be used for any system composed of particles interacting with discrete potentials in fluid, solid, or glassy states. The entropies calculated for the liquid and crystalline hard-sphere states using these methods are found to agree closely with the current best estimates in the literature, demonstrating the accuracy of the approach.},

  abstract = {Computationally inexpensive particle-based coarse-grained (CG) models are essential for use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of mesoscopically slow cooperative phenomena, such as plastic deformations in solids. Molecular crystals possessing complex symmetry present enormous practical challenges for particle-based coarse-graining at molecularly resolved scales, when each molecule is in a single-site representation, and beyond. Presently, there is no published pairwise non-bonded single-site CG potential that is able to predict the space group and structure of a molecular crystal. In this paper, we present a successful coarse-graining at a molecular level from first principles of an energetic crystal, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro- s -triazine (RDX) in the alpha phase, using the force-matching-based multiscale coarse-graining (MSCG/FM) approach. The new MSCG/FM model, which implements an optimal pair decomposition of the crystal Helmholtz free energy potential in molecular center-of-mass coordinates, was obtained by force-matching atomistic MD simulations of liquid, amorphous, and crystalline states and in a wide range of pressures (up to 20 GPa). The MSCG/FM potentials for different pressures underwent top-down optimization to fine-tune the mechanical and thermodynamic properties, followed by consolidation into a transferable density-dependent model referred to as RDX-TC-DD (RDX True-Crystal Density-Dependent). The RDX-TC-DD model predicts accurately the crystal structure of α -RDX at room conditions and reproduces the atomistic reference system under isothermal (300 K) hydrostatic compression up to 20 GPa, in particular, the Pbca symmetry of α -RDX in the elastic regime. The RDX-TC-DD model was then used to simulate the plastic response of uniaxially ([100]) compressed α -RDX resulting in nanoscale shear banding, a key mechanism for plastic deformation and defect-free detonation initiation proposed for many molecular crystalline explosives. Additionally, a comparative analysis of the effect of core-softening of the RDX-TC-DD potential and the degree of molecular rigidity in the all-atom treatment suggests a stress-induced short-range softening of the effective intermolecular interaction as a fundamental cause of plastic instability in α -RDX. The reported RDX-TC-DD model and overall workflow to develop it open up possibilities to perform high quality simulation studies of molecular energetic materials under thermal and mechanical stimuli, including extreme conditions.},

Besides quantitatively reproducing low-order many-body energy contributions, the new MB-nrg PEF is able to correctly predict the interaction energies of small chloride–water clusters calculated at the coupled cluster level of theory. Importantly, classical and quantum molecular dynamics simulations of a single chloride ion in water demonstrate that the new MB-nrg PEF predicts x-ray spectra in close agreement with the experimental results. Comparisons with an popular empirical model and a polarizable PEF emphasize the importance of an accurate representation of short-range many-body effect while demonstrating that pairwise additive representations of chloride–water and water–water interactions are inadequate for correctly representing the hydration structure of chloride in both gas-phase clusters and solution. We believe that the analyses presented in this study provide additional evidence for the accuracy and predictive ability of the MB-nrg PEFs, which can then enable more realistic simulations of ionic aqueous systems in different environments.},

  abstract = {The development of accurate statistical mechanics models of molecular liquid systems is a problem of great practical and fundamental importance. Site-density functional theory (SDFT) is one of the promising directions in this area, but its success hinges upon the ability to efficiently reconcile the co-existence of two distinct intra- and inter-molecular interaction regimes in a molecular liquid. The renormalized formulation of SDFT (RSDFT), which we have recently developed, resolves this problem by introducing an additional potential field variable that decouples two interaction scales and maps the molecular liquid problem onto the effective simple liquid mixture. This work provides a critical assessment of RSDFT for the hydrated ion system—a problem that historically has always been one of the most difficult cases for SDFT applications. Using a two-site model of water, we perform a comprehensive analysis of hydrated alkali metal and halogen ions, including both structural and free energy based characteristics. The results indicate that RSDFT provides a significant improvement over conventional three-dimensional reference interaction site model implementations and may prove useful in coarse grained simulations based on two-site solvent models.},

We report the results of simulation and analysis of the low-frequency collision-induced absorption (CIA) in CO 2 –Ar, including its true dimer component. Our consideration relies on the use of ab initio intermolecular potential energy and induced dipole surfaces for CO 2 –Ar calculated in an assumption of a rigid CO 2 structure using the CCSD(T) method. The theory, the details of which are reported in Paper I [Chistikov et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 194106 (2019)], permits taking into account the effect of unbound and quasi-bound classical trajectories on the CIA in the range of a rototranslational band. This theory is largely extended by trajectory-based simulation of the true bound dimer absorption in the present paper. The spectra are obtained from a statistical average over a vast ensemble of classical trajectories restricted by properly chosen domains in the phase space. Rigorous classical theory is developed for two low-order spectral moments interpreted as the Boltzmann-weighted average of the respective dipole functions. These spectral moments were then used to check the accuracy of our trajectory-based spectra, for which both spectral moments can be evaluated independently in terms of specific integrals over the trajectory-based calculated spectral profiles. Good agreement between the spectral moments calculated as integrals over the frequency domain or the phase space largely supports the reliability of our simulated CIA spectra, which conform with the available microwave and far-infrared observations.},

  abstract = {We report theoretical derivations and experimental results on the volume averaging effect of nonlinear processes in focused laser fields. This effect is considered detrimental in revealing the intensity dependence of a nonlinear process, caused by the intensity variation across the sampled volume of a focused laser. Following the treatment in the literature, we prove that if the signal dependence can be expressed as a simple power function of the laser intensity and if the detection region encompasses effectively the whole volume, volume average does not affect the final conclusion on the derived exponent. However, to reveal the detailed saturation effect of a multi-photon process, intensity selective scans involving spatial filters and displacement of the laser focus ( z -scan) are required. Moreover, to fully capture the dependence of the signal on the variation of the laser intensity, the degree of spatial discrimination and the corresponding range of the z -scan need to be modeled carefully. Limitations in the dynamic range of the detector or the laser power, however, can thwart the desired scan range, resulting in erroneous fitting exponents. Using our nanosecond laser with a non-ideal Gaussian beam profile based on multiphoton ionization of argon atoms from a collimated molecular beam and from ambient argon gas, we report experimental measurements of the beam waist and Rayleigh range and compare the experimental intensity dependence of Ar + with theoretical values. Agreements between theory and experiment are remarkable.},

In this method, named as method A, we use thermal-random-phase wavefunctions with the random phases expanded in both the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom to model the thermal ensemble of the initial eigenstates. This method is compared with the other two methods (B and C) at different temperatures. Method B is also based on thermal-random-phase wavefunctions, except that the random-phase expansion is merely used for the vibrational degree of freedom. Method C is based on the independent propagation of every initial eigenstate, instead of the thermal-random-phase wavefunctions. Taking the (1) 1 Π g state as the target state, it is found that although these three methods can present the same population on the (1) 1 Π g state, the computation efficiency of method A increases dramatically with the increase in temperature. With this efficient method A, we find that the PA process at 1000 K can also induce rotational coherence, i.e., the molecular field-free alignment in the excited electronic states.},

This leads to a Hermitian QED-TDDFT coupling matrix that is expected to facilitate the future development of analytic derivatives. Through a Gaussian atomic basis implementation of the QED-TDDFT method, we examined the effect of dipole self-energy, rotating-wave approximation, and the Tamm–Dancoff approximation on the QED-TDDFT eigenstates of model compounds (ethene, formaldehyde, and benzaldehyde) in an optical cavity. We highlight, in the strong coupling regime, the role of higher-energy and off-resonance excited states with large transition dipole moments in the direction of the photonic field, which are automatically accounted for in our QED-TDDFT calculations and might substantially affect the energies and compositions of polaritons associated with lower-energy electronic states.},

Our model includes an instantaneous short-range Coulomb interaction and a local optical vibrational mode described by the Holstein–Hubbard (HH) model. Although characterization of the HH model for a bulk system has typically been conducted using a complex phase diagram, this approach is not sufficient for investigations of dynamical behavior at finite temperature, in particular for studies of nonlinear optical properties, where the time irreversibility of the dynamics that arises from the environment becomes significant. We therefore include heat baths with infinite heat capacity in the model to introduce thermal effects characterized by fluctuation and dissipation to the system dynamics. By reducing the number of degrees of freedom of the heat baths, we derive numerically “exact” hierarchical equations of motion for the reduced density matrix of the HH system. As demonstrations, we calculate the optical response of the system in two- and four-site cases under external electric fields. The results indicate that the effective strength of the system–bath coupling becomes large as the number of sites increases. Excitation of electrons promotes the conductivity when the Coulomb repulsion is equivalent to or dominates the electron–phonon coupling, whereas excitation of optical vibrations always suppresses the conductivity.},

While sophisticated numerical methods for studying equilibrium states have well advanced, quantitative predictions of kinetic behavior remain challenging. We introduce a reactant-to-barrier (R2B) machine learning model that rapidly and accurately infers activation energies and transition state geometries throughout the chemical compound space. R2B exhibits improving accuracy as training set sizes grow and requires as input solely the molecular graph of the reactant and the information of the reaction type. We provide numerical evidence for the applicability of R2B for two competing text-book reactions relevant to organic synthesis, E2 and S N 2, trained and tested on chemically diverse quantum data from the literature. After training on 1–1.8k examples, R2B predicts activation energies on average within less than 2.5 kcal/mol with respect to the coupled-cluster singles doubles reference within milliseconds. Principal component analysis of kernel matrices reveals the hierarchy of the multiple scales underpinning reactivity in chemical space: Nucleophiles and leaving groups, substituents, and pairwise substituent combinations correspond to systematic lowering of eigenvalues. Analysis of R2B based predictions of ∼11.5k E2 and S N 2 barriers in the gas-phase for previously undocumented reactants indicates that on average, E2 is favored in 75\% of all cases and that S N 2 becomes likely for chlorine as nucleophile/leaving group and for substituents consisting of hydrogen or electron-withdrawing groups. Experimental reaction design from first principles is enabled due to R2B, which is demonstrated by the construction of decision trees. Numerical R2B based results for interatomic distances and angles of reactant and transition state geometries suggest that Hammond’s postulate is applicable to S N 2, but not to E2.},

  abstract = {The one-electron picture in molecular electronic state theory, particularly the molecular orbital (MO) theory with the Hartree–Fock approximation, has set a foundation to develop chemical science. Frontier orbital theory, or the theory of HOMO (highest occupied MO)–LUMO (lowest unoccupied MO) interaction, and the conservation rule of orbital symmetry are among the brightest achievements in a molecular orbital picture. After 70 years from the birth of frontier orbital theory, however, electronic wavefunctions treated in current quantum chemistry are often highly correlated and consist of extensive scales of electronic configurations to be more accurate and to cope with far more complicated reactions than concerted reactions. Under such circumstances, the MO approximation itself readily loses its validity, let alone the utter dominance of the HOMO–LUMO interaction. Recently, we have proposed an invariant method to extract general orbitals from such correlated electronic wavefunctions, which we refer to as Energy Natural Orbitals (ENOs) [K. Takatsuka and Y. Arasaki, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 094103 (2021)]. The energies of ENOs are summed exactly to the total electronic energy. The topological (symmetry) properties of a total wavefunction are represented by the relative phases of ENOs along with the continuity and crossing (avoided and conical intersection) among them. Only a small number of ENOs often dominate and characterize chemical reactions. With these properties of ENO, we explore a couple of simple and typical symmetry forbidden reactions, illustrating the effects of electron correlation and degeneracy in relevant ENOs. We propose the notion of “internal conical intersection” among ENOs, which leads to Jahn–Teller effect, pseudo-Jahn–Teller effect, and so on. We dare to explain the primary origin of elementary conical intersections and multidimensional avoided crossing in chemical reactions with the use of the notion of orbital crossing between those of HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO interactions and so on.},

  abstract = {The reaction coordinate (RC) is the principal collective variable or feature that determines the progress along an activated or reactive process. In a molecular simulation using enhanced sampling, a good description of the RC is crucial for generating sufficient statistics. Moreover, the RC provides invaluable atomistic insight into the process under study. The optimal RC is the committor, which represents the likelihood of a system to evolve toward a given state based on the coordinates of all its particles. As the interpretability of such a high dimensional function is low, a more practical approach is to describe the RC by some low-dimensional molecular collective variables or order parameters. While several methods can perform this dimensionality reduction, they usually require a preselection of these low-dimension collective variables (CVs). Here, we propose to automate this dimensionality reduction using an extended autoencoder, which maps the input (many CVs) onto a lower-dimensional latent space, which is subsequently used for the reconstruction of the input as well as the prediction of the committor function. As a consequence, the latent space is optimized for both reconstruction and committor prediction and is likely to yield the best non-linear low-dimensional representation of the committor. We test our extended autoencoder model on simple but nontrivial toy systems, as well as extensive molecular simulation data of methane hydrate nucleation. The extended autoencoder model can effectively extract the underlying mechanism of a reaction, make reliable predictions about the committor of a given configuration, and potentially even generate new paths representative for a reaction.},

  abstract = {The self-assembly of peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils plays a causative role in a wide range of increasingly common and currently incurable diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process have recently been discovered, prompting the development of drugs that inhibit specific reaction steps as possible treatments for some of these disorders. A crucial part of treatment design is to determine how much drug to give and when to give it, informed by its efficacy and intrinsic toxicity. Since amyloid formation does not proceed at the same pace in different individuals, it is also important that treatment design is informed by local measurements of the extent of protein aggregation. Here, we use stochastic optimal control theory to determine treatment regimens for inhibitory drugs targeting several key reaction steps in protein aggregation, explicitly taking into account variability in the reaction kinetics. We demonstrate how these regimens may be updated “on the fly” as new measurements of the protein aggregate concentration become available, in principle, enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual. We find that treatment timing, duration, and drug dosage all depend strongly on the particular reaction step being targeted. Moreover, for some kinds of inhibitory drugs, the optimal regimen exhibits high sensitivity to stochastic fluctuations. Feedback controls tailored to the individual may therefore substantially increase the effectiveness of future treatments.},

The precise roles played by DES components and whether they simply represent a benign medium for mobilizing charge carriers or present beneficial functionality that impacts device performance remain unclear. To begin to address this deficiency in understanding, we performed a comprehensive characterization of the three “canonical” choline chloride-based DESs (i.e., reline, ethaline, and glyceline) as DSSC electrolytes hosting the iodide–triiodide (I − /I 3 − ) redox couple. The measurement of electrolyte viscosities, determination of triiodide diffusion coefficients, and photovoltaic performances assessed for water contents up to 40 wt.\% allow the emergence of several important insights. A comparison to the observed photovoltaic performance arising from the individual components aids in further clarifying the impact of DES chemistry and solution viscosity on photovoltaic and charge carrier diffusion characteristics. Finally, we introduce the DES guaniline—consisting of a 1:1 molar ratio mixture of choline chloride with guanidinium thiocyanate—demonstrating it to be a superior DSSC electrolyte over those formulated from the three most widely studied canonical DESs at all water contents investigated.},

  abstract = {Shape-transformable molecular additives with photoresponsivity, such as azobenzene or spiropyran, in matter are known to decrease the local order parameter and lead to drastic state variations under light irradiation. For example, a liquid crystalline state can be transformed to an isotropic liquid state by photo-exciting a tiny amount of azobenzene additives from trans - to cis -conformers. On the other hand, structural or shape transformation without changing the phase state is also intriguing since it offers an opportunity for manipulating specific structures. Here, we demonstrate an active control of the topology of chiral particle-like twisting structures, dubbed toron, by light. Interestingly, the individual twisting structure is fully reconfigurable between spherical and unique branched topological states. We reveal that the shape transformation is driven by the free-energy competition between the variation of surface anchoring strength and the elastic energy stored in the twisting structure. The mean-field simulation based on the Landau–de Gennes framework shows that the elastic anisotropy plays the dominant role in modifying the toron topology upon weak anchoring. The results offer a new path for understanding the process of topology-involved shape transformation and fabrication of novel functional materials.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of light emission from metallic nanoparticles has been a subject of debate in recent years. Photoluminescence and electronic Raman scattering mechanisms have both been proposed to explain the observed emission from plasmonic nanostructures. Recent results from Stokes and anti-Stokes emission spectroscopy of single gold nanorods using continuous wave laser excitation carried out in our laboratory are summarized here. We show that varying excitation wavelength and power change the energy distribution of hot carriers and impact the emission spectral lineshape. We then examine the role of interband and intraband transitions in the emission lineshape by varying the particle size. We establish a relationship between the single particle emission quantum yield and its corresponding plasmonic resonance quality factor, which we also tune through nanorod crystallinity. Finally, based on anti-Stokes emission, we extract electron temperatures that further suggest a hot carrier based mechanism. The central role of hot carriers in our systematic study on gold nanorods as a model system supports a Purcell effect enhanced hot carrier photoluminescence mechanism. We end with a discussion on the impact of understanding the light emission mechanism on fields utilizing hot carrier distributions, such as photocatalysis and nanothermometry.},

  abstract = {Light harvesting as the first step in photosynthesis is of prime importance for life on earth. For a theoretical description of photochemical processes during light harvesting, spectral densities are key quantities. They serve as input functions for modeling the excitation energy transfer dynamics and spectroscopic properties. Herein, a recently developed procedure is applied to determine the spectral densities of the pigments in the minor antenna complex CP29 of photosystem II, which has recently gained attention because of its active role in non-photochemical quenching processes in higher plants. To this end, the density functional-based tight binding (DFTB) method has been employed to enable simulation of the ground state dynamics in a quantum-mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme for each chlorophyll pigment. Subsequently, the time-dependent extension of the long-range corrected DFTB approach has been used to obtain the excitation energy fluctuations along the ground-state trajectories also in a QM/MM setting. From these results, the spectral densities have been determined and compared for different force fields and to spectral densities from other light-harvesting complexes. In addition, time-dependent and time-independent excitonic Hamiltonians of the system have been constructed and applied to the determination of absorption spectra as well as exciton dynamics.},

The charge transport times and currents that may be generated in these assemblies are also estimated using kinetic simulations. The first ratcheting mechanism described for nanoscale systems requires local electric fields on the 10 9 V/m scale to realize nearly 100\% population transport. The second ratcheting mechanism for even larger systems, based on electrochemical gating, is estimated to generate currents as large as 0.1 pA for DNA structures that are a few μ m in length with a gate voltage of about 5 V, a magnitude comparable to currents measured in DNA wires at the nanoscale when a source–drain voltage bias of similar magnitude is applied, suggesting an approach to considerably extend the distance range over which DNA charge transport devices may operate.},

For all heptapeptides, except GY7, parallel β-sheet organizations with polar residues packed at the steric zipper appear to be the preferred assemblies for the two β-sheets system due to the formation of a strong network of hydrogen bonds. For GY7, however, an antiparallel organization with glycine at the steric zipper is the most stable one. The preferred architecture is mostly conserved when enlarging our model from two to four β-sheets. The present work shows that the relative stability of different architectures results from a delicate balance between peptide composition, side chain hydrophobicity, and non-covalent interactions at the interface and provides the basis for a rational design of new improved artificial prion-inspired materials.},

The purpose of the present paper is to study, unlike the previous studies, how the stable DLMs are formed not in a melt but in a solution of symmetric diblock copolymers with a nonselective solvent that wets the thin film on the patterned substrate. It is shown, via a straightforward self-consistent field calculation of the total solution free energy for various competing phases, that the DLM could be formed in the solutions (with the solvent volume fraction of 0.5), which provides much faster thermodynamic equilibration of the solution as compared to the melt. The last circumstance can ease the production of stable DLMs in thin films of copolymers.

The system includes two crosslinker molecules, which differ in their glass transition temperatures ( T g ) and chain length and thus have the potential for phase separation. One crosslinker has a high T g corresponding to a rubbery behavior, and simulations were performed for a short length (4 beads) and a long length (33 beads). The resin and other crosslinker have low T g . A coarse-grained model is developed with these features and with interaction parameters determined so that for either rubbery crosslinker length, the system is in the liquid state at the cure temperature. For sufficiently slow reaction rates, the long rubbery molecule exhibits PIPS into a bicontinuous array of nanoscale domains, but the short one does not, reproducing recent experimental results. The simulations demonstrate that the reaction rates must be slow enough to allow diffusion to yield phase separation. Particularly, the reaction rate corresponding to the secondary amine must be very slow, else the structure of crosslinked clusters and the substantially increased diffusion time will prevent PIPS.},

In this article, we present a model that describes this enhanced sorption in binary brushes of immiscible A–B polymers. To do so, we set up a free-energy model to predict the interfacial area between the different polymer phases in binary brushes. This description is combined with Gibbs adsorption isotherms to determine the adsorption at these interfaces. We validate our model with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, based on our results, we propose design parameters (A–B chain fraction, grafting density, vapor, and A–B interaction strength) for optimal vapor absorption in coatings composed of binary brushes.},

Flow alone (i.e., without local heating) in a direction normal to the helical axis does not affect the cholesteric pitch.

  abstract = {Long chain molecules can be entropically compacted in a crowded medium. We study the compaction transition of a heterogeneous polymer with ring topology by crowding effects in a free or confined space. For this, we use molecular dynamics simulations in which the effects of crowders are taken into account through effective interactions between chain segments. Our parameter choices are inspired by the Escherichia coli chromosome. The polymer consists of small and big monomers; the big monomers dispersed along the backbone are to mimic the binding of RNA polymerases. Our results show that the compaction transition is a two-step process: initial compaction induced by the association (clustering) of big monomers followed by a gradual overall compaction. They also indicate that cylindrical confinement makes the initial transition more effective; for representative parameter choices, the initial compaction accounts for about 60\% reduction in the chain size. Our simulation results support the view that crowding promotes clustering of active transcription units into transcription factories.},

  abstract = {By using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the structure and dynamics of supercooled single-chain cross-linked nanoparticle (SCNP) melts having a range of cross-linking degrees ϕ . We find a nearly linear increase in glass-transition temperature ( T g ) with increasing ϕ . Correspondingly, we have also experimentally synthesized a series of polystyrene-based SCNPs and have found that the measured T g estimated from differential scanning calorimetry is qualitatively consistent with the trend predicted by our simulation estimates. Experimentally, an increase in T g as large as Δ T g = 61 K for ϕ = 0.36 is found compared with their linear chain counterparts, indicating that the changes in dynamics with cross-links are quite appreciable. We attribute the increase in T g to the enlarged effective hard-core volume and the corresponding reduction in the free volume of the polymer segments. Topological constraints evidently frustrate the local packing. In addition, the introduction of intra-molecular cross-linking bonds slows down the structural relaxation and simultaneously enhances the local coupling motion on the length scales within SCNPs. Consequently, a more pronounced dynamical heterogeneity (DH) is observed for larger ϕ , as quantified by measuring the dynamical correlation length through the four-point susceptibility parameter, χ 4 . The increase in DH is directly related to the enhanced local cooperative motion derived from intra-molecular cross-linking bonds and structural heterogeneity derived from the cross-linking process. These results shed new light on the influence of intra-molecular topological constraints on the segmental dynamics of polymer melts.},

The use of the ionic liquid allows us to investigate the changes that the system undergoes with the addition of the amide or, equivalently, the changes from an ionic liquid to a DES. Our studies revealed that the vibrational probe in the DES senses a very similar local environment irrespective of the cation chemical structure. In addition, the amide also appears to perceive the same molecular environment. The concentration dependence studies also showed that the amide changes from being isolated from other amides in the ionic liquid environment to an environment where the amide–amide interactions are favored. In the case of the vibrational probe, the addition of the amide produced significant changes in the slow dynamics associated with the making and breaking of the ionic cages but did not affect the rattling-in-cage motions perceived by it. Furthermore, the concentration dependence of slow dynamics showed two regimes which are linked to the changes in the overall structure of the solution. These observations are interpreted in the context of a nanoscopic heterogeneous environment in the DES which, according to the observed dynamical regimes, appears at very large concentrations of the amide (molar ratio of greater than 1:1) since for lower amide molar ratios, the amide appears to be not segregated from the ionic liquid. This proposed molecular picture is supported by small angle x-ray scattering experiments.},

Chem. Chem. Phys. 22 , 14169 (2020)]. The charge peak decreases slightly with increasing temperature at fixed conductivity, however. For simple liquids, curves with invariant dynamics and structure, known as isomorphs, can be identified as configurational adiabats. While liquids with strong-Coulomb interactions do not have good isomorphs, ionic liquids could be an intermediate case with approximate isomorphs along which some aspects of structure and dynamics are invariant. We study a simple molten salt model using molecular dynamics simulations to test this hypothesis. Simple measures of structure and dynamics are investigated along with one transport property, the shear viscosity. We find that there is a substantial degree of invariance of the self-intermediate scattering function, the mean square displacement, and the viscosity along configurational adiabats over a wide range of densities for the three adiabats simulated. The density range studied is more than a factor of two and extends from the strong-Coulomb regime at low densities to the weak-Coulomb regime at high densities. The structure is not invariant over the full range of density, but in the weak-Coulomb regime, we see behavior similar to that seen experimentally over density changes of order 15\%. In view of the limited structural invariance but substantial dynamical invariance, we designate the configurational adiabats as isodynes .},

  abstract = {We generalize the self-consistent cooperative hopping theory for a dilute spherical penetrant or tracer activated dynamics in dense metastable hard sphere fluids and glasses to address the effect of external stress, the consequences of which are systematically established as a function of matrix packing fraction and penetrant-to-matrix size ratio. All relaxation processes speed up under stress, but the difference between the penetrant and matrix hopping (alpha relaxation) times decreases significantly with stress corresponding to less time scale decoupling. A dynamic crossover occurs at a critical “slaving onset” stress beyond which the matrix activated hopping relaxation time controls the penetrant hopping time. This characteristic stress increases (decreases) exponentially with packing fraction (size ratio) and can be well below the absolute yield stress of the matrix. Below the slaving onset, the penetrant hopping time is predicted to vary exponentially with stress, differing from the power law dependence of the pure matrix alpha time due to system-specificity of the stress-induced changes in the penetrant local cage and elastic barriers. An exponential growth of the penetrant alpha relaxation time with size ratio under stress is predicted, and at a fixed matrix packing fraction, the exponential relation between penetrant hopping time and stress for different size ratios can be collapsed onto a master curve. Direct connections between the short- and long-time activated penetrant dynamics and between the penetrant (or matrix) alpha relaxation time and matrix thermodynamic dimensionless compressibility are also predicted. The presented results should be testable in future experiments and simulations.},

The results for pure silica are first compared to reference potentials prior to an investigation of the thermodynamic diagram, the diffusivity, and the structure under different ( T , P ) conditions. It is found that the equation of state and the diffusivity are weakly sensitive to the nature of the incorporated noble gas, leading to a similar trend with density for all systems. The network structure is weakly altered by the presence of the gas, and pressure induced structural changes are those usually found for amorphous and liquid silica, i.e., Si coordination increase, tetrahedral to octahedral conversion of the base geometry, and collapse of large rings under pressure. Ne- and Ar-based systems display an increased structuration, however, as preferential distances appear in gas–gas correlations at large densities in both the liquid and amorphous states. Finally, we focus on the conditions of heterogeneity that are driven by the formation of noble gas bubbles, and these appear for a threshold density ρ c that is observed for all systems.},

The results demonstrate that these liquids are thermorheologically complex with the coexistence of a fast and a slow relaxation process, which could be attributed to the segmental motion of the phosphate chains and the Zn–O bond scission/renewal dynamics, respectively. The segmental motion of the phosphate chains is found to be the dominant process associated with the shear relaxation for all metaphosphate liquids. The compositional evolution of the calorimetric fragility of these liquids is shown to be related to the conformational entropy of the constituent phosphate chains, which is manifested by the width of the relaxation time distribution for the segmental chain motion. This entropy decreases and the temporal coupling between the chain dynamics and Zn–O bond scission-renewal increases with the increasing Zn content as the higher field strength Zn modifier ions provide more effective cross-linking between the phosphate chains.},

We calculate the relevant properties of the phase diagram, and we find that TIP4P/Ice presents a retracing line of density maxima, similar to what was previously found for atomistic water models and models of other tetrahedral liquids. For this model, a liquid–liquid critical point between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid was recently found. We compute the lines of the maxima of isothermal compressibility and the minima of the coefficient of thermal expansion in the one phase region, and we show that these lines point to the liquid–liquid critical point while collapsing on the Widom line. This line is the line of the maxima of correlation length that emanates from a second order critical point in the one phase region. Supercooled water was found to follow mode coupling theory and to undergo a transition from a fragile to a strong behavior right at the crossing of the Widom line. We find here that this phenomenology also happens for TIP4P/Ice. Our results appear, therefore, to be a general characteristic of supercooled water, which does not depend on the interaction potential used, and they reinforce the idea that the dynamical crossover from a region where the relaxation mechanism is dominated by cage relaxation to a region where cages are frozen and hopping dominates is correlated in water to a phase transition between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid.},

For the first time, the shape of the dependence of the degree of covalence in HBs on 1 J (N–H), 1 J (O–H), 2h J (O–N), and δ ( 1 H) during the proton transfer process in o -hydroxyaryl Schiff bases was analyzed. Parameters obtained from Bader’s theory of atoms in molecules were used to assess the dependence of covalent character in HBs with both the NMR properties. The influence of π-electronic delocalization on 2h J (N–O) under the proton transfer process was investigated. 2h J (O–N) in a Mannich base was also studied in order to compare the results with an unsaturated system. In addition, substituent effects on the phenolic ring were investigated. Our results indicate that the covalent character of HBs on both sides of the transition state undergoes a smooth exponential increase as the δ ( 1 H) moves downfield. The degree of covalence of the N⋯H (O⋯H) bond increases linearly as 1 J (N–H) ( 1 J (O–H)) becomes more negative, even after reaching the transition state. Non-vanishing values of spin dipolar (SD) and paramagnetic spin orbital terms of 2h J (O–N) show that π-electronic delocalization has a non-negligible effect on tautomeric equilibrium and gives evidence of the presence of the resonance assisted HB.Variation of the SD term of 2h J (O–N) follows a similar pattern as the change in the para-delocalization aromaticity index of the chelate ring.},

Additionally, the synergistic effect between the gold nanocluster and co-catalyst played a crucial role in CO 2 cycloaddition.},

  abstract = {Linearly polarized synchrotron radiation has been used to record polarization dependent valence shell photoelectron spectra of imidazole in the photon energy range 21–100 eV. These have allowed the photoelectron angular distributions, as characterized by the anisotropy parameter β , and the electronic state intensity branching ratios to be determined. Complementing these experimental data, theoretical photoionization partial cross sections and β -parameters have been calculated for the outer valence shell orbitals. The assignment of the structure appearing in the experimental photoelectron spectra has been guided by vertical ionization energies and spectral intensities calculated by various theoretical methods that incorporate electron correlation and orbital relaxation. Strong orbital relaxation effects have been found for the 15a′, nitrogen lone-pair orbital. The calculations also predict that configuration mixing leads to the formation of several low-lying satellite states. The vibrational structure associated with ionization out of a particular orbital has been simulated within the Franck–Condon model using harmonic vibrational modes. The adiabatic approximation appears to be valid for the X 2 A″ state, with the β -parameter for this state being independent of the level of vibrational excitation. However, for all the other outer valence ionic states, a disparity occurs between the observed and the simulated vibrational structure, and the measured β -parameters are at variance with the behavior expected at the level of the Franck–Condon approximation. These inconsistencies suggest that the excited electronic states may be interacting vibronically such that the nuclear dynamics occur over coupled potential energy surfaces.},

  abstract = {The pure rotational spectrum of thiazole ( c -C 3 H 3 NS, C s ) has been studied in the millimeter-wave region from 130 to 375 GHz. Nearly 4800 newly measured rotational transitions for the ground vibrational state of the main isotopologue were combined with previously reported measurements and least-squares fit to a complete sextic Hamiltonian. Transitions for six singly substituted heavy-atom isotopologues ( 13 C, 15 N, 33 S, 34 S) were observed at natural abundance and likewise fit. Several deuterium-enriched samples were prepared, which gave access to the rotational spectra of 16 additional isotopologues, 14 of which had not been previously studied. The rotational spectra of each isotopologue were fit to A- and S-reduced distorted-rotor Hamiltonians in the I r representation. The experimental values of the ground-state rotational constants ( A 0 , B 0 , and C 0 ) from each isotopologue were converted to determinable constants ( A 0 ″, B 0 ″, and C 0 ″), which were corrected for effects of vibration–rotation interactions and electron-mass distributions using coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples calculations [CCSD(T)/cc-pCVTZ]. The moments of inertia from the resulting constants ( A e , B e , and C e ) of 24 isotopologues were used to determine the precise semi-experimental equilibrium structure ( r e SE ) of thiazole. As a basis for comparison, a purely theoretical equilibrium structure was estimated by an electronic structure calculation [CCSD(T)/cc-pCV5Z] that was subsequently corrected for extrapolation to the complete basis set, electron correlation beyond CCSD(T), relativistic effects, and the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction. The precise r e SE structure is compared to the resulting “best theoretical estimate” structure. Some, but not all, of the best theoretical r e structural parameters fall within the narrow statistical limits (2σ) of the r e SE results. The possible origin of the discrepancies between the best theoretical estimate r e and semi-empirical r e SE structures is discussed.},

Despite similar icosahedral Au 13 cores 1 and 3 , their absorption and photoluminescence profiles were evidently different.

We consider vibronic coupling that arises through either Franck–Condon activity in which each site in the heterodimer has a local electron–phonon coupling or Herzberg–Teller activity in which the transition dipole moment coupling the sites has an explicit vibrational mode-dependence. We have computed two-dimensional electronic–vibrational (2DEV) spectra for this model while varying the magnitude of these two effects and find that 2DEV spectra contain static and dynamic signatures of both types of vibronic coupling. Franck–Condon activity emerges through a change in the observed excitonic structure, while Herzberg–Teller activity is evident in the appearance of significant side-band transitions that mimic the lower-energy excitonic structure. A comparison of quantum beating patterns obtained from analysis of the simulated 2DEV spectra shows that this technique can report on the mechanism of energy transfer, elucidating a means of experimentally determining the role of specific vibronic coupling mechanisms in such processes.},

A particular strength of this method is its straightforward access to imaginary-time correlation functions (ITCFs). For example, the well-known density–density ITCF F ( q , τ ) allows one to estimate the linear response of a given system for all wave vectors q from a single simulation of the unperturbed system. Moreover, it constitutes the basis for the reconstruction of the dynamic structure factor S ( q , ω )—a key quantity in state-of-the-art scattering experiments. In this work, we present analogous relations between the nonlinear density response in the quadratic and cubic order of the perturbation strength and generalized ITCFs measuring correlations between up to four imaginary-time arguments. As a practical demonstration of our new approach, we carry out simulations of the warm dense electron gas and find excellent agreement with previous PIMC results that had been obtained with substantially larger computational effort. In addition, we give a relation between a cubic ITCF and the triple dynamic structure factor S ( q 1 , ω 1 ; q 2 , ω 2 ), which evokes the enticing possibility to study dynamic three-body effects on an ab initio level.},

Due to the preprocessing, standard Gaussian basis sets from basis set libraries can be used in OEP calculations. As examples, we present numerical stable computational setups based on aux-cc-pwCVXZ basis sets with X = T, Q, 5 for the orbitals and aux-cc-pVDZ/mp2fit and aux-cc-pVTZ/mp2fit auxiliary basis sets and use them to calculate KS exchange potentials with the exact exchange-only KS method for various atoms and molecules. The resulting exchange potentials not only are numerically stable and physically reasonable but also show convergence with increasing quality of the orbital basis sets. The effect of incorporating exact conditions that the KS exchange potential has to obey is discussed. Moreover, it is briefly demonstrated that the presented approach not only works for KS exchange potentials but equally well for correlation potentials within the direct random phase approximation. Besides for OEP methods, the introduced preprocessing of auxiliary basis sets should also be beneficial in procedures to calculate back effective KS potentials from given electron densities.},

The formalism required to compute fluorescence, Internal Conversion (IC), and Inter-System Crossing (ISC) is discussed. The IC mechanism, in particular, is a difficult pathway to compute due to difficulties associated with the computation of required bosonic configurations and non-adiabatic coupling elements. Here, we offer a discussion and breakdown on how to model these pathways at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level with respect to its computational implementation, strengths, and current limitations. The model is then used to compute the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of a number of small but important compounds: anthracene, tetracene, pentacene, diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole (DPP), and Perylene Diimide (PDI) within a polarizable continuum model. Rate constants for fluorescence, IC, and ISC compare well for the most part with respect to experiment, despite triplet energies being overestimated to a degree. The resulting PLQYs are promising with respect to the level of theory being DFT. While we obtained a positive result for PDI within the Franck–Condon limit, the other systems require a second order correction. Recomputing quantum yields with Herzberg–Teller terms yields PLQYs of 0.19, 0.08, 0.04, 0.70, and 0.99 for anthracene, tetracene, pentacene, DPP, and PDI, respectively. Based on these results, we are confident that the presented methodology is sound with respect to the level of quantum chemistry and presents an important stepping stone in the search for a tool to predict the properties of larger coupled systems.},

In this article, we explore the variation of the Hartree–Fock fractional-spin (or ghost-interaction) error in one-electron systems using restricted and unrestricted ensemble densities and the exact generalized Hartree–Fock representation. By considering the hydrogen atom and H + 2 cation, we analyze how the unrestricted and generalized Hartree–Fock schemes minimize this error by localizing the electrons or rotating the spin coordinates. We also reveal a clear similarity between the Coulomb hole of He-like ions and the density depletion near the nucleus induced by the fractional-spin error in the unpolarized hydrogen atom. Finally, we analyze the effect of the fractional-spin error on the Møller–Plesset adiabatic connection, excited states, and functional- and density-driven errors.},

While modern density functional methods have proven to accurately predict trends in intramolecular reorganization energy, such calculations are computationally expensive. In this work, we outline active machine learning methods to predict computed intramolecular reorganization energies of a wide range of polythiophenes and their use toward screening new compounds with low internal reorganization energies. Our models have an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of ±0.113 eV, but a much smaller RMSE of only ±0.036 eV on the new screening set. Since the larger error derives from high-reorganization energy compounds, the new method is highly effective to screen for compounds with potentially efficient charge transport parameters.},

By understanding what features were used to generate predictions, scientists are then able to critically evaluate the credibility of the predictions and gain new insights. Here, we demonstrate that ignoring hyperparameters viewed as less impactful to the overall model performance can deprecate model explainability. Specifically, we demonstrate that random forest models trained using unconstrained maximum depths, in accordance with accepted best practices, often can report a randomly generated feature as being one of the most important features in generated predictions for classifying an alloy as being a high entropy alloy. We demonstrate that this is the case for impurity, permutation, and Shapley importance rankings, and the latter two showed no strong structure in terms of optimal hyperparameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, for the case of impurity importance rankings, only optimizing the validation accuracy, as is also considered standard in the random forest community, yields models that prefer the random feature in generating their predictions. We show that by adopting a Pareto optimization strategy to model performance that balances validation statistics with the differences between the training and validation statistics, one obtains models that reject random features and thus balance model predictive power and explainability.},

Herein, we develop a stochastic GW method for calculating these charge excitation energies. The approach employs maximally localized electronic states to define the electronic subspace of a molecule and the rest of the system, both of which are randomly sampled. We test the method on three solute–solvent systems: phenol, thymine, and phenylalanine in water. The results are in excellent agreement with the previous high-level calculations and available experimental data. The stochastic calculations for supercells containing up to 1000 electrons representing the solvated systems are inexpensive and require ≤ 1000 central processing unit hrs. We find that the coupling with the environment accounts for ∼ 40\% of the total correlation energy. The solvent-to-solute feedback mechanism incorporated in the molecular correlation term causes up to 0.6 eV destabilization of the quasiparticle energy. Simulated photo-emission spectra exhibit red shifts, state-degeneracy lifting, and lifetime shortening. Our method provides an efficient approach for an accurate study of excitations of large molecules in realistic condensed phase environments.},

  abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) have become one of the preferred methods for the analysis and interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of conformational transitions in biopolymers. While there is great variation in terms of implementation, a well-defined workflow involving multiple steps is often adopted. Typically, molecular coordinates are first subjected to dimensionality reduction and then clustered into small “microstates,” which are subsequently lumped into “macrostates” using the information from the slowest eigenmodes. However, the microstate dynamics is often non-Markovian, and long lag times are required to converge the relevant slow dynamics in the MSM. Here, we propose a variation on this typical workflow, taking advantage of hierarchical density-based clustering. When applied to simulation data, this type of clustering separates high population regions of conformational space from others that are rarely visited. In this way, density-based clustering naturally implements assignment of the data based on transitions between metastable states, resulting in a core-set MSM. As a result, the state definition becomes more consistent with the assumption of Markovianity, and the timescales of the slow dynamics of the system are recovered more effectively. We present results of this simplified workflow for a model potential and MD simulations of the alanine dipeptide and the FiP35 WW domain.},

  abstract = {The many-body expansion (MBE) is an efficient tool that has a long history of use for calculating interaction energies, binding energies, lattice energies, and so on. In the past, applications of MBE to correlation energy have been unfeasible for large systems, but recent improvements to computing resources have sparked renewed interest in capturing the correlation energy using the generalized n th order Bethe–Goldstone equation. In this work, we extend this approach, originally proposed for a Slater determinant, to a tensor product state (TPS) based wavefunction. By partitioning the active space into smaller orbital clusters, our approach starts from a cluster mean field reference TPS configuration and includes the correlation contribution of the excited TPSs using the MBE. This method, named cluster MBE (cMBE), improves the convergence of MBE at lower orders compared to directly doing a block-based MBE from a RHF reference. We present numerical results for strongly correlated systems, such as the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models and the chromium dimer. The performance of the cMBE method is also tested by partitioning the extended π space of several large π -conjugated systems, including a graphene nano-sheet with a very large active space of 114 electrons in 114 orbitals, which would require 10 66 determinants for the exact FCI solution.},

With these restrictions, the EKT is equivalent to the CI procedure involving all hole-state configurations derived from the active space of the reference wavefunction and has properties analogous to those of the original Koopmans theorem. The equivalence is used to demonstrate in a transparent manner that the first ionization energy predicted by the EKT is in general not exact, i.e., not equal to the difference between the full CI energies of the neutral and the ion, but can approach the full CI result with arbitrary precision even within a finite basis set.

  abstract = {Undercoordinated metal nanoclusters have shown great promise for various catalytic applications. However, their activity is often limited by the covalently bonded ligands, which could block the active surface sites. Here, we investigate the ligand removal process for Au 25 nanoclusters using both thermal and electrochemical treatments, as well as its impact on the electroreduction of CO 2 to CO. The Au 25 nanoclusters are synthesized with 2-phenylethanethiol as the capping agent and anchored on sulfur-doped graphene. The thiolate ligands can be readily removed under either thermal annealing at ≥180°C or electrochemical biasing at ≤−0.5 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, as evidenced by the Cu underpotential deposition surface area measurement, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. However, these ligand-removing treatments also trigger the structural evolution of Au 25 nanoclusters concomitantly. The thermally and electrochemically treated Au 25 nanoclusters show enhanced activity and selectivity for the electrochemical CO 2 -to-CO conversion than their pristine counterpart, which is attributed to the exposure of undercoordinated Au sites on the surface after ligand removal. This work provides facile strategies to strip away the staple ligands from metal nanoclusters and highlights its importance in promoting the catalytic performances.},

  abstract = {Molecular vibrational polaritons, a hybridized quasiparticle formed by the strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and photon cavity modes, have attracted tremendous attention in the chemical physics community due to their peculiar influence on chemical reactions. At the same time, the half-photon half-matter characteristics of polaritons make them suitable to possess properties from both sides and lead to new features that are useful for photonic and quantum technology applications. To eventually use polaritons for chemical and quantum applications, it is critical to understand their dynamics. Due to the intrinsic time scale of cavity modes and molecular vibrational modes in condensed phases, polaritons can experience dynamics on ultrafast time scales, e.g., relaxation from polaritons to dark modes. Thus, ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy becomes an ideal tool to investigate such dynamics. In this Perspective, we give an overview of recent ultrafast spectroscopic works by our group and others in the field. These recent works show that molecular vibrational polaritons can have distinct dynamics from its pure molecular counterparts, such as intermolecular vibrational energy transfer and hot vibrational dynamics. We then discuss some current challenges and future opportunities, such as the possible use of ultrafast vibrational dynamics, to understand cavity-modified reactions and routes to develop molecular vibrational polaritons as new room temperature quantum platforms.},

  abstract = {Understanding the permeation of biomolecules through cellular membranes is critical for many biotechnological applications, including targeted drug delivery, pathogen detection, and the development of new antibiotics. To this end, computer simulations are routinely used to probe the underlying mechanisms of membrane permeation. Despite great progress and continued development, permeation simulations of realistic systems (e.g., more complex drug molecules or biologics through heterogeneous membranes) remain extremely challenging if not intractable. In this work, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with transition-tempered metadynamics and techniques from the variational approach to conformational dynamics to study the permeation mechanism of a drug molecule, trimethoprim, through a multicomponent membrane. We show that collective variables (CVs) obtained from an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called time-structure based Independent Component Analysis (tICA) improve performance and substantially accelerate convergence of permeation potential of mean force (PMF) calculations. The addition of cholesterol to the lipid bilayer is shown to increase both the width and height of the free energy barrier due to a condensing effect (lower area per lipid) and increase bilayer thickness. Additionally, the tICA CVs reveal a subtle effect of cholesterol increasing the resistance to permeation in the lipid head group region, which is not observed when canonical CVs are used. We conclude that the use of tICA CVs can enable more efficient PMF calculations with additional insight into the permeation mechanism.},

The species, 2A and 3B, have two A and three B patches, respectively, and only bonds between patches A and B (AB bonds) are allowed. This model describes colloidal systems where the aggregation of particles (3B) is mediated and controlled by a second species, the linkers (2A) to which they bind strongly. Thermodynamic calculations are performed using Wertheim’s perturbation theory with a hard sphere reference term that accounts for the difference in the size of the two species. Percolation lines are determined employing a generalized Flory–Stockmayer theory, and the effects of gravity are included through a local density approximation. The bulk phase diagrams are calculated, and all the stacking sequences generated in the presence of gravity are determined and classified in a stacking diagram. The relative size of the particles can be used to control the phase behavior of the mixture. An increase in the size of particles 3B, relative to the size of the linkers 2A, is found to promote mixing while keeping the percolating structures and, in certain cases, leads to changes in the stacking sequence under gravity.},

Various activities and ABP concentrations below and above the critical values for motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) are considered. In a homogeneous ABP fluid, the embedded polymer swells with increasing bath activity, with stronger swelling for larger densities. The polymer dynamics is enhanced, with the diffusion coefficient increasing by a power-law with increasing activity, where the exponent depends on the ABP concentration. For ABP concentrations in the MIPS regime, we observe a localization of the polymer in the low-density ABP phase associated with polymer collapse for moderate activities and a reswelling for high activities accompanied by a preferred localization in the high-density ABP phase. Localization and reswelling are independent of the polymer stiffness, with stiff polymers behaving similarly to flexible polymers. The polymer collapse is associated with a slowdown of its dynamics and a significantly smaller center-of-mass diffusion coefficient. In general, the polymer dynamics can only partially be described by an effective (bath) temperature. Moreover, the properties of a polymer embedded in a homogeneous active bath deviate quantitatively from those of a polymer composed of active monomers, i.e., linear chains of ABPs; however, such a polymer exhibits qualitatively similar activity-dependent features.},

Furthermore, calculated vibrational eigenvectors and spectra allowed us to identify characteristic in-plane (NO 2 scissoring) and out-of-plane (C–H wagging) modes and to predict their strength in the spectrum in dependence of the adsorption geometry.

Our extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that the QLB exhibits structure and dynamics indistinguishable from the bilayer liquid phase, acting as a lower-dimensional analog of the QLL on the bulk ice. We further find that at low temperatures, the width of the QLBs at armchair-type edges of the 2D ice is almost identical to that at zigzag-type edges but becomes far greater than the latter at temperatures near the melting point. The chirality-dependent edge premelting of 2D ices should add an important new ingredient to the heterogeneity of premelting.},

We find that both the surface corrugation and the phonon coupling vary strongly with molecular orientation and that there is a “chemical” aspect to this due to the catalytic nature of the metal. For example, molecules with reactive orientations can approach close to surface sites with low barriers to dissociation. Moreover, lattice motion can lower the barrier to dissociation, leading to unusual behavior for the phonon coupling. We find good agreement with experiment and two recent classical studies if we average our potential energy surface over several orientations of the molecule. We also find reasonable agreement with a recent study of methane diffraction, although we show that diffraction does not play a major role in trapping on the smooth Ir(111) surface and that trapping obeys normal energy scaling, consistent with experiment. We show that the trapping probability can be sensitive to the temperature at both high and low incidence energies. Relaxation and desorption of trapped particles are examined.},

  abstract = {The world desperately needs new technologies and solutions for gas capture and separation. To make this possible, molecular modeling is applied here to investigate the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of a model for the poly(urethane urea) (PUU) oligomer model to selectively capture CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 . In this work, we applied a well-known approach to derive atomic partial charges for atoms in a polymer chain based on self-consistent sampling using quantum chemistry and stochastic dynamics. The interactions of the gases with the PUU model were studied in a pure gas based system as well as in a gas mixture. A detailed structure characterization revealed high interaction of CO 2 molecules with the hard segments of the PUU. Therefore, the structural and energy properties explain the reasons for the greater CO 2 sorption than CH 4 . We find that the CO 2 sorption is higher than the CH 4 with a selectivity of 7.5 at 298 K for the gas mixture. We characterized the Gibbs dividing surface for each system, and the CO 2 is confined for a long time at the gas–oligomer model interface. The simulated oligomer model showed performance above the 2008 Robeson’s upper bound and may be a potential material for CO 2 /CH 4 separation. Further computational and experimental studies are needed to evaluate the material.},

  abstract = {Electrochemistry experiments have established that the capacitance of electrode–electrolyte interfaces is much larger for good metals, such as gold and platinum, than for carbon-based materials. Despite the development of elaborate electrode interaction potentials, to date molecular dynamics simulations are not able to capture this effect. Here, we show that changing the width of the Gaussian charge distribution used to represent the atomic charges in gold is an effective way to tune its metallicity. Larger Gaussian widths lead to a capacitance of aqueous solutions (pure water and 1 M NaCl) in good agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics results. For pure water, the increase in the capacitance is not accompanied by structural changes, while in the presence of salt, the Na + cations tend to adsorb significantly on the surface. For a strongly metallic gold electrode, these ions can even form inner sphere complexes on hollow sites of the surface.},

  abstract = {The catalytic reduction in carbon dioxide is a crucial step in many chemical industrial reactions, such as methanol synthesis, the reverse water–gas shift reaction, and formic acid synthesis. Here, we investigate the role of bulk hydrogen, where hydrogen atoms are found deep inside a metal surface as opposed to subsurface ones, upon CO 2 reduction over a Ni(110) surface using density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While it has previously been shown that subsurface hydrogen stabilizes CO 2 and can aid in overcoming reaction barriers, the role of bulk hydrogen is less studied and thus unknown with regard to CO 2 reduction. We find that the presence of bulk hydrogen can significantly alter the electronic structure of the Ni(110) surface, particularly the work function and d -band center, such that CO 2 adsorbs more strongly to the surface and is more easily reduced. Our results show an enhanced CO 2 dissociation in the presence of bulk hydrogen, shedding light on a hitherto underappreciated mechanistic pathway for CO 2 reduction on metal surfaces.},

  abstract = {Single metallic particles and dimers of nanospheres have been used extensively for sensing, but dimers of particles provide attractive advantages because they exhibit multiple modes that can be tuned by the dimer geometry. Here, we employ correlative microscopy of single self-assembled dimers of gold nanorods to study their performance as refractometric sensors. The correlation between atomic force microscopy and single-particle white-light spectroscopy allows us to relate the measured sensitivity to numerical simulations taking into account the exact geometry of the construct. The sensitivity of the antibonding mode is in good agreement with simulations, whereas the bonding mode exhibits a reduced sensitivity related to the accessibility of the gap region between the particles. We find that the figure of merit is a trade-off between the resonance linewidth and its refractive index sensitivity, which depend in opposite ways on the interparticle angle. The presence of two narrow plasmon resonances in the visible to near-infrared wavelength regime makes nanorod dimers exciting candidates for multicolor and multiplexed sensing.},

  abstract = {A new connection between the structure and dynamics in glass-forming liquids is presented. We show how the origin of spatially localized excitations, as defined by the dynamical facilitation (DF) theory, can be understood from a structure-based framework. This framework is constructed by associating excitation events in the DF theory to hopping events between energy minima in the potential energy landscape (PEL). By reducing the PEL to an equal energy well picture and applying a harmonic approximation, we develop a field theory to describe elastic fluctuations about inherent states, which are energy minimizing configurations of the PEL. We model an excitation as a shear transformation zone (STZ) inducing a localized pure shear deformation onto an inherent state. We connect STZs to T1 transition events that break the elastic bonds holding the local structure of an inherent state. A formula for the excitation energy barrier, denoted as J σ , is obtained as a function of inherent-state elastic moduli and the radial distribution function. The energy barrier from the current theory is compared to the one predicted by the DF theory where good agreement is found in various two-dimensional continuous poly-disperse atomistic models of glass formers. These results strengthen the role of structure and elasticity in driving glassy dynamics through the creation and relaxation of localized excitations.},

  abstract = {Lithium-salt-based deep eutectic solvents, where the only cation is Li + , are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical energy-storage devices, such as batteries. We have performed broadband dielectric spectroscopy on three such systems, covering a broad temperature and dynamic range that extends from the low-viscosity liquid around room temperature down to the glassy state approaching the glass-transition temperature. We detect a relaxational process that can be ascribed to dipolar reorientational dynamics and exhibits the clear signatures of glassy freezing. We find that the temperature dependence of the ionic dc conductivity and its room-temperature value also are governed by the glassy dynamics of these systems, depending, e.g., on the glass-transition temperature and fragility. Compared to the previously investigated corresponding systems, containing choline chloride instead of a lithium salt, both the reorientational and ionic dynamics are significantly reduced due to variations in the glass-transition temperature and the higher ionic potential of the lithium ions. These lithium-based deep eutectic solvents partly exhibit significant decoupling of the dipolar reorientational and the ionic translational dynamics and approximately follow a fractional Debye–Stokes–Einstein relation, leading to an enhancement of the dc conductivity, especially at low temperatures. The presented results clearly reveal the importance of decoupling effects and of the typical glass-forming properties of these systems for the technically relevant room-temperature conductivity.},

  abstract = {Hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (HDESs) have gained immense popularity because of their promising applications in extraction processes. Herein, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to unveil the dynamics of DL-menthol (DLM) based HDESs with hexanoic (C6), octanoic (C8), and decanoic (C10) acids as hydrogen bond donors. The particular focus is on understanding the nature of dynamics with changing acid tail length. For all three HDESs, two modes of hydrogen bond relaxations are observed. We observe longer hydrogen bond lifetimes of the inter-molecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the carbonyl oxygen of the acid and hydroxyl oxygen of menthol with hydroxyl hydrogen of both acids and menthol. We infer strong hydrogen bonding between them compared to that between hydroxyl oxygen of acids and hydroxyl hydrogens of menthol and acids, marked by a faster decay rate and shorter hydrogen bond lifetime. The translational dynamics of the species in the HDES becomes slower with increasing tail length of the organic acid. Slightly enhanced caging is also observed for the HDES with a longer tail length of the acids. The evidence of dynamic heterogeneity in the displacements of the component molecules is observed in all the HDESs. From the values of the α -relaxation time scale, we observe that the molecular displacements become random in a shorter time scale for DLM-C6. The analysis of the self-van Hove function reveals that the overall distance covered by DLM and acid molecules in the respective HDES is more than what is expected from ideal diffusion. As marked by the shorter time scale associated with hole filling, the diffusion of the oxygen atom of menthol and the carbonyl oxygen of acid from one site to the other is fastest for hexanoic acid containing HDES.},

Although the structural relaxation processes in the vicinity of glass transition temperature are phenomenologically expressed by the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function and the relaxation time can be successfully interpreted by Adam–Gibbs theory and/or Narayanaswamy’s model, the atomic rearrangement, which is the origin of the volume change, and its driving force have not been elucidated. Using the microsecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations, this study provides insights to quantitatively determine the origin of the thermal shrinkage below T g in a soda-lime silicate glass. We found that during annealing below T g , Na ions penetrate into the six-membered silicate rings, which remedies the acute O–O–O angles of the energetically unstable rings. The ring structure change makes the space to possess the cation inside the rings, but the ring volume is eventually reduced, which results in thermal shrinkage of the soda-lime silica glass. In conclusion, the dynamical structural relaxation due to the cation displacement evokes the overall volume relaxation at low temperature in the glassy material.},

The thermodynamical states of the clusters were characterized by measuring the cluster beam velocity and the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of embedded molecules. Two distinct velocity components were identified in the beam that originates from different clustering mechanisms. The fast velocity component corresponds to the expansion of H 2 from the gas phase, while the slow velocity component corresponds to the expansion from the liquid phase. The velocity distribution of these two components showed no significant difference between the expansions of para and normal hydrogen. In this study, LIF spectroscopy of single Mg-phthalocyanine molecules embedded in the H 2 clusters consisting of 10 5 H 2 molecules was used to investigate the properties of the fast component. The observed peak frequencies of the LIF signals, compared to those observed in helium droplets, were used to infer the possible presence of the liquid phase in the fast component of the H 2 clusters below 5 K. The shift, linewidth, and splitting in the spectra, which strongly depend on the ortho / para ratio, are attributed to the local configurations of hydrogen in the vicinity of the probe molecules.},

Nine experimentally reported ChCl-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were selected for this study where ChCl was common in all the DESs and the hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) were varied. The most energetically favorable cluster was selected using MD simulation followed by density functional theory calculation. The most stable cluster structures were fully optimized, and their quantum chemical properties and IR spectra were computed at the ωB97XD/6-31G++(d,p) level of theory. Principal component analysis was performed to distinguish their behavioral differences and to find out if any correlation exists among the 1:1 and 1:2 clusters. The atom–atom radial distribution functions based on MD simulations revealed that several hydrogen bonds were formed among the donor and acceptor molecules. However, the most prominent hydrogen bonds were found to be N–H HBD ⋯Cl − for ChCl:U, ChCl:TU, and ChCl:Ace and O–H HBD ⋯Cl − for ChCl:Glu, ChCl:Ma, ChCl:Ox, ChCl:Gly, and ChCl:Phe. Both N–H HBD ⋯Cl − and O–H HBD ⋯Cl − were major interactions for ChCl:Pro, where Cl − worked as a bridge between Ch + and the respective donors. In addition, the –OH of Ch + showed strong intermolecular interactions with the acceptor groups of the donor molecules, such as C=O and O–H. This study has tried to extract a pattern of the contributions of HBDs by comparing the structural, spectroscopic, and thermodynamic properties of ChCl-based DESs, which have also been successfully correlated with the intermolecular interactions.},

Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the crown-motif structure of Au9 – PMo12 was decomposed at ∼475 K without weight loss to form Au nanoparticles. After structural decomposition, the ligands were desorbed from the sample. The ligand desorption temperature of Au9 – PMo12 increased under 20\% O 2 conditions because of the formation of Au nanoparticles and stronger interaction of the formed O=PPh 3 than PPh 3 . The Pd and Pt single-atom doping improved the thermal stability of the clusters. This improvement was due to the formation of a large bonding index of M–Au and a change in Au–PPh 3 bonding energy by heteroatom doping. Moreover, we found that the ligand desorption temperatures were also affected by the type of counter anions, whose charge and size influence the localized Coulomb interaction and cluster packing between the cationic ligand-protected metal clusters and counter anions.},

  abstract = {Thiolate-protected Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) have been widely studied in areas of catalysis, biosensors, and bioengineering. In real applications, e.g., catalytic reactions, the thiolate groups are normally partially detached. However, which of the thiolate groups are easily detached and how the detachment of the ligands affects the geometries and electronic structures of the Au nanoclusters have been rarely studied. In this work, we employed the density functional theory calculations as well as the molecular orbital analysis to explore the detachment effect of the ligands using nine thiolate-protected AuNCs as examples. Our results showed that there existed a nearly linear relationship between the averaged detachment energies and the numbers of Au atoms in the motifs. Detaching longer motifs normally required more energies owing to the stronger aurophilic effects. For detaching a full motif, based on the structure decomposition via the grand unified model, analysis on the inner Au core indicated that the change in Au–Au bond length was more sensitive for the inter-block compared to the intra-block. The detachment of the –SH fragment generally needs less energy and brings less structural deformations when compared to the removal of a full motif. Molecular orbital analysis showed that the relative energies of the HOMO orbitals were elevated, which led to the narrow down of the HOMO–LUMO gap. This work provides a primary description of the correlation of the ligands’ detachment with the relative stabilities and structures of the AuNCs, which would be beneficial for establishing the structure–property relationship of AuNCs in real applications.},

Quantum wavepacket propagation calculations within the linear vibronic coupling framework suggest that both [5]- and [7]CPPs rapidly relax to S 2 upon populating “bright” higher singlet excited states. The S 2 –S 1 energy decreases with the increase in CPP size, and hence, [9]CPP exhibits a faster S 2 → S 1 internal conversion decay. Higher triplet states act as receiver states for the intersystem crossing happening either via S 1 or S 2 . The wavepacket evolving on the receiver triplet state would decay to lower states via multiple conical intersections and reach T 1 .

  abstract = {A multi-level layered elongation method was developed for efficiently analyzing the electronic states of local structures in large bio/nano-systems at the full ab initio level of theory. The original elongation method developed during the last three decades in our group has focused on the system in one direction from one terminal to the other terminal to sequentially construct the electronic states of a polymer, called a theoretical synthesis of polymers. In this study, an important region termed the central (C) part is targeted in a large polymer and the remainder are terminal (T) parts. The electronic structures along with polymer elongation are calculated repeatedly from both end T parts to the C central part at the same time. The important C part is treated with large basis sets (high level) and the other regions are treated with small basis sets (low level) in the ab initio theoretical framework. The electronic structures besides the C part can be reused for other systems with different structures at the C part, which renders the method computationally efficient. This multi-level layered elongation method was applied to the investigation on DNA single bulge recognition of small molecules (ligands). The reliability and validity of our approach were examined in comparison with the results obtained by direct calculations using a conventional quantum chemical method for the entire system. Furthermore, stabilization energies by the formation of the complex of bulge DNA and a ligand were estimated with basis set superposition error corrections incorporated into the elongation method.},

Giner et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 149 , 194301 (2018)]. In contrast to the previously used approximation where the basis-set correction density functional was a posteriori added to the energy from a wave-function calculation, here the energy minimization is performed including the basis-set correction. Compared to the non-self-consistent approximation, this allows one to lower the total energy and change the wave function under the effect of the basis-set correction. This work addresses two main questions: (i) What is the change in total energy compared to the non-self-consistent approximation and (ii) can we obtain better properties, namely, dipole moments, with the basis-set corrected wave functions. We implement the present formalism with two different basis-set correction functionals and test it on different molecular systems. The main results of the study are that (i) the total energy lowering obtained by the self-consistent approach is extremely small, which justifies the use of the non-self-consistent approximation, and (ii) the dipole moments obtained from the basis-set corrected wave functions are improved, being already close to their complete basis-set values with triple-zeta basis sets. Thus, the present study further confirms the soundness of the density-based basis-set correction scheme.},

Direct interactions are performed in the core region. For the shell zone, we employ a random batch of interacting particles to reduce the number of interaction pairs. The error estimate of the algorithm is provided. We investigate the Lennard-Jones fluid by molecular dynamics simulations and show that this novel method can significantly accelerate the simulations with a factor of several fold without loss of the accuracy. This method is simple to implement, can be well combined with any linked cell methods to further speed up and scale up the simulation systems, and can be straightforwardly extended to other interactions, such as Ewald short-range part, and thus it is promising for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Protein dynamics play an essential role in function regulation. In recent years, many experimental and theoretical studies have shown that changes in protein fluctuations in the backbone and side chains fulfill a pivotal role associated with amino acid mutations, chemical modifications, and ligand binding. The dynamic correlations between protein side chains have not been sufficiently studied, and no reliable analysis method has been available so far. Therefore, we developed a method to evaluate the dynamic correlation between protein side chains using mutual information and molecular dynamics simulations. To eliminate the structural superposition errors dealing with conventional analysis methods, and to accurately extract the intrinsic fluctuation properties of the side chains, we employed distance principal component analysis (distPCA). The motion of the side chain was then projected onto the eigenvector space obtained by distPCA, and the mutual information between the projected motions was calculated. The proposed method was then applied to a small protein “eglin c” and the mutants. The results show that even a single mutation significantly changed the dynamic correlations and also suggest that the dynamic change is deeply related to the stability. Those results indicate that our developed method could be useful for analyzing the molecular mechanism of allosteric communication in proteins.},

For water, our results show that in the dissociative lowest core-excited state, a linear configuration is preferred. For formic acid, we find that the O K-edge lowest core-excited state is non-planar, a fact that is not captured by the equivalent core approximation where the core-excited atom with its hole is replaced by the “Z + 1” neighboring atom in the periodic table. For benzene, the core-excited state gradients are presented along the Jahn–Teller distorted geometry of the 1s → π * excited state. Our development may pave a new path to studying the dynamics of molecules in their core-excited states.},

  abstract = {Quantum optical theory of absorption properties of interacting atoms is developed. The concept of local absorptance is introduced as a derivative of the logarithm of intensity with respect to the distance in the vicinity of a given spatial point and a moment of time. The intensity is represented by the quantum and statistically averaged normal product of creation and annihilation operators of the electromagnetic field. The development of an analytical method of the estimation for the kinetic and optical parameters for the system is proposed here. The calculation method of the absorption coefficient includes thermal atomic motion, Doppler effect, and the short-range interaction between atoms. The absorption coefficient explicitly takes into account the quantum nature of the optical field. The ability of the system to absorb or emit quanta is quantitatively expressed through the special form of interaction integrals. The specific form of integrals results from the structure of the quantum brackets. The interplay between the collective (virtual photon exchange) and binary (optically induced inter-particle bonding) processes determines the system behavior. The spectral profile of the local absorption coefficient for different atomic densities and time intervals is simulated for realistic parameters.},

We study two numerical models, the spin-boson model and a model of interacting hard-core bosons in a 1D harmonic trap. We find that the influence functional and the intermediates involved in its construction can be efficiently approximated by low bond dimension tensor networks in certain dynamical regimes, which allows the quantum dynamics to be accurately computed for longer times than with direct time evolution methods. However, as one iteratively integrates out the bath, the correlations in the influence functional can first increase before decreasing, indicating that the final compressibility of the influence functional is achieved via non-trivial cancellation.},

One such spectroscopy technique utilizes non-classical correlations among entangled photons to enable measurements with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. Here, we investigate the spectroscopic measurement utilizing entangled three photons. In this measurement, time-resolved entangled photon spectroscopy with monochromatic pumping [A. Ishizaki, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 051102 (2020)] is integrated with the frequency-dispersed two-photon counting technique, which suppresses undesired accidental photon counts in the detector and thus allows one to separate the weak desired signal. This time-resolved frequency-dispersed two-photon counting signal, which is a function of two frequencies, is shown to provide the same information as that of coherent two-dimensional optical spectra. The spectral distribution of the phase-matching function works as a frequency filter to selectively resolve a specific region of the two-dimensional spectra, whereas the excited-state dynamics under investigation are temporally resolved in the time region longer than the entanglement time. The signal is not subject to Fourier limitations on the joint temporal and spectral resolution, and therefore, it is expected to be useful for investigating complex molecular systems in which multiple electronic states are present within a narrow energy range.},

  abstract = {This Perspective reviews recent efforts toward selfconsistent calculations of ground-state energies within the random phase approximation (RPA) in the (generalized) Kohn–Sham (KS) density functional theory context. Since the RPA correlation energy explicitly depends on the non-interacting KS potential, an additional condition to determine the energy as a functional of the density is necessary. This observation leads to the concept of functional selfconsistency (FSC), which requires that the KS density equals the interacting density defined as the functional derivative of the ground-state energy with respect to the external potential. While all existing selfconsistent RPA schemes violate FSC, the recent generalized KS semicanonical projected RPA (GKS-spRPA) method takes a step toward satisfying it. This leads to systematic improvements in densities, binding energy curves, reference state stability, and molecular properties compared to non-selfconsistent RPA as well as optimized effective potential RPA. GKS-spRPA orbital energies accurately approximate valence and core ionization potentials, and even electron affinities of non-valence bound anions. The computational cost and performance of GKS-spRPA are compared to those of related selfconsistent schemes, including GW and orbital optimization methods, and limitations are discussed. Large differences between KS and interacting densities observed in the absence of FSC and the well-rounded performance of GKS-spRPA suggest that the KS potential as a density functional should be defined via the FSC condition for explicitly potential-dependent density functionals.},

  abstract = {The formation of crystals has proven to be one of the most challenging phase transformations to quantitatively model—let alone to actually understand—be it by means of the latest experimental technique or the full arsenal of enhanced sampling approaches at our disposal. One of the most crucial quantities involved with the crystallization process is the nucleation rate, a single elusive number that is supposed to quantify the average probability for a nucleus of critical size to occur within a certain volume and time span. A substantial amount of effort has been devoted to attempt a connection between the crystal nucleation rates computed by means of atomistic simulations and their experimentally measured counterparts. Sadly, this endeavor almost invariably fails to some extent, with the venerable classical nucleation theory typically blamed as the main culprit. Here, we review some of the recent advances in the field, focusing on a number of perhaps more subtle details that are sometimes overlooked when computing nucleation rates. We believe it is important for the community to be aware of the full impact of aspects, such as finite size effects and slow dynamics, that often introduce inconspicuous and yet non-negligible sources of uncertainty into our simulations. In fact, it is key to obtain robust and reproducible trends to be leveraged so as to shed new light on the kinetics of a process, that of crystal nucleation, which is involved into countless practical applications, from the formulation of pharmaceutical drugs to the manufacturing of nano-electronic devices.},

  abstract = {The nonadiabatic mechanism that mediates nonradiative decay of the bright S 2 state to the dark S 1 state of carotenoids involves population of a bridging intermediate state, S x , in several examples. The nature of S x remains to be determined definitively, but it has been recently suggested that S x corresponds to conformationally distorted molecules evolving along out-of-plane coordinates of the isoprenoid backbone near a low barrier between planar and distorted conformations on the S 2 potential surface. In this study, the electronic and vibrational dynamics accompanying the formation of S x in toluene solutions of the ketocarotenoid canthaxanthin (CAN) are characterized with broadband two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) with 7.8 fs excitation pulses and detection of the linear polarization components of the third-order nonlinear optical signal. A stimulated-emission cross peak in the 2DES spectrum accompanies the formation of S x in &lt;20 fs following excitation of the main absorption band. S x is prepared instantaneously, however, with excitation of hot-band transitions associated with distorted conformations of CAN’s isoprenoid backbone in the low frequency onset of the main absorption band. Vibrational coherence oscillation maps and modulated anisotropy transients show that S x undergoes displacements from the Franck–Condon S 2 state along out-of-plane coordinates as it passes to the S 1 state. The results are consistent with the conclusion that CAN’s carbonyl-substituted β-ionone rings impart an intramolecular charge-transfer character that frictionally slows the passage from S x to S 1 compared to carotenoids lacking carbonyl substitution. Despite the longer lifetime, the S 1 state of CAN is formed with retention of vibrational coherence after passing through a conical intersection seam with the S x state.},

  abstract = {Enkephalins are small opioid peptides whose binding conformations are catalyzed by phospholipid membranes. Binding to opioid receptors is determined by the orientation of tyrosine and phenylalanine side chains. In this work, we investigate the effects of different charged phospholipid headgroups on the insertion of the tyrosine side chain into a lipid bilayer using a combination of 2D IR spectroscopy, anharmonic DFT calculations, and third order response function modeling. The insertion is probed by using the ∼1515 cm −1 tyrosine ring breathing mode, which we found exhibits rich vibrational dynamics on the picosecond timescale. These dynamics include rapid intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR), where some of the energy ends up in a dark state that shows up as an anharmonically shifted combination band. The waiting-time dependent 2D IR spectra also show an unusual line shape distortion that affects the extraction of the frequency–frequency correlation function (FFCF), which is the dynamic observable of interest that reflects the tyrosine side chain’s insertion into the lipid bilayer. We proposed three models to account for this distortion: a hot-state exchange model, a local environment dependent IVR model, and a coherence transfer model. A qualitative analysis of these models suggests that the local environment dependent IVR rate best explains the line shape distortion, while the coherence transfer model best reproduced the effects on the FFCF. Even with these complex dynamics, we found that the tyrosine ring mode’s FFCF is qualitatively correlated with the degree of insertion expected from the different phospholipid headgroups.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AK) is composed of CORE domain and two branch domains: LID and AMP-binding domain (AMPbd). AK exhibits considerable allostery in a reversible phosphoryl transfer reaction, which is largely attributed to the relative motion of LID and AMPbd with respect to CORE. Such an allosteric conformational change is also evident in the absence of ligands. Recent studies showed that the mutations in branch domains can adjust dynamic allostery and alter the substrate affinity and enzyme activity. In this work, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulation to study the impacts of mutations in branch domains on AK’s dynamic allostery by comparing two double mutants, i.e., LID mutant (Val135Gly, Val142Gly) and AMPbd mutant (Ala37Gly, Ala55Gly), with wild-type. Two mutants undergo considerable conformational fluctuation and exhibit deviation from the initially extended apo state to more compact structures. The LID domain in the LID mutant adjusts its relative position and firmly adheres to CORE. More strikingly, AMPbd mutations affect the relative positions of both the AMPbd domain and remote LID domain. Both domains undergo considerable movement, especially the inherent hinge swing motion of the flexible LID domain. In both mutants, the mutations can enhance the inter-domain interaction. The results about the conformation change of AK in both mutants are in line with the experiment of AK’s affinity and activity. As revealed by our findings, the flexibility of branch domains and their inherent motions, especially LID domain, is highly relevant to dynamic allostery in the AK system.},

  abstract = {A vibronic exciton model is developed to account for the spectral signatures of HJ-aggregates of oligomers and polymers containing donor–acceptor–donor (DAD) repeat units. In (DAD) N π-stacks, J-aggregate-promoting intra chain interactions compete with H-aggregate-promoting inter chain interactions. The latter includes Coulombic coupling, which arises from “side-by-side” fragment transition dipole moments as well as intermolecular charge transfer (ICT), which is enhanced in geometries with substantial overlap between donors on one chain and acceptors on a neighboring chain. J-behavior is dominant in single (DAD) N chains with enhanced intrachain order as evidenced by an increased red-shift in the low-energy absorption band along with a heightened A 1 /A 2 peak ratio, where A 1 and A 2 are the oscillator strengths of the first two vibronic peaks in the progression sourced by the symmetric quinoidal–aromatic vibration. By contrast, the positive H-promoting interchain Coulomb interactions operative in aggregates cause the vibronic ratio to attenuate, similar to what has been established in H-aggregates of homopolymers such as P3HT. An attenuated A 1 /A 2 ratio can also be caused by H-promoting ICT which occurs when the electron and hole transfer integrals are out-of-phase. In this case, the A 1 peak is red-shifted, in contrast to conventional Kasha H-aggregates. With slight modifications, the ratio formula derived previously for P3HT aggregates is shown to apply to (DAD) N aggregates as well, allowing one to determine the effective free-exciton interchain coupling from the A 1 /A 2 ratio. Applications are made to polymers based on 2T-DPP-2T and 2T-BT-2T repeat units, where the importance of the admixture of the excited acceptor state in the lowest energy band is emphasized.},

In this work, we use computer simulations to study crowding-induced adsorption of semiflexible polymers on otherwise repulsive surfaces. Crowding particles are modeled explicitly, and we investigate the interplay between the bending stiffness of the polymer and the volume fraction and size of crowding particles. Adsorption to flat surfaces is promoted by stiffer polymers, smaller crowding particles, and larger volume fractions of crowders. We characterize transitions from non-adsorbed to partially and strongly adsorbed states as a function of bending stiffness. The crowding-induced transitions occur at smaller values of the bending stiffness as the volume fraction of crowders increases. Concomitant effects on the size and shape of the polymer are reflected by crowding- and stiffness-dependent changes to the radius of gyration. For various polymer lengths, we identify a critical crowding fraction for adsorption and analyze its scaling behavior in terms of polymer stiffness. We also consider crowding-induced adsorption in spherical confinement and identify a regime in which increasing the bending stiffness induces desorption. The results of our simulations shed light on the interplay of crowding and bending stiffness on the spatial organization of biopolymers in encapsulated cellular and cell-free systems.},

Using the coordinates obtained from confocal microscopy experiments, we determined the radial, angular, and nearest-neighbor distribution functions together with the cluster radius of gyration as a function of size ratio and polymer concentration. The analysis of the structural correlations reveals that the network structure becomes increasingly less sensitive to the potential strength with the decreasing polymer–colloid size ratio. For the larger size ratios, compact clusters are formed at the onset of network formation and become progressively more branched and elongated with increasing polymer concentration/attraction strength. For the smallest size ratios, we observe that the aggregate structures forming the gel network are characterized by similar morphological parameters for different values of the size ratio and the polymer concentration, indicating a limited evolution of the gel structure with variations of the parameters that determine the interaction potential between colloids.},

Results of a coarse-grained theoretical model are contrasted with rheological data, where the soft and hard colloids are mimicked by large star polymers with high functionality as the soft component and smaller stars with ultrahigh functionality as the hard one. Previous work by us revealed the recovery of the ergodicity of glassy soft star solutions and subsequent arrested phase separation and re-entrant solid transition upon progressive addition of small hard depletants. Here, we use different components to show that a small variation in softness has a significant impact on the state diagram of such mixtures. In particular, we establish that rendering the soft component more penetrable and modifying the size ratio bring about a remarkable shift in both the phase separation region and the glass-melting line so that the region of restored ergodicity can be notably enhanced and extended to much higher star polymer concentrations than for pure systems. We further rationalize our findings by analyzing the features of the depletion interaction induced by the smaller component that result from the interplay between the size ratio and the softness of the large component. These results demonstrate the great sensitivity of the phase behavior of entropic mixtures to small changes in the molecular architecture of the soft stars and point to the importance of accounting for details of the internal microstructure of soft colloidal particles for tailoring the flow properties of soft composites.},

Dramatically, more energy loss is seen for scattering from the Pt(111) surface compared to p (2 × 2) O on Pt(111), indicating that O adsorption reduces the probability of electron–hole pair (EHP) excitation. We produced a new full-dimensional potential energy surface for H interaction with O/Pt that reproduces density functional theory energies accurately. We then attempted to model the EHP excitation in H/D scattering with molecular dynamics simulations employing the electronic density information from the Pt(111) to calculate electronic friction at the level of the local density friction approximation (LDFA). This approach, which assumes that O atoms simply block the Pt atom from the approaching H atom, fails to reproduce experiment due to the fact that the effective collision cross section of the O atom is only 10\% of the area of the surface unit cell. An empirical adiabatic sphere model that reduces electronic nonadiabaticity within an O–Pt bonding length scale of 2.8 Å reproduces experiment well, suggesting that the electronic structure changes induced by chemisorption of O atoms nearly remove the H atom’s ability to excite EHPs in the Pt. Alternatives to LDFA friction are needed to account for this adsorbate effect.},

The adsorption and wetting behaviors of polymer solutions in the presence of a solid surface are critical to the fabrication process of PNCs. In this study, we use both classical density functional theory (cDFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study dilute and semi-dilute solutions of short polymer chains near a solid surface. Using cDFT, we calculate the equilibrium properties of polymer solutions near a flat surface while varying the solvent quality, surface–fluid interactions, and the polymer chain lengths to investigate their effects on the polymer adsorption and wetting transitions. Using MD simulations, we simulate polymer solutions near solid surfaces with three different curvatures (a flat surface and NPs with two radii) to study the static conformation of the polymer bound layer near the surface and the dynamic chain adsorption process. We find that the bulk polymer concentration at which the wetting transition in the poor solvent system occurs is not affected by the difference in surface–fluid interactions; however, a threshold value of surface–fluid interaction is needed to observe the wetting transition. We also find that with good solvent, increasing the chain length or the difference in the surface–polymer interaction relative to the surface–solvent interaction increases the surface coverage of polymer segments and independent chains for all surface curvatures. Finally, we demonstrate that the polymer segmental adsorption times are heavily influenced only by the surface–fluid interactions, although polymers desorb more quickly from highly curved surfaces.},

In addition, time-resolved anisotropy decays were used to determine the solute’s rotational reorientation time as a function of viscosity. Measurements were made in solutions covering the entire range of mole fraction. Viscosity measurements were used to characterize the bulk solvent properties, and as expected, addition of methanol resulted in an decreased viscosity, showing an exponential decrease with mole fraction, up to ∼50-fold at x MeOH = 1.0. Probe rotational reorientation times were found to be biexponential at x MeOH &lt; 0.3 for C153 and x MeOH &lt; 0.5 for C343 and monoexponential at richer methanol content. In proportion to viscosity, C153 and C343 average rotation times decreased ∼30-fold from x MeOH = 0 to 0.9 and showed a power law dependence of ∼ η 0.85 . Rotation times approached the stick boundary limit on dilution with methanol. Time-resolved Stokes shifts quantified the solvation dynamics and were nearly single exponential for C153 but were clearly biexponential for C343. Solvation times also tracked with viscosity according to a power law dependence, with exponents of 0.3 and 0.4 for C153 and C343, respectively. The dilution effect of methanol was not linear in proportion to the viscosity change and alone cannot account for the change in solvation. Dilution also showed a different correlation to solvation than did temperature variations to govern the viscosity change.},

Observation of a new absorption band and related changes in the fluorescence to phosphorescence intensity ratio, when the concentration of BTBT in the matrix increased above 10 −4 M, indicated the presence of BTBT aggregates. Quantum-chemistry calculations performed for the simplest aggregate, isolated dimer, showed that its structure is similar to the “herringbone” element in the BTBT crystal unit cell and the lowest electronic excited singlet state of the dimer has the intermolecular charge-transfer character. A qualitatively different nature of this state in dimers and in crystals, when compared with the situation in BTBT monomer [locally excited (LE) state], is associated with a decrease in the intersystem crossing yield. The structured vibronic structure of phosphorescence spectra in the studied systems indicated LE character of the triplet states.},

  abstract = {The origin of the exceptional stability of molecular glasses grown by physical vapor deposition (PVD) is not well understood. Differences in glass density have been correlated with thermodynamic stability for thin films of N , N ′-Bis(3-methylphenyl)- N , N ′-diphenylbenzidine (TPD) grown by PVD at specific substrate temperatures below the glass transition temperature. However, the relationship between the internal conformation of glass molecules and the thermodynamic properties of molecular glasses is not well studied. We use carbon 1s near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy to examine different TPD sample preparations in which differences in the thermodynamic stability of the glass are known. Density functional theory simulations of the NEXAFS spectra of TPD allow us to attribute spectroscopic differences to changes in the internal conformation of the TPD molecule and relate this conformation to the stability of the TPD glass. This provides a direct experimental measurement of the internal conformation of molecules forming an organic glass.},

  abstract = {We develop a first-principles-based generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT) for the tagged-particle motion of glassy systems. This theory establishes a hierarchy of coupled integro-differential equations for self-multi-point density correlation functions, which can formally be extended up to infinite order. We use our GMCT framework to calculate the self-nonergodicity parameters and the self-intermediate scattering function for the Percus–Yevick hard-sphere system based on the first few levels of the GMCT hierarchy. We also test the scaling laws in the α - and β -relaxation regimes near the glass-transition singularity. Furthermore, we study the mean-square displacement and the Stokes–Einstein relation in the supercooled regime. We find that qualitatively our GMCT results share many similarities with the well-established predictions from standard mode-coupling theory, but the quantitative results change, and typically improve, by increasing the GMCT closure level. However, we also demonstrate on general theoretical grounds that the current GMCT framework is unable to account for violation of the Stokes–Einstein relation, underlining the need for further improvements in the first-principles description of glassy dynamics.},

  abstract = {The differences on the impact of water on the intermolecular interactions present in the deep eutectic solvents betaine/urea and choline/urea are investigated in this work by measuring the solid–liquid phase diagrams of these mixtures with different amounts of added water. These data are analyzed in terms of ternary systems, rather than the usual pseudo-binary approach, and are used to calculate activity coefficients, which provide precious insight into how water affects the interactions of these systems. It is found that the addition of water greatly enhances the intermolecular interactions of betaine/urea near its eutectic composition, hinting at the formation of a 1:1:1 betaine/urea/water aggregate. On the other hand and contrary to what is commonly believed, water has an asymmetric impact on the interactions present in the choline/urea system. The addition of water to choline-rich mixtures leads to weaker interactions, whereas its addition to urea-rich mixtures leads to stronger interactions. This shows that the decrease in the melting temperature of choline/urea mixtures due to the presence of water does not necessarily mean that intermolecular interactions are strengthened. Finally, a minimum in the activity coefficient of urea in the choline/urea system with 2 wt.\% of water was found, which coincides with several anomalies in the properties of this system previously reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {A measurement of the magnitude of the electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM) larger than that predicted by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is expected to have a huge impact on the search for physics beyond the SM. Polar diatomic molecules containing heavy elements experience enhanced sensitivity to parity ( P ) and time-reversal ( T )-violating phenomena, such as the eEDM and the scalar–pseudoscalar (S–PS) interaction between the nucleons and the electrons, and are thus promising candidates for measurements. The NL- e EDM collaboration is preparing an experiment to measure the eEDM and S–PS interaction in a slow beam of cold BaF molecules [P. Aggarwal et al. , Eur. Phys. J. D 72 , 197 (2018)]. Accurate knowledge of the electronic structure parameters, W d and W s , connecting the eEDM and the S–PS interaction to the measurable energy shifts is crucial for the interpretation of these measurements. In this work, we use the finite field relativistic coupled cluster approach to calculate the W d and W s parameters in the ground state of the BaF molecule. Special attention was paid to providing a reliable theoretical uncertainty estimate based on investigations of the basis set, electron correlation, relativistic effects, and geometry. Our recommended values of the two parameters, including conservative uncertainty estimates, are 3.13 ± 0.12 × 1 0 24 Hz e cm for W d and 8.29 ± 0.12 kHz for W s .},

The previously known 5b 1 3s-Rydberg state has been reinterpreted by comparison with our recent high-resolution photoelectron spectral analysis of the X 2 B 1 ionic state. Additional vibrational details in the region of this Rydberg state are observed in its VUV spectrum when compared with the photoelectron 2 B 1 ionic state; this is attributed to the underlying valence state structure in the VUV. Valence and Rydberg state energies have been obtained by configuration interaction and time-dependent density functional theoretical methods. Several low-lying singlet valence states, especially those that arise from ππ* excitations, conventionally termed NV 1 to NV 4 , have been examined in detail. Their Franck–Condon (FC) and Herzberg–Teller (HT) profiles have been investigated and fitted to the VUV spectrum. Estimates of the experimental 0 0 band positions have been made from these fits. The anomaly of the observed UV absorption by the 1 A 2 state of NBD is attributed to HT effects. Generally, the HT components are less than 10\% of the FC terms. The calculated 5b 1 3s lowest Rydberg state also shows a low level of HT components. The observed electron impact spectra of NBD have been analyzed in detail in terms of triplet states.},

Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a highly stable ligand-protected gold hydride nanocluster, [Au 22 H 3 (dppee) 7 ] 3+ [dppee = bis(2-diphenylphosphino) ethyl ether]. A synthetic method is developed to obtain high purity samples of the gold trihydride nanocluster with good yields. The properties of the new hydride cluster are characterized with different experimental techniques, as well as theoretical calculations. Solid samples of [Au 22 H 3 (dppee) 7 ] 3+ are found to be stable under ambient conditions. Both experimental evidence and theoretical evidence suggest that the Au 22 H 3 core of the [Au 22 H 3 (dppee) 7 ] 3+ hydride nanocluster consists of two Au 11 units bonded via two triangular faces, creating six uncoordinated Au sites at the interface. The three H atoms bridge the six uncoordinated Au atoms at the interface. The Au 11 unit behaves as an eight-electron trivalent superatom, forming a superatom triple bond (Au 11 ≡ Au 11 ) in the [Au 22 H 3 (dppee) 7 ] 3+ trihydride nanocluster assisted by the three bridging H atoms.},

For the OH + acetaldehyde reaction, a slight catalytic effect of H 2 O was previously reported at temperatures between 60 and 118 K. In this work, we used Laval nozzle expansions to reinvestigate the impact of H 2 O on the OH-reactivity with acetaldehyde between 21.7 and 135.0 K. The results of this comprehensive study demonstrate that water, instead, slows down the reaction by factors of ∼3 (21.7 K) and ∼2 (36.2–89.5 K), and almost no effect of added H 2 O was observed at 135.0 K.},

The observed patterns of transitions are consistent with the most stable geometries of the TMO–w, TMO–(w) 2 , and TMS–w complexes at the B2PLYP-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVTZ level and were confirmed using spectra of the 18 O isotopologue. Due to its effectively planar backbone, TMO offers one unique binding site for solvation, while water can bind to the puckered TMS ring in either an axial or equatorial site of the heteroatom. In all clusters, the first water molecule binds in the σ v symmetry plane of the ring monomer and serves as a hydrogen bond donor to the heteroatom. The second water molecule is predicted to form a cooperative hydrogen bonding network between the three moieties. Secondary C–H⋯O interactions are a key stabilizing influence in trimers and also drive the preferred binding site in the TMS clusters with the axial binding site preferred in TMS–w and the equatorial form calculated to be more stable in the dihydrate. Using an energy partition scheme from the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory for the O, S, and Se containing mono- and dihydrates, the intermolecular interactions are revealed to be mainly electrostatic, but the dispersive character of the contacts is enhanced with the increasing size of the ring’s heteroatom due to the key role of longer-range secondary interactions.},

Photoinduced relaxation has been explored by time-resolved spectroscopy and simulations, mainly by semiclassical approaches or referring to open quantum systems methods, within the Redfield approximation. Here, we take the benefit of an ab initio investigation of a phenylacetylene trimer, and in the spirit of a divide-and-conquer approach, we focus on the early dynamics of the hierarchy of interactions. We build a simplified but realistic model by retaining only bright electronic states and selecting the vibrational domain expected to play the dominant role for timescales shorter than 500 fs. We specifically analyze the role of the in-plane high-frequency skeletal vibrational modes involving the triple bonds. Open quantum system non-adiabatic dynamics involving conical intersections is conducted by separating the electronic subsystem from the high-frequency tuning and coupling vibrational baths. This partition is implemented within a robust non-perturbative and non-Markovian method, here the hierarchical equations of motion. We will more precisely analyze the coherent preparation of donor states or of their superposition by short laser pulses with different polarizations. In particular, we extend the π -pulse strategy for the creation of a superposition to a V-type system. We study the relaxation induced by the high-frequency vibrational collective modes and the transitory dissymmetry, which results from the creation of a superposition of electronic donor states.},

Here, we employ density functional theory to investigate the interfaces of a model carboxylate group, CH 3 COO, on the coinage metal surfaces and clusters. We found that μ 2 -CH 3 COO is the most preferred binding mode on the three M(111) surfaces (M = Cu, Ag, and Au), while μ 3 -CH 3 COO is also stable on Cu(111) and Ag(111). The saturation coverage was found to be about seven CH 3 COO groups per nm 2 for all surfaces. CH 3 COO has the strongest binding on Cu and weakest on Au. Moving from the flat surfaces to the icosahedral M 13 clusters, we found that the eight-electron superatomic [M 13 (CH 3 COO) 6 ] − nanoclusters also prefer the μ 2 -CH 3 COO mode on the surface. The icosahedral kernel in [Cu 13 (CH 3 COO) 6 ] − and [Ag 13 (CH 3 COO) 6 ] − was well maintained after geometry optimization, but a larger deformation was found in [Au 13 (CH 3 COO) 6 ] − .

  abstract = {Benefitting from the capability of recording scalar ( J ) couplings and bonding information, 2D J -resolved NMR spectroscopy constitutes an important tool for molecular structure analysis and mixture component identification. Unfortunately, conventional 2D J -resolved experiments generally encounter challenges of insufficient spectral resolution and strong coupling artifacts. In this study, a general NMR approach is exploited to record absorption-mode artifact-free 2D J -resolved spectra. This proposal adopts the advanced triple-spin-echo pure shift yielded by chirp excitation element to eliminate J coupling splittings and preserve chemical shifts along the F2 dimension, and it additionally utilizes the echo-train J acquisition to reveal the multiplet structure along the F1 dimension in accelerated experimental acquisition. Thus, it permits one to extract multiplet structure information from crowded spectral regions in one-shot experiments, with considerable resolution advantage resulting from completely decoupling F2 dimension and absorption-mode presentation, thus facilitating analysis on complex samples. More importantly, this method grants the superior performance on suppressing strong coupling artifacts, which have been affirmed by experiments on a series of chemical samples. As a consequence, this proposed method serves as a useful tool for J coupling measurements and multiplet structure analyses on complex samples that contain crowded NMR resonances and strong coupling spin systems, and it may exhibit broad application potentials in fields of physics, chemistry, and medical science, among others.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional Fourier transform spectroscopy is a promising technique to study ultrafast molecular dynamics. Similar to transient absorption spectroscopy, a more complete picture of the dynamics requires broadband laser pulses to observe transient changes over a large enough bandwidth, exceeding the inhomogeneous width of electronic transitions, as well as the separation between the electronic or vibronic transitions of interest. Here, we present visible broadband 2D spectra of a series of dye molecules and report vibrational coherences with frequencies up to ∼1400 cm −1 that were obtained after improvements to our existing two-dimensional Fourier transform setup [Al Haddad et al. , Opt. Lett. 40 , 312–315 (2015)]. The experiment uses white light from a hollow core fiber, allowing us to acquire 2D spectra with a bandwidth of 200 nm, in a range between 500 and 800 nm, and with a temporal resolution of 10–15 fs. 2D spectra of nile blue, rhodamine 800, terylene diimide, and pinacyanol iodide show vibronic spectral features with at least one vibrational mode and reveal information about structural motion via coherent oscillations of the 2D signals during the population time. For the case of pinacyanol iodide, these observations are complemented by its Raman spectrum, as well as the calculated Raman activity at the ground- and excited-state geometry.},

  abstract = {In this article, several optimization methods of two-electron repulsion integral calculations on a graphic processing unit (GPU) are presented. These methods are based on the investigations of the method presented by McMurchie and Davidson (MD). A new Boys function evaluation method for the GPU calculation is introduced. The series summation, the error function, and the finite sum formula method are combined; thus, good performance on the GPU can be achieved. By taking some theoretical study of the McMurchie–Davidson recurrence relations, three major optimization approaches are derived from the deduction of the general term formula for the Hermite expansion coefficient. The three approaches contain a new form of the Hermite expansion coefficients with corresponding recurrence relations, which is more efficient for one-electron integrals and [ ss |∗∗] or [∗∗| ss ] type two-electron integrals. In addition, a simple yet efficient new recurrence formula for the coefficient evaluation is derived, which is more efficient both in float operations and memory operations than its original one. In average, the new recurrence relation can save 26\% float operations and 37\% memory operations. Finally, a common sub-expression elimination (CSE) method is implemented. This CSE method is directly generated from some equalities we discovered from the general term formula other than by computer algebra system software. This optimized method achieved up to 3.09 speedups compared to the original MD method on the GPU and up to 92.75 speedups compared to the GAMESS calculation on the central processing unit.},

In the lattice matching step, a scan over combinations of substrate and film Miller indices is performed to identify the domain-matched interfaces with the lowest mismatch. Subsequently, surface matching is conducted by Bayesian optimization to find the optimal interfacial distance and in-plane registry between the substrate and the film. For the objective function, a geometric score function is proposed based on the overlap and empty space between atomic spheres at the interface. The score function reproduces the results of density functional theory (DFT) at a fraction of the computational cost. The optimized interfaces are pre-ranked using a score function based on the similarity of the atomic environment at the interface to the bulk environment. Final ranking of the top candidate structures is performed with DFT. Ogre streamlines DFT calculations of interface energies and electronic properties by automating the construction of interface models. The application of Ogre is demonstrated for two interfaces of interest for quantum computing and spintronics, Al/InAs and Fe/InSb.},

The MI-FNO framework provides a systematic reduction of the occupied and virtual orbital spaces for quantum chemistry simulations. The correlation energies of the resulting increments from the MI-FNO reduction can then be solved by various algorithms, including quantum algorithms such as the phase estimation algorithm and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles VQE framework is used to obtain correlation energies for the case of small molecules (i.e., BeH 2 , CH 4 , NH 3 , H 2 O, and HF) using the cc-pVDZ basis set. The quantum resource requirements are estimated for a constrained geometry complex catalyst that is utilized in industrial settings for the polymerization of α -olefins. We show that the MI-FNO approach provides a significant reduction in the quantum bit (qubit) requirements relative to the full system simulations.

We propose a correction scheme based on many-body perturbation theory to calculate the shift from first-principles. The ionization potential of the core donor state is first computed and then substituted for the corresponding Kohn–Sham orbital energy, thus emulating Koopmans’s condition. Both self-interaction error and orbital relaxation are taken into account. The method exploits the localized nature of core states for efficiency and integrates seamlessly in our previous implementation of core level LR-TDDFT, yielding corrected spectra in a single calculation. We benchmark the correction scheme on molecules at the K- and L-edges as well as for core binding energies and report accuracies comparable to higher order methods. We also demonstrate applicability in large and extended systems and discuss efficient approximations.},

As a demonstration, the isothermal–isobaric SLHMC method was used to study the vibrational structure of liquid silica at temperatures close to the melting point, whereby the slow diffusive motion is beyond the time scale of first-principles molecular dynamics. It was found that the static structure factor thus computed from first-principles agrees quite well with the high-energy x-ray data.},

We apply this method to the astrophysically important case of CO 2 –He collisions, using newly computed ab initio three-dimensional potential energy surfaces for CO 2 –He with CO 2 distorted along the symmetric and asymmetric stretch ( ν 1 and ν 3 ) coordinates. It is shown that the MC-DWBA method is almost as accurate as full CC calculations, but more efficient.

  abstract = {Kramers’ procedure for calculating the rate of activated processes involves partitioning space into reactant, barrier, and product regions by introducing two dividing surfaces. Then, a nonequilibrium steady state is established by injecting particles on one surface and removing them when they reach the other. The rate is obtained as the ratio of the steady-state flux between the surfaces and the population of the initial well. An alternative procedure that seems less artificial is to estimate the first non-zero eigenvalue of the operator that describes the dynamics and then equate its magnitude to the sum of the forward and backward rate constants. Here, we establish the relationship between these approaches for diffusive dynamics, starting with the variational principle for the eigenvalue of interest and then using a trial function involving two adjustable surfaces. We show how Kramers’ flux-over-population expression for the rate constant can be obtained from our variationally determined eigenvalue in the special case where the reactant and product regions are separated by a high barrier. This work exploits the modern theory of activated rate processes where the committor (the probability of reaching one dividing surface before the other) plays a central role. Surprisingly, our upper bound for the eigenvalue can be expressed solely in terms of mean first-passage times and the mean transition-path time between the two dividing surfaces.},

An additional advantage of representing the probability mass function in the tensor-train format is that parametric dependency can be easily incorporated by introducing a tensor product basis expansion in the parameter space. Time is treated as an additional dimension of the tensor and a linear system is derived to solve the chemical master equation in time. We exemplify the tensor-train method by performing inference tasks such as smoothing and parameter inference using the tensor-train framework.

  abstract = {The function of an enzyme depends on its dynamic structure, and the catalytic mechanism has long been an active focus of research. The principle for interpreting protein selectivity and fidelity stems from optimization of the active site upon protein–substrate complexation, i.e., a lock-and-key configuration, on which most protein–substrate molecule binding recognition, and hence drug discovery, relies. Yet another thought has been to incorporate the protein folding interior tunnels for stereo- and regio-selectivity along the protein–substrate or protein–ligand/inhibitor binding process. Free energy calculations provide valuable information for molecular recognition and protein–ligand binding dynamics and kinetics. In this study, we focused on the kinetics of cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP450s) and the protein interior tunnel structure–dynamics relationship in terms of the substrate binding and leaving mechanism. A case in point is given by the prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2 ) homologous isomerase of prostacyclin synthase. To calculate the reactant and product traversing the tunnels to and from the heme site, the free energy paths and tunnel potentials of mean force are constructed from steered molecular dynamics simulations and adaptive basing force umbrella sampling simulations. We explore the binding tunnels and critical residue lining characteristics for the ligand traverse and the underlying mechanism of CYP450 activity. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into the decisive role of the substrate tunnel binding process of the CYP450 mechanism and may be useful in drug design and protein engineering contexts.},

  abstract = {Understanding the fundamental forces such as hydrophobic interactions in a crowded intracellular environment is necessary to comprehensively decipher the mechanisms of protein folding and biomolecular self-assemblies. The widely accepted entropic depletion view of crowding effects primarily attributes biomolecular compaction to the solvent excluded volume effects exerted by the “inert” crowders, neglecting their soft interactions with the biomolecule. In this study, we examine the effects of chemical nature and soft attractive energy of crowders on the water-mediated hydrophobic interaction between two non-polar neopentane solutes using molecular dynamics simulations. The crowded environment is modeled using dipeptides composed of polar and non-polar amino acids of varying sizes. The results show that amongst the non-polar crowders, Leu 2 strengthens the hydrophobic interactions significantly, whereas the polar and small-sized non-polar crowders do not show significant strengthening. Distinct underlying thermodynamic driving forces are illustrated where the small-sized crowders drive hydrophobic interaction via a classic entropic depletion effect and the bulky crowders strengthen it by preferential interaction with the solute. A crossover from energy-stabilized solvent-separated pair to entropy-stabilized contact pair state is observed in the case of bulky non-polar (Leu 2 ) and polar (Lys 2 ) crowders. The influence of solute–crowder energy in affecting the dehydration energy penalty is found to be crucial for determining the neopentane association. The findings demonstrate that along with the entropic (size) effects, the energetic effects also play a crucial role in determining hydrophobic association. The results can be extended and have implications in understanding the impact of protein crowding with varying chemistry in modulating the protein free energy landscapes.},

  abstract = {Depletion interactions between colloidal particles surrounded by smaller depletants are typically characterized by a strong attraction at contact and a moderately repulsive barrier in front of it that extends at distances similar to the size of the depletants; the appearance and height of the barrier basically depend on the concentration and, therefore, the correlation between depletants. From a thermodynamic point of view, the former can drive the system to phase separation or toward non-equilibrium states, such as gel-like states, but its effects on both local and global properties may be controlled by the latter, which acts as a kind of entropic gate. However, the latter has not been entirely analyzed and understood within the context of colloidal mixtures mainly driven by entropy. In this contribution, we present a systematic study of depletion forces in ternary mixtures of hard spherical particles with two species of depletants, in two and three dimensions. We focus the discussion on how the composition of the depletants becomes the main physical parameter that drives the competition between the attractive well and the repulsive barrier. Our results are obtained by means of the integral equation theory of depletion forces and techniques of contraction of the description adapted to molecular dynamics computer simulations.},

Additionally, the d -band model cannot explain the disappearance of the local minima for H adsorption at the hollow site on the potential energy surface of 5 d single-atom element doped Au and Ag(111) surfaces. Here, we use a simple model with factors, including the d -band center, filling of the d -band, renormalized adsorbate states, coupling matrix elements, and surface–adsorbate bond lengths, to correlate with the density functional theory calculated H binding energies on both mono- and bimetallic (111) surfaces. Our results suggest that H adsorption at metal-atop sites is determined by all these factors, not only by the d -band center. The strong adsorption of H at the atop sites of 5 d metal surfaces can be explained by their lower repulsive contribution.},

  abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) constitute a class of three-dimensional porous materials that have shown applicability for carbon dioxide capture at low pressures, which is particularly advantageous in dealing with the well-known environmental problem related to the carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. In this work, the effect of changing the metallic center in the inorganic counterpart of MIL-53 (X), where X = Fe 3+ , Al 3+ , and Cu 2+ , has been assessed over the ability of the porous material to adsorb carbon dioxide by means of first-principles theory. In general, the non-spin polarized computational method has led to adsorption energies in fair agreement with the experimental outcomes, where the carbon dioxide stabilizes at the pore center through long-range interactions via oxygen atoms with the axial hydroxyl groups in the inorganic counterpart. However, spin-polarization effects in connection with the Hubbard corrections, on Fe 3 d and Cu 3 d states, were needed to properly describe the metal orbital occupancy in the open-shell systems (Fe- and Cu-based MOFs). This methodology gave rise to a coherent high-spin configuration, with five unpaired electrons, for Fe atoms leading to a better agreement with the experimental results. Within the GGA+U level of theory, the binding energy for the Cu-based MOF is found to be E b = −35.85 kJ/mol, which is within the desirable values for gas capture applications. Moreover, it has been verified that the adsorption energetics is dominated by the gas–framework and internal weak interactions.},

Building upon this work, a new combination scheme is proposed to incorporate solvation effects for the computation of infrared (IR) absorption spectra. Herein, Boltzmann populations calculated for implicitly solvated single conformers are used to weight the IR spectra of explicitly solvated clusters with a size of typically ten solvent molecules, i.e., accounting for the first solvation shell. It is found that in water and methanol, the most abundant conformers of ML are structurally modified relative to the gas phase, where the major form is ML1, in which the syn conformation of the –OH moiety is stabilized by a OH⋯O=C intramolecular hydrogen bond (HB). In solution, this syn conformation transforms to the gauche form because the intramolecular HB is disrupted by explicit water molecules that form intermolecular HBs with the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. Similar changes induced by the gas-solution transition are observed for the minor conformers, ML2 and/or ML3, characterized by OH⋯OCH 3 intramolecular HB in the gas phase. The relative abundance of ML1 is shown to decrease from ∼96\% in gas to ∼51\% in water and ∼92\% in methanol. The solvent strongly influences frequencies, IR intensities, and normal modes, resulting in qualitatively different spectra compared to the gas phase. Some liquid-state conformational markers in the fingerprint region of IR spectra are revealed.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have become a prevalent and promising medium in various industrial applications. The addition of water to DESs has attracted a lot of attention as a scheme to modulate their functionalities and improve their physicochemical properties. In this work, we study the effects of water on an acetamide based DES by probing its microscopic structure and dynamics using classical molecular dynamics simulation. It is observed that, at low water content, acetamide still remains the dominant solvate in the first solvation shell of lithium ions, however, beyond 10 wt.\%, it is replaced by water. The increase in the water content in the solvent accelerates the H-bond dynamics by drastically decreasing the lifetimes of acetamide–lithium H-bond complexes. Additionally, water–lithium H-bond complexes are also found to form, with systematically longer lifetimes in comparison to acetamide–lithium complexes. Consequently, the diffusivity and ionic conductivity of all the species in the DES are found to increase substantially. Non-Gaussianity parameters for translational motions of acetamide and water in the DES show a conspicuous decrease with addition of water in the system. The signature of jump-like reorientation of acetamide is observed in the DES by quantifying the deviation from rotational Brownian motion. However, a notable decrease in the deviation is observed with an increase in the water content in the DES. This study demonstrates the intricate connection between H-bond dynamics and various microscopic dynamical parameters in the DES, by investigating the modulation of the former with addition of water.},

Chem. Chem. Phys. 23 , 7200 (2021)]. Here, we analyze nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and stimulated echo decays of deuterated m -TPTS-d 4 ( 2 H) and TPP ( 31 P) and attempt to understand the dielectric spectra in terms of component specific dynamics. The high- T g component (α 1 ) shows relaxation similar to that of neat systems, yet with some broadening upon mixing. This correlates with high-frequency broadening of the dielectric spectra. The low- T g component (α 2 ) exhibits highly stretched relaxations and strong dynamic heterogeneities indicated by “two-phase” spectra, reflecting varying fractions of fast and slow liquid-like reorienting molecules. Missing for the high- T g component, such two-phase spectra are identified down to w TPP = 0.04, indicating that isotropic reorientation prevails in the rigid high- T g matrix stretching from close to T g T P P to T g 1 w T P P ⁠ . This correlates with low-frequency broadening of the dielectric spectra. Two T g values are defined: T g 1 ( w T P P ) displays a plasticizer effect, whereas T g 2 ( w T P P ) passes through a maximum, signaling extreme separation of the component dynamics at low w TPP . We suggest understanding the latter counter-intuitive feature by referring to a crossover from “single glass” to “double glass” scenario revealed by recent MD simulations. Analyses reveal that a second population of TPP molecules exists, which is associated with the dynamics of the high-T g component. However, the fractions are lower than suggested by the dielectric spectra. We discuss this discrepancy considering the role of collective dynamics probed by dielectric but not by NMR spectroscopy.},

The unique ability of 2PT to accurately and efficiently approximate the entropy and Gibbs energy of liquids allows for assignment of phase boundaries from relatively short (∼100 ps) MD simulations. We validate our approach by calculating the critical properties of the flexible elementary physical model 2, showing good agreement with previous results. We show, however, that the incorrect description of the short-range Pauli force and the lack of molecular charge polarization lead to deviations from experiments at high pressures. We, thus, develop a many-body, fluctuating charge model for CO 2 , termed CO 2 –Fq, from high level quantum mechanics (QM) calculations that accurately capture the condensed phase vibrational properties of the solid (including the Fermi resonance at 1378 cm −1 ) as well as the diffusional properties of the liquid, leading to overall excellent agreement with experiments over the entire phase diagram. This work provides an efficient computational approach for determining phase diagrams of arbitrary systems and underscores the critical role of QM charge reorganization physics in molecular phase stability.},

  abstract = {Temperature-dependent dynamic structure factors S ( Q , ω ) for liquid water have been calculated using a composite model, which is based on the decoupling approximation of the mean square displacement of the water molecules into diffusion and solid-like vibrational parts. The solid-like vibrational part S vib ( Q , ω ) is calculated with the phonon expansion method established in the framework of the incoherent Gaussian approximation. The diffusion part S diff ( Q , ω ) relies on the Egelstaff–Schofield translational diffusion model corrected for jump diffusions and rotational diffusions with the Singwi–Sjölander random model and Sears expansion, respectively. Systematics of the model parameters as a function of temperature were deduced from quasi-elastic neutron scattering data analysis reported in the literature and from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations relying on the TIP4P/2005f model. The resulting S ( Q , ω ) values are confronted by means of Monte Carlo simulations to inelastic neutron scattering data measured with IN4, IN5, and IN6 time-of-flight spectrometers of the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) (Grenoble, France). A modest range of temperatures (283–494 K) has been investigated with neutron wavelengths corresponding to incident neutron energies ranging from 0.57 to 67.6 meV. The neutron-weighted multiphonon spectra deduced from the ILL data indicate a slight overestimation by the MD simulations of the frequency shift and broadening of the librational band. The descriptive power of the composite model was suited for improving the comparison to experiments via Bayesian updating of prior model parameters inferred from MD simulations. The reported posterior temperature-dependent densities of state of hydrogen in H 2 O would represent valuable insights for studying the collective coupling interactions in the water molecule between the inter- and intramolecular degrees of freedom.},

Significant theoretical and computational efforts have thus been dedicated to untangling their properties. By contrast, disordered microphases, which are structurally just as rich but nowhere near as elegant, have not been as carefully considered. Part of the difficulty is that simple mean-field descriptions make a homogeneity assumption that washes away all of their structural features. Here, we study disordered microphases by exactly solving a SALR model on the Bethe lattice. By sidestepping the homogenization assumption, this treatment recapitulates many of the key structural regimes of disordered microphases, including particle and void cluster fluids as well as gelation. This analysis also provides physical insight into the relationship between various structural and thermal observables, between criticality and physical percolation, and between glassiness and microphase ordering.},

The atomic precision of their structure, characterized through single crystal x-ray diffraction, enables the accurate investigation of their physicochemical properties through electronic structure calculations. Recent experimental efforts have led to the successful heterometal doping of TPNCs, potentially unlocking a large domain of bimetallic TPNCs for targeted applications. However, how TPNC size, bimetallic composition, and location of dopants influence electronic structure is unknown. To this end, we introduce novel structure–property relationships (SPRs) that predict electronic properties such as ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of AgAu TPNCs based on physically relevant descriptors. The models are constructed by first generating a hypothetical AgAu TPNC dataset of 368 structures with sizes varying from 36 to 279 metal atoms. Using our dataset calculated with density functional theory (DFT), we employed systematic analyses to unravel size, composition, and, importantly, core–shell effects on TPNC EA and IP behavior. We develop generalized SPRs that are able to predict electronic properties across the AgAu TPNC materials space. The models leverage the same three fundamental descriptors (i.e., size, composition, and core–shell makeup) that do not require DFT calculations and rely only on simple atom counting, opening avenues for high throughput bimetallic TPNC screening for targeted applications. This work is a first step toward finely controlling TPNC electronic properties through heterometal doping using high throughput computational means.},

An essentially constant A ̃ 2 − A ̃ 1 energy separation for different vibronic levels is observed in the LIF spectrum, which is attributed to both the spin–orbit (SO) interaction and non-relativistic effects. Electronic transition energies, vibrational frequencies, and spin–vibrational eigenfunctions calculated using the coupled-cluster method, along with results from previous complete active space self-consistent field calculations, have been used to predict the vibronic energy level structure and simulate the recorded LIF/DF spectra. Although the vibrational frequencies and Franck–Condon (FC) factors calculated under the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and the harmonic oscillator approximation reproduce the dominant spectral features well, the inclusion of the pseudo-Jahn–Teller (pJT) and SO interactions, especially those between the A 1 ̃ 2 A ″ / A 2 ̃ 2 A ′ and the B ̃ 2 A ′ states, induces additional vibronic transitions and significantly improves the accuracy of the spectral simulations. Notably, the spin–vibronic interactions couple vibronic levels and alter transition intensities. The calculated FC matrix for the A 1 ̃ 2 A ′ ′ / A 2 ̃ 2 A ′ − X ̃ 2 A ′ transition contains a number of off-diagonal matrix elements that connect the vibrational ground levels to the levels of the ν 8 (CO stretch), ν 11 (OCC bending), ν 12 (CaO stretch), ν 13 (in-plane CaOC bending), and ν 21 (out-of-plane CaOC bending) modes, which are used for vibrational assignments. Transitions to the ν 21 ( a ″) levels are allowed due to the pJT effect. Furthermore, when LIF transitions to the A ̃ -state levels of the CaOC-bending modes, ν 13 and ν 21 , are pumped, A 1 ̃ 2 A ′ ′ / A 2 ̃ 2 A ′ → X ̃ 2 A ′ transitions to the combination levels of these two modes with the ν 8 , ν 11 , and ν 12 modes are also observed in the DF spectra due to the Duschinsky mixing. Implications of the present spectroscopic investigation to laser cooling of asymmetric-top molecules are discussed.},

This finding is incompatible with rate heterogeneity as a cause of the nonexponential relaxation and appears to be in conflict with an earlier multidimensional analysis of the same data.

  abstract = {Often, a single correlation function is used to measure the kinetics of a complex system. In contrast, a large set of k -vector modes and their correlation functions are commonly defined for motion in free space. This set can be transformed to the van Hove correlation function, which is the Green’s function for molecular diffusion. Here, these ideas are generalized to other observables. A set of correlation functions of nonlinear functions of an observable is used to extract the corresponding Green’s function. Although this paper focuses on nonlinear correlation functions of an equilibrium time series, the results are directly connected to other types of nonlinear kinetics, including perturbation–response experiments with strong fields. Generalized modes are defined as the orthogonal polynomials associated with the equilibrium distribution. A matrix of mode-correlation functions can be transformed to the complete, single-time-interval (1D) Green’s function. Diagonalizing this matrix finds the eigendecays. To understand the advantages and limitation of this approach, Green’s functions are calculated for a number of models of complex dynamics within a Gaussian probability distribution. Examples of non-diffusive motion, rate heterogeneity, and range heterogeneity are examined. General arguments are made that a full set of nonlinear 1D measurements is necessary to extract all the information available in a time series. However, when a process is neither dynamically Gaussian nor Markovian, they are not sufficient. In those cases, additional multidimensional measurements are needed.},

  abstract = {Converting neutron scattering data to real-space time-dependent structures can only be achieved through suitable models, which is particularly challenging for geometrically disordered structures. We address this problem by introducing time-dependent clipped Gaussian field models. General expressions are derived for all space- and time-correlation functions relevant to coherent inelastic neutron scattering for multiphase systems and arbitrary scattering contrasts. Various dynamic models are introduced that enable one to add time-dependence to any given spatial statistics, as captured, e.g., by small-angle scattering. In a first approach, the Gaussian field is decomposed into localized waves that are allowed to fluctuate in time or to move either ballistically or diffusively. In a second approach, a dispersion relation is used to make the spectral components of the field time-dependent. The various models lead to qualitatively different dynamics, which can be discriminated by neutron scattering. The methods of this paper are illustrated with oil/water microemulsion studied by small-angle scattering and neutron spin-echo. All available data—in both film and bulk contrasts, over the entire range of q and τ —are analyzed jointly with a single model. The analysis points to the static large-scale structure of the oil and water domains while the interfaces are subject to thermal fluctuations. The fluctuations have an amplitude of around 60 Å and contribute to 30\% of the total interface area.},

A computational method that can accurately predict their electronic structures is indispensable for exploring new nitride materials. However, the relatively small bandgap of nitrides, which stems from the subtle balance between ionic and covalent bond characteristics, makes conventional density functional theory challenging to achieve satisfactory accuracy. Here, we employed a self-consistent hybrid functional where the Hartree–Fock mixing parameter is self-consistently determined and thus the empiricism of the hybrid functional is effectively removed to calculate the bandgaps of various nitride compounds. By comparing the bandgaps from the self-consistent hybrid functional calculations with the available experimental and high-level GW calculation results, we found that the self-consistent hybrid functional can provide a computationally efficient approach for quantitative predictions of nitride electronic structures with an accuracy level comparable to the GW method. Additionally, we aligned the band edge positions of various nitride compounds using self-consistent hybrid functional calculations, providing material design principles for heterostructures of nitride-based optoelectronic devices. We anticipate the wide use of the self-consistent hybrid functional for accelerating explorations and predictions of new nitride-based functional materials in various photoactive applications.},

One-particle Green’s functions directly provide electronic energies and one-particle properties, such as dipole moment. However, the evaluation of two-particle properties, such as ⟨ S 2 ⟩ and ⟨ N 2 ⟩, can be challenging because they require a solution of the computationally expensive Bethe–Salpeter equation to find two-particle Green’s functions. We demonstrate that the solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation can be completely avoided. Applying the thermodynamic Hellmann–Feynman theorem to self-consistent one-particle Green’s function methods, we derive expressions for two-particle density matrices in a general case and provide explicit expressions for GF2 and GW methods. Such density matrices can be decomposed into an antisymmetrized product of correlated one-electron density matrices and the two-particle electronic cumulant of the density matrix. Cumulant expressions reveal a deviation from ensemble representability for GW, explaining its known deficiencies. We analyze the temperature dependence of ⟨ S 2 ⟩ and ⟨ N 2 ⟩ for a set of small closed-shell systems. Interestingly, both GF2 and GW show a non-zero spin contamination and a non-zero fluctuation of the number of particles for closed-shell systems at the zero-temperature limit.},

We report an implementation at the coupled cluster with single and double excitations level (CCSD), for which we present the first simulations of the origin-invariant Buckingham/Dunn tensor in the LG. We compare LG(OI) and MVG results on a series of 22 organic molecules, showing good linear correlation between the approaches, although for small tensor elements, they provide values of opposite sign. We also attempt to decouple the effects of electron correlation and basis set incompleteness on the choice of gauge for specific rotation calculations on simple test systems. The simulations show a smooth convergence of the LG(OI) and MVG results with the basis set size toward the complete basis set limit. However, these preliminary results indicate that CCSD may not be close to a complete description of the electron correlation effects on this property even for small molecules and that basis set incompleteness may be a less important cause of discrepancy between choices of gauge than electron correlation incompleteness.},

A wide range of solutes were investigated, including hydrophobes, water as a solute, and the FreeSolv database containing 642 drug-like molecules having a variety of shapes and sizes. The usual second-order approximation of the theory is corrected by a third-order, angular-independent bridge functional. The overall functional is parameter-free in the sense that the only inputs are bulk water properties, independent of the solutes considered. These inputs are the direct correlation function, compressibility, liquid–gas surface tension, and excess chemical potential of the solvent. Compared to molecular simulations with the same force field and the same fixed solute geometries, the present theory is shown to describe accurately the solvation free energy and structure of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic solutes. Overall, the method yields a precision of order 0.5 k B T for the hydration free energies of the FreeSolv database, with a computer speedup of 3 orders of magnitude. The theory remains to be improved for a better description of the H-bonding structure and the hydration free energy of charged solutes.},

  abstract = {This work introduces a novel application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the prediction of starting geometries in transition state (TS) searches based on the geometries of reactants and products. The multi-dimensional potential energy space of a chemical reaction often complicates the location of a starting TS geometry, leading to the correct TS combining reactants and products in question. The proposed TS-GAN efficiently maps the space between reactants and products and generates reliable TS guess geometries, and it can be easily combined with any quantum chemical software package performing geometry optimizations. The TS-GAN was trained and applied to generate TS guess structures for typical chemical reactions, such as hydrogen migration, isomerization, and transition metal-catalyzed reactions. The performance of the TS-GAN was directly compared to that of classical approaches, proving its high accuracy and efficiency. The current TS-GAN can be extended to any dataset that contains sufficient chemical reactions for training. The software is freely available for training, experimentation, and prediction at https://github.com/ekraka/TS-GAN .},

  abstract = {Progress in electrochemical technologies, such as automotive batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells, depends greatly on developing improved charged interfaces between electrodes and electrolytes. The rational development of such interfaces can benefit from the atomistic understanding of the materials involved by first-principles quantum mechanical simulations with Density Functional Theory (DFT). However, such simulations are typically performed on the electrode surface in the absence of its electrolyte environment and at constant charge. We have developed a new hybrid computational method combining DFT and the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (P–BE) capable of simulating experimental electrochemistry under potential control in the presence of a solvent and an electrolyte. The charged electrode is represented quantum-mechanically via linear-scaling DFT, which can model nanoscale systems with thousands of atoms and is neutralized by a counter electrolyte charge via the solution of a modified P–BE. Our approach works with the total free energy of the combined multiscale system in a grand canonical ensemble of electrons subject to a constant electrochemical potential. It is calibrated with respect to the reduction potential of common reference electrodes, such as the standard hydrogen electrode and the Li metal electrode, which is used as a reference electrode in Li-ion batteries. Our new method can be used to predict electrochemical properties under constant potential, and we demonstrate this in exemplar simulations of the differential capacitance of few-layer graphene electrodes and the charging of a graphene electrode coupled to a Li metal electrode at different voltages.},

The electrostatic potential in the interstitial region, obtained from density functional theory, with four exchange correlation functionals, is used to predict the valence band offsets of 27 zinc blende semiconductors. The results are found to be in qualitative agreement with Frensley and Kroemer’s original data. In addition to absolute electron energies, the possibility of extracting effective ionic charges is investigated and compared to Bader partial charges.

Applying the Legendre transform approach introduced by Maggs [Europhys. Lett. 98 , 16012 (2012)], the dual functionals of these models are derived and are given by convex vector-field functionals of the dielectric displacement D and the polarization field P . We compare the convex functionals in P -space to the non-convex functionals in electric field E -space and apply them to the classic problem of the solvation of point-like ions. Since the dipolar-Poisson model does not properly describe polarization saturation, we argue that only the dipolar-Poisson–Langevin functional can be used to provide a nonlinear generalization of the harmonic polarization functional used in the theory of Marcus for the electron transfer rate to nonlinear regimes. We show that the model can be quantitatively parameterized by molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics occur in a wide range of chemical reactions and femtochemistry experiments involving electronically excited states. These dynamics are hard to treat numerically as the system’s complexity increases, and it is thus desirable to have accurate yet affordable methods for their simulation. Here, we introduce a linearized semiclassical method, the generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation (GDTWA), which is well-established in the context of quantum spin lattice systems, into the arena of chemical nonadiabatic systems. In contrast to traditional continuous mapping approaches, e.g., the Meyer–Miller–Stock–Thoss and the spin mappings, GDTWA samples the electron degrees of freedom in a discrete phase space and thus forbids an unphysical unbounded growth of electronic state populations. The discrete sampling also accounts for an effective reduced but non-vanishing zero-point energy without an explicit parameter, which makes it possible to treat the identity operator and other operators on an equal footing. As numerical benchmarks on two linear vibronic coupling models and Tully’s models show, GDTWA has a satisfactory accuracy in a wide parameter regime, independent of whether the dynamics is dominated by relaxation or by coherent interactions. Our results suggest that the method can be very adequate to treat challenging nonadiabatic dynamics problems in chemistry and related fields.},

Via this method, trion energy levels and wavefunctions can be calculated efficiently with fairly good accuracy. We first apply this method to study trion energy levels in a 2D hydrogen-like system with respect to a wide range of mass ratios and screening lengths. We find that the ground-state trion is bound for the whole parameter range, and an excited-state trion with antisymmetric permutation of electrons with finite angular momentum is bound for large electron–hole mass ratios or long screening lengths. The binding energies of ground-state trions calculated by the present method agree well with those calculated by more sophisticated but computationally demanding methods. We then calculate trion binding energies in various monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) by using this method with the inclusion of electron–hole exchange (EHX) interaction. For TMDCs, we found that the effect of EHX can be significant in determining the trion binding energy and the possible existence of stable excited-state trions.},

A. 115 , 5890–5895 (2018)], we examined an effect of the nuclear mass during the non-adiabatic transfer between strongly coupled Rydberg and valence electronic states in N 2 excited by an ultrafast pulse. Here, we develop and analyze an algebraic description for the density matrix and its logarithm, the surprisal, in such a superposition of states with a focus on the essentially quantum effect of mass. This allows for the identification of a few observables that accurately characterize the density matrix of the system with several coupled electron-nuclear states. We compact the time evolution in terms of time-dependent coefficients of these observables. Using the few observables, we derive an analytical expression for the time-dependent surprisal. This provides a mass-dependent phase factor only in the observables off-diagonal in the electronic index. The isotope effect is shown to be explicitly driven by the shift in the equilibrium position of the valence state potential. It is analytically given as a time-dependent phase factor describing the interference in the overlap of the two wave packets on the coupled electronic states. This phase factorizes as a product of classical and quantal contributions.},

The new diagrammatic approach enables the first cubic scaling implementation of nuclear derivatives for THC tensors fitted in molecular orbital basis (MO-THC). Furthermore, application of this new approach to THC-MP2 analytical gradients leads to an implementation, which is at least four times faster than the previously reported, manually derived implementation. Finally, we apply the new approach to the 14 tensor contraction patterns appearing in the supporting subspace formulation of multireference perturbation theory, laying the foundation for developments of analytical nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic coupling vectors for multi-state CASPT2.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms have undergone an explosive development impacting every aspect of computational chemistry. To obtain reliable predictions, one needs to maintain a proper balance between the black-box nature of ML frameworks and the physics of the target properties. One of the most appealing quantum-chemical properties for regression models is the electron density, and some of us recently proposed a transferable and scalable model based on the decomposition of the density onto an atom-centered basis set. The decomposition, as well as the training of the model, is at its core a minimization of some loss function, which can be arbitrarily chosen and may lead to results of different quality. Well-studied in the context of density fitting (DF), the impact of the metric on the performance of ML models has not been analyzed yet. In this work, we compare predictions obtained using the overlap and the Coulomb-repulsion metrics for both decomposition and training. As expected, the Coulomb metric used as both the DF and ML loss functions leads to the best results for the electrostatic potential and dipole moments. The origin of this difference lies in the fact that the model is not constrained to predict densities that integrate to the exact number of electrons N . Since an a posteriori correction for the number of electrons decreases the errors, we proposed a modification of the model, where N is included directly into the kernel function, which allowed lowering of the errors on the test and out-of-sample sets.},

In this study, we first review available nonbonded pair interactions in field-theoretic models and propose a classification. Then, we outline the inverse potential problem and present an alternative approach on the basis of a saddle-point approximation, enabling the use of a richer set of pair interaction functions. We test our approach by using as an example the Morse potential, which finds extensive applications in particle-based simulations, and we calibrate u −1 with results from a molecular dynamics simulation. The u −1 thus obtained is consistent with the field-theoretic model equations, and when used in stand-alone self-consistent field simulations, it produces the correct fluid structure starting from a random initial state of the density field.},

In addition to the changes in the electronic structure, the nuclei are exposed to the Lorentz force with the magnetic field being screened by the electrons. In this work, we explore these effects using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on an effective Hamiltonian calculated at the Hartree–Fock level of theory. To correctly include these non-conservative forces in the dynamics, we have designed a series of novel propagators that show both good efficiency and stability in test cases. As a first application, we analyze simulations of He and H 2 at two field strengths characteristic of magnetic white dwarfs (0.1 B 0 = 2.35 × 10 4 T and B 0 = 2.35 × 10 5 T). While the He simulations clearly demonstrate the importance of electron screening of the Lorentz force in the dynamics, the extracted rovibrational spectra of H 2 reveal a number of fascinating features not observed in the field-free case: couplings of rotations/vibrations with the cyclotron rotation, overtones with unusual selection rules, and hindered rotations that transmute into librations with increasing field strength. We conclude that our presented framework is a powerful tool to investigate molecules in these extreme environments.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of a molecule in a magnetic field is significantly different from its zero-field counterpart. One important difference in the presence of a field is the Lorentz force acting on the nuclei, which can be decomposed as the sum of the bare nuclear Lorentz force and a screening force due to the electrons. This screening force is calculated from the Berry curvature and can change the dynamics qualitatively. It is therefore important to include the contributions from the Berry curvature in molecular dynamics simulations in a magnetic field. In this work, we present a scheme for calculating the Berry curvature numerically using a finite-difference technique, addressing challenges related to the arbitrary global phase of the wave function. The Berry curvature is calculated as a function of bond distance for H 2 at the restricted and unrestricted Hartree–Fock levels of theory and for CH + as a function of the magnetic field strength at the restricted Hartree–Fock level of theory. The calculations are carried out using basis sets of contracted Gaussian functions equipped with London phase factors (London orbitals) to ensure gauge-origin invariance. In this paper, we also interpret the Berry curvature in terms of atomic charges and discuss its convergence in basis sets with and without London phase factors. The calculation of the Berry curvature allows for its inclusion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in a magnetic field.},

  abstract = {Ab initio molecular dynamics was used to estimate the response to constant imposed strain on a short polyethylene (PE) chain and a radical chain with a removed hydrogen atom. Two independent types of simulations were run. In the first case, the chains were strained by expanding a periodic cell, restraining the length but allowing the internal degrees of freedom to reach equilibrium. From these simulations, the average force on the chain was computed, and the resulting force was integrated to determine the Helmholtz free energy for chain stretching. In the second set of simulations, chains were constrained to various lengths, while a bond was restrained at various bond lengths using umbrella sampling. This provided free energy of bond scission for various chain strains. The sum of the two free energy functions results in an approximation of the free energy of chain scission under various strains and gives a realistic and new picture of the effect of chain strain on bond breaking. Unimolecular scission rates for each chain type were examined as a function of chain strain. The scission rate for the radical chain is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the pristine chain at smaller strains and at equilibrium. This highlights the importance of radical formation in PE rupture and is consistent with experiments. Constant strain results were used to derive a constant-force model for the radical chain that demonstrates a roll over in rate similar to the “catch-bond” behavior observed in protein membrane detachment experiments.},

In contrast to the wave-function methods, a detailed and careful analysis of such molecular solutions was not performed before. In this work, we use two-particle density matrices to investigate local spin and charge correlators that quantify the charge resonance and covalent characters of these solutions. When applied within the unrestricted orbital set, spin correlators elucidate the broken symmetry of the solutions, containing necessary information for building effective magnetic Hamiltonians. Based on GW and GF2 calculations of simple molecules and transition metal complexes, we construct Heisenberg Hamiltonians, four-spin-four-center corrections, and biquadratic spin–spin interactions. These Hamiltonian parameterizations are compared to previous wave-function calculations.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic–vibrational spectroscopy (2DEVS) is an emerging spectroscopic technique which exploits two different frequency ranges for the excitation (visible) and detection (infrared) axes of a 2D spectrum. In contrast to degenerate 2D techniques, such as 2D electronic or 2D infrared spectroscopy, the spectral features of a 2DEV spectrum report cross correlations between fluctuating electronic and vibrational energy gaps rather than autocorrelations as in the degenerate spectroscopies. The center line slope of the spectral features reports on this cross correlation function directly and can reveal specific electronic–vibrational couplings and rapid changes in the electronic structure, for example. The involvement of the two types of transition moments, visible and infrared, makes 2DEVS very sensitive to electronic and vibronic mixing. 2DEV spectra also feature improved spectral resolution, making the method valuable for unraveling the highly congested spectra of molecular complexes. The unique features of 2DEVS are illustrated in this paper with specific examples and their origin described at an intuitive level with references to formal derivations provided. Although early in its development and far from fully explored, 2DEVS has already proven to be a valuable addition to the tool box of ultrafast nonlinear optical spectroscopy and is of promising potential in future efforts to explore the intricate connection between electronic and vibrational nuclear degrees of freedom in energy and charge transport applications.},

  abstract = {Single-particle tracking (SPT) experiments of lipids and membrane proteins provide a wealth of information about the properties of biomembranes. Careful analysis of SPT trajectories can reveal deviations from ideal Brownian behavior. Among others, this includes confinement effects and anomalous diffusion, which are manifestations of both the nanoscale structure of the underlying membrane and the structure of the diffuser. With the rapid increase in temporal and spatial resolution of experimental methods, a new aspect of the motion of the particle, namely, anisotropic diffusion, might become relevant. This aspect that so far received only little attention is the anisotropy of the diffusive motion and may soon provide an additional proxy to the structure and topology of biomembranes. Unfortunately, the theoretical framework for detecting and interpreting anisotropy effects is currently scattered and incomplete. Here, we provide a computational method to evaluate the degree of anisotropy directly from molecular dynamics simulations and also point out a way to compare the obtained results with those available from SPT experiments. In order to probe the effects of anisotropic diffusion, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of peripheral and integral membrane proteins in flat and curved bilayers. In agreement with the theoretical basis, our computational results indicate that anisotropy can persist up to the rotational relaxation time [ τ = ( 2 D r ) − 1 ], after which isotropic diffusion is observed. Moreover, the underlying topology of the membrane bilayer can couple with the geometry of the particle, thus extending the spatiotemporal domain over which this type of motion can be detected.},

Using microwave dielectric spectroscopy, we have assessed the amount of water associated with hydration shells of methemoglobin as a function of its concentration in the presence or absence of ions. We estimated water–hemoglobin interactions to interpret the obtained data. Within the concentration range of 5–10 g/dl of methemoglobin, ions play an important role in defining the free-to-bound water ratio competing with hemoglobin to recruit water molecules for the hydration shell. At higher concentrations, hemoglobin is a major contributor to the recruitment of water to its hydration shell. Furthermore, the amount of bound water does not change as the hemoglobin concentration is increased from 15 to 30 g/dl, remaining at the level of ∼20\% of the total intracellular water pool. The theoretical evaluation of the ratio of free and bound water for the hemoglobin concentration in the absence of ions corresponds with the experimental results and shows that the methemoglobin molecule binds about 1400 water molecules. These observations suggest that within the concentration range close to the physiological one, hemoglobin molecules are so close to each other that their hydration shells interact. In this case, the orientation of the hemoglobin molecules is most likely not stochastic, but rather supports partial neutralization of positive and negative charges at the protein surface. Furthermore, deformation of the red blood cell shape results in the rearrangement of these structures.},

The key microscopic features that control such assemblies remain poorly understood, nevertheless. Using classical density functional theory, we demonstrate how the intrinsic length scales and their interplay in terms of interspecies molecular interactions can be used to tune soft matter self-assembly. We apply our strategy to two different soft binary mixtures to create guidelines for tuning intermolecular interactions that lead to transitions from a fully miscible, liquid-like uniform state to formation of simple and core–shell aggregates and mixed aggregate structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the interspecies interactions and system composition can be used to control concentration gradients of component species within these assemblies. The insight generated by this work contributes toward understanding and controlling soft multi-component self-assembly systems. Additionally, our results aid in understanding complex biological assemblies and their function and provide tools to engineer molecular interactions in order to control polymeric and protein-based materials, pharmaceutical formulations, and nanoparticle assemblies.},

The mechanical properties of these materials are of interest for a variety of applications; however, computational studies in this area have so far been limited. In this work, we derive expressions for two important properties for dispersions of polarizable spherical particles with dipoles induced by a uniform external field—the isothermal stress tensor and the pressure. Numerical calculations of these quantities, evaluated using a spectrally accurate Ewald summation method, are validated using thermodynamic integration. We also compare the stress obtained using the mutual dipole model, which accounts for the mutual polarization of particles, to the stress expected from calculations using a fixed dipole model, which neglects mutual polarization. We find that as the conductivity of the particles increases relative to the surrounding medium, the fixed dipole model does not accurately describe the dipolar contribution to the stress. The thermodynamic pressure, calculated from the trace of the stress tensor, is compared to the virial expression for the pressure, which is simpler to calculate but inexact. We find that the virial pressure and the thermodynamic pressure differ, especially in suspensions with a high volume fraction of particles.},

Using the “barrier climbing” path, we calculate the activation exponent. We also derive an approximate expression for the prefactor. The calculated results are compared with the simulations, and a good agreement between the two is found. Our results show that, unlike in the case of thermal noise, the rate depends not just on the barrier height but also on the shape of the whole barrier.

These systems have been intensively studied for applications as molecular memories, sensing devices, or super-resolution optical microscopy. Here, we study the long-term switching behavior of single photochromic triads under oxygen-free conditions at 10 K. The triads consist of a photochromic unit that is covalently linked to two strong fluorophores that were employed for monitoring the light-induced conversions of the switch via changes in the fluorescence intensity from the fluorophores. As dyes we use either perylene bisimide or boron-dipyrromethen, and as photochromic switch we use dithienylcyclopentene (DCP). Both types of triads showed high fatigue resistance allowing for up to 6000 switching cycles of a single triad corresponding to time durations in the order of 80 min without deterioration. Long-term analysis of the switching cycles reveals that the probability that an intensity change in the emission from the dyes can be assigned to an externally stimulated conversion of the DCP (rather than to stochastic blinking of the dye molecules) amounts to 0.7 ± 0.1 for both types of triads. This number is far too low for optical data storage using single triads and implications concerning the miniaturization of optical memories based on such systems will be discussed. Yet, together with the high fatigue resistance, this number is encouraging for applications in super-resolution optical microscopy on frozen biological samples.},

This method judiciously combines two well-known, counter-intuitive phenomena, the levitation and the blowtorch effects. The result is that the two components are separated by being driven to the opposite ends of the zeolite column. The calculations are based on the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo method with moves from a region at one temperature to a region at another temperature. The necessary acceptance probability for such moves has been derived here on the basis of stationary solution of an inhomogeneous Fokker–Planck equation. Simulations have been carried out with a realistic and experimentally relevant Gaussian hot zone and also a square hot zone, both of which lead to very good separation. Simulations without the hot zones do not show any separation. The results are reported at a loading of 1 molecule per cage. The temperature of the hot zone is just ∼30 K higher than the ambient temperature. The separation factors of the order of 10 17 are achieved using single crystals of zeolite, which are less than 1 μ m long. The conditions for including the hot zone may be experimentally realizable in the future considering the rapid advances in nanoscale thermometry. The separation process is likely to be energetically more efficient by several orders of magnitude as compared to the existing methods of separation, making the method very green.},

Implicit solvent models at low concentrations and small dielectric constants exhibit strongly field-dependent conductivities. We compare these results to Onsager–Wilson theory of the Wien effect, which provides a qualitatively consistent prediction at low concentrations and high static dielectric constants but is inconsistent away from these regimes. The origin of the discrepancy is found to be increased ion correlations under these conditions. Explicit solvent effects act to suppress nonlinear responses, yielding a weakly field-dependent conductivity over the range of physically realizable field strengths. By decomposing the relevant time correlation functions, we find that the insensitivity of the conductivity to the field results from the persistent frictional forces on the ions from the solvent. Our findings illustrate the utility of nonequilibrium response theory in rationalizing nonlinear transport behavior.},

Their viscoelastic responses are analyzed in relation to their previously investigated electric conductivity. The comparison of the also presently reported dielectric response of deuterated sulfuric acid tetrahydrate (SA4D) and that of its protonated analog SA4H reveals an absence of isotope effects for the charge transport in this hydrate. This finding clearly contrasts with the situation known for PA1H and PA1D. Our analyses also demonstrate that the conductivity relaxation profiles of acid hydrides closely resemble those exhibited by classical ionic electrolytes, even though the charge transport in phosphoric acid hydrates is dominated by proton transfer processes. At variance with this dielectric simplicity, the viscoelastic responses of these materials depend on their structural compositions. While SA4H displays a “simple liquid”-like viscoelastic behavior, the mechanical responses of PA1H and PA1D are more complex, revealing relaxation modes, which are faster than their ubiquitous structural rearrangements. Interestingly, the characteristic rates of these fast mechanical relaxations agree well with the characteristic frequencies of the charge rearrangements probed in the dielectric investigations, suggesting appearance of a proton transfer in mechanical relaxation of phosphoric acid hydrates. These findings open the exciting perspective of exploiting shear rheology to access not only the dynamics of the matrix but also that of the charge carriers in highly viscous decoupled conductors.},

The kinetics are studied within the framework of the fictive temperature ( T F ) of the glassy structure. We solve for the kinetics of T F ( t ) and the time-dependent structure factor and find that they are different but closely related by a function that depends only on temperature. Furthermore, we are able to solve for the evolution of T F ( t ) in a set of temperature-jump histories referred to as the Kovacs’ signatures. We demonstrate that the NE-SCGLE theory reproduces all the Kovacs’ signatures, namely, intrinsic isotherm, asymmetry of approach, and memory effect. In addition, we extend the theory into largely unexplored, deep glassy state, regions that are below the notionally “ideal” glass temperature.},

A detailed experimental evaluation of the S–L phase behavior revealed that the eutectic point is shifted toward lower temperatures and higher salt contents upon decreasing the ionic radius. The salt fusion properties were experimentally inaccessible owing to thermal decomposition. The data were inter- and extrapolated using various models for the Gibbs energy of mixing fitted to the glutaric-acid rich side only, which allowed for the assessment of the eutectic point. Fitting the experimental data to a two-parameter Redlich–Kister expansion with Flory entropy, the eutectic depth could be related to the ionic radius of the anion. The anion type, and in particular its size, can therefore be viewed as an important design parameter for the liquid window of other acid and salt-based deep eutectic solvents/systems.},

Bismuth(III) halometallates form highly colored novel ionic liquid based solvents for which experimental characterization and fundamental understanding are limited. In this work, Bismuth(III) halometallates incorporating chloride, bromide, and iodide have been studied via density functional theory employing B3LYP-D3BJ/aug-cc-pVDZ. Lone anions, and anions in clusters with sufficient 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium [C 2 C 1 Im] + counter-cations to balance the charge, have been investigated in the gas- phase, and with polarizable continuum solvation. Evaluation of speciation profiles indicates that dimeric or trimeric anions are prevalent. In contrast to analogous Al systems, anions of higher charge (−2, −3) are present. Speciation profiles are similar, but not identical with respect to the halide. The Bi based anions [ Bi m X n ] x − in the gas phase and generalized solvation environment produce multiple low energy conformers; moreover, key structural interaction patterns emerge from an analysis of ion-pair and neutral-cluster structures ( Bi m X n ) x − ( C 2 C 1 Im ) x + for x = 1, 2, and 3. Cation–anion interactions are weak; with Coulombic and dispersion forces predominating, anion– π structures are favored, while significant hydrogen bonding does not occur. Anion to cation charge transfer is minimal, but mutual polarization is significant, leading to local positive regions in the anion electrostatic potential surface. The key features of experimental x-ray photoelectron, UV–Vis spectra, and Raman spectra are reproduced, validating the computational results and facilitating rationalization of key features.},

  abstract = {Löwdin’s symmetry dilemma is an ubiquitous issue in approximate quantum chemistry. In the context of Hartree–Fock (HF) theory, the use of Slater determinants with some imposed constraints to preserve symmetries of the exact problem may lead to physically unreasonable potential energy surfaces. On the other hand, lifting these constraints leads to the so-called broken symmetry solutions that usually provide better energetics, at the cost of losing information about good quantum numbers that describe the state of the system. This behavior has previously been extensively studied in the context of bond dissociation. This paper studies the behavior of different classes of HF spin polarized solutions (restricted, unrestricted, and generalized) in the context of ionization by strong static electric fields. We find that, for simple two electron systems, unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) is able to provide a qualitatively good description of states involved during the ionization process (neutral, singly ionized, and doubly ionized states), whereas RHF fails to describe the singly ionized state. For more complex systems, even though UHF is able to capture some of the expected characteristics of the ionized states, it is constrained to a single M s (diabatic) manifold in the energy surface as a function of field intensity. In this case, a better qualitative picture can be painted by using generalized Hartree–Fock as it is able to explore different spin manifolds and follow the lowest solution due to lack of collinearity constraints on the spin quantization axis.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that molecular polaritons, hybrid states of light and matter formed by the strong coupling between molecular electronic or vibrational excitations and an optical cavity, can substantially modify the physical and chemical properties of molecular systems. Here, we show that by exploiting the collective character of molecular polaritons in conjunction with the effect of polaron decoupling, i.e., the suppression of environmental influence on the polariton, a super-reaction can be realized, involving a collective enhancement of charge or excitation-energy transfer reaction rate in a system of donors all coupled to a common acceptor. This effect is analogous to the phenomenon of super-radiation. Since the polariton is a superposition state of excitations of all the molecules coupled to the cavity, it is vulnerable to the effect of decoherence caused by energy fluctuations in molecular systems. Consequently, in the absence of a strong light–matter interaction, the reaction rate decreases significantly as the number of molecules increases, even if the system starts from the polariton state. By turning on the light–matter interaction, the dynamic behavior of the system changes dramatically, and the reaction rate increases with the number of molecules, as expected for a super-reaction. The underlying mechanism is shown to be the protection of quantum coherence between different donors as the light–matter interaction becomes stronger.},

Here, we report on the synthesis of self-assembled Ag 2 Cl 2 (dppe) 2 clusters through the ligand-exchange-induced transformation of [Pt 2 Ag 23 Cl 7 (PPh 3 ) 10 ] NCs [(dppe): 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane; (PPh 3 ): triphenylphosphine]. The single crystal x-ray structure reveals that two Ag atoms are bridged by one dppe and two Cl ligands, forming a Ag 2 Cl 2 (dppe) cluster, which is subsequently self-assembled through dppe ligands to form [Ag 2 Cl 2 (dppe) 2 ] n . Importantly, the Ag 2 Cl 2 (dppe) 2 cluster assembly exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield: ∼18\%, which is attributed to the metallophilic interactions and rigidification of the ligand shell. We hope that this work will motivate the exploitation of the chemical reactivity of NCs as a new path to attain cluster assemblies endowed with enhanced photophysical properties.},

Herein, we report controlled syngas production with various H 2 /CO ratios via the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on specifically formulated Au 25 and PtAu 24 nanoclusters (NCs) with core-atom-controlled selectivities. While CO was predominantly produced from the CO 2 RR on the Au NCs, H 2 production was favored on the PtAu 24 NCs. Density functional theory calculations of the free energy profiles for the CO 2 RR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) indicated that the reaction energy for the conversion of CO 2 to CO was much lower than that for the HER on the Au 25 NC. In contrast, the energy profiles calculated for the HER indicated that the PtAu 24 NCs have nearly thermoneutral binding properties; thus, H 2 production is favored over CO formation. Based on the distinctly different catalytic selectivities of Au 25 and PtAu 24 NCs, controlled syngas production with H 2 /CO ratios of 1 to 4 was demonstrated at a constant applied potential by simply mixing the Au 25 and PtAu 24 NCs based on their intrinsic catalytic activities for the production of CO and H 2 .},

Following a recent work by Mayer et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 116 , 8167–8172 (2019)] on the room temperature binding of Ar to a superelectrophilic boron site embedded in a negative ion complex, B 12 (CN) 11 − , we have systematically studied the effect of cluster size and terminal ligands on the interaction of Ng by focusing on B 12 X 11 (Ng) (X = H, CN, and BO) and B 12 X 10 (Ng) 2 (X = CN and BO) whose stabilities are governed by the Wade–Mingos rule and on C 5 BX 5 (Ng) (X = H, F, and CN) and C 4 B 2 (CN) 4 (Ng) 2 whose stabilities are governed by the Huckel’s aromaticity rule. Our conclusion, based on density functional theory, is that both the cluster size and the terminal ligands matter—the interaction between the cluster and the Ng atoms becomes stronger with increasing cluster size and the electron affinity of the terminal ligands. Our studies also led to a counter-intuitive finding—removing multiple terminal ligands can enable electrophilic centers to bind multiple Ng atoms simultaneously without compromising their binding strength.},

In this study, we aim to develop further understanding of the coupling between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom of TIPS-pentacene (TIPS-Pn). We measured and analyzed the 2D electronic spectra of TIPS-Pn in solutions. Using center line slope (CLS) analysis, we characterized the frequency-fluctuation correlation function of the 0–0 vibronic transition. Strong oscillations in the CLS values were observed for up to 5 ps with a frequency of 264 cm −1 , which are attributable to a large vibronic coupling with the TIPS-Pn ring-breathing vibrational mode. In addition, detailed analysis of the CLS values allowed us to retrieve two spectral diffusion lifetimes, which are attributed to the inertial and diffusive dynamics of solvent molecules. Amplitude beating analysis also uncovered couplings with another vibrational mode at 1173 cm −1 . The experimental results can be described using the displaced harmonic oscillator model. By comparing the CLS values of the simulated data with the experimental CLS values, we estimated a Huang–Rhys factor of 0.1 for the ring-breathing vibrational mode. The results demonstrated how CLS analysis can be a useful method for characterizing the strength of vibronic coupling.},

However, the lack of well-resolved experimental probes of a AuNC electronic structure has made the task of evaluating the accuracy of electronic structure descriptions challenging. We compare electronic absorption spectra computed using time-dependent density functional theory to recently collected high resolution experimental spectra of A u 9 ( P P h 3 ) 8 3 + and A u 8 ( P P h 3 ) 7 2 + AuNCs with strikingly similar features. After applying a simple scaling correction, the computed spectrum of A u 8 ( P P h 3 ) 7 2 + yields a suitable match, allowing us to assign low-energy metal–metal transitions in the experimental spectrum. No similar match is obtained after following the same procedure for two previously reported isomers for A u 9 ( P P h 3 ) 8 3 + ⁠ , suggesting either a deficiency in the calculations or the presence of an additional isomer. Instead, we propose assignments for A u 9 ( P P h 3 ) 8 3 + based off of similarities A u 8 ( P P h 3 ) 7 2 + ⁠ . We further model these clusters using a simple particle-in-a-box analysis for an asymmetrical ellipsoidal superatomic core, which allows us to reproduce the same transitions and extract an effective core size and shape that agrees well with that expected from crystal structures.

  abstract = {The source–sink potential (SSP) method provides a simple tool for the qualitative analysis of the conductance of molecular electronic devices, and often analytical expressions for the conductance can be obtained. Here, we extend the SSP approach to account for decoherent, inelastic electron transport by including the non-adiabatic coupling between the electrons and the nuclei in the molecule. This coupling results in contributions to electron transport that can modify the qualitative structure–conductance relationships that we unraveled previously with SSP. In the approach proposed, electron–nucleus interactions are treated starting from the harmonic approximation for the nuclei, using a non-perturbative approach to account for the non-adiabatic coupling. Our method qualitatively describes experimentally observed phenomena and allows for a simple analysis that often provides analytical formulas in terms of the physical parameters of the junction, e.g., vibrational energies, non-adiabatic coupling, and molecule–contact coupling.},

  abstract = {The truncated Wigner approximation to quantum dynamics in phase space is explored in the context of computing vibronic line shapes for monomer linear optical spectra. We consider multiple model potential forms including a shifted harmonic oscillator with both equal and unequal frequencies on the ground and excited state potentials as well as a shifted Morse potential model. For the equal-frequency shifted harmonic oscillator model, we derive an analytic expression for the exact vibronic line shape that emphasizes the importance of using a quantum mechanical distribution of phase space initial conditions. For the unequal-frequency shifted harmonic oscillator model, we are no longer able to obtain an exact expression for the vibronic line shape in terms of independent deterministic classical trajectories. We show how one can rigorously account for corrections to the truncated Wigner approximation through nonlinear responses of the line shape function to momentum fluctuations along a classical trajectory and demonstrate the qualitative improvement in the resulting spectrum when the leading-order quantum correction is included. Finally, we numerically simulate absorption spectra of a highly anharmonic shifted Morse potential model. We find that, while finite quantization and the dissociation limit are captured with reasonable accuracy, there is a qualitative breakdown of the quasi-classical trajectory ensemble’s ability to describe the vibronic line shape when the relative shift in Morse potentials becomes large. The work presented here provides clarity on the origin of unphysical negative features known to contaminate absorption spectra computed with quasi-classical trajectory ensembles.},

An extension of the Fock-space wave operators is introduced in order to treat the short-range correlation effects for excited and doubly electron-attached states. We show that an effective reduction in the number of active virtuals can also be obtained by improving how the short-range correlation is treated. Numerical results to gauge the performance for valence and Rydberg excitation energies, double ionization potentials, and double electron attachment energies of several molecules are obtained. Statistical measures of the errors in excitation energies show that the explicitly correlated results are within 0.1 eV from the complete basis set limit already at the double- ζ level unless the excitation energies are too close to the ionization thresholds. Similar accuracy is seen for the double ionization potentials and double electron attachment energies.},

The dianionic Cu-based molecule was proposed to be a promising qubit candidate. Self-interaction error within approximate DFT functionals renders severe delocalization of electron and spin densities arising from 3 d orbitals. The FLO-SIC method relies on optimization of Fermi–Löwdin orbital descriptors (FODs) with which localized occupied orbitals are constructed to create SIC potentials. Starting with many initial sets of FODs, we employ a frozen-density loop algorithm within the FLO-SIC method to study the Cu-based molecule. We find that the electronic structure of the molecule remains unchanged despite somewhat different final FOD configurations. In the dianionic state (spin S = 1/2), FLO-SIC spin density originates from the Cu d and S p orbitals with an approximate ratio of 2:1, in quantitative agreement with multireference calculations, while in the case of SIC-free DFT, the orbital ratio is reversed. Overall, FLO-SIC lowers the energies of the occupied orbitals and, in particular, the 3 d orbitals unhybridized with the ligands significantly, which substantially increases the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) compared to SIC-free DFT results. The FLO-SIC HOMO–LUMO gap of the dianionic state is larger than that of the monoanionic state, which is consistent with experiment. Our results suggest a positive outlook of the FLO-SIC method in the description of magnetic exchange coupling within 3 d -element-based systems.},

It is well known that the primary Kondo characteristics at ω = ± eV = ±( μ L − μ R ) display asymmetrical upturns and remarkable peaks in S ( ω ) and d S ( ω )/d ω , respectively. These features are originated from the Rabi interference of the transport current dynamics, with the Kondo oscillation frequency of | eV |.

In this article, we extend the generalized block-localized wave function technique to a relativistic two-component framework. Optimization of excited state determinants for two-component wave functions presents a unique challenge because the excited state manifold is often quite dense with degenerate states. Furthermore, we test the degree to which certain symmetries result naturally from the ΔSCF optimization such as time-reversal symmetry and symmetry with respect to the total angular momentum operator on a series of atomic systems. Variational optimizations may often break the symmetry in order to lower the overall energy, just as unrestricted Hartree–Fock breaks spin symmetry. Overall, we demonstrate that time-reversal symmetry is roughly maintained when using Hartree–Fock, but less so when using Kohn–Sham density functional theory. Additionally, maintaining total angular momentum symmetry appears to be system dependent and not guaranteed. Finally, we were able to trace the breaking of total angular momentum symmetry to the relaxation of core electrons.},

Following the suggestion of Plasser et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 12 , 1207 (2016)], the derivative couplings are computed as finite differences of wave function overlaps. Several measures have been taken to speed up the calculation of the NACMEs. Schur’s determinant complement is employed to build up the determinant of the full matrix of spin-blocked orbital overlaps from precomputed spin factors with fixed orbital occupation. Test calculations on formaldehyde, pyrazine, and xanthone show that the mutual excitation level of the configurations at the reference and displaced geometries can be restricted to 1. In combination with a cutoff parameter of t norm = 10 −8 for the DFT/MRCI wave function expansion, this approximation leads to substantial savings of cpu time without essential loss of precision. With regard to applications, the photoexcitation decay kinetics of xanthone in apolar media and in aqueous solution is in the focus of the present work. The results of our computational study substantiate the conjecture that S 1 T 2 reverse ISC outcompetes the T 2 ↝ T 1 IC in aqueous solution, thus explaining the occurrence of delayed fluorescence in addition to prompt fluorescence.},

We explore and analyze here the efficacy of the UGA-SSMRPT2 theory in the description of the avoided crossings and interlacings between a manifold of potential energy curves for states belonging to the same space-spin symmetry. Three different aspects of UGA-SSMRPT2 have been studied: (a) We introduce and develop the most rigorous version of UGA-SSMRPT2 that emerges from the rigorous version of UGA-SSMRCC utilizing a linearly independent virtual manifold; we call this the “projection” version of UGA-SSMRPT2 (UGA-SSMRPT2 scheme P). We compare and contrast this approach with our earlier formulation that used extra sufficiency conditions via amplitude equations (UGA-SSMRPT2 scheme A). (b) We present the results for a variety of electronic states of a set of molecules, which display the striking accuracy of both the two versions of UGA-SSMRPT2 with respect to three different situations involving weakly avoided crossings, moderate/strongly avoided crossings, and interlacing in a manifold of potential energy curves (PECs) of the same symmetry. Accuracy of our results has been benchmarked against IC-MRCISD + Q. (c) For weakly avoided crossing between states displaying differently charged sectors around the crossing region, the insufficient inclusion of state-specific orbital relaxation and the absence of dynamic correlation induced by orbital relaxation in the first order wavefunction for a second order perturbative theory lead to an artifact of double crossing between the pair of PECs.},

However, it faces significant challenges as the human genome consists of over 6 × 10 9 base pairs, a system size that exceeds the capacity of traditional modeling approaches. In this perspective, we review the progress that has been made in modeling the human genome. Coarse-grained models parameterized to reproduce experimental data via the maximum entropy optimization algorithm serve as effective means to study genome organization at various length scales. They have provided insight into the principles of whole-genome organization and enabled de novo predictions of chromosome structures from epigenetic modifications. Applications of these models at a near-atomistic resolution further revealed physicochemical interactions that drive the phase separation of disordered proteins and dictate chromatin stability in situ .

By using molecular dynamics simulation, we explore the underlying mechanism of ethanol-induced disruption of a model coronavirus membrane and, in detail, interactions of the E-protein and lipids. We model the membrane bilayer as N-palmitoyl-sphingomyelin and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine lipids and the coronavirus E-protein. The study reveals that ethanol causes an increase in the lateral area of the bilayer along with thinning of the bilayer membrane and orientational disordering of lipid tails. Ethanol resides at the head–tail region of the membrane and enhances bilayer permeability. We found an envelope-protein-mediated increase in the ordering of lipid tails. Our simulations also provide important insights into the orientation of the envelope protein in a model membrane environment. At ∼25 mol.\% of ethanol in the surrounding ethanol–water phase, we observe disintegration of the lipid bilayer and dislocation of the E-protein from the membrane environment.},

We find that an alteration in the relative dominance of self-regulation, chiral inhibition, and achiral decay processes breaks the chiral symmetry of the system, which is either partial or complete. This results in four different asymmetric population states, viz., three-isomer coexistence, enantiomeric coexistence, chiral–achiral coexistence, and homochiral state. A change in the reaction condition induces nonequilibrium transition among these states. We also report that a fast stochastic self-regulation and a slow chiral inhibition and achiral decay process along with a threshold population of interacting neighbors suffice for the requisite for transition toward a completely symmetry broken state, i.e., homochirality.},

  abstract = {We study the elastic response of rigid wire frame particles in concentrated glassy suspensions to a step strain by applying the simple geometric methods developed in Paper I. The wire frame particles are comprised of thin rigid rods of length L , and their number density, ρ , is such that ρL 3 ≫ 1. We specifically compare rigid rods to L-shapes made of two equal length rods joined at right angles. The behavior of wire frames is found to be strikingly different from that of rods. The linear elasticity scales like ρ 3 L 6 for L-shaped particles, whereas it scales proportional to ρ for rods and the non-linear response shows a transition from shear hardening to shear softening at a critical density ρ c ∼ K / k B T L 6 ⁠ , where K is the bending modulus of the particles. For realistic particles made of double stranded DNA, this transition occurs at densities of about ρL 3 ∼ 10. The reason for these differences is that wire frames can be forced to bend by the entanglements with their surroundings, whereas rods always remain straight. This is found to be very important even for small strains, with most particles being bent above a critical strain γ c ∼ ρ L 3 − 1 ⁠ .},

We specifically compare straight rod-like particles to bent and branched wire frames. In dense suspensions, the wire frames are frozen in a disordered state by the topological entanglements between their arms. We present a simple, geometric method to find the scaling of the elastic stress with concentration in these glassy systems. We apply this method to a simple 2D model system where a test particle is placed on a plane and constrained by a random distribution of points with number density ν . Two striking differences between wire frame and rod suspensions are found: (1) The linear elasticity per particle for wire frames is very large, scaling like ν 2 L 4 , whereas for rods, it is much smaller and independent of concentration. (2) Rods always shear thin but wire frames shear harden for concentrations less than ∼ K / k B T L 4 ⁠ , where K is the bending modulus of the particles. The deformation of wire frames is found to be important even for small strains, with the proportion of deformed particles at a particular strain, γ , being given by ( ν L 2 ) 2 γ 2 ⁠ .

Our special focus will be on the states where the colloids arrange in thin strands that span the whole system and that we will refer to as dilute gel networks. These states occur at low packing fractions for attractions that are stronger than those at both the binodal line of the equilibrium gas–liquid phase separation and the directed percolation transition line. By using Brownian dynamics simulations, we explore the formation, structure, and aging dynamics of dilute gel networks. The essential connections in a dilute gel network are determined by constructing reduced networks. We compare the observed properties to those of clumpy gels or cluster fluids. Our results demonstrate that both the structure and the (often slow) dynamics of the stable or meta-stable heterogeneous states in colloid–polymer mixtures possess distinct features on various length and time scales and thus are richly diverse.},

Our investigation shows that the NPs exhibit a sequence of three modes of adhesion. For low adhesive interactions, the adhering NPs are apart from each other. As the adhesive interaction is increased, the NPs dimerize into in-plane dimers. As the adhesive interaction is further increased for relatively large vesicles, the NPs dimerize into tubular dimers. However, for small vesicles, the tubular dimer state is not observed. For higher values of the adhesive interaction, four endocytosis modes are observed, depending on the initial locations of the NPs on the vesicle and the relative size of the NPs with respect to that of the vesicle. For relatively large vesicles, the NPs are endocytosed individually or as a dimer. For relatively small vesicles, only one NP is endocytosed if the initial distance between the NPs is large, while the second NP remains adhered to the outer leaflet of the vesicle. However, if the initial distance between the NPs is small, one NP is endocytosed, while the other is internalized in the vesicle through a pore.},

Despite the absence of explicit interactions among the velocities or the active forces of different particles, the system displays a transition from a disordered and stuck state to an ordered state of global collective motion where the particles rotate persistently clockwise or anticlockwise. We describe this behavior by introducing a suitable order parameter, the velocity polarization, measuring the global alignment of the particles’ velocities along the tangential direction of the ring. We also measure the spatial velocity correlation function and its correlation length to characterize the two states. In the rotating phase, the velocity correlation displays an algebraic decay that is analytically predicted together with its correlation length, while in the stuck regime, the velocity correlation decays exponentially with a correlation length that increases with the persistence time. In the first case, the correlation (and, in particular, its correlation length) does not depend on the active force but the system size only. The global collective motion, an effect caused by the interplay between finite-size, periodicity, and persistent active forces, disappears as the size of the ring becomes infinite, suggesting that this phenomenon does not correspond to a phase transition in the usual thermodynamic sense.},

  abstract = {Cancer remains hard to treat, partially due to the non-specificity of chemotherapeutics. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising carriers for targeted chemotherapy, yet, to date, there have been few detailed studies to systematically enhance drug loading while maintaining controlled release. In this work, we investigate which molecular simulation methods best capture the experimental uptake and release of cisplatin from UiO-66 and UiO-66(NH 2 ). We then screen a series of biocompatible, pH-sensitive zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) for their ability to retain cisplatin in healthy parts of the patient and release it in the vicinity of a tumor. Pure-component GCMC simulations show that the maximum cisplatin loading depends on the pore volume. To achieve this maximum loading in the presence of water, either the pore size needs to be large enough to occupy both cisplatin and its solvation shell or the MOF–cisplatin interaction must be more favorable than the cisplatin–shell interaction. Both solvated and non-solvated simulations show that cisplatin release rates can be controlled by either decreasing the pore limiting diameters or by manipulating framework–cisplatin interaction energies to create strong, dispersed adsorption sites. The latter method is preferable if cisplatin loading is performed from solution into a pre-synthesized framework as weak interaction energies and small pore window diameters will hinder cisplatin uptake. Here, ZIF-82 is most promising. If it is possible to load cisplatin during crystallization, ZIF-11 would outcompete the other MOFs screened as cisplatin cannot pass through its pore windows; therefore, release rates would be purely driven by the pH triggered framework degradation.},

  abstract = {High-harmonic generation (HHG) from the condensed matter phase holds promise to promote future cutting-edge research in the emerging field of attosecond nanoscopy. The key for the progress of the field relies on the capability of the existing schemes to enhance the harmonic yield and to push the photon energy cutoff to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV, 10–100 eV) regime and beyond toward the spectral “water window” region (282–533 eV). Here, we demonstrate a coherent control scheme of HHG, which we show to give rise to quantum modulations in the XUV region. These modulations are shown to be caused by quantum-path interferences and are found to exhibit a strong sensitivity to the delocalized character of bulk states of the material. The control scheme is based on exploring surface states in transition-metal surfaces and, specifically, tuning the electronic structure of the metal surface itself together with the use of optimal chirped pulses. Moreover, we show that the use of such pulses having moderate intensities permits us to push the harmonic cutoff further to the spectral water window region and that the extension is found to be robust against the change in the intrinsic properties of the material. The scenario is numerically implemented using a minimal model by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the metal surface Cu(111) initially prepared in the surface state. Our findings elucidate the importance of metal surfaces for generating coherent isolated attosecond XUV and soft-x-ray pulses and for designing compact solid-state HHG devices.},

It is shown that angular polarization patterns of the far-field second harmonic response abide to threefold symmetry constraints on tensors. When a molecular layer is added to the system and its parameters are adjusted to achieve the strong coupling regime between a localized plasmon mode and molecular excitons, Rabi splitting is observed from the occurrence of both single- and two-photon transition peaks within the SHG power spectrum. It is argued that the splitting observed for both transitions results from direct two-photon transitions between lower and upper polaritonic states of the strongly coupled system. This interpretation can be accounted by a tailored three-level quantum model, with results in agreement with the unbiased numerical approach. Our results suggest that the hybrid states formed in strongly coupled systems directly contribute to the nonlinear dynamics. This opens new directions in designing THz sources and nonlinear frequency converters.},

The overall relationship between these structures and configurational sampling schemes, however, remains largely uncharted. Here, the disordered microphases of a schematic SALR model are thoroughly characterized, and structural relaxation functions adapted to each regime are devised. The sampling efficiency of various advanced Monte Carlo sampling schemes—Virtual-Move (VMMC), Aggregation-Volume-Bias (AVBMC), and Event-Chain (ECMC)—is then assessed. A combination of VMMC and AVBMC is found to be computationally most efficient for cluster fluids and ECMC to become relatively more efficient as density increases.

In a first of its kind, a hydrophobic DES composed of a 1:1 mixture of oleic acid and lidocaine was recently reported, possessing a lower critical solution temperature in water. The thermoreversible phase property of this DES–water system was utilized to sequester out dye molecules from their aqueous solutions. In this article, we explore the phase separation phenomena for this particular DES in its aqueous solution using an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. A 50 wt.\% solution of the DES in water was studied at three different temperatures (253, 293, and 313 K) to understand the various molecular interactions that dictate the phase segregation property of these systems. In this work, we have elaborated on the importance of hydrogen bonding interactions and the non-bonding interactions between the components and the competition between the two that leads to phase separation. Overall, we observe that the increase in unfavorable interaction between the DES components and water with increasing temperature determines the phase separation behavior. We have also studied the modification in the dynamical properties of water molecules close to the phase boundary. Such molecular insights would be beneficial for designing novel solvent systems that can be used as extraction-based media in industries.},

Indeed, deformations of the Compton profiles are observed when varying hydration, and two different bonding kinds are associated with the water molecules: at low hydration, water surrounds the sulfonic groups, while on increasing hydration, water molecules occupy the interstitial cavities formed upon swelling of the membrane. The analysis is proposed in terms of averaged OH bond length variation. A sizable contraction of the OH distance is observed at low hydration (∼0.09 Å), while at higher hydration levels, the contraction is smaller (∼0.02 Å) and the OH bond length is closer to bulk water. An evaluation of the electron kinetic energy indicates that the spatial changes associated with the water distribution correspond to a consistent binding energy increase. Distinct temperature dependences of each water population are observed, which can be straightly related to water desorption into ice on cooling below the freezing point.},

  abstract = {Treating water as a linearly responding dielectric continuum on molecular length scales allows very simple estimates of the solvation structure and thermodynamics for charged and polar solutes. While this approach can successfully account for basic length and energy scales of ion solvation, computer simulations indicate not only its quantitative inaccuracies but also its inability to capture some basic and important aspects of microscopic polarization response. Here, we consider one such shortcoming, a failure to distinguish the solvation thermodynamics of cations from that of otherwise-identical anions, and we pursue a simple, physically inspired modification of the dielectric continuum model to address it. The adaptation is motivated by analyzing the orientational response of an isolated water molecule whose dipole is rigidly constrained. Its free energy suggests a Hamiltonian for dipole fluctuations that accounts implicitly for the influence of higher-order multipole moments while respecting constraints of molecular geometry. We propose a field theory with the suggested form, whose nonlinear response breaks the charge symmetry of ion solvation. An approximate variational solution of this theory, with a single adjustable parameter, yields solvation free energies that agree closely with simulation results over a considerable range of solute size and charge.},

Although the crystalline phase melts at 36–38 °C depending on the heating rate, ChAc:U can be easily supercooled at sub-ambient conditions, thus maintaining at the liquid state, with a glass–liquid transition at about −50 °C. Synchrotron high energy x-ray scattering experiments provide the experimental data for supporting a reverse Monte Carlo analysis to extract structural information at the atomistic level. This exploration of the liquid structure of ChAc:U reveals the major role played by hydrogen bonding in determining interspecies correlations: both acetate and urea are strong hydrogen bond acceptor sites, while both choline hydroxyl and urea act as HB donors. All ChAc:U moieties are involved in mutual interactions, with acetate and urea strongly interacting through hydrogen bonding, while choline being mostly involved in van der Waals mediated interactions. Such a structural situation is mirrored by the dynamic evidences obtained by means of 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, which show how urea and acetate species experience higher translational activation energy than choline, fingerprinting their stronger commitments into the extended hydrogen bonding network established in ChAc:U.},

  abstract = {For the first time, the terahertz transmittance spectra of l -alanine have been measured using a single crystal. Measurements were obtained over a large temperature range (12–300 K) and revealed 18 absorptions between 20 and 250 cm −1 . These modes were sharp and symmetric, a feature of single crystals and low temperatures. The spectra were directly compared to those of a powdered pellet sample. Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction were used to confirm the sample’s structure and purity. With increasing temperature, all modes exhibit spectral redshift, well described by a Bose–Einstein model, indicating the phonon origin of the absorptions. The exceptions are the 91 and 128 cm −1 modes. The former blueshifts. The latter initially blueshifts but transitions to redshifting. Both behaviors are anomalous. Density-functional theory modeling helped assign all the observed modes.},

  abstract = {The rotational spectrum of thiophene ( c -C 4 H 4 S) has been collected between 8 and 360 GHz. Samples of varying deuterium-enrichment were synthesized to yield all possible deuterium-substituted isotopologues of thiophene. A total of 26 isotopologues have been measured and least-squares fit using A- and S-reduced distorted-rotor Hamiltonians in the I r representation. The resultant rotational constants ( A 0 , B 0 , and C 0 ) from each reduction were converted to determinable constants ( A ″, B ″, and C ″) to remove the impact of centrifugal distortion. The computed vibrational and electron mass corrections [CCSD(T)/cc-pCVTZ] were applied to the determinable constants to obtain semi-experimental equilibrium rotational constants ( A e , B e , and C e ) for 24 isotopologues. A precise semi-experimental equilibrium ( r e SE ) structure has been achieved from a least-squares fit of the equilibrium moments of inertia. The combination of the expanded isotopologue rotational data with high-level computational work establishes a precise r e SE structure for this sulfur-containing heterocycle. The CCSD(T)/cc-pCV5Z structure has been obtained and corrected for the extrapolation to the complete basis set, electron correlation beyond CCSD(T), relativistic effects, and the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction. The precise r e SE structure is compared to the resulting “best theoretical estimate” structure. Several of the best theoretical r e structural parameters fall within the narrow statistical limits (2σ) of the r e SE results. The possible origin of the discrepancies for the computed parameters that fall outside the statistical uncertainties is discussed.},

The Au–S framework structures of 20 quasi-fcc gold clusters had been determined from the Au 2 S network. Based on the Au 2 S network, some new quasi-fcc clusters, such as 8 e − clusters Au 24 (SR) 16 , Au 26 (SR) 18 , Au 26 (SR) 19 − , Au 29 (SR) 21 , Au 30 (SR) 22 , and Au 32 (SR) 24 , and a class of Au 24+8n (SR) 20+4n (n = 1, 2, 3, …) clusters were predicted. Furthermore, by studying the evolution of Au–S frameworks, it was possible to construct molecular-like reaction equations to account for the formation mechanism of quasi-fcc gold clusters, which indicated that the formation of quasi-fcc gold clusters can be understood from the stepwise 2 e − -reduction cluster growth pathways. The present studies showed that the Au 2 S network model provided a “parental” Au–S network for exploring the structural evolution of the quasi-fcc Au n (SR) m clusters. Moreover, it was possible to study the formation pathways of the Au n (SR) m clusters by studying the evolution of their Au–S frameworks.},

  abstract = {The high cost of density functional theory (DFT) has hitherto limited the ab initio prediction of the equation of state (EOS). In this article, we employ a combination of large scale computing, advanced simulation techniques, and smart data science strategies to provide an unprecedented ab initio performance analysis of the high explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Comparison to both experiment and thermochemical predictions reveals important quantitative limitations of DFT for EOS prediction and thus the assessment of high explosives. In particular, we find that DFT predicts the energy of PETN detonation products to be systematically too high relative to the unreacted neat crystalline material, resulting in an underprediction of the detonation velocity, pressure, and temperature at the Chapman–Jouguet state. The energetic bias can be partially accounted for by high-level electronic structure calculations of the product molecules. We also demonstrate a modeling strategy for mapping chemical composition across a wide parameter space with limited numerical data, the results of which suggest additional molecular species to consider in thermochemical modeling.},

The dependence of the ionic fragments on phase distinguishes between two dissociation channels, while a quantity that is proportional to the directionality of the ejected fragments, called asymmetry parameter (β), is measured as a function of composite field’s phase. The dependence of the two channels’ asymmetry amplitude (β 0 ) on the experimental parameters that characterize the composite field (wavelength, anisotropic shape, and total intensity) is found to differ significantly. The channel leading to H 2 + and O + ions’ ejection shows increased asymmetry compared to the other channel and is found to be dependent on excitation of overtones and combinations of vibrational modes as well as from the field’s shape and intensity. The asymmetry (β) of the channel leading to the release of a H + and an OH + ions is far less sensitive to the experimental parameters. Inspection of the individual OH + peak’s dependence on phase reveals information on the effect of the field’s profile, which is unclear when asymmetry (β) is inspected.},

  abstract = {A path integral ground state (PIGS) approach for the simulation of asymmetric top rotors is presented. The method is based on Monte Carlo sampling of angular degrees of freedom. A symmetry-adapted rotational density matrix is used to account for nuclear spin statistics. To illustrate the method, ground-state properties of collections of para -water molecules confined to a one-dimensional lattice are computed. Those include energetic and structural observables. An advantage of the PIGS method is that expectation values can be obtained directly since the square of the wavefunction is sampled during a simulation. To benchmark the method, ground state energies and orientational distributions are computed using exact diagonalization for a single para -water molecule in an external field using a finite basis of symmetric top eigenfunctions. Benchmark results are also provided for N = 2 para -water molecules pinned to lattice sites at various distances to sample the crossover from hydrogen bonding to the dipole–dipole interaction regime. Excellent agreement between the PIGS results and the finite basis set calculations is observed. A thorough analysis of the convergence in terms of the imaginary time propagation length and systematic Trotter error is performed. The PIGS approach is then applied to a chain of N = 11 water molecules, and an equation of state is constructed in terms of the intermolecular separation. Ordering effects are also studied, and a transition between hydrogen bonding to dipole–dipole alignment is observed. The method is scalable and can also be applied in higher dimensions.},

The 6 s , 5 d , and 6 p orbitals of lutetium, along with the valence 2 p and 3 p orbitals of fluorine, were included in the active space, allowing for the accurate description of static and dynamic correlation. The Lu( 4 F) + F( 2 P) channel has intersystem spin crossings with the Lu( 2 P) + F( 2 P) and Lu( 2 D) + F( 2 P) channels, which are discussed herein. To obtain spectroscopic constants, bond lengths, and excited states, multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) was used at a quadruple-ζ basis set level, correlating also the 4 f electrons and corresponding orbitals. Core spin–orbit (C-MRCI) calculations were performed, revealing that 1 3 Π 0− is the first excited state closely followed by 1 3 Π 0+ . In addition, the dissociation energy of LuF was determined at different levels of theory, with a range of basis sets. A balance between core correlation and a relativistic treatment of electrons is fundamental to obtain an accurate description of the dissociation energy. The best prediction was obtained with a combination of coupled-cluster single, double, and perturbative triple excitations /Douglas–Kroll–Hess third order Hamiltonian methods at a complete basis set level with a zero-point energy correction, which yields a dissociation value of 170.4 kcal mol −1 .

The AIMS method was used to carry out non-adiabatic dynamic simulations with the ab initio calculation performed at the SA-2-CAS(8,7)/6-31G* level. Upon irradiation to the S 1 state, CF 3 COCl first relaxes to S 1 minimum and then overcomes the ∼10 kcal/mol (TS S1_CCl ) or ∼30 kcal/mol (TS S1_CO ) barrier to the conical intersection region CI-1 or CI-3 (minor), with the S 1 → S 0 transition probability of 63:1. After non-adiabatic transition to the S 0 state through CI-1, trajectories mainly distribute to three different reaction pathways, with one going back to S 0 minimum through shortening of the C–Cl bond, the other forming CF 3 CO and Cl radicals by continuous elongation of the C–Cl distance, and another dissociating into CF 3 + CO + Cl and running into the CI-3 region through elongation of C–C and C–Cl distances. Moreover, we found that the trajectories would recross to the S 1 state with the recrossing probability of 13.9\% through the CI-3 region due to the extremely sloped topographic character of CI-3. On the basis of time evolution of wavefunctions simulated here, the product ratio of CF 3 + CO + Cl and CF 3 CO + Cl is 53.5\%:18.4\%, which is consistent with the experimental value of 3:1. We further explain the photo-dissociation wavelength dependence of CF 3 COCl, and the product ratio of CF 3 + CO + Cl increases with the increase in total energy.},

The green emission is strong and prompt with ϕ = 18\% and τ = 1.25 ns, and the near-infrared luminescence is weaker, slower with τ = 50 µ s, and is partly quenched by oxygen, suggesting phosphorescence. This lifetime can be modulated by the DNA host, and we consider two derivatives of C 4 AC 4 TC 3 G with similar sequences but distinct structures. In one variant, thymine was excised to create an abasic gap in an otherwise intact strand. In the other, the covalent phosphate linkage was removed to split the DNA scaffold into two fragments. In relation to the contiguous strands, the broken template speeds the luminescence decay by twofold, and this difference may be due to greater DNA flexibility.

Theoretical calculations based on the frozen-core Hartree–Fock approximation and Franck–Condon simulations were carried out to cross-verify the measured PICS. The results show that the photoionization cross sections of benzonitrile and cyanotoluene isomers are similar. The generalized charge decomposition analysis was used to investigate the components of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and HOMO-1. It was found that the HOMO and HOMO-1 of benzonitrile and cyanotoluene isomers are dominated by the features of the benzene ring, indicating that the substitution of CN and methyl has a minor influence on the PICS of the studied molecules. The reported PICS on benzonitrile and cyanotoluene isomers in the present work could contribute to the near-threshold PIMS experiments and determine the ionization and dissociation rates in interstellar space for these crucial species. The theoretical analysis on characteristics of molecular orbitals provides clues to estimating the PICS of similar substituted aromatic compounds.},

  abstract = {Entangled photon spectroscopy is a nascent field that has important implications for measurement and imaging across chemical, biology, and materials fields. Entangled photon spectroscopy potentially offers improved spatial and temporal-frequency resolutions, increased cross sections for multiphoton and nonlinear measurements, and new abilities in inducing or measuring quantum correlations. A critical step in enabling entangled photon spectroscopies is the creation of high-flux entangled sources that can use conventional detectors as well as provide redundancy for the losses in realistic samples. Here, we report a periodically poled, chirped, lithium tantalate platform that generates entangled photon pairs with ∼10 −7 efficiency. For a near watt level diode laser, this results in a near μ W-level flux. The single photon per mode limit that is necessary to maintain non-classical photon behavior is still satisfied by distributing this power over up to an octave-spanning bandwidth. The spectral–temporal photon correlations are observed via a Michelson-type interferometer that measures the broadband Hong–Ou–Mandel two-photon interference. A coherence time of 245 fs for a 10 nm bandwidth in the collinear case and a coherence time of 62 fs for a 125 nm bandwidth in the non-collinear case are measured using a CW pump laser and, essentially, collecting the full photon cone. We outline in detail the numerical methods used for designing and tailoring the entangled photons source, such as changing center wavelength or bandwidth, with the ultimate aim of increasing the availability of high-flux UV–Vis entangled photon sources in the optical spectroscopy community.},

  abstract = {Drug efficacy depends on its capacity to permeate across the cell membrane. We consider the prediction of passive drug–membrane permeability coefficients. Beyond the widely recognized correlation with hydrophobicity, we additionally consider the functional relationship between passive permeation and acidity. To discover easily interpretable equations that explain the data well, we use the recently proposed sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO), an artificial-intelligence technique that combines symbolic regression with compressed sensing. Our study is based on a large in silico dataset of 0.4 × 10 6 small molecules extracted from coarse-grained simulations. We rationalize the equation suggested by SISSO via an analysis of the inhomogeneous solubility–diffusion model in several asymptotic acidity regimes. We further extend our analysis to the dependence on lipid-membrane composition. Lipid-tail unsaturation plays a key role but surprisingly contributes stepwise rather than proportionally. Our results are in line with previously observed changes in permeability, suggesting the distinction between liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered permeation. Together, compressed sensing with analytically derived asymptotes establish and validate an accurate, broadly applicable, and interpretable equation for passive permeability across both drug and lipid-tail chemistry.},

  abstract = {The reactivity of gold has been investigated for a long time. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of relativistic effects over the chemical kinetic properties of elementary reactions associated with methane activation by gold(I) cations, CH 4 + Au + ↔ AuCH 2 + + H 2 . The global reaction is modeled as a two-step process, CH 4 + Au + ↔ HAuCH 3 + ↔ AuCH 2 + + H 2 . Moreover, the barrierless dissociation of the initial adduct between reactants, AuCH 4 + , is discussed as well. Higher-order relativistic treatments are used to provide corrections beyond the commonly considered scalar effects of relativistic effective core potentials (RECPs). Although the scalar relativistic contributions predominate, lowering the forward barrier heights by 48.4 and 36.1 kcal mol −1 , the spin–orbit coupling effect can still provide additional reductions of these forward barrier heights by as much as 9\% (1.0 and 2.2 kcal mol −1 ). The global reaction proceeds rapidly at low temperatures to the intermediate attained after the first hydrogen transfer, HAuCH 3 + . The relativistic corrections beyond the ones from RECPs are still able to double the rate constant of the CH 4 + Au + → HAuCH 3 + process at 300 K, while the reverse reaction becomes five times slower. The formation of global products from this intermediate only becomes significant at much higher temperatures (∼1500 K upward). The scalar relativistic contributions decrease the dissociation energy of the initial adduct, AuCH 4 + , into the global products by 105.8 kcal mol −1 , while the spin–orbit effect provides an extra lowering of 1.8 kcal mol −1 .},

In this work, we reformulate the ADAPT-VQE with reduced density matrices (RDMs) to avoid additional measurement overhead. With Valdemoro’s reconstruction of the three-electron RDM, we present a revised ADAPT-VQE algorithm, termed ADAPT-V, without any additional measurements but at the cost of increasing variational parameters compared to the ADAPT-VQE. Furthermore, we present an ADAPT-Vx algorithm by prescreening the anti-Hermitian operator pool with this RDM-based scheme. ADAPT-Vx requires almost the same variational parameters as ADAPT-VQE but a significantly reduced number of gradient evaluations. Numerical benchmark calculations for small molecules demonstrate that ADAPT-V and ADAPT-Vx provide an accurate description of the ground- and excited-state potential energy curves. In addition, to minimize the quantum resource demand, we generalize this RDM-based scheme to circuit-efficient IQEB-VQE algorithm and achieve significant measurement reduction.},

The third-order response function formalism predicts a signal that grows linearly with the field strength of each laser pulse, thus lacking a way of accounting for non-trivial intensity-dependent effects, such as saturation and finite bleaching. An analytical expression to describe the orientational part of the molecular response, which, in the weak-field limit, becomes equivalent to a four-point correlation function, is presented. Such an expression is evaluated for Liouville-space pathways accounting for diagonal and cross peaks for all-parallel and cross-polarized pulse sequences, in both the weak- and strong-field conditions, via truncation of a Taylor series expansion at different orders. The results obtained in the strong-field conditions suggest how a careful analysis of two-dimensional spectroscopic experimental data should include laser pulse intensity considerations when determining molecular internal coordinates.},

  abstract = {Nuclear quantum effects are important in a variety of chemical and biological processes. The constrained nuclear–electronic orbital density functional theory (cNEO-DFT) has been developed to include nuclear quantum effects in energy surfaces. Herein, we develop the analytic Hessian for cNEO-DFT energy with respect to the change in nuclear (expectation) positions, which can be used to characterize stationary points on energy surfaces and compute molecular vibrational frequencies. This is achieved by constructing and solving the multicomponent cNEO coupled-perturbed Kohn–Sham (cNEO-CPKS) equations, which describe the response of electronic and nuclear orbitals to the displacement of nuclear (expectation) positions. With the analytic Hessian, the vibrational frequencies of a series of small molecules are calculated and compared to those from conventional DFT Hessian calculations as well as those from the vibrational second-order perturbation theory (VPT2). It is found that even with a harmonic treatment, cNEO-DFT significantly outperforms DFT and is comparable to DFT-VPT2 in the description of vibrational frequencies in regular polyatomic molecules. Furthermore, cNEO-DFT can reasonably describe the proton transfer modes in systems with a shared proton, whereas DFT-VPT2 often faces great challenges. Our results suggest the importance of nuclear quantum effects in molecular vibrations, and cNEO-DFT is an accurate and inexpensive method to describe molecular vibrations.},

  abstract = {The energies of molecular excited states arise as solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equation and are often compared to experiment. At the same time, nuclear quantum motion is known to be important and to induce a redshift of excited state energies. However, it is thus far unclear whether incorporating nuclear quantum motion in molecular excited state calculations leads to a systematic improvement of their predictive accuracy, making further investigation necessary. Here, we present such an investigation by employing two first-principles methods for capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations on excited state energies, which we apply to the Thiel set of organic molecules. We show that accounting for zero-point motion leads to much improved agreement with experiment, compared to “static” calculations that only account for electronic effects, and the magnitude of the redshift can become as large as 1.36 eV. Moreover, we show that the effect of nuclear quantum motion on excited state energies largely depends on the molecular size, with smaller molecules exhibiting larger redshifts. Our methodology also makes it possible to analyze the contribution of individual vibrational normal modes to the redshift of excited state energies, and in several molecules, we identify a limited number of modes dominating this effect. Overall, our study provides a foundation for systematically quantifying the shift of excited state energies due to nuclear quantum motion and for understanding this effect at a microscopic level.},

Part of its simplicity arises from using only two types of empirically fit physics-motivated parameters: the first describes the orbital energies on each atom and the second describes electronic interactions and bonding between atoms. By replacing these empirical parameters with machine-learned dynamic values, we vastly increase the accuracy of the extended Hückel model. The dynamic values are generated with a deep neural network, which is trained to reproduce orbital energies and densities derived from density functional theory. The resulting model retains interpretability, while the deep neural network parameterization is smooth and accurate and reproduces insightful features of the original empirical parameterization. Overall, this work shows the promise of utilizing machine learning to formulate simple, accurate, and dynamically parameterized physics models.},

  abstract = {Nuclear long-lived spin states represent spin density operator configurations that are exceptionally well protected against spin relaxation phenomena. Their long-lived character is exploited in a variety of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques. Despite the growing importance of long-lived spin states in modern NMR, strategies for their identification have changed little over the last decade. The standard approach heavily relies on a chain of group theoretical arguments. In this paper, we present a more streamlined method for the calculation of such configurations. Instead of focusing on the symmetry properties of the relaxation superoperator, we focus on its corresponding relaxation algebra. This enables us to analyze long-lived spin states with Lie algebraic methods rather than group theoretical arguments. We show that the centralizer of the relaxation algebra forms a basis for the set of long-lived spin states. The characterization of the centralizer, on the other hand, does not rely on any special symmetry arguments, and its calculation is straightforward. We outline a basic algorithm and illustrate advantages by considering long-lived spin states for some spin-1/2 pairs and rapidly rotating methyl groups.},

Our approach is based on a Helmholtz free-energy functional that is consistent with the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state. This allows for a coarse-grained description of the solvent based on an inhomogeneous density of PC-SAFT segments. The solute, on the other hand, is described in full detail by atomistic Lennard-Jones interaction sites. The approach is entirely predictive as it only takes the PC-SAFT parameters of the solvent and the force-field parameters of the solute as input. No adjustable parameters or empirical corrections are involved. The framework is applied to study self-solvation of n -alkanes and to the calculation of residual chemical potentials in binary solvent mixtures. Our DFT approach accurately predicts solvation free energies of small molecular solutes in three different non-polar solvents, namely n -hexane, cyclohexane, and benzene. Additionally, we show that the calculated solvation free energies agree well with those obtained by molecular dynamics simulations and with the residual chemical potential calculated by the bulk PC-SAFT equation of state. We observe higher deviations for the solvation free energy of systems with significant solute–solvent Coulomb interactions.},

  abstract = {The theoretical framework for reorientation-induced spectral diffusion (RISD) describes the polarization dependence of spectral diffusion dynamics as measured with two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy and related techniques. Generally, RISD relates to the orientational dynamics of the molecular chromophore relative to local electric fields of the medium. The predictions of RISD have been shown to be very sensitive to both restricted orientational dynamics (generally arising from steric hindrance) and the distribution of local electric fields relative to the probe (electrostatic ordering). Here, a theory that combines the two effects is developed analytically and supported with numerical calculations. The combined effects can smoothly vary the polarization dependence of spectral diffusion from the purely steric case (least polarization dependence) to the purely electrostatic case (greatest polarization dependence). Analytic approximations of the modified RISD equations were also developed using the orientational dynamics of the molecular probe and two order parameters describing the degree of electrostatic ordering. It was found that frequency-dependent orientational dynamics are a possible consequence of the combined electrostatic and steric effects, providing a test for the applicability of this model to experimental systems. The modified RISD equations were then used to successfully describe the anomalous polarization-dependent spectral diffusion seen in 2D infrared spectroscopy in a polystyrene oligomer system that exhibits frequency-dependent orientational dynamics. The degree of polarization-dependent spectral diffusion enables the extent of electrostatic ordering in a chemical system to be quantified and distinguished from steric ordering.},

  abstract = {Pressure plays essential roles in chemistry by altering structures and controlling chemical reactions. The extreme-pressure polarizable continuum model (XP-PCM) is an emerging method with an efficient quantum mechanical description of small- and medium-sized molecules at high pressure (on the order of GPa). However, its application to large molecular systems was previously hampered by a CPU computation bottleneck: the Pauli repulsion potential unique to XP-PCM requires the evaluation of a large number of electric field integrals, resulting in significant computational overhead compared to the gas-phase or standard-pressure polarizable continuum model calculations. Here, we exploit advances in graphical processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the XP-PCM-integral evaluations. This enables high-pressure quantum chemistry simulation of proteins that used to be computationally intractable. We benchmarked the performance using 18 small proteins in aqueous solutions. Using a single GPU, our method evaluates the XP-PCM free energy of a protein with over 500 atoms and 4000 basis functions within half an hour. The time taken by the XP-PCM-integral evaluation is typically 1\% of the time taken for a gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) on the same system. The overall XP-PCM calculations require less computational effort than that for their gas-phase counterpart due to the improved convergence of self-consistent field iterations. Therefore, the description of the high-pressure effects with our GPU-accelerated XP-PCM is feasible for any molecule tractable for gas-phase DFT calculation. We have also validated the accuracy of our method on small molecules whose properties under high pressure are known from experiments or previous theoretical studies.},

  abstract = {The group contribution SAFT- γ Mie EoS is based on the statistical associating fluid theory for fused heteronuclear molecules. While the chain term of the model has been modified to account for the new functional group-specific parameters, it does not impose a bonding order to these functional groups, only considering intergroup interactions in the monomer reference fluid. This leaves the model unable to account for the different physical properties of structural isomers and implicitly introducing modeling bias to species where the molecular structure mimics those used in the parameter regression. In this work, a simple but physically meaningful modification to the chain term in SAFT- γ Mie is proposed that accounts for the number of intergroup bonds, thereby encoding structural information in the model, without introducing an additional regressed parameter. The resulting structural SAFT- γ Mie (s-SAFT- γ Mie) requires reparameterization of the group parameters, which we present for linear and branched alkanes (CH 3 , CH 2 , CH, and C groups) here. Following an identical parameterization procedure to the original model, validation showed that the modification actually improves prediction accuracy for linear alkanes while addressing the original inability of the framework to distinguish between structural isomers.

However, identification of a suitable determinant basis is complicated, in practice, by (i) exponential scaling of the determinant space from which a suitable basis must be extracted, (ii) possible linear dependencies in the determinant basis, and (iii) inconsistent behavior in the determinant basis, such as disappearing or coalescing solutions, as a result of external perturbations, such as geometry change. An approach that avoids the aforementioned issues is to allow for basis determinant optimization starting from an arbitrarily constructed initial determinant set. In this work, we derive the equations required for performing such an optimization, extending previous work by accounting for changes in the orthogonality level (defined as the dimension of the orbital overlap kernel between two determinants) as a result of orbital perturbations. The performance of the resulting wavefunction for studying avoided crossings and conical intersections where strong correlation plays an important role is examined.},

However, ZIFs are largely utilized as simple hosts or passive media for dispersing other catalytically active species, resembling the roles of zeolites in catalysis. In contrast, our recent findings show that ZIFs not only have broad absorption across the UV–visible and near IR spectral region but also have an exceptionally long-lived excited charge separated state, suggesting that ZIFs may be used as intrinsic light harvesting and photocatalytic materials rather than as inert hosts. This Perspective will focus on the recent progress on the fundamental studies of the intrinsic light absorption, charge separation, and photocatalytic properties of ZIFs and will discuss the outlook for future development.},

Fibril models were constructed using either a finite or an infinite number of layers made using periodic images. These studies yielded four conclusions. First, finite fibrils tend to unravel in a manner reminiscent of fibril dissolution, while infinite fibrils were more stable during simulations. Second, salt bridges in these fibrils remained stable in those fibrils that contained them initially, and those without salt bridges did not develop them over the time course of the simulations. Third, all fibrils tended to develop a “stagger” or register shift of β-strands along the fibril axis. Fourth and most importantly, the brain-seeded, 2M4J, infinite fibrils allowed bidirectional transport of water in and out of the central longitudinal core of the fibril by rapidly developing gaps at the fibril vertices. 2LMP fibrils also showed this behavior, although to a lesser extent. The diffusion of water molecules in the fibril core region involved two dynamical states: a localized state and directed diffusion in the presence of obstacles. These observations provided support for the hypothesis that Aβ fibrils could act as nanotubes. At least some Aβ oligomers resembled fibrils structurally in having parallel, in-register β-sheets and a sheet-turn-sheet motif. Thus, our findings could have implications for Aβ cytotoxicity, which may occur through the ability of oligomers to form abnormal water and ion channels in cell membranes.},

We compare the theoretical expectations with results from Monte Carlo simulations based on a simple hydrophobic/polar protein model. We consider both cubic systems with spherical droplets and elongated systems with slab-like droplets.

Au particles often form irregular aggregates in dispersions because of a strong van der Waals force acting between them. To prevent aggregation, we introduced negative electric charges on particle surfaces. By the addition of NaPAA, colloidal crystals were formed on the bottom of a sample cell because of the supply of Au particles by sedimentation and 2D diffusion even under very dilute conditions. Interparticle potential calculations demonstrated that the addition of NaPAA caused depletion attraction between the particles as well as a significant reduction in the interparticle repulsion because of the electrostatic screening effect. However, the electrostatic repulsion was strong enough to prevent the direct contact of particles in the excluded region between Au particles. Large-area crystals could be obtained by tilting the sample cell. By drying the sample, the Au particles came into contact and the non-space-filling crystals changed into closest packed crystals. These closest packed crystals exhibited a significant enhancement of Raman scattering intensity because of high hot-spot density.},

  abstract = {We present a phenomenological study of dynamical evolution of the active site in atomically dispersed catalysts in the presence of reaction intermediates associated with CO oxidation and low-temperature water–gas shift reaction. Using picosecond ab initio molecular dynamics, we probe the initiation of adsorbate-induced diffusion of atomically dispersed platinum on rutile TiO 2 (110). NVT trajectories spanning 5 ps at 500 K reveal that the dynamical stability of the metal atom is governed by its local coordination to the support and adsorbate. Adsorbates that bind the strongest to Pt typically also lead to the fastest diffusion of the metal atom, and all adsorbates weaken Pt-support interactions, resulting in higher diffusion coefficients compared to bare Pt. We note, however, the absence of quantitative correlations between adsorption characteristics (Pt Bader charge, adsorbate binding energy) and ensemble-averaged quantities (diffusion coefficients). A recurring structural motif identified in several trajectories is a near-linear coordination between support oxygen, Pt, and specific adsorbates. These geometries, on account of enhanced metal support interactions, stabilize Pt and inhibit migration over picosecond timescales. We also identify hydrogen bonding events between the adsorbate and support for OH-containing groups. In the case of OH-bound Pt, for instance, we believe that short-lived H-bonds between OH and support promote Pt migration in the beginning of the NVT trajectory, while the subsequent formation of a near-linear geometry stabilizes the Pt atom despite the continued formation of short-lived hydrogen bonds. These observations are consistent with prior studies that report stabilization of isolated metal atoms in the presence of hydroxyl groups.},

The PES on a beam of individual non-supported Ag–K nanoparticles created in this way allowed a direct absolute measurement of their WF , avoiding several usual shortcomings of the method. Experimentally, the WF has been found to be very sensitive to K concentration: Already at low exposure, it decreased down to ≈2 eV—below the value of pure K. In the jellium modeling, considered for Ag–K nanoparticles, two principally different adsorption patterns were tested: without and with K diffusion. The experimental and calculation results together suggest that only efficient surface alloying of two metals, whose immiscibility was long-term textbook knowledge, could lead to the observed WF values.},

  abstract = {Materials design from first principles enables exploration of uncharted chemical spaces. Extensive computational searches have been performed for mixed-cation ternary compounds, but mixed-anion systems are gaining increased interest as well. Central to computational discovery is the crystal structure prediction, where the trade-off between reliance on prototype structures and size limitations of unconstrained sampling has to be navigated. We approach this challenge by letting two complementary structure sampling approaches compete. We use the kinetically limited minimization approach for high-throughput unconstrained crystal structure prediction in smaller cells up to 21 atoms. On the other hand, ternary—and, more generally, multinary—systems often assume structures formed by atomic ordering on a lattice derived from a binary parent structure. Thus, we additionally sample atomic configurations on prototype lattices with cells up to 56 atoms. Using this approach, we searched 65 different charge-balanced oxide–nitride stoichiometries, including six known systems as the control sample. The convex hull analysis is performed both for the thermodynamic limit and for the case of synthesis with activated nitrogen sources. We identified 34 phases that are either on the convex hull or within a viable energy window for potentially metastable phases. We further performed structure sampling for “missing” binary nitrides whose energies are needed for the convex hull analysis. Among these, we discovered metastable Ce 3 N 4 as a nitride analog of the tetravalent cerium oxide, which becomes stable under slightly activated nitrogen condition Δ μ N &gt; +0.07 eV. Given the outsize role of CeO 2 in research and application, Ce 3 N 4 is a potentially important discovery.},

Using stochastic dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of applied voltage and diffusion constant on the growth of dendrites. We find that the diffusion constant is the most significant factor, and the inhomogeneity of the electric field does not play a significant role. The growth is most pronounced when the applied voltage and diffusion constant are both low. We observe a structural change from broccoli to cauliflower shape as the diffusion constant is increased. The simulations suggest that a control of electrolyte parameters that impact lithium diffusion might be an attractive route to controlling dendrite growth.},

These properties are used in the estimation of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecular and crystal structures. This process is slow at the quantum level of theory because it involves an iterative calculation of forces using quantum chemical codes such as density functional theory (DFT), which are computationally expensive and which limit the speed of the optimization algorithms. It would be highly advantageous to accelerate this process because then one could do either the same amount of work in less time or more work in the same time. In this work, we provide a neural network (NN) ensemble based active learning method to accelerate the local geometry optimization for multiple configurations simultaneously. We illustrate the acceleration on several case studies including bare metal surfaces, surfaces with adsorbates, and nudged elastic band for two reactions. In all cases, the accelerated method requires fewer DFT calculations than the standard method. In addition, we provide an Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)-optimizer Python package to make the usage of the NN ensemble active learning for geometry optimization easier.},

  abstract = {A single atom Ti–Cu(111) surface alloy can be generated by depositing small amounts of Ti onto Cu(111) at slightly elevated surface temperatures (∼500 to 600 K). Scanning tunneling microscopy shows that small Ti-rich islands covered by a Cu single layer form preferentially on ascending step edges of Cu(111) during Ti deposition below about 400 K but that a Ti–Cu(111) alloy replaces these small islands during deposition between 500 and 600 K, producing an alloy in the brims of the steps. Larger partially Cu-covered Ti-containing islands also form on the Cu(111) terraces at temperatures between 300 and 700 K. After surface exposure to CO at low temperatures, reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) reveals distinct C–O stretch bands at 2102 and 2050 cm −1 attributed to CO adsorbed on Cu-covered Ti-containing domains vs sites in the Ti–Cu(111) surface alloy. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) suggest that the lower frequency C–O stretch band originates specifically from CO adsorbed on isolated Ti atoms in the Ti–Cu(111) surface alloy and predicts a higher C–O stretch frequency for CO adsorbed on Cu above subsurface Ti ensembles. DFT further predicts that CO preferentially adsorbs in flat-lying configurations on contiguous Ti surface structures with more than one Ti atom and thus that CO adsorbed on such structures should not be observed with RAIRS. The ability to generate a single atom Ti–Cu(111) alloy will provide future opportunities to investigate the surface chemistry promoted by a representative early transition metal dopant on a Cu(111) host surface.},

In this work, we use a fully quantum mechanical method based on the hierarchical quantum master equation approach to analyze the dissociation mechanisms in molecular junctions. Considering a wide range of transport regimes, from off-resonant to resonant, non-adiabatic to adiabatic transport, and weak to strong vibronic coupling, our systematic study identifies three dissociation mechanisms. In the weak and intermediate vibronic coupling regime, the dominant dissociation mechanism is stepwise vibrational ladder climbing. For strong vibronic coupling, dissociation is induced via multi-quantum vibrational excitations triggered either by a single electronic transition at high bias voltages or by multiple electronic transitions at low biases. Furthermore, the influence of vibrational relaxation on the dissociation dynamics is analyzed and strategies for improving the stability of molecular junctions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Morphologies of adsorbed molecular films are of interest in a wide range of applications. To study the epitaxial growth of these systems in computer simulations requires access to long time and length scales, and one typically resorts to kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. However, KMC simulations require as input transition rates and their dependence on external parameters (such as temperature). Experimental data allow only limited and indirect access to these rates, and models are often oversimplified. Here, we follow a bottom-up approach and aim at systematically constructing all relevant rates for an example system that has shown interesting properties in experiments, buckminsterfullerene on a calcium fluoride substrate. We develop classical force fields (both atomistic and coarse-grained) and perform molecular dynamics simulations of the elementary transitions in order to derive explicit expressions for the transition rates with a minimal number of free parameters.},

  abstract = {We test the theoretical free energy surface (FES) for two-step nucleation (TSN) proposed by Iwamatsu [J. Chem. Phys. 134 , 164508 (2011)] by comparing the predictions of the theory to numerical results for the FES recently reported from Monte Carlo simulations of TSN in a simple lattice system [James et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 074501 (2019)]. No adjustable parameters are used to make this comparison. That is, all the parameters of the theory are evaluated directly for the model system, yielding a predicted FES, which we then compare to the FES obtained from simulations. We find that the theoretical FES successfully predicts the numerically evaluated FES over a range of thermodynamic conditions that spans distinct regimes of behavior associated with TSN. All the qualitative features of the FES are captured by the theory, and the quantitative comparison is also very good. Our results demonstrate that Iwamatsu’s extension of classical nucleation theory provides an excellent framework for understanding the thermodynamics of TSN.},

  abstract = {Proton Field-Cycling (FC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry is applied over a wide frequency and temperature range to get insight into the dynamic processes occurring in the plastically crystalline phase of the two isomers cyanocyclohexane (CNCH) and isocyanocyclohexane. The spin-lattice relaxation rate, R 1 ( ω ), is measured in the 0.01–30 MHz frequency range and transformed into the susceptibility representation χ N M R ″ ω = ω R 1 ω ⁠ . Three relaxation processes are identified, namely, a main (α-) relaxation, a fast secondary (β-) relaxation, and a slow relaxation; they are very similar for the two isomers. Exploiting frequency–temperature superposition, master curves of χ N M R ″ ω τ are constructed and analyzed for different processes. The α-relaxation displays a pronounced non-Lorentzian susceptibility with a temperature independent width parameter, and the correlation times display a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence—features indicating cooperative dynamics of the overall reorientation of the molecules. The β-relaxation shows high similarity with secondary relaxations in structural glasses. The extracted correlation times well agree with those reported by other techniques. A direct comparison of FC NMR and dielectric master curves for CNCH yields pronounced difference regarding the non-Lorentzian spectral shape as well as the relative relaxation strength of α- and β-relaxation. The correlation times of the slow relaxation follow an Arrhenius temperature dependence with a comparatively high activation energy. As the α-process involves liquid-like isotropic molecular reorientation, the slow process has to be attributed to vacancy diffusion, which modulates intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions, possibly accompanied by chair–chair interconversion of the cyclohexane ring. However, the low frequency relaxation features characteristic of vacancy diffusion cannot be detected due to experimental limitations.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy has become a very important tool for studying the structure and ultrafast dynamics in solution. In particular, it has been recently applied to investigate the molecular interactions and motions of lithium salts in organic carbonates. However, there has been a discrepancy in the molecular interpretation of the spectral features and dynamics derived from these spectroscopies. Hence, the mechanism behind spectral features appearing in the carbonyl stretching region was further investigated using linear and nonlinear spectroscopic tools and the co-solvent dilution strategy. Lithium perchlorate in a binary mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and tetrahydrofuran was used as part of the dilution strategy to identify the changes of the spectral features with the number of carbonates in the first solvation shell since both solvents have similar interaction energetics with the lithium ion. Experiments showed that more than one carbonate is always participating in the lithium ion solvation structures, even at the low concentration of DMC. Moreover, temperature-dependent study revealed that the exchange of the solvent molecules coordinating the lithium ion is not thermally accessible at room temperature. Furthermore, time-resolved IR experiments confirmed the presence of vibrationally coupled carbonyl stretches among coordinated DMC molecules and demonstrated that this process is significantly altered by limiting the number of carbonate molecules in the lithium ion solvation shell. Overall, the presented experimental findings strongly support the vibrational energy transfer as the mechanism behind the off-diagonal features appearing on the 2DIR spectra of solutions of lithium salt in organic carbonates.},

In classical nucleation theory, estimates of the ice nucleation rate are very sensitive to thermodynamic parameters, such as the chemical potential difference between water and ice Δ μ and the ice–water interfacial free energy γ . However, even today, there are still many contradictions and approximations when estimating these thermodynamic parameters, introducing a large uncertainty in any estimate of the ice nucleation rate. Starting from basic concepts for a general solid–liquid crystallization system, we expand the Gibbs–Thomson equation to second order and derive second-order analytical formulas for Δ μ , γ , and the nucleation barrier Δ G *, which are used in molecular dynamics simulations. These formulas describe well the temperature dependence of these thermodynamic parameters. This may be a new method of estimating Δ μ , γ , and Δ G *.},

In line with a perturbation theory, the parametric equations are formulated as the sum of a contribution due to a reference part of the intermolecular potential and a perturbation. Thereby, the equations provide a convenient (low-density) starting point for developing equation-of-state models of fluids or for developing similar approximations for the virial coefficient of (polymeric-)chain fluids. The choice of Barker and Henderson [J. Chem. Phys. 47 , 4714 (1967)] and Weeks, Chandler, and Andersen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 25 , 149 (1970); J. Chem. Phys. 54 , 5237 (1971); and Phys. Rev. A 4 , 1597 (1971)] for the reference part of the potential is considered. Our analytic approximations correctly recover the virial coefficient of the inverse-power potential of exponent m in the high-temperature limit and provide accurate estimates of the temperatures for which the virial coefficient equals zero or takes on its maximum value. Our description of the reference contribution to the second virial coefficient follows from an exact mapping onto the second virial coefficient of hard spheres; we propose a simple algebraic equation for the corresponding effective diameter of the hard spheres, which correctly recovers the low- and high-temperature scaling and limits of the reference fluid’s second virial coefficient.},

  abstract = {In this work, we examine hydrogen-bond (H-bond) switching by employing the Markov State Model (MSM). During the H-bond switching, a water hydrogen initially H-bonded with water oxygen becomes H-bonded to a different water oxygen. MSM analysis was applied to trajectories generated from molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P/2005 model from a room-temperature state to a supercooled state. We defined four basis states to characterize the configuration between two water molecules: H-bonded (“H”), unbound (“U”), weakly H-bonded (“w”), and alternative H-bonded (“a”) states. A 16 × 16 MSM matrix was constructed, describing the transition probability between states composed of three water molecules. The mean first-passage time of the H-bond switching was estimated by calculating the total flux from the HU to UH states. It is demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the mean first-passage time is in accordance with that of the H-bond lifetime determined from the H-bond correlation function. Furthermore, the flux for the H-bond switching is decomposed into individual pathways that are characterized by different forms of H-bond configurations of trimers. The dominant pathway of the H-bond switching is found to be a direct one without passing through such intermediate states as “w” and “a,” the existence of which becomes evident in supercooled water. The pathway through “w” indicates a large reorientation of the donor molecule. In contrast, the pathway through “a” utilizes the tetrahedral H-bond network, which is revealed by the further decomposition based on the H-bond number of the acceptor molecule.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments on laser-dissociation of aligned homonuclear diatomic molecules show an asymmetric forward–backward (spatial) electron-localization along the laser polarization axis. Most theoretical models attribute this asymmetry to interference effects between gerade and ungerade vibronic states. Presumably due to alignment, these models neglect molecular rotations and hence infer an asymmetric (post-dissociation) charge distribution over the two identical nuclei. In this paper, we question the equivalence that is made between spatial electron-localization, observed in experiments, and atomic electron-localization, alluded by these theoretical models. We show that (seeming) agreement between these models and experiments is due to an unfortunate omission of nuclear permutation symmetry, i.e., quantum statistics. Enforcement of the latter requires mandatory inclusion of the molecular rotational degree of freedom, even for perfectly aligned molecules. Unlike previous interpretations, we ascribe spatial electron-localization to the laser creation of a rovibronic wavepacket that involves field-free molecular eigenstates with opposite space-inversion symmetry i.e., even and odd parity. Space-inversion symmetry breaking would then lead to an asymmetric distribution of the (space-fixed) electronic density over the forward and backward hemisphere. However, owing to the simultaneous coexistence of two indistinguishable molecular orientational isomers, our analytical and computational results show that the post-dissociation electronic density along a specified space-fixed axis is equally shared between the two identical nuclei—a result that is in perfect accordance with the principle of the indistinguishability of identical particles.},

Gaseous CH 3 I molecules are excited to the A -band by a UV pump (277 nm, ∼20 fs) and probed by attosecond XUV pulses targeting iodine I(4 d ) core-to-valence transitions. Owing to the excellent temporal resolution of the technique, passage through a conical intersection is mapped through spectral signatures of nonadiabatic wave packet bifurcation observed to occur at 15 ± 4 fs following UV photoexcitation. The observed XUV signatures and time dynamics are in agreement with previous simulations [H. Wang, M. Odelius, and D. Prendergast, J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 124106 (2019)]. Due to the short duration of the UV pump pulse, coherent vibrational motion in the CH 3 I ground state along the C–I stretch mode (538 ± 7 cm −1 ) launched by resonant impulsive stimulated Raman scattering and dynamics in multiphoton excited states of CH 3 I are also detected.},

Here, we extend the branching and phase corrections to multilevel systems and combine them with both the traditional fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) and its variant global flux surface hopping (GFSH) algorithms. To get a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods, we construct a series of more challenging and diverse three-level and four-level scattering models and use exact quantum solutions as references. Encouragingly, both FSSH and GFSH with the branching and phase corrections produce excellent and nearly identical results in all investigated systems, indicating that the new surface hopping methods are robust to describe multilevel problems and the reliability is insensitive to the definition of self-consistent hopping probabilities in the adiabatic representation. Furthermore, the branching correction is found to be especially important when dealing with strongly repulsive potential energy surfaces, which are common in realistic systems, thus promising for general applications.},

For molecules interacting via Lennard-Jones potential, we have computed the formation free energy of a Stillinger i -mer [F. H. Stillinger, J. Chem.

It turns out that the size of a critical Stillinger i -mer remains finite and its formation free energy is on the order of k B T , and the size of a critical tWF i -mer remains finite and its formation free energy is even higher. This can be explained by Binder’s theory [K. Binder, Phys. Rev.

  abstract = {Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) has become an invaluable tool for studying the fundamental nature of non-covalent interactions by directly computing the electrostatics, exchange (steric) repulsion, induction (polarization), and London dispersion contributions to the interaction energy using quantum mechanics. Further application of SAPT is primarily limited by its computational expense, where even its most affordable variant (SAPT0) scales as the fifth power of system size [ O ( N 5 ) ] due to the dispersion terms. The algorithmic scaling of SAPT0 is reduced from O ( N 5 ) → O ( N 4 ) by replacing these terms with the empirical D3 dispersion correction of Grimme and co-workers, forming a method that may be termed SAPT0-D3. Here, we optimize the damping parameters for the -D3 terms in SAPT0-D3 using a much larger training set than has previously been considered, namely, 8299 interaction energies computed at the complete-basis-set limit of coupled cluster through perturbative triples [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Perhaps surprisingly, with only three fitted parameters, SAPT0-D3 improves on the accuracy of SAPT0, reducing mean absolute errors from 0.61 to 0.49 kcal mol −1 over the full set of complexes. Additionally, SAPT0-D3 exhibits a nearly 2.5× speedup over conventional SAPT0 for systems with ∼300 atoms and is applied here to systems with up to 459 atoms. Finally, we have also implemented a functional group partitioning of the approach (F-SAPT0-D3) and applied it to determine important contacts in the binding of salbutamol to G-protein coupled β 1 -adrenergic receptor in both active and inactive forms. SAPT0-D3 capabilities have been added to the open-source Psi4 software.},

Our approximation allows us to obtain a decoupled system for the light-excited matter and “dressed” light connected parametrically. With these equations at hand, we study how intense light as a quantum state is affected due to the back-action of the interacting matter.

  abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy allows practitioners to locate and track labeled molecules in biological systems. When extracting diffusion coefficients from the resulting trajectories, it is common practice to perform a linear fit on mean-squared-displacement curves. However, this strategy is suboptimal and prone to errors. Recently, it was shown that the increments between the observed positions provide a good estimate for the diffusion coefficient, and their statistics are well-suited for likelihood-based analysis methods. Here, we revisit the problem of extracting diffusion coefficients from single-particle tracking experiments subject to static noise and dynamic motion blur using the principle of maximum likelihood. Taking advantage of an efficient real-space formulation, we extend the model to mixtures of subpopulations differing in their diffusion coefficients, which we estimate with the help of the expectation–maximization algorithm. This formulation naturally leads to a probabilistic assignment of trajectories to subpopulations. We employ the theory to analyze experimental tracking data that cannot be explained with a single diffusion coefficient. We test how well a dataset conforms to the assumptions of a diffusion model and determine the optimal number of subpopulations with the help of a quality factor of known analytical distribution. To facilitate use by practitioners, we provide a fast open-source implementation of the theory for the efficient analysis of multiple trajectories in arbitrary dimensions simultaneously.},

This method is applied to the electron dynamics in Ne and Ar atoms exposed to an intense near-infrared laser pulse with various intensities. We benchmark our results against the TD complete-active-space self-consistent field (TD-CASSCF), TD-OCC with double and triple excitations (TD-OCCDT), TD-OCC with double excitations (TD-OCCD), and TD Hartree–Fock (TDHF) methods to understand how this approximate scheme performs in describing nonperturbatively nonlinear phenomena, such as field-induced ionization and high-harmonic generation. We find that the TD-OCCDT(4) method performs equally well as the TD-OCCDT method, almost perfectly reproducing the results of the fully correlated TD-CASSCF with a more favorable computational scaling.},

  abstract = {We present a basis set correction scheme for the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method. The scheme is based on employing frozen natural orbitals (FNOs) and diagrammatically decomposed contributions to the electronic correlation energy, which dominate the basis set incompleteness error (BSIE). As recently discussed in the work of Irmler et al . [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123 , 156401 (2019)], the BSIE of the CCSD correlation energy is dominated by the second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) perturbation energy and the particle–particle ladder term. Here, we derive a simple approximation to the BSIE of the particle–particle ladder term that effectively corresponds to a rescaled pair-specific MP2 BSIE, where the scaling factor depends on the spatially averaged correlation hole depth of the coupled-cluster and first-order pair wavefunctions. The evaluation of the derived expressions is simple to implement in any existing code. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for the uniform electron gas. Furthermore, we apply the method to coupled-cluster theory calculations of atoms and molecules using FNOs. Employing the proposed correction and an increasing number of FNOs per occupied orbital, we demonstrate for a test set that rapidly convergent closed and open-shell reaction energies, atomization energies, electron affinities, and ionization potentials can be obtained. Moreover, we show that a similarly excellent trade-off between required virtual orbital basis set size and remaining BSIEs can be achieved for the perturbative triples contribution to the CCSD(T) energy employing FNOs and the (T*) approximation.},

  abstract = {The structures of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be tuned to reproducibly create adsorption properties that enable the use of these materials in fixed-adsorption beds for non-thermal separations. However, with millions of possible MOF structures, the challenge is to find the MOF with the best adsorption properties to separate a given mixture. Thus, computational, rather than experimental, screening is necessary to identify promising MOF structures that merit further examination, a process traditionally done using molecular simulation. However, even molecular simulation can become intractable when screening an expansive MOF database for their separation properties at more than a few composition, temperature, and pressure combinations. Here, we illustrate progress toward an alternative computational framework that can efficiently identify the highest-performing MOFs for separating various gas mixtures at a variety of conditions and at a fraction of the computational cost of molecular simulation. This framework uses a “multipurpose” multilayer perceptron (MLP) model that can predict single component adsorption of various small adsorbates, which, upon coupling with ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), can predict binary adsorption for mixtures such as Xe/Kr, CH 4 /CH 6 , N 2 /CH 4 , and Ar/Kr at multiple compositions and pressures. For this MLP+IAST framework to work with sufficient accuracy, we found it critical for the MLP to make accurate predictions at low pressures (0.01–0.1 bar). After training a model with this capability, we found that MOFs in the 95th and 90th percentiles of separation performance determined from MLP+IAST calculations were 65\% and 87\%, respectively, the same as MOFs in the simulation-predicted 95th percentile across several mixtures at diverse conditions (on average). After validating our MLP+IAST framework, we used a clustering algorithm to identify “privileged” MOFs that are high performing for multiple separations at multiple conditions. As an example, we focused on MOFs that were high performing for the industrially relevant separations 80/20 Xe/Kr at 1 bar and 80/20 N 2 /CH 4 at 5 bars. Finally, we used the MOF free energies (calculated on our entire database) to identify privileged MOFs that were also likely synthetically accessible, at least from a thermodynamic perspective.},

The base functional should be dispersionless, numerically stable, and involve minimal delocalization error. Simultaneously, the dispersion correction should include finite damping, higher-order pairwise dispersion terms, and electronic many-body effects.

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, coherent multidimensional spectroscopies have been implemented across the terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. A combination of coherent excitation of several resonances with few-cycle pulses, and spectral decongestion along multiple spectral dimensions, has enabled new insights into wide ranging molecular scale phenomena, such as energy and charge delocalization in natural and artificial light-harvesting systems, hydrogen bonding dynamics in monolayers, and strong light–matter couplings in Fabry–Pérot cavities. However, measurements on ensembles have implied signal averaging over relevant details, such as morphological and energetic inhomogeneity, which are not rephased by the Fourier transform. Recent extension of these spectroscopies to provide diffraction-limited spatial resolution, while maintaining temporal and spectral information, has been exciting and has paved a way to address several challenging questions by going beyond ensemble averaging. The aim of this Perspective is to discuss the technological developments that have eventually enabled spatially resolved multidimensional electronic spectroscopies and highlight some of the very recent findings already made possible by introducing spatial resolution in a powerful spectroscopic tool.},

  abstract = {The crowded cellular environment can affect biomolecular binding energetics, with specific effects depending on the properties of the binding partners and the local environment. Often, crowding effects on binding are studied on particular complexes, which provide system-specific insights but may not provide comprehensive trends or a generalized framework to better understand how crowding affects energetics involved in molecular recognition. Here, we use theoretical, idealized molecules whose physical properties can be systematically varied along with samplings of crowder placements to understand how electrostatic binding energetics are altered through crowding and how these effects depend on the charge distribution, shape, and size of the binding partners or crowders. We focus on electrostatic binding energetics using a continuum electrostatic framework to understand effects due to depletion of a polar, aqueous solvent in a crowded environment. We find that crowding effects can depend predictably on a system’s charge distribution, with coupling between the crowder size and the geometry of the partners’ binding interface in determining crowder effects. We also explore the effect of crowder charge on binding interactions as a function of the monopoles of the system components. Finally, we find that modeling crowding via a lowered solvent dielectric constant cannot account for certain electrostatic crowding effects due to the finite size, shape, or placement of system components. This study, which comprehensively examines solvent depletion effects due to crowding, complements work focusing on other crowding aspects to help build a holistic understanding of environmental impacts on molecular recognition.},

  abstract = {We develop a model of interacting zwitterionic membranes with rotating surface dipoles immersed in a monovalent salt and implement it in a field theoretic formalism. In the mean-field regime of monovalent salt, the electrostatic forces between the membranes are characterized by a non-uniform trend: at large membrane separations, the interfacial dipoles on the opposing sides behave as like-charge cations and give rise to repulsive membrane interactions; at short membrane separations, the anionic field induced by the dipolar phosphate groups sets the behavior in the intermembrane region. The attraction of the cationic nitrogens in the dipolar lipid headgroups leads to the adhesion of the membrane surfaces via dipolar bridging. The underlying competition between the opposing field components of the individual dipolar charges leads to the non-uniform salt ion affinity of the zwitterionic membrane with respect to the separation distance; large inter-membrane separations imply anionic excess, while small nanometer-sized separations favor cationic excess. This complex ionic selectivity of zwitterionic membranes may have relevant repercussions on nanofiltration and nanofluidic transport techniques.},

Our ESD results for pure films of N 2 O show the production of numerous fragment cations and anions, and of larger molecular ions, of sufficient kinetic energy to escape into vacuum, which are likely formed by ion–molecule scattering in the film. Ion–molecule scattering is also responsible for the production of cations from C 2 D 2 films that contain as many as six or seven carbon atoms. Many of the same anions and cations desorb from N 2 O/C 2 D 2 mixtures, as well as new species, which is the result of ion–molecule scattering in the film. Anion desorption signals further indicate the formation of C–N containing species within the irradiated films. XPS spectra of N1s, C1s, and O1s lines reveal the fragmentation of N–O bonds and gradual formation of molecules containing species containing O–C=O, C=O, and C–O functional groups. A comparison between ESD and XPS findings suggests that species observed in the ESD channel are primarily products of reactions taking place at the film–vacuum interface, while those observed in the XPS derive from reactions occurring within the solid.},

However, these efforts are hindered due to a lack of simulation approaches for modeling solvent effects in SERS. In this work, we present an atomistic electrodynamics-quantum mechanical method to simulate SERS in aqueous solution based on the discrete interaction model/quantum mechanical method. This method combines an atomistic electrodynamics model of the nanoparticle with a time-dependent density functional theory description of the molecule and a polarizable embedding method for the solvent. The explicit treatment of solvent molecules and nanoparticles results in a large number of polarizable dipoles that need to be considered. To reduce the computational cost, a simple cut-off based approach has been implemented to limit the number of dipoles that need to be treated without sacrificing accuracy. As a test of this method, we have studied how solvent affects the SERS of pyridine in the junction between two nanoparticles in aqueous solution. We find that the solvent leads to an enhanced SERS due to an increased local field at the position of the pyridine. We further demonstrate the importance of both image field and local field effects in determining the enhancements and the spectral signatures. Our results show the importance of describing the local environment due to the solvent molecules when modeling SERS.},

Details and implementation of the method are provided along with three examples treating rhodamine thin films about one monolayer thick. The technique leads to a perfect agreement between experiment and simulations of the visible DR-SFG line shapes, even in the case of complex intermolecular interactions resulting from J-aggregated chromophores in heterogeneous films. For films with mixed H- and J-aggregates, separation of their responses shows that the J-aggregate DR-SFG response is dominant. Our analysis also accounts for the unexplained results published in the early times of DR-SFG experiments.},

Here, we employ density-functional theory calculations to study the evolution of the electronic structure of a slab of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 in the presence of oxygen vacancies under the influence of an external electric field. We find that, under massive electric fields, isolated O atoms are pulled out of the surface consisting of CuO chains. As vacancies accumulate at the surface, a configuration with vacancies located in the chains inside the slab becomes energetically preferred, thus providing a driving force for O migration toward the surface. Regardless of the defect configuration studied, the electric field is always fully screened near the surface, thus negligibly affecting diffusion barriers across the film.},

Such pressure-regulated ion transport is critical for various biological processes, such as cellular turgor control and hearing in mammals, but has yet to be achieved in artificial systems using similar mechanisms. In this work, we construct a nanoconfinement by reversibly blocking a single nanopore with a nanoparticle and report anomalous and ultra-mechanosensitive ionic transport across the resulting nanoconfinement upon assorted mechanical and electrical stimuli. Our observation reveals a suppressed ion conduction through the system as the applied pressure increases, which imitates certain behaviors of stretch-inactivated ion channels in biological systems. Moreover, pressure-induced ionic current rectification is also observed despite the high ionic concentration of the solution. Using a combined experimental and simulation study, we correlate both phenomena to pressure-induced nanoparticle rotation and the resulting physical structure change in the blocked nanopore. This work presents a mechanosensitive nano-confinement requiring minimal fabrication techniques and provides new opportunities for bio-inspired nanofluidic applications.},

  abstract = {Mechanotransduction, the biological response to mechanical stress, is often initiated by activation of mechanosensitive (MS) proteins upon mechanically induced deformations of the cell membrane. A current challenge in fully understanding this process is in predicting how lipid bilayers deform upon the application of mechanical stress. In this context, it is now well established that anionic lipids influence the function of many proteins. Here, we test the hypothesis that anionic lipids could indirectly modulate MS proteins by alteration of the lipid bilayer mechanical properties. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we computed the bilayer bending rigidity ( K C ), the area compressibility ( K A ), and the surface shear viscosity ( η m ) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) lipid bilayers with and without phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) at physiological concentrations in the lower leaflet. Tensionless leaflets were first checked for each asymmetric bilayer model, and a formula for embedding an asymmetric channel in an asymmetric bilayer is proposed. Results from two different sized bilayers show consistently that the addition of 20\% surface charge in the lower leaflet of the PC bilayer with PIP 2 has minimal impact on its mechanical properties, while PS reduced the bilayer bending rigidity by 22\%. As a comparison, supplementing the PIP 2 -enriched PC membrane with 30\% cholesterol, a known rigidifying steroid lipid, produces a significant increase in all three mechanical constants. Analysis of pairwise splay moduli suggests that the effect of anionic lipids on bilayer bending rigidity largely depends on the number of anionic lipid pairs formed during simulations. The potential implication of bilayer bending rigidity is discussed in the framework of MS piezo channels.},

  abstract = {In this work, we explored how the structure of monolayer water confined between two graphene sheets is coupled to its dynamic behavior. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that there is a remarkable interrelation between the friction of confined water with two walls and its structure under extreme confinement. When the water molecules formed a regular quadrilateral structure, the friction coefficient is dramatically reduced. Such a low-friction coefficient can be attributed to the formation of long-range ordered hydrogen bond network, which not only decreases the structure corrugation in the direction perpendicular to the walls but also promotes the collective motion of the confined water. The regular quadrilateral structure can be formed only if the number density of confined water falls within a certain range. Higher number density results in larger structure corrugations, which increases the friction, while smaller number density leads to an irregular hydrogen bond network in which the collective motion cannot play the role. We demonstrated that there are four distinct stages in the diagram of the friction coefficient vs the number density of confined water. This research clearly established the connection between the dynamic characteristics of confined monolayer water and its structure, which is beneficial to further understand the mechanism of the high-speed water flow through graphene nanocapillaries observed in recent experiments.},

However, a suitable mixture having desired properties can only be designed when the physiochemical properties of the mixtures of ILs along with their spectroscopic properties are well understood. With an aim to achieve this objective, three different mixtures with a common anion, namely, [C 2 C 1 im][C 4 C 1 im][NTf 2 ], [C 3 C 1 pyr][C 4 C 1 pyr][NTf 2 ], and [C 3 C 1 im][C 3 C 1 pyr][NTf 2 ], have been investigated in the current study. Investigations have been carried out at the macroscopic level by observing the thermophysical properties, such as molar volume and thermal expansion coefficient, and at the microscopic level with time-resolved fluorescence measurements and the pulse field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. The results obtained from the thermophysical study have indicated that excess molar volume for imidazolium-based IL–IL mixtures may be linked to the free volume created by the alkyl chain of the imidazolium cation whereas for the mixture of pyrrolidinium ILs, lowering of density can give rise to free volume. Analysis of time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy data has provided clear evidence in favor of the presence of free volume in the binary mixture of ILs. NMR studies have also supported the fluorescence anisotropy data. The outcome of the present investigation reveals that the mixtures show appreciable deviation from ideal behavior and the deviation from the ideal behavior is caused due to the generation of free volume in the resultant mixture, describing these IL mixtures as quasi-ideal rather than ideal or non-ideal.},

In this study, the original coarse-graining strategy proposed in our previous work [M. Li and J. Z. H. Zhang, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23 , 8926 (2021)] is first extended to the ultra-coarse-graining (UCG) modeling of liquid water, with the N C increasing from 4–10 to 20–500. The UCG force field is parameterized by the top-down strategy and subsequently refined on important properties of liquid water by the trial-and-error scheme. The optimal cutoffs for non-bonded interactions in the N C = 20/100/500 UCG simulations are, respectively, determined on energy convergence. The results show that the average density at 300 K can be accurately reproduced from the well-refined UCG models while it is largely different in describing compressibility, self-diffusion coefficient, etc. The density–temperature relationships predicted by these UCG models are in good agreement with the experiment result. Besides, two polarizable states of the UCG molecules are observed after simulated systems are equilibrated. The ion–water RDFs from the ion-involved N C = 100 UCG simulation are nearly in accord with the scaled AA ones. Furthermore, the concentration of ions can influence the ratio of two polarizable states in the N C = 100 simulation. Finally, it is illustrated that the proposed UCG models can accelerate liquid water simulation by 114–135 times, compared with the TIP3P force field. The proposed UCG force field is simple, generic, and transferable, potentially providing valuable information for UCG simulations of large biomolecules.},

  abstract = {By complexing with hydrophobic compounds, cyclodextrins afford increased solubility and thermodynamic stability to hardly soluble compounds, thereby underlining their invaluable applications in pharmaceutical and other industries. However, common cyclodextrins such as β-cyclodextrin, suffer from limited solubility in water, which often leads to precipitation and formation of unfavorable aggregates, driving the search for better solvents. Here, we study the solvation of cyclodextrin in deep eutectic solvents (DESs), environmentally friendly media that possess unique properties. We focus on reline, the DES formed from choline chloride and urea, and resolve the mechanism through which its constituents elevate β-cyclodextrin solubility in hydrated solutions compared to pure water or dry reline. Combining experiments and simulations, we determine that the remarkable solubilization of β-cyclodextrin in hydrated reline is mostly due to the inclusion of urea inside β-cyclodextrin’s cavity and at its exterior surfaces. The role of choline chloride in further increasing solvation is twofold. First, it increases urea’s solubility beyond the saturation limit in water, ultimately leading to much higher β-cyclodextrin solubility in hydrated reline in comparison to aqueous urea solutions. Second, choline chloride increases urea’s accumulation in β-cyclodextrin’s vicinity. Specifically, we find that the accumulation of urea becomes stronger at high reline concentrations, as the solution transitions from reline-in-water to water-in-reline, where water alone cannot be regarded as the solvent. Simulations further suggest that in dry DES, the mechanism of β-cyclodextrin solvation changes so that reline acts as a quasi-single component solvent that lacks preference for the accumulation of urea or choline chloride around β-cyclodextrin.},

  abstract = {Suspended colloids are often considered as models for molecules, which are sufficiently big so that they can be observed directly in (light) microscopes and for which the effective interaction among each other can be tailored. The Asakura–Oosawa model of ideal colloid–polymer mixtures captures the idea of tuning the interaction between the colloids via a potential, which possesses a range set by the size of the polymers and an attractive strength characterized by the (reservoir) number density of the polymers, which plays the role of an inverse temperature. The celebrated Asakura–Oosawa depletion potential allows one to recreate the bulk phase diagram of a simple fluid by employing a colloid–polymer mixture. This has been verified in theory, by computer simulations, and via experiments. Here, we study the phase behavior of a confined colloid–polymer mixture with two polymer species. The sizes and densities are chosen such that the resulting bulk phase diagram exhibits a second stable critical point within the framework of the classical density functional theory. Our results suggest that a suitably tuned colloid–polymer mixture can be an interesting model system to study fluids with two critical points.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that two amorphous solid states can exist in 4 He consisting of distinguishable Boltzmann atoms under compressed conditions. The isothermal compression of normal or supercritical fluid 4 He was conducted at 3–25 K using the isobaric–isothermal path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulation. The compression of fluid first produced the low-dispersion amorphous (LDA) state possessing modest extension of atomic necklaces. Further isothermal compression up to the order of 10 kbar to 1 Mbar or an isobaric cooling of LDA induced the transition to the high-dispersion amorphous (HDA) state. The HDA was characterized by long quantum wavelengths of atoms extended over several Angstroms and the promotion of atomic residual diffusion. They were related to the quantum tunneling of atoms bestriding the potential saddle points in this glass. The change in pressure or temperature induced the LDA–HDA transition reversibly with hysteresis, while it resembled the coil–globule transition of classical polymers. The HDA had lower kinetic and higher Gibbs free energies than the LDA at close temperature. The HDA was absent at T ≥ 13 K, while the LDA–HDA transition pressure significantly decreased with lowering temperature. The LDA and HDA correspond to the trapped and tunneling regimes proposed by Markland et al . [J. Chem. Phys. 136 , 074511 (2012)], respectively. The same reentrant behavior as they found was observed for the expansion factor of the quantum wavelength as well as for atomic diffusivity.},

DESs were designed starting from the well-known cholinium chloride salt mixed with the partially amphiphilic 1,4-butanediol hydrogen bond donor (HBD), and then, the effect of increasing salt hydrophobicity (tetrabutylammonium bromide) and HBD hydrophobicity ( p -cresol) was explored. Measurements were made between 2.5 and 25 wt.\% H 2 O, as a reasonable range representing atmospherically absorbed water, and molecular dynamics simulations were used for structural analysis. The choline chloride:1,4-butanediol DES had the lowest indigo solubility, with only the hydrophobic character of the alcohol alkyl spacers. Solubility was highest for indigo in the tetrabutylammonium bromide:1,4-butanediol DES with 2.5 wt.\% H 2 O due to interactions of indigo with the hydrophobic cation, but further addition of water caused this to reduce in line with the added water mole fraction, as water solvated the cation and reduced the extent of the hydrophobic region. The ChCl: p -cresol DES did not have the highest solubility at 2.5 wt.\% H 2 O, but did at 25 wt.\% H 2 O. Radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and spatial distribution functions demonstrate that this is due to strong indigo–HBD interactions, which allow this system to resist the higher mole fraction of water molecules and retain its solubility. The DES is, therefore, a host to local-composition effects in solvation, where its hydrophobic moieties concentrate around the hydrophobic solute, illustrating the versatility of DES as solvents.},

  abstract = {Mixtures of sodium salts with oxygen-containing molecules are useful from the perspective of applications such as sodium ion batteries because they fill the gap between deep eutectic solvents and molten salt hydrates. In a previous work, the physical properties (such as diffusion coefficients, conductivity, viscosity, and glass transition temperature) of four salts, namely, Na 2 B 4 O 7 · 10H 2 O, NaOAc · 3H 2 O, NaBr, and NaOAc, were measured with glycerol. Pulsed-field gradient (PFG) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was also used to measure self-diffusion coefficients of 1 H-bearing species. However, the technique was not able to measure diffusion of sodium ions due to the very fast NMR relaxation rate of such species, resulting in loss of the PFG NMR signal. In the current work, this study is expanded using 23 Na T 1 relaxation measurements which, under certain assumptions, can be translated into diffusion coefficients. Analysis of the physical properties is then correlated with self-diffusion coefficient measurements to elucidate information about structure and ionic mobility. It is shown that NaOAc · 3H 2 O, NaBr, and NaOAc fit models for ionic conductivity and diffusion, which are consistent with ionic liquids where charge transport is limited by ionic mobility rather than the number of charge carriers. The waters of hydration of NaOAc · 3H 2 O do not appear to form a separate phase but are instead strongly coordinated to the cation. In contrast, Na 2 B 4 O 7 · 10H 2 O appears to form a water-rich phase with enhanced sodium mobility.},

Computationally, the electron affinities of both thorium and uranium were calculated by conducting relativistic coupled-cluster and multi-reference configuration interaction calculations. The experimentally determined value of the electron affinity of the uranium atom was determined to be 0.309 ± 0.025 eV. The computationally predicted electron affinity of uranium based on composite coupled cluster calculations and full four-component spin–orbit coupling was found to be 0.232 eV. Predominately due to a better convergence of the coupled cluster sequence for Th and Th − , the final calculated electron affinity of Th, 0.565 eV, was in much better agreement with the accurate experimental value of 0.608 eV. In both cases, the ground state of the anion corresponds to electron attachment to the 6d orbital.},

Assignment of the observed bands is achieved using a combination of dispersed fluorescence (DF), two-dimensional LIF (2D-LIF), zero-electron-kinetic energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations. The spectroscopic studies project the levels of the S 1 state onto those of either the S 0 state, in DF and 2D-LIF spectroscopy, or the ground state cation (D 0 + ) state, in ZEKE spectroscopy. The assignments of the spectra provide information on the vibrational, vibration-torsion (vibtor), and torsional levels in those states and those of the S 1 levels. The spectra are indicative of vibronic (including torsional) interactions between the S 1 state and other excited electronic states, deduced both in terms of the vibrational activity observed and shifts from expected vibrational wavenumbers in the S 1 state, attributed to the resulting altered shape of the S 1 surface. Many of the ZEKE spectra are consistent with the largely Rydberg nature of the S 1 state near the Franck–Condon region; however, there is also some activity that is less straightforward to explain.

Since 2008, a few theoretical groups have suggested significant contributions of other dark states S 3 ( 1 A u , nπ*) and S 4 ( 1 B 2g , nπ*) to the decay of S 2 . We have previously reported the results of nuclear wave packet simulations [Kanno et al ., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 17 , 2012 (2015)] and photoelectron spectrum calculations [Mignolet et al ., Chem. Phys. 515 , 704 (2018)] that support the conventional two-state picture. In this article, the two different approaches, i.e., wave packet simulation and photoelectron spectrum calculation, are combined: We computed the time-resolved vacuum ultraviolet photoelectron spectrum and photoelectron angular distribution for the ionization of the wave packet transferred from S 2 to S 1 . The present results reproduce almost all the characteristic features of the corresponding experimental time-resolved spectrum [Horio et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 145 , 044306 (2016)], such as a rapid change from a three-band to two-band structure. This further supports the existence and character of the widely accepted pathway (S 2 → S 1 ) of ultrafast internal conversion in pyrazine.},

  abstract = {Discovery of new compounds from wide chemical space is attractive for materials researchers. However, theoretical prediction and validation experiments have not been systematically integrated. Here, we demonstrate that a new combined approach is powerful in significantly accelerating the discovery rate of new compounds, which should be useful for exploration of a wide chemical space in general. A recommender system for chemically relevant composition is constructed by machine learning of Inorganic Crystal Structure Database using chemical compositional descriptors. Synthesis and identification experiments are made at the chemical compositions with high recommendation scores by the single-particle diagnosis method. Two new compounds, La 4 Si 3 AlN 9 and La 26 Si 41 N 80 O, and two new variants (isomorphic substitutions) of known compounds, La 7 Si 6 N 15 and La 4 Si 5 N 10 O, are successfully discovered. Finally, density functional theory calculations are conducted for La 4 Si 3 AlN 9 to confirm the energetic and dynamical stability and to reveal its atomic arrangement.},

  abstract = {There has been recent interest in the deployment of ab initio density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) computations on high performance computing platforms. Here, we introduce a reformulation of the conventional distributed memory ab initio DMRG algorithm that connects it to the conceptually simpler and advantageous sum of the sub-Hamiltonian approach. Starting from this framework, we further explore a hierarchy of parallelism strategies that includes (i) parallelism over the sum of sub-Hamiltonians, (ii) parallelism over sites, (iii) parallelism over normal and complementary operators, (iv) parallelism over symmetry sectors, and (v) parallelism within dense matrix multiplications. We describe how to reduce processor load imbalance and the communication cost of the algorithm to achieve higher efficiencies. We illustrate the performance of our new open-source implementation on a recent benchmark ground-state calculation of benzene in an orbital space of 108 orbitals and 30 electrons, with a bond dimension of up to 6000, and a model of the FeMo cofactor with 76 orbitals and 113 electrons. The observed parallel scaling from 448 to 2800 central processing unit cores is nearly ideal.},

While beyond-dipole interactions and many-body contributions were separately addressed, little is known about their combined effect, especially in large molecules and relevant nanoscale systems. Here, we provide a full many-body description of vdW interactions beyond the dipole approximation, efficiently applicable to large-scale systems. Dipole–quadrupole interactions consistently exhibit large magnitude up to nm-scale separations, while many-body effects lead to system-dependent screening effects, which can reduce vdW interactions by a large fraction. Combined many-body and multipolar terms emerge as an essential ingredient for the reliable description of vdW interactions in molecular and nanoscale systems.},

The former are modeled quantum-mechanically, while the latter are treated as polarizable continua characterized by their dielectric constants. The proposed approach is purposely designed to simulate complex hybrid heterostructures with nano-engineered substrates including a stack of anisotropic layers. LayerPCM is suitable for describing the polarization-induced renormalization of frontier energy levels of the adsorbates in the static regime. Moreover, it can be reliably applied to simulating laser-induced ultrafast dynamics of molecules through the inclusion of electric fields generated by Fresnel-reflection at the substrate. Depending on the complexity of the underlying layer structure, such reflected fields can assume non-trivial shapes and profoundly affect the dynamics of the photo-excited charge carriers in the molecule. In particular, the interaction with the substrate can give rise to strong delayed fields, which lead to interference effects resembling those of multi-pulse-based spectroscopy. The robustness of the implementation and the above-mentioned features are demonstrated with a number of examples, ranging from intuitive models to realistic systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamic disorder behind a process, i.e., the dynamic effect of fluctuations that occur on a timescale slower or comparable with the timescale of the process, is essential for elucidating the dynamics and kinetics of complicated molecular processes in biomolecules and liquids. Despite numerous theoretical studies of single-molecule kinetics, our microscopic understanding of dynamic disorder remains limited. In the present study, we investigate the microscopic aspects of dynamic disorder in the isomerization dynamics of the Cys14–Cys38 disulfide bond in the protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, which has been observed by nuclear magnetic resonance. We use a theoretical model with a stochastic transition rate coefficient, which is calculated from the 1-ms-long time molecular dynamics trajectory obtained by Shaw et al. [Science 330 , 341–346 (2010)]. The isomerization dynamics are expressed by the transitions between coarse-grained states consisting of internal states, i.e., conformational sub-states. In this description, the rate for the transition from the coarse-grained states is stochastically modulated due to fluctuations between internal states. We examine the survival probability for the conformational transitions from a coarse-grained state using a theoretical model, which is a good approximation to the directly calculated survival probability. The dynamic disorder changes from a slow modulation limit to a fast modulation limit depending on the aspects of the coarse-grained states. Our analysis of the rate modulations behind the survival probability, in relation to the fluctuations between internal states, reveals the microscopic origin of dynamic disorder.},

Subsequently, we look for ways to sparsify the descriptor and further improve the computational efficiency of the method. To this aim, we use both principal component analysis and least absolute shrinkage operator regression for energy fitting on six single-element datasets. Both methods highlight the possibility of constructing a descriptor that is four times smaller than the original with a similar or even improved accuracy. Furthermore, we find that the reduced descriptors share a sizable fraction of their features across the six independent datasets, hinting at the possibility of designing material-agnostic, optimally compressed, and accurate descriptors.},

The broad-bandwidth, high-field nature of the pulses results in a multitude of accessible excited states. Multiconfigurational quantum chemistry with the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is used to examine population transfer dynamics in stimulated x-ray Raman scattering of the nitric oxide oxygen and nitrogen K-edges. Two pulse schemes initiate wavepackets of different characters and demonstrate how chemical differences between core-excitation pathways affect the dynamics. The population transfer to valence-excited states is found to be sensitive to the electronic structure and pulse conditions, highlighting complexities attributed to the Rabi frequency. The orthogonally polarized two-color-pulse setup has increased selectivity while facilitating longer, less intense pulses than the one-pulse setup. Population transfer in the 1s → Rydberg region is more effective but less selective at the nitrogen K-edge; the selectivity is reduced by double core-excited states. Result interpretation is aided by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering maps.},

The method is based on zero-time Kubo-transformed correlation functions and captures the anharmonicity of the potential due to both temperature and quantum effects. Using analytical derivations and numerical calculations on toy-model potentials, we show that two different estimators built upon PIMD correlation functions fully characterize the phonon spectra and the anharmonicity strength. The first estimator is associated with the force–force quantum correlators and, in the weak anharmonic regime, yields reliable zero-point motion frequencies and thermodynamic properties of the quantum system. The second one is instead connected to displacement–displacement correlators and accurately probes the lowest-energy phonon excitations, regardless of the anharmonicity strength of the system. We also prove that the use of generalized eigenvalue equations, in place of the standard normal mode equations, leads to a significant speed-up in the PIMD phonon calculations, both in terms of faster convergence rate and smaller time step bias. Within this framework, using ab initio PIMD simulations, we compute phonon dispersions of diamond and of the high-pressure I4 1 /amd phase of atomic hydrogen. We find that in the latter case, the anharmonicity is stronger than previously estimated and yields a sizeable red-shift in the vibrational spectrum of atomic hydrogen.},

Explicit corrections for the frozen core orbitals and the unfrozen valence orbitals are introduced, safeguarding against seemingly minor numerical deviations from the assumed orthonormality conditions of the basis functions. A speedup of over twofold can be achieved for the diagonalization step in all-electron density-functional theory simulations containing heavy elements, without any accuracy degradation in terms of the electron density, total energy, and atomic forces. This is demonstrated in a benchmark study covering 103 materials across the Periodic Table and a large-scale simulation of CsPbBr 3 with 2560 atoms. Our study provides a rigorous benchmark of the precision of the frozen core approximation (sub-meV per atom for frozen core orbitals below −200 eV) for a wide range of test cases and for chemical elements ranging from Li to Po.

We show that substituents affect the substrate by exerting forces on the nuclei. These substituent-induced forces are able to develop a work when the molecule follows a given reaction path. By applying a simple mechanical model, it becomes possible to quantify this work, which corresponds to the energy variation due to the effect of the substituent along a specific pathway. Our model accounts for the Hammett equation as a particular case, providing the first non-empirical scale for the σ and ρ constants, which, in the developed model, are related to the forces exerted by the substituents (σ) and the reaction path length (ρ), giving their product (σ · ρ) the well-known variation on the reaction energy due to the substituent.},

  abstract = {Polyphenols are natural molecules of crucial importance in many applications, of which tannic acid (TA) is one of the most abundant and established. Most high-value applications require precise control of TA interactions with the system of interest. However, the molecular structure of TA is still not comprehended at the atomic level, of which all electronic and reactivity properties depend. Here, we combine an enhanced sampling global optimization method with density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to explore the conformational space of TA assisted by unsupervised machine learning visualization and then investigate its lowest energy conformers. We study the external environment’s effect on the TA structure and properties. We find that vacuum favors compact structures by stabilizing peripheral atoms’ weak interactions, while in water, the molecule adopts more open conformations. The frontier molecular orbitals of the conformers with the lowest harmonic vibrational free energy have a HOMO–LUMO energy gap of 2.21 (3.27) eV, increasing to 2.82 (3.88) eV in water, at the DFT generalized gradient approximation (and hybrid) level of theory. Structural differences also change the distribution of potential reactive sites. We establish the fundamental importance of accurate structural consideration in determining TA and related polyphenol interactions in relevant technological applications.},

  abstract = {We derive a formulation of mixed quantum–classical dynamics for modeling electronic carriers interacting with phonons in reciprocal space. For dispersionless phonons, we start by expressing the real-space classical coordinates in terms of complex variables. Taking these variables as a Fourier series then yields the reciprocal-space coordinates. Evaluating the electron–phonon interaction term through Ehrenfest’s theorem, we arrive at a reciprocal-space formalism that is equivalent to mean-field mixed quantum–classical dynamics in real space. This equivalence is numerically verified for the Holstein and Peierls models, for which we find the reciprocal-space Hellmann–Feynman forces to involve momentum-derivative contributions in addition to the position-derivative terms commonly seen in real space. To illustrate the advantage of the reciprocal-space formulation, we present a proof of concept for the inexpensive modeling of low-momentum carriers interacting with phonons using a truncated reciprocal-space basis, which is not possible within a real-space formulation.},

  abstract = {We report the first investigation of the performance of EOM-CC4—an approximate equation-of-motion coupled-cluster model, which includes iterative quadruple excitations—for vertical excitation energies in molecular systems. By considering a set of 28 excited states in 10 small molecules for which we have computed CC with singles, doubles, triples, quadruples, and pentuples and full configuration interaction reference energies, we show that, in the case of excited states with a dominant contribution from the single excitations, CC4 yields excitation energies with sub-kJ mol −1 accuracy (i.e., error below 0.01 eV), in very close agreement with its more expensive CC with singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples parent. Therefore, if one aims at high accuracy, CC4 stands as a highly competitive approximate method to model molecular excited states, with a significant improvement over both CC3 and CC with singles, doubles, and triples. Our results also evidence that, although the same qualitative conclusions hold, one cannot reach the same level of accuracy for transitions with a dominant contribution from the double excitations.},

Because of the complex composition of light-intensity-dependent apparent activation energies, the issue that principally hinders the synergistic thermal effect to photocatalysis has hardly been accurately explored. In this work, by virtue of mutual match of theoretical simulation and experimental behaviors, we demonstrate that photocatalytic reaction rates exhibit a sensitively positive correlation with temperature under weak illumination, in which charge recombination predominates the rate-determining step of semiconductor–cocatalyst interfacial electron transfer. Under high-intensity irradiation, however, the aggravation of charge leakage inherently accompanied by thermionic emission severely weakens the synergistic thermal effect or even slows down the reaction by raising the temperature. Inspired by these, we manage to maximize the photocatalytic solar utilization by spherical incidence of sunlight with the assistance of low-grade heat.},

  abstract = {Experimental methods based on a wide range of physical principles are used to determine carrier mobilities for light-harvesting materials in photovoltaic cells. For example, in a time-of-flight experiment, a single laser pulse photoexcites the active layer of a device, and the transit time is determined by the arrival of carriers at an acceptor electrode. With inspiration from this conventional approach, we present a multidimensional time-of-flight technique in which carrier transport is tracked with a second intervening laser pulse. Transient populations of separate material components of an active layer may then be established by tuning the wavelengths of the laser pulses into their respective electronic resonances. This experimental technique is demonstrated using photovoltaic cells based on mixtures of organohalide perovskite quantum wells. In these “layered perovskite” systems, charge carriers are funneled between quantum wells with different thicknesses because of staggered band alignments. Multidimensional time-of-flight measurements show that these funneling processes do not support long-range transport because of carrier trapping. Rather, our data suggest that the photocurrent is dominated by processes in which the phases of the thickest quantum wells absorb light and transport carriers without transitions into domains occupied by quantum wells with smaller sizes. These same conclusions cannot be drawn using conventional one-dimensional techniques for measuring carrier mobilities. Advantages and disadvantages of multidimensional time-of-flight experiments are discussed in the context of a model for the signal generation mechanism.},

Crystal structures of rhodopsins contain several structurally conserved water molecules. It has been suggested that water plays an active role in facilitating the ion pumping/translocation process by acting as a lubricant in these systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the localization, structure, dynamics, and energetics of the water molecules along the channel for the resting/dark state of KR2 rhodopsin. By employing several microseconds long atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of this trans-membrane protein system, we demonstrate the presence of five distinct water containing pockets/cavities separated by gateways controlled by protein side-chains. There exists a strong hydrogen bonded network involving these buried water molecules and functionally important key residues. We present evidence of significant structural and dynamical heterogeneity in the water molecules present in these cavities, with very rare exchange between them. The exchange time scale of such buried water with the bulk has an extremely wide range, from tens of nanoseconds to &gt;1.5 µ s. The translational and rotational dynamics of buried water are found to be strongly dependent on the protein cavity size and local interactions with a classic signature of trapped diffusion and rotational anisotropy.},

Our results demonstrate that a Cu nanorod favors one position on both tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO 2 surfaces, where the bottom Cu atoms are placed close to the lattice oxygens. In agreement with previous calculations, we find that CO 2 prefers a bent bidentate configuration at the Cu–ZrO 2 interface and the molecule is clearly activated being negatively charged. Straining of the Cu nanorod influences CO 2 adsorption energy but does not change the preferred nanorod position on zirconia. Altogether, our results highlight that CO 2 adsorption and activation depend sensitively on the chemical composition and atomic structure of the interface used in the calculations. This structure sensitivity may potentially impact further catalytic steps and the overall computed reactivity profile.},

One important issue is how to improve the quantum efficiency of quantum emitters in the nanometer-sized metallic gap so that molecule-specific emission can be clearly observed. Here, using electromagnetic simulations, we systematically investigate the influence of an atomic-scale protrusion at the tip apex on the emission properties of a point dipole in the plasmonic nanocavity. We found that such an atomistic protrusion can induce strong and spatially highly confined electric fields, thus increasing the quantum efficiency of molecular fluorescence over two orders of magnitude even when its dipole is oriented parallel to the metal surface, a situation occurring in most realistic single-molecule electroluminescence experiments. In addition, our theoretical simulations indicate that due to the lightning rod effect induced by the protrusion in a plasmonic nanocavity, the quantum efficiency increases monotonically as the tip approaches the dipole to the point of contact, instead of being quenched, thus explaining previous experimental observations with ever-enhancing fluorescence. Furthermore, we also examine in detail how the protrusion radius, height, and material affect the protrusion-induced emission enhancement. These results are believed to be instructive for further studies on the optoelectronic properties of single molecules in tip-based plasmonic nanocavities.},

  abstract = {A trace amount of interfacial water is required to initiate hydrosilation reactions of trifunctional organosilanes to form surface assemblies. In recent studies, we have learned that water also has a critical role in directing molecular placement on surfaces because water can react with silicon to provide oxygenated sites for surface binding. Consequently, the wettability nature of substrates influences the placement and density of organosilane films formed by vapor-phase reactions. Nanopatterning protocols were designed using vapor-phase organosilanes and colloidal lithography to compare the wettability differences of hydrophilic mica(0001) compared to relatively hydrophobic Si(100) as a strategy for tracking the location of water on surfaces. The competition between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains for the adsorption and coalescence of water condensed from vapor can be mapped indirectly by mapping the organosilanes, which bind to water at the solid interface, using atomic force microscopy. Trifunctional octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was used as a marker molecule to map out the areas of the surface where water was deposited. The effect of systematic changes in film thickness and surface coverage of OTS was evaluated at the vapor/solid interface by adding an incremental amount of water to sealed reaction vessels to wet the surface and assessing the outcome after reaction with vapor-phase trichlorosilane. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations of the silicon–water vapor interface combined with electronic structure calculations of oxygenated silicon clusters with methyltrichlorosilane provided insight of the mechanism for surface binding, toward understanding the nature of the interface and wettability factors, which influence the association and placement of silane molecules on surfaces.},

Therefore, an electrical double layer should form at this interface and existing models for describing the electrical double layer at metal oxide–water interfaces should be able to be modified to describe the surface charge, surface potential, and ionic occupancy at the ice–water interface. I used a surface complexation model along with literature measurements of the zeta potential of ice in brines of various strength and pH to constrain equilibrium constants. I then made predictions of ion site occupancy, surface charge density, and partitioning of counterions between the Stern and diffuse layers. The equilibrium constant for cation adsorption is more than 5 orders of magnitude larger than the other constants, indicating that this reaction dominates even at low salinity. Deprotonated OH sites are predicted to be slightly more abundant than dangling O sites, consistent with previous work. Surface charge densities are on the order of ±0.001 C/m 2 and are always negative at the moderate pH values of interest to atmospheric and geophysical applications (6–9). In this pH range, over 99\% of the counterions are contained in the Stern layer. This suggests that diffuse layer polarization will not occur because the ionic concentrations in the diffuse layer are nearly identical to those in the bulk electrolyte and that electrical conduction and polarization in the Stern layer will be negligible due to reduced ion mobility.},

  abstract = {The construction of heterojunctions has attracted considerable attention among the various strategies of water-splitting for hydrogen evolution due to their band structure advantages. In this research, we combined chemical vapor deposition and pulsed laser deposition to fabricate MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction films on indium-tin oxide glass substrates, and we studied the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. The x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope characterizations suggested the successful preparation of MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction films. In particular, the shifts of the peak positions in the XPS spectra indicated the formation of a strong interaction between the g-C 3 N 4 and MoS 2 films. After depositing MoS 2 on the g-C 3 N 4 film, the visible-light absorption was enhanced and broadened, the electrical conductivity improved, and the intensity of the photoluminescence peak decreased. As a result, the greater generation, faster transport, and lower recombination rate of electrons and holes caused the heterojunction films to show higher PEC performance. More importantly, the obtained MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 film was confirmed to be an n–n type heterojunction and to have a typical type-II band structure, which could indeed suppress the recombination and promote the separation, transfer, and transport of photogenerated electron–holes. Finally, the obtained MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 film successfully achieved the overall water-splitting and the H 2 evolution rate when the visible-light radiation reached 252 µ mol/h.},

  abstract = {Salt-concentrated electrolytes are emerging as promising electrolytes for advanced lithium ion batteries (LIBs) that can offer high energy density and improved cycle life. To further improve these electrolytes, it is essential to understand their inherent behavior at various operating conditions of LIBs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are extensively used to study various properties of electrolytes and explain the associated molecular-level phenomena. In this study, we use classical MD simulations to probe the properties of the concentrated electrolyte solution of 3 mol/kg lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6 ) salt in the propylene carbonate solvent at various temperatures ranging from 298 to 378 K. Our results reveal that the properties such as ionic diffusivity and molar conductivity of a concentrated electrolyte are more sensitive to temperature compared to that of dilute electrolytes. The residence time analysis shows that temperature affects the Li + ion solvation shell dynamics significantly. The effect of temperature on the transport and dynamic properties needs to be accounted carefully while designing better thermal management systems for batteries made with concentrated electrolytes to garner the advantages of these electrolytes.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of breaking and re-formation of hydrogen bonds (HBs) in liquid water is a prototype of reversible geminate recombination. HB population correlation functions (HBPCFs) are a means to study the HB kinetics. The long-time limiting behavior of HBPCFs is controlled by translatoric diffusion and shows a t −3/2 time-dependence, which can be described by analytical expressions based on the HB acceptor density and the donor–acceptor inter-diffusion coefficient. If the trajectories are not properly “unwrapped,” the presence of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) can perturb this long-time limiting behavior. Keeping the trajectories “wrapped,” however, allows for a more efficient calculation of HBPCFs. We discuss the consequences of PBCs in combination with “wrapped” trajectories following from the approximations according to Luzar–Chandler and according to Starr, each deviating in a different fashion from the true long-time limiting behavior, but enveloping the unperturbed function. A simple expression is given for estimating the maximum time up to which the computed HBPCFs reliably describe the long-time limiting behavior. In addition, an exact a posteriori correction for systems with PBCs for “wrapped” trajectories is derived, which can be easily computed and which is able to fully recover the true t −3/2 long-time behavior. For comparison, HBPCFs are computed from MD simulations of TIP4P/2005 model water for varying system sizes and temperatures of 273 and 298 K using this newly introduced correction. Implications for the computations of HB lifetimes and the effect of the system-size are discussed.},

The theoretical simulations for the monomer and two different forms of the dimer are compared against high-resolution experimental data for pure liquid acetic acid. We show that the theoretical model based on a dimer describes the hydrogen bond formation in the liquid phase well and that this bond formation sufficiently alters the RIXS spectra, allowing us to trace these effects directly from the experiment.

In this paper, we have used high-precision multiwavelet calculations to compute the metal–ligand association energies for 27 transition metal complexes with common ligands, such as H 2 , CO, olefins, and solvent molecules. By comparing our multiwavelet results to a variety of frequently used Gaussian-type basis sets, we show that counterpoise corrections, which are widely employed to correct for basis set superposition errors, often lead to underbinding. Additionally, counterpoise corrections are difficult to employ when the association step also involves a chemical transformation. Multiwavelets, which can be conveniently applied to all types of reactions, provide a promising alternative for computing electronic interaction energies free from any basis set errors.},

The results show that double-quantum 2DCS provides sensitive and background-free detection of weak dipole–dipole interaction between atoms with a mean separation up to about 16 μ m, and multi-quantum 2DCS can excite and detect multi-atom states (Dicke states) with up to eight correlated atoms. The technique of optical 2DCS can provide a new approach to study many-body physics in atomic ensembles and can be potentially implemented to measure many-body effects in cold atoms and other atomic/molecular systems.},

This leads to a near doubling in performance on central processing units (CPUs) compared to pure fp64 evaluation. Since the cost of evaluating the 3c1e integrals is less significant on graphic processing units (GPUs) compared to CPU, the performance gains from accelerating 3c1e integrals alone is less impressive on GPUs. Therefore, we also investigate the possibility of employing only fp32 operations to evaluate the exchange matrix within the self-consistent-field (SCF) followed by an accurate one-shot evaluation of the exchange energy using mixed fp32/fp64 precision. This still provides very accurate (1.8 µ E h maximal error) results while providing a sevenfold speedup on a typical “gaming” GPU (GTX 1080Ti). We also propose the use of incremental exchange-builds to further reduce these errors. The proposed SCF scheme (i-sn-LinK) requires only one mixed-precision exchange matrix calculation, while all other exchange-matrix builds are performed with only fp32 operations. Compared to pure fp64 evaluation, this leads to 4–7× speedups for the whole SCF procedure without any significant deterioration of the results or the convergence behavior.},

It has been found that the CU, PS, and even EPS approximations with loose thresholds may introduce intruder states. In the present work, the origin of these “false intruder” states introduced by approximated density matrices is discussed. Canonical NEVPT2 implementations employ a rank reduction trick. By analyzing its residual error, we find that the omission of the rank reduction leads to a more stable multireference perturbation theory for incomplete active space reference wave functions. Such a full rank (FR)-NEVPT2 formulation is equivalent to the conventional NEVPT2 method for the complete active space self-consistent field/complete active space configuration interaction reference wave function. A major drawback of the FR-NEVPT2 formulation is the necessity of the fifth-order density matrix. To avoid the construction of the high-order density matrices, the combination of the FR-NEVPT2 with the CU approximation is studied. However, we find that the CU approximation remains problematic as it still introduces intruder states. The question of how to robustly and efficiently perform internally contracted multireference perturbation theories with approximate densities remains a challenging field of investigation.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, the second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) has developed into a widely used multireference perturbation method. To apply NEVPT2 to systems with large active spaces, the computational bottleneck is the construction of the fourth-order reduced density matrix. Both its generation and storage become quickly problematic beyond the usual maximum active space of about 15 active orbitals. To reduce the computational cost of handling fourth-order density matrices, the cumulant approximation (CU) has been proposed in several studies. A more conventional strategy to address the higher-order density matrices is the pre-screening approximation (PS), which is the default one in the ORCA program package since 2010. In the present work, the performance of the CU, PS, and extended PS (EPS) approximations for the fourth-order density matrices is compared. Following a pedagogical introduction to NEVPT2, contraction schemes, as well as the approximations to density matrices, and the intruder state problem are discussed. The CU approximation, while potentially leading to large computational savings, virtually always leads to intruder states. With the PS approximation, the computational savings are more modest. However, in conjunction with conservative cutoffs, it produces stable results. The EPS approximation to the fourth-order density matrices can reproduce very accurate NEVPT2 results without any intruder states. However, its computational cost is not much lower than that of the canonical algorithm. Moreover, we found that a good indicator of intrude states problems in any approximation to high order density matrices is the eigenspectra of the Koopmans matrices.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a new method to calculate molecular nonradiative electronic relaxation rates based on the numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group theory. This method could go beyond the existing frameworks under the harmonic approximation (HA) of the potential energy surface (PES) so that the anharmonic effect could be considered, which is of vital importance when the electronic energy gap is much larger than the vibrational frequency. We calculate the internal conversion (IC) rates in a two-mode model with Morse potential to investigate the validity of HA. We find that HA is unsatisfactory unless only the lowest several vibrational states of the lower electronic state are involved in the transition process when the adiabatic excitation energy is relatively low. As the excitation energy increases, HA first underestimates and then overestimates the IC rates when the excited state PES shifts toward the dissociative side of the ground state PES. On the contrary, HA slightly overestimates the IC rates when the excited state PES shifts toward the repulsive side. In both cases, a higher temperature enlarges the error of HA. As a real example to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the method, we calculate the IC rates of azulene from S 1 to S 0 on the ab initio anharmonic PES approximated by the one-mode representation. The calculated IC rates of azulene under HA are consistent with the analytically exact results. The rates on the anharmonic PES are 30\%–40\% higher than the rates under HA.},

Here, we generalize the variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory to compute the energies and properties of strongly correlated periodic systems. The 2-RDM of the unit cell is directly computed subject to necessary N -representability conditions such that the unit-cell 2-RDM represents at least one N -electron density matrix. Two canonical but non-trivial systems, periodic metallic hydrogen chains and periodic acenes, are treated to demonstrate the methodology. We show that while single-reference correlation theories do not capture the strong (static) correlation effects in either of these molecular systems, the periodic variational 2-RDM theory predicts the Mott metal-to-insulator transition in the hydrogen chains and the length-dependent polyradical formation in acenes. For both hydrogen chains and acenes, the periodic calculations are compared with previous non-periodic calculations with the results showing a significant change in energies and increase in the electron correlation from the periodic boundary conditions. The 2-RDM theory, which allows for much larger active spaces than are traditionally possible, is applicable to studying correlation-driven phenomena in general periodic molecular solids and materials.},

  abstract = {Benchmarking calculations on excited states of models of phenylalanine protein chains are presented to assess the ability of alternative methods to the standard and most commonly used multiconfigurational wave function-based method, the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF), in recovering the non-dynamical correlation for systems that become not affordable by the CASSCF. The exploration of larger active spaces beyond the CASSCF limit is benchmarked through three strategies based on the reduction in the number of determinants: the restricted active space self-consistent field, the generalized active space self-consistent field (GASSCF), and the occupation-restricted multiple active space (ORMAS) schemes. The remaining dynamic correlation effects are then added by the complete active space second-order perturbation theory and by the multireference difference dedicated configuration interaction methods. In parallel, the approximate second-order coupled cluster (CC2), already proven to be successful for small building blocks of model proteins in one of our previous works [Ben Amor et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 184105 (2018)], is investigated to assess its performances for larger systems. Among the different alternative strategies to CASSCF, our results highlight the greatest efficiency of the GASSCF and ORMAS schemes in the systematic reduction of the configuration interaction expansion without loss of accuracy in both nature and excitation energies of both singlet ππ * and nπ * CO excited states with respect to the equivalent CASSCF calculations. Guidelines for an optimum applicability of this scheme to systems requiring active spaces beyond the complete active space limit are then proposed. Finally, the extension of the CC2 method to such large systems without loss of accuracy is demonstrated, highlighting the great potential of this method to treat accurately excited states, mainly single reference, of very large systems.},

The absolute shifts were reproduced without semi-empirical calibrations by periodic density functional calculations employing extensive localized basis sets with several common density functionals. However, the best numerical agreement is obtained with the B1WC hybrid functional. Extension of the calculations to 350 GPa, a pressure corresponding to the Earth’s inner core, predicted the IS range of 0.00 to −0.85 mm/s, covering the span from Fe(0) to Fe(VI) compounds measured at ambient pressure. The calculations also reproduced the pressure trend from polymorphs of prototypical iron oxide minerals, FeO and Fe 2 O 3 . Analysis of the electronic structure shows a strong donation of electrons from oxygen to iron at high pressure. The assignment of formal oxidation to the Fe atom becomes ambiguous under this condition.},

  abstract = {The elastic properties of lipid membranes can be measured by monitoring their thermal fluctuations. For instance, comparing the power spectra of membrane shape or lipid director fluctuations with predictions based on suitable continuum theories gives access to bending-, tilt-, and twist-moduli. However, to do so in a computer simulation, we must first define a continuum surface shape and lipid director field from the discrete configurations of lipid molecules in a typically fairly small box. Here, we show that the required mapping choices, as well as the details of the subsequent data analysis, can shift the measured values of these moduli by far more than their statistical uncertainties. We investigate the resulting systematic errors on the basis of atomistic simulation trajectories for 13 different lipids, previously published by Venable et al. [Chem. Phys. Lipids 192 , 60–74 (2015)]. Specifically, we examine mapping choices for surface- and tilt-field definitions, normalizing and averaging lipid directors, accounting for wave vector dependent time autocorrelations, error propagation, and finding the right fitting range. We propose a set of criteria that may help to decide upon a particular combination of choices underlying the fluctuation analysis, and we make several recommendations based on these. While systematic shifts in observables that are extracted from large-wavelength limits vanish, in principle, for sufficiently large system size, no such exact limit exists for intrinsically local parameters, such as the twist modulus or the splay-tilt coupling, and so not all potential choices can be trivially verified.},

AIMS represents nuclear wavefunctions as linear combinations of traveling, coupled Gaussians called trajectory basis functions (TBFs) and uses a spawning algorithm to increase as needed the size of this basis set during nonadiabatic transitions. While the success of AIMS resides in this spawning algorithm, the dramatic increase in TBFs generated by multiple crossings between electronic states can rapidly lead to intractable dynamics. In this Communication, we introduce a new flavor of AIMS, coined ab initio multiple spawning with informed stochastic selections (AIMSWISS), which proposes a parameter-free strategy to beat the growing number of TBFs in an AIMS dynamics while preserving its accurate description of nonadiabatic transitions. The performance of AIMSWISS is validated against the photodynamics of ethylene, cyclopropanone, and fulvene. This technique, built upon the recently developed stochastic-selection AIMS, is intended to serve as a computationally affordable starting point for multiple spawning simulations.},

  abstract = {Coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) is a promising ab initio method for the electronic structure of three-dimensional metals, for which second-order perturbation theory (MP2) diverges in the thermodynamic limit. However, due to the high cost and poor convergence of CCSD with respect to basis size, applying CCSD to periodic systems often leads to large basis set errors. In a common “composite” method, MP2 is used to recover the missing dynamical correlation energy through a focal-point correction, but the inadequacy of finite-order perturbation theory for metals raises questions about this approach. Here, we describe how high-energy excitations treated by MP2 can be “downfolded” into a low-energy active space to be treated by CCSD. Comparing how the composite and downfolding approaches perform for the uniform electron gas, we find that the latter converges more quickly with respect to the basis set size. Nonetheless, the composite approach is surprisingly accurate because it removes the problematic MP2 treatment of double excitations near the Fermi surface. Using this method to estimate the CCSD correlation energy in the combined complete basis set and thermodynamic limits, we find that CCSD recovers 85\%–90\% of the exact correlation energy at r s = 4. We also test the composite approach with the direct random-phase approximation used in place of MP2, yielding a method that is typically (but not always) more cost effective due to the smaller number of orbitals that need to be included in the more expensive CCSD calculation.},

We also compared rigid vs fully flexible variants of the MB-pol model and evaluated system size effects for the properties studied. We found that the MB-pol model predictions are in good agreement with experimental data, even for temperatures approaching the vapor–liquid critical point; this agreement was largely insensitive to system sizes or the rigid vs flexible treatment of the intramolecular degrees of freedom. These results attest to the chemical accuracy of MB-pol and its high degree of transferability, thus enabling MB-pol’s application across a large swath of water’s phase diagram.},

Similarly, the reaction of Ni(1,5-COD) 2 with 0.6 equiv of [Ni(CN t Bu) 4 ], followed by addition of 0.08 equiv of I 2 , resulted in the formation of [Ni 8 (CN t Bu) 12 ][I] ( 3 ), which could be isolated in 52\% yield after work-up. Both 2 and 3 adopt folded nanosheet structures in the solid state, characterized by two symmetry-related planar Ni 4 arrays, six terminally bound t BuNC ligands, and six t BuNC ligands that adopt bridging coordination modes. The metrical parameters of the six bridging t BuNC ligands suggest that they have been reduced to their [ t BuNC] 2− form. In contrast to the nanosheet structures observed for 2 and 3 , gas phase Ni 8 is predicted to feature a compact bisdisphenoid ground state structure. The strikingly different structural outcomes reveal the profound structural changes that can occur upon addition of ligands to bare metal clusters. Ultimately, the characterization of 2 and 3 will enable more accurate structural predictions of ligand-protected nanoclusters in the future.},

  abstract = {We survey the inclusion of interferometric elements in nonlinear spectroscopy performed with quantum light. Controlled interference of electromagnetic fields coupled to matter can induce constructive or destructive contributions of microscopic coupling sequences (histories) of matter. Since quantum fields do not commute, quantum light signals are sensitive to the order of light–matter coupling sequences. Matter correlation functions are thus imprinted by different field factors, which depend on that order. We identify the associated quantum information obtained by controlling the weights of different contributing pathways and offer several experimental schemes for recovering it. Nonlinear quantum response functions include out-of-time-ordering matter correlators (OTOCs), which reveal how perturbations spread throughout a quantum system (information scrambling). Their effect becomes most notable when using ultrafast pulse sequences with respect to the path difference induced by the interferometer. OTOCs appear in quantum-informatics studies in other fields, including black hole, high energy, and condensed matter physics.},

Phys. 148 , 141103 (2018); Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 , 247802 (2018)] that the extensional flow of entangled polymer melts can engender, within a definite strain-rate regime [expressed in terms of the Deborah number ( De ) based on the Rouse time], the coexistence of separate domains consisting primarily of either coiled or stretched chain-like macromolecules. This flow-induced phase separation results in bimodal configurational distributions, where transitions of individual molecules between the coiled and stretched states occur very slowly by hopping over an apparent energy activation barrier. We demonstrate that the qualitative aspects of this phenomenon can be described via the single-mode Rolie–Poly model including Convective Constraint Release (CCR) and finite extensibility of the chain-like macromolecules. This analysis reveals the physical mechanism for the configurational coexistence, namely, the nonlinear rate of change of the average entropic restoring force of a given entangled chain with extension. Under conditions of significant flow-induced disentanglement, the rate of change of the effective restoring force initially decreases with extension (effective spring softening) and then increases (hardens) as the maximum chain length is approached. When balanced by flow-induced chain stretching, we find that there can be two configuration states within the same De regime, as covered by the NEMD simulations; therefore, a region of conformational coexistence can indeed exist. However, we demonstrate that this coexistence of configurational microstates is only possible when the magnitude of the CCR parameters is consistent with the rate of flow-induced disentanglement, as observed in the NEMD simulations.},

Excluded volume interactions in mixtures of colloidal rods and spheres lead to mediated depletion interactions. The strength and range of this attractive interaction depend on the concentrations of the particles, the length L and diameter D of the rods, and the radius R of the spheres. At strong enough attraction, this depletion interaction leads to phase separation. We experimentally determined the rod and sphere concentrations where these phase transitions occur by systematically varying the size ratios L / R and D / R and the aspect ratio L / D . This was done by using spheres with different radii and modifying the effective diameter of the rods through either the ionic strength of the buffer or anchoring a polymeric brush to the surface of the rods. The observed phase transitions were from a binary fluid to a colloidal gas/liquid phase coexistence that occurred already at very low concentrations due to the depletion efficiency of highly anisotropic rods. The experimentally measured phase transitions were compared to phase boundaries obtained using free volume theory (FVT), a well established theory for calculating the phase behavior of colloidal particles mixed with depletants. We find good correspondence between the experimental phase transitions and the theoretical FVT model where the excluded volume of the rod-like depletants was explicitly accounted for in both the reservoir and the system.},

This can give rise to interesting phenomena; however, it gained little attention in the past. In this work, we use the potential in question as an inter-component interaction in a binary hard-sphere mixture, where it is shown that the effective interaction induced by one component resembles qualitatively the well-known Asakura–Oosawa–Vrij potential and can lead to a liquid–gas phase transition in the other component.},

However, ligand-controlled catalysis for macromolecules, which differ from small molecules in penetrability and charge transfer behavior due to their bulky sizes, still remains undiscovered. Here, we systematically investigate the role of surface ligands in the photocatalytic performance of cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs in light-induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) by using thiol-based ligands with various polarities and chain lengths. A highly enhanced polymerization efficiency was observed when 3-mercapto propionic acid (MPA), a short-chain and polar ligand, was used to modify the CdSe QDs’ surface, achieving high chain-end fidelity, good temporal control, and a dispersity of 1.18, while also tolerating a wide-range of functional monomers ranging from acrylates to methacrylates and fluorinated monomers. Transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence studies reveal interesting mechanistic details of electron and hole transfers from the excited QDs to the initiators and 3-MPA capping ligands, respectively, providing key mechanistic insight of these ligand controlled and QD photocatalyzed ATRP processes. The thiolate ligands were found to serve as an efficient hole acceptor for QDs, which facilitates the formation of a charge-separated state, followed by electron transfer from the conduction band edge to initiators and ultimately suppressing charge recombination within the QD.},

Upon magnetization by a homogeneous external magnetic field, the systems feature an overall torsional deformation around the magnetization direction. Starting from a discrete minimal mesoscopic model setup, we work toward a macroscopic characterization. The two scales are linked by identifying expressions for the macroscopic system parameters as functions of the mesoscopic model parameters. In this way, the observed behavior of a macroscopic system can, in principle, be mapped to and illustratively be understood from an appropriate mesoscopic picture.

In addition to the previously reported mean-square displacement, we analyze the time evolution of the self-Van Hove functions G ( r , t ), as this probability density function uncovers intrinsic heterogeneous dynamics. Through this analysis, we show that the dynamics of the host particles parallel to the director becomes non-Gaussian and therefore heterogeneous after the nematic-to-smectic-A phase transition, even though it exhibits a nearly diffusive behavior according to its mean-squared displacement. In contrast, the non-commensurate guest particles display Gaussian dynamics of the parallel motion, up to the transition to the smectic-B phase. Thus, we show that the self-Van Hove function is a very sensitive probe to account for the instantaneous and heterogeneous dynamics of our system and should be more widely considered as a quantitative and complementary approach of the classical mean-squared displacement characterization in diffusion processes.},

Only at high absorbed doses, charge-induced disintegration of the graphene structure prevails. We also demonstrate that the progressing damage can be probed by femtosecond optical pulses in the soft UV regime (4 eV photon energy).

  abstract = {Metal oxyfluorides constitute a broad group of chemical compounds with a rich spectrum of crystal structures and properties. Surprisingly though, none of the ternary oxyfluorides contains a cation from group 11 of the periodic table. Intending to find one, we focused on the silver derivative, the Ag 2 OF 2 system, which may be considered as the 1:1 “adduct” of AgF 2 (i.e., an antiferromagnetic positive U charge transfer insulator) and AgO (i.e., a diamagnetic disproportionated negative charge transfer insulator). Here, possible crystal structures of the silver oxyfluoride were studied using evolutionary algorithms based on the density functional theory approach. We analyzed the oxidation states of silver in the low-energy structures, possible magnetic interactions, and energetic stability with respect to the available substrates. Our findings suggest that silver oxyfluoride, if obtained, may form a metastable crystal with cations in three different oxidation states of the same element. Due to the small energy difference, existence of a fully disproportionated metallic compound cannot be ruled out.

  abstract = {Carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs) are biomimetic membrane channels that demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and unique water and ion transport properties. Gating transport in CNTPs with external voltage could increase control over ion flow and selectivity. Herein, we used continuum modeling to probe the parameters that enable and further affect CNTP gating efficiency, including the size and composition of the supporting lipid membrane, slip flow in the carbon nanotube, and the intrinsic electronic properties of the nanotube. Our results show that the optimal gated CNTP device consists of a semiconducting CNTP inserted into a small membrane patch containing an internally conductive layer. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ionic transport modulated by gate voltages is controlled by the charge distribution along the CNTP under the external gate electric potential. The theoretical understanding developed in this study offers valuable guidance for the design of gated CNTP devices for nanofluidic studies, novel biomimetic membranes, and cellular interfaces in the future.},

A combination of x-ray electron spectroscopy, high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, and density functional theory is employed to gain insight into the MgO monomer binding, electronic and vibrational properties, and thermal stability. In the most stable configuration, the Mg and O of the MgO monomer bind to two surface oxygens and one undercoordinated surface titanium, respectively. The additional binding weakens the Mg–O monomer bond and makes Mg more ionic. The monomers are thermally stable up to 600 K, where the onset of diffusion into the TiO 2 bulk is observed. The monomeric MgO species on TiO 2 (101) represent an ideal atomically precise system with modified acid–base properties and will be employed in our future catalytic studies.},

  abstract = {The co-involvement of biological molecules and nanomaterials has increasingly come to the fore in modern-day applications. While the “bio–nano” (BN) interface presents physico-chemical characteristics that are manifestly different from those observed in isotropic bulk conditions, the underlying molecular reasons remain little understood; this is especially true of anomalies in interfacial hydration. In this paper, we leverage atomistic simulations to study differential adsorption characteristics of a small protein on the inner (concave) surface of a single-walled carbon nanotube whose diameter exceeds dimensions conducive to single-file water movement. Our findings indicate that the extent of adsorption is decided by the degree of foldedness of the protein conformational substate. Importantly, we find that partially folded substates, but not the natively folded one, induce reorganization of the protein hydration layer into an inner layer water closer to the nanotube axis and an outer layer water in the interstitial space near the nanotube walls. Further analyses reveal sharp dynamical differences between water molecules in the two layers as observed in the onset of increased heterogeneity in rotational relaxation and the enhanced deviation from Fickian behavior. The vibrational density of states reveals that the dynamical distinctions are correlated with differences in crucial bands in the power spectra. The current results set the stage for further systematic studies of various BN interfaces vis-à-vis control of hydration properties.},

  abstract = {Carbon–carbon coupling is an important step in many catalytic reactions, and performing sp 3 –sp 3 carbon–carbon coupling heterogeneously is particularly challenging. It has been reported that PdAu single-atom alloy (SAA) model catalytic surfaces are able to selectively couple methyl groups, producing ethane from methyl iodide. Herein, we extend this study to NiAu SAAs and find that Ni atoms in Au are active for C–I cleavage and selective sp 3 –sp 3 carbon–carbon coupling to produce ethane. Furthermore, we perform ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that include the effect of the iodine atom, which was previously considered a bystander species. We find that model NiAu surfaces exhibit a similar chemistry to PdAu, but the reason for the similarity is due to the role the iodine atoms play in terms of blocking the Ni atom active sites. Specifically, on NiAu SAAs, the iodine atoms outcompete the methyl groups for occupancy of the Ni sites leaving the Me groups on Au, while on PdAu SAAs, the binding strengths of methyl groups and iodine atoms at the Pd atom active site are more similar. These simulations shed light on the mechanism of this important sp 3 –sp 3 carbon–carbon coupling chemistry on SAAs. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of the iodine atoms on the reaction energetics and make an analogy between the effect of iodine as an active site blocker on this model heterogeneous catalyst and homogeneous catalysts in which ligands must detach in order for the active site to be accessed by the reactants.},

In the first part, a statistical model is employed to provide a probabilistic explanation for the similarity in the structure of simple liquids interacting with different pair potential forms, collectively known as simple liquids. The methodology works by sampling the radial distribution function and the number of interacting particles within the cutoff distance, and it produces the probability density function of the net force. We show that matching the probability distribution of the net force can be a direct route to parameterize simple liquid pair potentials with a similar structure, as the net force is the main component of the Newtonian equations of motion. The statistical model is assessed and validated against various cases. In the second part, we exploit DeepILST [A. Moradzadeh and N. R. Aluru, J. Phys. Chem.

  abstract = {The vibrational energy relaxation paths of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) OH excited in pure water and in isotopically diluted (deuterated) water are elucidated via non-equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (NE-AIMD) simulations. The present study extends the previous NE-AIMD simulation for the energy relaxation of an excited free OH vibration at an air/water interface [T. Ishiyama, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 104708 (2021)] to the energy relaxation of an excited H-bonded OH vibration in bulk water. The present simulation shows that the excited OH vibration in pure water dissipates its energy on a timescale of 0.1 ps, whereas that in deuterated water relaxes on a timescale of 0.7 ps, consistent with the experimental observations. To decompose these relaxation energies into the components due to intramolecular and intermolecular couplings, constraints are introduced on the vibrational modes except for the target path in the NE-AIMD simulation. In the case of pure water, 80\% of the total relaxation is attributed to the pathway due to the resonant intermolecular OH⋯OH stretch coupling, and the remaining 17\% and 3\% are attributed to intramolecular couplings with the bend overtone and with the conjugate OH stretch, respectively. This result strongly supports a significant role for the Förster transfer mechanism of pure water due to the intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions. In the case of deuterated water, on the other hand, 36\% of the total relaxation is due to the intermolecular stretch coupling, and all the remaining 64\% arises from coupling with the intramolecular bend overtone.},

While its ionic and hydrogen-ordered nature puts topological constraints on the ice-like network structures it can form, it is not clear what consequences these constraints have for NH 4 F compound formation and evolution. Here, we explore computationally the reach and eventual limits of the ice analogy for ammonium fluoride. By combining data mining of known and hypothetical ice networks with crystal structure prediction and density functional calculations, we explore the high-pressure phase diagram of NH 4 F and host–guest compounds of its hydrides. Pure NH 4 F departs from ice-like behavior above 80 GPa with the emergence of close-packed ionic structures. The predicted stability of NH 4 F hydrides shows that NH 4 F can act as a host to small guest species, albeit in a topologically severely constraint configuration space. Finally, we explore the binary NH 3 –HF chemical space, where we find candidate structures for several unsolved polyfluoride phases; among them is the chemical analog to H 2 O 2 dihydrate.},

Herein, we investigate this mechanism in detail by means of multireference semi-empirical quantum chemistry calculations, allowing, for the first time, for a balanced treatment of the static and dynamic correlation effects, both playing a crucial role in DAE photochemistry.

The two equivalent methyl groups cause each rotational transition to split into four torsional species, which is combined with the quadrupole hyperfine splittings in the same order of magnitude arising from the 14 N nucleus. This results in a complicated spectrum feature. The spectral assignment was done separately for each torsional species. Two global fits were carried out using the XIAM code and the BELGI - C 2 v -2 Tops - hyperfine code, a modified version of the BELGI - C 2 v -2 Tops code, giving satisfactory root-mean-square deviations. The potential barriers to internal rotation of the two methyl groups were determined to be V 3 = 317.208(16) cm −1 .

The studied systems include 24 different combinations of the dopant, total cluster charge, and cluster structure (cubic-like or oblate). The magnetically induced currents (both diatropic and paratropic) are shown to be sensitive to the atomic structure of clusters, the number of superatomic electrons, and the chemical nature of the dopant metal. Among the cubic-like structures, the strongest aromaticity is observed in Pd- and Pt-doped M @ A u 8 L 8 0 clusters.

For n = 12, the anion MnGe 12 − cluster probably includes two isomers: a major isomer with a puckered hexagonal prism geometry and a minor isomer with a distorted icosahedron geometry. Specifically, the puckered hexagonal prism isomer follows the Wade–Mingos rules and can be suggested as a new kind of superatom with the magnetic property. Furthermore, the results of adaptive natural density partitioning and deformation density analyses suggest a polar covalent interaction between Ge and Mn for endohedral clusters of MnGe 12 − . The spin density and natural population analysis indicate that MnGe n − clusters have high magnetic moments localized on Mn. The density of states diagram visually shows the significant spin polarization for endohedral structures and reveals the weak interaction between the Ge 4p orbital and the 4s, 3d orbitals of Mn.},

Here, we explore the use of confocal Raman imaging to characterize the three-dimensional (3D) spatial distribution of alkyl quinolones (AQs) in P. aeruginosa biofilms by reconstructing depth profiles from hyperspectral Raman data. AQs are important to quorum sensing (QS), virulence, and other actions of P. aeruginosa . Three-dimensional distributions of three different AQs (PQS, HQNO, and HHQ) were observed to have a significant depth, suggesting 3D anisotropic shapes—sheet-like rectangular solids for HQNO and extended cylinders for PQS. Similar to observations from 2D imaging studies, spectral features characteristic of AQs (HQNO or PQS) and the amide I vibration from peptide-containing species were found to correlate with the PQS cylinders typically located at the tips of the HQNO rectangular solids. In the QS-deficient mutant lasIrhlI , a small globular component was observed, whose highly localized nature and similarity in size to a P. aeruginosa cell suggest that the feature arises from HHQ localized in the vicinity of the cell from which it was secreted. The difference in the shapes and sizes of the aggregates of the three AQs in wild-type and mutant P. aeruginosa is likely related to the difference in the cellular response to growth conditions, environmental stress, metabolic levels, or other structural and biochemical variations inside biofilms. This study provides a new route to characterizing the 3D structure of biofilms and shows the potential of confocal Raman imaging to elucidate the nature of heterogeneous biofilms in all three spatial dimensions. These capabilities should be applicable as a tool in studies of infectious diseases.},

It is shown that this suggests a reformulation of TDDFT in terms of the second time derivative of the density, rather than the density itself. The result is a time-local Kohn–Sham scheme of second-order in time whose causal structure is more transparent than that of the usual Kohn–Sham formalism. The scheme can be used to construct new approximations at the exchange-only level and beyond, and it offers a straightforward definition of the exact adiabatic approximation.},

  abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) forces have been studied extensively in recent decades because of their importance with spectroscopic observables and geometry optimization. Here, we benchmark the accuracy and computational cost of QMC forces. The zero-variance zero-bias (ZVZB) force estimator is used in standard variational and diffusion Monte Carlo simulations with mean-field based trial wavefunctions and atomic pseudopotentials. Statistical force uncertainties are obtained with a recently developed regression technique for heavy tailed QMC data [P. Lopez Rios and G. J. Conduit, Phys. Rev. E 99 , 063312 (2019)]. By considering selected atoms and dimers with elements ranging from H to Zn (1 ≤ Z eff ≤ 20), we assess the accuracy and the computational cost of ZVZB forces as the effective pseudopotential valence charge, Z eff , increases. We find that the costs of QMC energies and forces approximately follow simple power laws in Z eff . The force uncertainty grows more rapidly, leading to a best case cost scaling relationship of approximately Z e ff 6.5 ( 3 ) for diffusion Monte Carlo. We find that the accessible system size at fixed computational cost scales as Z e ff − 2 ⁠ , insensitive to model assumptions or the use of the “space warp” variance-reduction technique. Our results predict the practical cost of obtaining forces for a range of materials, such as transition metal oxides where QMC forces have yet to be applied, and underscore the importance of further developing force variance-reduction techniques, particularly for atoms with high Z eff .},

Theoretical and numerical analyses of the non-collinear approaches confirm their ability to yield the proper collinear limit and provide rotational invariance of the total energy for functionals in the local-density or generalized-gradient approximations (GGAs). Calculations on simple molecules corroborate the formal considerations and highlight the importance of an effective screening algorithm to provide the sufficient level of numerical stability required for a rotationally invariant implementation of non-collinear GGA functionals. The illustrative calculations provide a first numerical comparison of both previously proposed non-collinear formulations for GGA functionals. The proposed screening procedure allows us to effectively deal with points of small magnetization, which would otherwise be problematic for the evaluation of the exchange–correlation energy and/or potential for non-collinear GGA functionals. Both previously suggested formulations for the non-collinear GGA are confirmed to be adequate for total energy calculations, provided that the screening is achieved on a sufficiently fine grid. All methods are implemented in the Crystal program.},

  abstract = {The generalized quantum master equation (GQME) provides a general and formally exact framework for simulating the reduced dynamics of open quantum systems. The recently introduced modified approach to the GQME (M-GQME) corresponds to a specific implementation of the GQME that is geared toward simulating the dynamics of the electronic reduced density matrix in systems governed by an excitonic Hamiltonian. Such a Hamiltonian, which is often used for describing energy and charge transfer dynamics in complex molecular systems, is given in terms of diabatic electronic states that are coupled to each other and correspond to different nuclear Hamiltonians. Within the M-GQME approach, the effect of the nuclear degrees of freedom on the time evolution of the electronic density matrix is fully captured by a memory kernel superoperator, which can be obtained from short-lived (compared to the time scale of energy/charge transfer) projection-free inputs. In this paper, we test the ability of the M-GQME to predict the energy transfer dynamics within a seven-state benchmark model of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex, with the short-lived projection-free inputs obtained via the Ehrenfest method. The M-GQME with Ehrenfest-based inputs is shown to yield accurate results across a wide parameter range. It is also found to dramatically outperform the direct application of the Ehrenfest method and to provide better-behaved convergence with respect to memory time in comparison to an alternative implementation of the GQME approach previously applied to the same FMO model.},

  abstract = {Stochastic density functional theory (sDFT) is becoming a valuable tool for studying ground-state properties of extended materials. The computational complexity of describing the Kohn–Sham orbitals is replaced by introducing a set of random (stochastic) orbitals leading to linear and often sub-linear scaling of certain ground-state observables at the account of introducing a statistical error. Schemes to reduce the noise are essential, for example, for determining the structure using the forces obtained from sDFT. Recently, we have introduced two embedding schemes to mitigate the statistical fluctuations in the electron density and resultant forces on the nuclei. Both techniques were based on fragmenting the system either in real space or slicing the occupied space into energy windows, allowing for a significant reduction in the statistical fluctuations. For chemical accuracy, further reduction of the noise is required, which could be achieved by increasing the number of stochastic orbitals. However, the convergence is relatively slow as the statistical error scales as 1 / N χ according to the central limit theorem, where N χ is the number of random orbitals. In this paper, we combined the embedding schemes mentioned above and introduced a new approach that builds on overlapped fragments and energy windows. The new approach significantly lowers the noise for ground-state properties, such as the electron density, total energy, and forces on the nuclei, as demonstrated for a G-center in bulk silicon.},

  abstract = {We develop a fast method for computing the electrostatic energy and forces for a collection of charges in doubly periodic slabs with jumps in the dielectric permittivity at the slab boundaries. Our method achieves spectral accuracy by using Ewald splitting to replace the original Poisson equation for nearly singular sources with a smooth far-field Poisson equation, combined with a localized near-field correction. Unlike existing spectral Ewald methods, which make use of the Fourier transform in the aperiodic direction, we recast the problem as a two-point boundary value problem in the aperiodic direction for each transverse Fourier mode for which exact analytic boundary conditions are available. We solve each of these boundary value problems using a fast, well-conditioned Chebyshev method. In the presence of dielectric jumps, combining Ewald splitting with the classical method of images results in smoothed charge distributions, which overlap the dielectric boundaries themselves. We show how to preserve the spectral accuracy in this case through the use of a harmonic correction, which involves solving a simple Laplace equation with smooth boundary data. We implement our method on graphical processing units and combine our doubly periodic Poisson solver with Brownian dynamics to study the equilibrium structure of double layers in binary electrolytes confined by dielectric boundaries. Consistent with prior studies, we find strong charge depletion near the interfaces due to repulsive interactions with image charges, which points to the need for incorporating polarization effects in understanding confined electrolytes, both theoretically and computationally.},

Although the RBM introduces a random perturbation of the interaction forces at each time step, the long time effects of the random perturbations along the sampling process only result in a small bias in the empirical measure of the pmmLang + RBM from the target distribution, which also implies a small error in the thermal average calculation. We numerically study the convergence of the pmmLang + RBM and quantitatively investigate the dependence of the error in computing the thermal average on the parameters such as batch size, time step, and so on. We also propose an extension of the pmmLang + RBM, which is based on the splitting Monte Carlo method and is applicable when the interacting potential contains a singular part.},

Specifically, we discuss how spin correlation can ensue from random encounters of n radicals, i.e., “F-clusters” as a generalization of radical F-pairs, acting as precursors of spin-driven magnetic field effects. Survival probabilities and the spin correlation of the surviving radical population, as well as transients, are evaluated by expanding the spin density operator in an operator basis that is closed under application of the Haberkorn recombination operator and singlet–triplet dephasing. For the primary spin cluster, the steady-state density operator is found to be independent of the details of the recombination network, provided that it is irreducible; pairs of surviving radicals are triplet-polarized independent of whether they are actually reacting with each other. The steady state is independent of the singlet–triplet dephasing, but the kinetics and the population of sister clusters of smaller size can depend on the degree of dephasing. We also analyze reaction-induced singlet–triplet interconversion in radical pairs due to radical scavenging by initially uncorrelated radicals (“chemical Zeno effect”). We generalize previous treatments for radical triads by discussing the effect of spin-selective recombination in the original pair and extending the analysis to four radicals, i.e., radical pairs interacting with two radical scavengers.},

  abstract = {Microscopic mechanisms of natural processes are frequently understood in terms of random walk models by analyzing local particle transitions. This is because these models properly account for dynamic processes at the molecular level and provide a clear physical picture. Recent theoretical studies made a surprising discovery that in complex systems, the symmetry of molecular forward/backward transition times with respect to local bias in the dynamics may be broken and it may take longer to go downhill than uphill. The physical origins of these phenomena remain not fully understood. Here, we explore in more detail the microscopic features of the symmetry breaking in the forward/backward transition times by analyzing exactly solvable discrete-state stochastic models. In particular, we consider a specific case of two random walkers on a four-site periodic lattice as the way to represent the general systems with multiple pathways. It is found that the asymmetry in transition times depends on several factors that include the degree of deviation from equilibrium, the particle crowding, and methods of measurements of dynamic properties. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the asymmetry in transition times can be explored experimentally for determining the important microscopic features of natural processes by quantitatively measuring the local deviations from equilibrium and the degrees of crowding.},

  abstract = {Transition Metal Complexes (TMCs) are known for the rich variety of their excited states showing different nature and degrees of locality. Describing the energies of these excited states with the same degree of accuracy is still problematic when using time-dependent density functional theory in conjunction with the most current density functional approximations. In particular, the presence of unphysically low lying excited states possessing a relevant Charge Transfer (CT) character may significantly affect the spectra computed at such a level of theory and, more relevantly, the interpretation of their photophysical behavior. In this work, we propose an improved version of the M AC index, recently proposed by the authors and collaborators, as a simple and computationally inexpensive diagnostic tool that can be used for the detection and correction of the unphysically predicted low lying excited states. The analysis, performed on five prototype TMCs, shows that spurious and ghost states can appear in a wide spectral range and that it is difficult to detect them only on the basis of their CT extent. Indeed, both delocalization of the excited state and CT extent are criteria that must be combined, as in the M AC index, to detect unphysical states.},

This leads to frequent frustration, common misconceptions, and sometimes erroneous numerical treatment. To improve this, we present the main practically relevant segments of the theory with constant reference to physical intuition. We pinpoint the role of the implicit or explicit definition of the bound state (or the binding site) to make a robust link between an experimental measurement and a computational result. We clarify the role of symmetry and discuss cases where symmetry number corrections have been misinterpreted. In particular, we argue that symmetry corrections as classically presented are a source of confusion and could be advantageously replaced by restraint free energy contributions. We establish that contrary to a common intuition, partial or missing sampling of some modes of symmetric bound states does not affect the calculated decoupling free energies. Finally, we review these questions and pitfalls in the context of a few common practical situations: binding to a symmetric receptor (equivalent binding sites), binding of a symmetric ligand (equivalent poses), and formation of a symmetric complex, in the case of homodimerization.},

The effects of quantum electrodynamics (QED) are included non-perturbatively using the model QED operator that is now implemented for molecules. It is shown that the inclusion of the QED effects in molecular and atomic calculations is a key ingredient in resolving the discrepancy between the theoretical values obtained within the Dirac–Coulomb–Breit Hamiltonian and the experiment. The remaining deviation from the experimental values is within a few meV.

Clusters provide a powerful platform for the study of the properties of local phenomena (e.g., dopants or defect sites in heterogeneous catalysts), the evolution of the band structure and the transition from semiconductor to metallic behavior in metal clusters, control of electronic structures of clusters through electron donating or withdrawing ligands, and the control of magnetic properties by interactions between the photoelectron and remnant neutral states, among other important topics of fundamental interest. This perspective revisits historical, groundbreaking anion PE spectroscopic finding and details more recent advances and insight gleaned from the PE spectra of small covalently or ionically bound clusters. The properties of the broad range of systems studied are uniquely small-cluster like in that incremental size differences are associated with striking changes in stability, electronic structures, and symmetry, but they can also be readily related to larger or bulk species in a broader range of materials and applications.},

  abstract = {Biological processes at the cellular level are stochastic in nature, and the immune response system is no different. Therefore, models that attempt to explain this system need to also incorporate noise or fluctuations that can account for the observed variability. In this work, a stochastic model of the immune response system is presented in terms of the dynamics of T cells and virus particles. Making use of the Green’s function and the Wilemski–Fixman approximation, this model is then solved to obtain the analytical expression for the joint probability density function of these variables in the early and late stages of infection. This is then also used to calculate the average level of virus particles in the system. Upon comparing the theoretically predicted average virus levels to those of COVID-19 patients, it is hypothesized that the long-lived dynamics that are characteristics of such viral infections are due to the long range correlations in the temporal fluctuations of the virions. This model, therefore, provides an insight into the effects of noise on viral dynamics.},

  abstract = {Interactions among ions and their specific interactions with macromolecular solutes are known to play a central role in biomolecular stability. However, similar effects in the conformational stability of protein loops that play functional roles, such as binding ligands, proteins, and DNA/RNA molecules, remain relatively unexplored. A well-characterized enzyme that has such a functional loop is Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase ( ec DHFR), whose so-called M20 loop has been observed in three ordered conformations in crystal structures. To explore how solution ionic strengths may affect the M20 loop conformation, we proposed a reaction coordinate that could quantitatively describe the loop conformation and used it to classify the loop conformations in representative ec DHFR x-ray structures crystallized in varying ionic strengths. The Protein Data Bank survey indicates that at ionic strengths (I) below the intracellular ion concentration-derived ionic strength in E. coli (I ≤ 0.237M), the ec DHFR M20 loop tends to adopt open / closed conformations, and rarely an occluded loop state, but when I is &gt;0.237M, the loop tends to adopt closed / occluded conformations. Distance-dependent electrostatic potentials around the most mobile M20 loop region from molecular dynamics simulations of ec DHFR in equilibrated CaCl 2 solutions of varying ionic strengths show that high ionic strengths (I = 0.75/1.5M) can preferentially stabilize the loop in closed/occluded conformations. These results nicely correlate with conformations derived from ec DHFR structures crystallized in varying ionic strengths. Altogether, our results suggest caution in linking M20 loop conformations derived from crystal structures solved at ionic strengths beyond that tolerated by E. coli to the ec DHFR function.},

The approach could be utilized for exploring the collective dynamics of a membrane protein (system) coupled to the lipid bilayer (environment). However, the application to membrane proteins is limited due to high computational costs of modeling a sufficiently large membrane environment unbiased by end effects, which drastically increases the size of the investigated system. We derived a recursive formula for calculating the reduced Hessian of a membrane protein embedded in a lipid bilayer by decomposing the membrane into concentric cylindrical domains with the protein located at the center. The approach allows for the design of a time- and memory-efficient algorithm and a mathematical understanding of the convergence of the reduced Hessian with respect to increasing membrane sizes. The application to the archaeal aspartate transporter Glt Ph illustrates its utility and efficiency in capturing the transporter’s elevator-like movement during its transition between outward-facing and inward-facing states.},

  abstract = {Interactions in enzymes between catalytic and neighboring amino acids and how these interactions facilitate catalysis are examined. In examples from both natural and designed enzymes, it is shown that increases in catalytic rates may be achieved through elongation of the buffer range of the catalytic residues; such perturbations in the protonation equilibria are, in turn, achieved through enhanced coupling of the protonation equilibria of the active ionizable residues with those of other ionizable residues. The strongest coupling between protonation states for a pair of residues that deprotonate to form an anion (or a pair that accept a proton to form a cation) is achieved when the difference in the intrinsic p K a s of the two residues is approximately within 1 pH unit. Thus, catalytic aspartates and glutamates are often coupled to nearby acidic residues. For an anion-forming residue coupled to a cation-forming residue, the elongated buffer range is achieved when the intrinsic p K a of the anion-forming residue is higher than the intrinsic p K a of the (conjugate acid of the) cation-forming residue. Therefore, the high p K a , anion-forming residues tyrosine and cysteine make good coupling partners for catalytic lysine residues. For the anion–cation pairs, the optimum difference in intrinsic p K a s is a function of the energy of interaction between the residues. For the energy of interaction ε expressed in units of (ln 10)RT, the optimum difference in intrinsic p K a s is within ∼1 pH unit of ε.},

  abstract = {After exciting scientific debates about its nature, the development of the exclusion zone, a region near hydrophilic surfaces from which charged colloidal particles are strongly expelled, has been finally traced back to the diffusiophoresis produced by unbalanced ion gradients. This was done by numerically solving the coupled Poisson equation for electrostatics, the two stationary Stokes equations for low Reynolds numbers in incompressible fluids, and the Nernst–Planck equation for mass transport. Recently, it has also been claimed that the leading mechanism behind the diffusiophoretic phenomenon is electrophoresis [Esplandiu et al. , Soft Matter 16 , 3717 (2020)]. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the exclusion zone based on a one-component interaction model at the Langevin equation level, which leads to simple analytical expressions instead of the complex numerical scheme of previous works, yet being consistent with it. We manage to reproduce the evolution of the exclusion zone width and the mean-square displacements of colloidal particles we measure near Nafion, a perfluorinated polymer membrane material, along with all characteristic time regimes, in a unified way. Our findings are also strongly supported by complementary experiments using two parallel planar conductors kept at a fixed voltage, mimicking the hydrophilic surfaces, and some computer simulations.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) polymers are extended networks of multi-functional repeating units that are covalently linked together but confined to a single plane. The past decade has witnessed a surge in interest and effort toward producing and utilizing 2D polymers. However, facile synthesis schemes suitable for mass production are yet to be realized. In addition, unifying theories to describe the 2D polymerization process, such as those for linear polymers, have not yet been established. Herein, we perform a chemical kinetic simulation to study the recent synthesis of 2D polymers in homogeneous solution with irreversible chemistry. We show that reaction sites for polymerization in 2D always scale unfavorably compared to 3D, growing as molecular weight to the 1/2 power vs 2/3 power for 3D. However, certain mechanisms can effectively suppress out-of-plane defect formation and subsequent 3D growth. We consider two such mechanisms, which we call bond-planarity and templated autocatalysis . In the first, although single bonds can easily rotate out-of-plane to render polymerization in 3D, some double-bond linkages prefer a planar configuration. In the second mechanism, stacked 2D plates may act as van der Waals templates for each other to enhance growth, which leads to an autocatalysis. When linkage reactions possess a 1000:1 selectivity (γ) for staying in plane vs rotating, solution-synthesized 2D polymers can have comparable size and yield with those synthesized from confined polymerization on a surface. Autocatalysis could achieve similar effects when self-templating accelerates 2D growth by a factor β of 10 6 . A combined strategy relaxes the requirement of both mechanisms by over one order of magnitude. We map the dependence of molecular weight and yield for the 2D polymer on the reaction parameters, allowing experimental results to be used to estimate β and γ. Our calculations show for the first time from theory the feasibility of producing two-dimensional polymers from irreversible polymerization in solution.},

Due to the accelerating nature of the branched evolution, we focus on the early stages of growth, identify the critical ramified peaks, and compute the effective time for the dissipation of ions from the vicinity of those branching fingers. The control parameter is a function of the maximum interface curvature (i.e., minimum radius) where the rate of runaway is the highest. The minimization of the total charging time is performed for generating the most packed microstructures, which correlate closely with those of considerably higher charging periods, consisting of constant and uniform square waves. The developed framework could be utilized as a smart charging protocol for safe and sustainable operation of rechargeable batteries, where the branching of the microstructures could be correlated with the sudden variation in the current/voltage.},

  abstract = {In the hybrid sulfur (HyS) cycle, the reaction between SO 2 and H 2 O is manipulated to produce hydrogen with water and sulfuric acid as by-products. However, sulfur poisoning of the catalyst has been widely reported to occur in this cycle, which is due to strong chemisorption of sulfur on the metal surface. The catalysts may deactivate as a result of these impurities present in the reactants or incorporated in the catalyst during its preparation and operation of the HyS cycle. Here, we report a density functional theory investigation of the interaction between S, SO, and SO 3 with the Pt (001), (011), and (111) surfaces. First, we have investigated the adsorption of single gas phase molecules on the three Pt surfaces. During adsorption, the 4F hollow sites on the (001) and (011) surfaces and the fcc hollow site on the (111) surface were preferred. S adsorption followed the trend of (001) 4F &gt; (011) 4F &gt; (111) fcc , while SO adsorption showed (001) 4F &gt; (011) bridge/4F &gt; (111) fcc and SO 3 adsorption was most stable in a S,O,O bound configuration on the (001) 4F &gt; (011) 4F &gt; (111) fcc sites. The surface coverage was increased on all the surfaces until a monolayer was obtained. The highest surface coverage for S shows the trend (001) S = (111) S &gt; (011) S , and for SO it is (001) SO &gt; (011) SO &gt; (111) SO , similar to SO 3 where we found (001) SO3 &gt; (011) SO3 &gt; (111) SO3 . These trends indicate that the (001) surface is more susceptible to S species poisoning. It is also evident that both the (001) and (111) surfaces were reactive toward S, leading to the formation of S 2 . The high coverage of SO 3 showed the formation of SO 2 and SO 4 , especially on the (011) surface. The thermodynamics indicated that an increased temperature of up to 2000 K resulted in Pt surfaces fully covered with elemental S. The SO coverage showed θ ≥ 1.00 on both the (001) and (011) surfaces and θ = 0.78 for the (111) surface in the experimental region where the HyS cycle is operated. Lower coverages of SO 3 were observed due to the size of the molecule.},

Contrary to results reported in certain earlier papers, the new analysis finds that concerted hopping events do occur in all simulations but that the majority of events are the product of proton rattling, where the excess proton will rattle between two or more waters. The results are consistent with the proposed “special-pair dance” model of the hydrated excess proton wherein the acceptor water molecule for the proton transfer will quickly change (resonate between three equivalent special pairs) until a decisive proton hop occurs. To remove the misleading effect of simple rattling, a filter was applied to the trajectory such that hopping events that were followed by back hops to the original water are not counted. A steep reduction in the number of multiple hopping events is found when the filter is applied, suggesting that many multiple hopping events that occur in the unfiltered trajectory are largely the product of rattling, contrary to prior suggestions. Comparing the continuous correlation function of the filtered and unfiltered trajectories, we find agreement with experimental values for the proton hopping time and Eigen–Zundel interconversion time, respectively.},

Failure of the theory is found to be correlated with the dynamic processes that emerged at the interface, but not apparently with the static interface structure. The chemical segregation of Ni and Al atoms occurs before the geometrical ordering upon crystallization at small undercoolings. In contrast, the geometrical ordering precedes the chemical one at deep undercoolings. These two ordering processes show a collapsed time evolution at the crossover temperature consistent with the onset of the theoretical deviation. We rationalize the delayed chemical segregation behavior by the collective atomic motion, which is characterized by the super-Arrhenius transition of the temperature-dependent diffusivity and structural relaxation time at the crossover point.},

However, we also unveil that for some models, small changes in the solution density can have significant effects on modifying the equilibrium balance between the two configurations. We conclude that the thermodynamic stability of contact and solvent-separated ion pairs is very sensitive to the dielectric properties of the underlying simulation model. In general, classical models are very robust in providing a similar estimation of the contact ion pair stability, while this is much more variable in density functional theory-based models. The barrier to transition from the solvent-separated to contact ion pair is fundamentally dependent on the balance between electrostatic potential energy and entropy. This reflects the importance of water intra- and inter-molecular polarizability in obtaining an accurate description of the screened ion–ion interactions.},

  abstract = {Heavy water or deuterium oxide, D 2 O, is used as a solvent in various biophysical and chemical experiments. To model such experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, effective pair potentials for heavy water are required, which reproduce the well-known physicochemical differences relative to light water. We present three effective pair potentials for heavy water, denoted SPC/E-HW, TIP3P-HW, and TIP4P/2005-HW. The models were parameterized by modifying the widely used three- and four-site models for light water, with the aim of maintaining the specific characteristics of the light water models. At room temperature, SPC/E-HW and TIP3P-HW capture the modulations relative to light water of the mass and electron densities, heat of vaporization, diffusion coefficient, and water structure. TIP4P/2005-HW captures, in addition, the density of heavy water over a wide temperature range.},

  abstract = {Plausible methods for accurate determination of equilibrium structures of intermolecular clusters have been assessed for the van der Waals dimer N 2 O⋯CO. In order to assure a large initial dataset of rotational parameters, we first measured the microwave spectra of the 15 N 2 O⋯ 12 CO and 15 N 2 O⋯ 13 CO isotopologs, expanding previous measurements. Then, an anharmonic force field was calculated ab initio and a semi-experimental equilibrium structure was determined. The dimer structure was also calculated at the coupled-cluster level of theory using very large basis sets with diffuse functions and counterpoise correction. It was found that the contributions of the diffuse functions and the counterpoise correction are not additive and do not compensate each other although they have almost the same value but opposite signs. The semi-experimental and ab initio structures were found to be in fair agreement, with the equilibrium distance between the centers of mass of both monomers being 3.825(13) Å and the intermolecular bond length r (C⋯O) = 3.300(9) Å. In this case, the mass-dependent method did not permit us to determine reliable intermolecular parameters. The combination of experimental rotational constants and results of ab initio calculations thus proves to be very sensitive to examine the accuracy of structural determinations in intermolecular clusters, offering insight into other aggregates.},

To validate the importance of NH 2 NO 2 in the Earth’s atmosphere, the ground and first electronic excited states of NH 2 NO 2 were characterized and its photochemistry was investigated using multireference and coupled cluster methods. NH 2 NO 2 is non-planar and of singlet multiplicity in the ground state while exhibiting large out-of-plane rotation in the triplet first excited state. One-dimensional cuts of the adiabatic potential energy surface calculated using the MRCI+Q method show low-lying singlet electronic states with minima in their potential along the N–N and N–O bond coordinates. Due to vertical excitation energies in the 225–180 nm region, photochemical processes will not compete in the troposphere, causing N 2 O production to be the predicted major removal process of NH 2 NO 2 . In the upper atmosphere, photodissociation to form NH 2 NO + O ( 3 P) is suggested to be a major photochemical removal pathway.},

  abstract = {High resolution coherent multidimensional spectroscopy has the ability to reduce congestion and automatically sort peaks by species and quantum numbers, even for simple mixtures and molecules that are extensively perturbed. The two-dimensional version is relatively simple to carry out, and the results are easy to interpret, but its ability to deal with severe spectral congestion is limited. Three-dimensional spectroscopy is considerably more complicated and time-consuming than two-dimensional spectroscopy, but it provides the spectral resolution needed for more challenging systems. This paper describes how to design high resolution coherent 3D spectroscopy experiments so that a small number of strategically positioned 2D scans may be used instead of recording all the data required for a 3D plot. This faster and simpler approach uses new pattern recognition methods to interpret the results. Key factors that affect the resulting patterns include the scanning strategy and the four wave mixing process. Optimum four wave mixing (FWM) processes and scanning strategies have been identified, and methods for identifying the FWM process from the observed patterns have been developed. Experiments based on nonparametric FWM processes provide significant pattern recognition and efficiency advantages over those based on parametric processes. Alternative scanning strategies that use synchronous scanning and asynchronous scanning to create new kinds of patterns have also been identified. Rotating the resulting patterns in 3D space leads to an insight into similarities in the patterns produced by different FWM processes.},

  abstract = {In this work, we provide a nuanced view of electron correlation in the context of transition metal complexes, reconciling computational characterization via spin and spatial symmetry breaking in single-reference methods with qualitative concepts from ligand-field and molecular orbital theories. These insights provide the tools to reliably diagnose the multi-reference character, and our analysis reveals that while strong (i.e., static) correlation can be found in linear molecules (e.g., diatomics) and weakly bound and antiferromagnetically coupled (monometal-noninnocent ligand or multi-metal) complexes, it is rarely found in the ground-states of mono-transition-metal complexes. This leads to a picture of static correlation that is no more complex for transition metals than it is, e.g., for organic biradicaloids. In contrast, the ability of organometallic species to form more complex interactions, involving both ligand-to-metal σ -donation and metal-to-ligand π -backdonation, places a larger burden on a theory’s treatment of dynamic correlation. We hypothesize that chemical bonds in which inter-electron pair correlation is non-negligible cannot be adequately described by theories using MP2 correlation energies and indeed find large errors vs experiment for carbonyl-dissociation energies from double-hybrid density functionals. A theory’s description of dynamic correlation (and to a less important extent, delocalization error), which affects relative spin-state energetics and thus spin symmetry breaking, is found to govern the efficacy of its use to diagnose static correlation.},

Transformations between different equivalent representations of a physical wavefunction that alter the tree structure used in the multi-layer MCTDH wavefunction representation interchange the role of single-particle functions (SPFs) and single-hole functions (SHFs) in the MCTDH formalism. While the physical wavefunction is invariant under these transformations, this invariance does not hold for the standard multi-layer MCTDH equations of motion. Introducing transformed SPFs, which obey normalization conditions typically associated with SHFs, revised equations of motion are derived. These equations do not show the singularities resulting from the inverse single-particle density matrix and are invariant under tree transformations. Based on the revised equations of motion, a new integration scheme is introduced. The scheme combines the advantages of the constant mean-field approach of Beck and Meyer [Z. Phys. D 42 , 113 (1997)] and the singularity-free integrator suggested by Lubich [Appl. Math. Res. Express 2015 , 311].

In this study, we propose techniques to simulate resonances on a quantum computer. First, we transformed the scaled molecular Hamiltonian to second quantization and then used the Jordan–Wigner transformation to transform the scaled Hamiltonian to the qubit space. To obtain the complex eigenvalues, we introduce the direct measurement method, which is applied to obtain the resonances of a simple one-dimensional model potential that exhibits pre-dissociating resonances analogous to those found in diatomic molecules. Finally, we applied the method to simulate the resonances of the H 2 − molecule. The numerical results from the IBM Qiskit simulators and IBM quantum computers verify our techniques.},

During reactive steps, transitions from reactant to product molecules are modeled according to physically correct transition probabilities based on quantum chemical information about the reactions such as molecular reaction rates via instant exchange of the employed force field and a subsequent, short relaxation of the structure. In the first application, we study the follow-up reactions of singly reduced ethylene carbonate (EC) radicals in EC solution, first, via extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and, second, with the reactive step algorithm. A direct comparison of both simulation methods shows excellent agreement. Then, we employ the reactive step algorithm to simulate the enolate formation of 2-methylcyclopropanone with the base lithium diisopropylamine. Thereby, we can demonstrate that the reactive step algorithm is also capable of capturing effects from kinetic vs thermodynamic control of chemical reactions during simulation.},

We first show that by employing the split operator method, the specific structure of the HEOM allows a simple propagation scheme using the Tucker tensor. When the number of effective modes in the HEOM increases and the Tucker representation becomes intractable, the split operator method is extended to the binary tree structure of the HT representation. It is found that to update the binary tree nodes related to a specific effective mode, we only need to propagate a short matrix product state constructed from these nodes. Numerical results show that by further employing the mode combination technique commonly used in the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree approaches, the binary tree representation can be applied to study excitation energy transfer dynamics in a fairly large system including over 10 4 effective modes. The new methods may thus provide a promising tool in simulating quantum dynamics in condensed phases.},

The probability to return to the initial position is computed, as a function of time, by integrating over the particle paths consistent with the physical properties of the model potential. The zero time condition for the first-passage probability defines the constraint to select the integral cutoff for various macroscopic helical conformations, obtained by tuning the twist, bending, and slide motion between adjacent base pairs along the molecule stack. Applying the method to a short homogeneous chain at room temperature, we obtain meaningful estimates for the maximum fluctuations in the twist conformation with ∼10.5 base pairs per helix turn, typical of double stranded DNA helices. Untwisting the double helix, the base pair fluctuations broaden and the integral cutoff increases. The cutoff is found to increase also in the presence of a sliding motion, which shortens the helix contour length, a situation peculiar of dsRNA molecules.},

  abstract = {Protein assembly is often studied in a three-dimensional solution, but a significant fraction of binding events involve proteins that can reversibly bind and diffuse along a two-dimensional surface. In a recent study, we quantified how proteins can exploit the reduced dimensionality of the membrane to trigger complex formation. Here, we derive a single expression for the characteristic timescale of this multi-step assembly process, where the change in dimensionality renders rates and concentrations effectively time-dependent. We find that proteins can accelerate dimer formation due to an increase in relative concentration, driving more frequent collisions, which often win out over slow-downs due to diffusion. Our model contains two protein populations that dimerize with one another and use a distinct site to bind membrane lipids, creating a complex reaction network. However, by identifying two major rate-limiting pathways to reach an equilibrium steady-state, we derive an excellent approximation for the mean first passage time when lipids are in abundant supply. Our theory highlights how the “sticking rate” or effective adsorption coefficient of the membrane is central in controlling timescales. We also derive a corrected localization rate to quantify how the geometry of the system and diffusion can reduce rates of membrane localization. We validate and test our results using kinetic and particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations. Our results establish how the speed of key assembly steps can shift by orders-of-magnitude when membrane localization is possible, which is critical to understanding mechanisms used in cells.},

  abstract = {One of the most exciting and debated aspects of polariton chemistry is the possibility that chemical reactions can be catalyzed by vibrational strong coupling (VSC) with confined optical modes in the absence of external illumination. Here, we report an attempt to reproduce the enhanced rate of cyanate ion hydrolysis reported by Hiura et al. [ chemRxiv:7234721 (2019)] when the collective OH stretching vibrations of water (which is both the solvent and a reactant) are strongly coupled to a Fabry–Pérot cavity mode. Using a piezo-tunable microcavity, we reproduce the reported vacuum Rabi splitting but fail to observe any change in the reaction rate as the cavity thickness is tuned in and out of the strong coupling regime during a given experiment. These findings suggest that there are subtleties involved in successfully realizing VSC-catalyzed reaction kinetics and therefore motivate a broader effort within the community to validate the claims of polariton chemistry in the dark.},

  abstract = {We propose a route for parameterizing isotropic (generalized) Langevin [(G)LE] thermostats with the aim to correct the dynamics of coarse-grained (CG) models with pairwise conservative interactions. The approach is based on the Mori–Zwanzig formalism and derives the memory kernels from Q-projected time correlation functions. Bottom-up informed (GLE and LE) thermostats for a CG star-polymer melt are investigated, and it is demonstrated that the inclusion of memory in the CG simulation leads to predictions of polymer diffusion in quantitative agreement with fine-grained simulations. Interestingly, memory effects are observed in the diffusive regime. We demonstrate that previously neglected cross-correlations between the “irrelevant” and the CG degree of freedom are important and lie at the origin of shortcomings in previous CG simulations.},

  abstract = {Building upon recent developments of force-based estimators with a reduced variance for the computation of densities, radial distribution functions, or local transport properties from molecular simulations, we show that the variance can be further reduced by considering optimal linear combinations of such estimators. This control variates approach, well known in statistics and already used in other branches of computational physics, has been comparatively much less exploited in molecular simulations. We illustrate this idea on the radial distribution function and the one-dimensional density of a bulk and confined Lennard-Jones fluid, where the optimal combination of estimators is determined for each distance or position, respectively. In addition to reducing the variance everywhere at virtually no additional cost, this approach cures an artifact of the initial force-based estimators, namely, small but non-zero values of the quantities in regions where they should vanish. Beyond the examples considered here, the present work highlights, more generally, the underexplored potential of control variates to estimate observables from molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {Fluid interfaces with nanoscale radii of curvature are generating great interest, both for their applications and as tools to probe our fundamental understanding. One important question is what is the smallest radius of curvature at which the three main thermodynamic combined equilibrium equations are valid: the Kelvin equation for the effect of curvature on vapor pressure, the Gibbs–Thomson equation for the curvature-induced freezing point depression, and the Ostwald–Freundlich equation for the curvature-induced increase in solubility. The objective of this Perspective is to provide conceptual, molecular modeling, and experimental support for the validity of these thermodynamic combined equilibrium equations down to the smallest interfacial radii of curvature. Important concepts underpinning thermodynamics, including ensemble averaging and Gibbs’s treatment of bulk phase heterogeneities in the region of an interface, give reason to believe that these equations might be valid to smaller scales than was previously thought. There is significant molecular modeling and experimental support for all three of the Kelvin equation, the Gibbs–Thomson equation, and the Ostwald–Freundlich equation for interfacial radii of curvature from 1 to 4 nm. There is even evidence of sub-nanometer quantitative accuracy for the Kelvin equation and the Gibbs–Thomson equation.},

  abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and other pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are native to neuronal membranes with an unusual lipid composition. While it is well-established that these receptors can be significantly modulated by lipids, the underlying mechanisms have been primarily studied in model membranes with few lipid species. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation to probe specific binding of lipids in a complex quasi-neuronal membrane. We ran a total of 50 μ s of simulations of a single nAChR in a membrane composed of 36 species of lipids. Competition between multiple lipid species produces a complex distribution. We find that overall, cholesterol selects for concave inter-subunit sites and polyunsaturated fatty acids select for convex M4 sites, while monounsaturated and saturated lipids are unenriched in the nAChR boundary. We propose the “density-threshold affinity” as a metric calculated from continuous density distributions, which reduces to a standard affinity in two-state binding. We find that the density-threshold affinity for M4 weakens with chain rigidity, which suggests that flexible chains may help relax packing defects caused by the conical protein shape. For any site, PE headgroups have the strongest affinity of all phospholipid headgroups, but anionic lipids still yield moderately high affinities for the M4 sites as expected. We observe cooperative effects between anionic headgroups and saturated chains at the M4 site in the inner leaflet. We also analyze affinities for individual anionic headgroups. When combined, these insights may reconcile several apparently contradictory experiments on the role of anionic phospholipids in modulating nAChR.},

The time for the conformational transitions of the riboswitch aptamer is longer for the ligand bound state as compared to that of the unbound one. The transition path time of the riboswitch follows a counterintuitive trend as it decreases with an increase in the barrier height. The mean transition path time of either transitions of the riboswitch in the ligand bound/unbound state increases with an increase in the complexity of the surrounding environment due to the caging effect. The results of the probability density function, transition path time distribution, and mean transition path time obtained from the theory qualitatively agree with those obtained from the simulations and with earlier experimental and theoretical studies.},

The shear thinning behavior at larger velocities is in qualitative agreement with macroscopic rheological experiments. The second process, observed at Weissenberg numbers as small as a few percent, appears to have no analog in macro-rheological findings. A simple model introduced earlier captured the observed behavior and implied that the two shear thinning processes correspond to two different length scales in the fluid. This model also reproduces oscillations, which have been observed in this system previously. While the system under macro-shear seems to be near equilibrium for shear rates in the regime of the intermediate Newtonian-like plateau, the one under micro-shear is thus still far from it. The analysis suggests the existence of a length scale of a few micrometres, the nature of which remains elusive.},

We study the supramolecular polymeric membrane prepared by supramolecular emulsion interfacial polymerization (SEIP) on the oil-in-water droplet via the computer simulation method. The factors that may influence its structure and properties are investigated, such as the degree of polymerization and molecular weight distribution (MWD) of products in the polymeric membranes. We find that the SEIP can lead to a higher total degree of polymerization as compared to the supramolecular interfacial polymerization (SIP). However, the average chain length of products in the SEIP is lower than that of the SIP due to its obvious interface curvature. The stoichiometric ratio of reactants in two phases will affect the MWD of the products, which further affects the performance of the membranes in practical applications, such as drug release rate and permeability. Besides, the MWD of the product by SEIP obviously deviates from the Flory distribution as a consequence of the curvature of reaction interface. In addition, we obtain the MWD for the emulsions whose size distribution conforms to the Gaussian distribution so that the MWD may be predicted according to the corresponding emulsion size distribution. This study helps us to better understand the controlling factors that may affect the structure and properties of supramolecular polymeric membranes by SEIP.},

At this point, its structural and thermodynamic properties both in the bulk and in contact with flat structureless walls are well understood. At the same time, the phase behavior of AO mixtures in spherical cavities and cylindrical pores, while thoroughly investigated by simulations, has not received a comparably detailed DFT treatment. In this paper, we use the DFT results for the AO model in the bulk and under planar confinement as a point of reference for studying its thermodynamic and structural properties in cavities and pores. The accuracy of the DFT approach is assessed by comparing its predictions with the available extensive simulation data; good overall agreement is generally found with some notable exceptions in the vicinity of wetting and drying transitions. The deviations of the phase behavior in confinement from the bulk phase diagram are analyzed using the Kelvin equation, which is seen to work reasonably well under moderate confinement, i.e., for sufficiently large radii of confining cavities and pores.},

We show that the effective temperature that enters the tagged particle distribution is the same as the effective temperature defined through the Einstein relation, i.e., it is equal to the ratio of the self-diffusion and tagged particle mobility coefficients. This result shows that this effective temperature, which is defined through a fluctuation–dissipation ratio, is relevant beyond the linear response regime. We verify our theoretical findings through computer simulations. Our theory fails when an additional large length scale appears in our active system. In the system we simulated, this length scale is associated with long-wavelength density fluctuations that emerge upon approaching motility-induced phase separation.},

We characterize the diversity of this dataset over reactants and in time. Artificial neural network models trained on this dataset can predict the most and least probable outcome dimensionalities with 71\% and 95\% accuracies, respectively, using only information about reactant identities, without stoichiometric information. Surprisingly, the amine identity plays only a minor role in most cases, as omitting this information only reduces the accuracy by &lt;2\%. The generality of this model is demonstrated on a time held-out test set of 36 amine-templated lanthanide oxalates, vanadium tellurites, vanadium selenites, vanadates, molybdates, and molybdenum sulfates, whose syntheses and structural characterizations are reported here for the first time, and which contain two new element combinations and four amines that are not present in the CSD.},

Using equilibrium molecular dynamics, we apply our method to estimate the interfacial friction for a simple Lennard-Jones system of argon confined between graphene sheets and a system of water confined between graphene sheets. Our new method shows smaller statistical errors for the friction coefficient than the previous procedure suggested by Hansen et al. Since we only use the interfacial particles, the interfacial friction calculated using our method is solely due to the wall–fluid interactions and is devoid of bulk fluid contributions. The intrinsic nature of the friction coefficient has been validated by measuring the friction coefficient at different interfaces and channel sizes and against direct non-equilibrium molecular dynamics measurements. Our improved methodology is found to be more reliable than the existing equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods and does not suffer from the well-known convergence and correlation-time ambiguities in the methods formulated along Green–Kubo-like ideas.},

  abstract = {Rh(C 2 H 4 ) 2 species grafted on the HY zeolite framework significantly enhance the activation of H 2 that reacts with C 2 H 4 ligands to form C 2 H 6 . While in this case, the simultaneous activation of C 2 H 4 and H 2 and the reaction between these species on zeolite-loaded Rh cations is a legitimate hydrogenation pathway yielding C 2 H 6 , the results obtained for Rh(CO)(C 2 H 4 )/HY materials exposed to H 2 convincingly show that the support-assisted C 2 H 4 hydrogenation pathway also exists. This additional and previously unrecognized hydrogenation pathway couples with the conversion of C 2 H 4 ligands on Rh sites and contributes significantly to the overall hydrogenation activity. This pathway does not require simultaneous activation of reactants on the same metal center and, therefore, is mechanistically different from hydrogenation chemistry exhibited by molecular organometallic complexes. We also demonstrate that the conversion of zeolite-supported Rh(CO) 2 complexes into Rh(CO)(C 2 H 4 ) species under ambient conditions is not a simple CO/C 2 H 4 ligand exchange reaction on Rh sites, as this process also involves the conversion of C 2 H 4 into C 4 hydrocarbons, among which 1,3-butadiene is the main product formed with the initial selectivity exceeding 98\% and the turnover frequency of 8.9 × 10 −3 s −1 . Thus, the primary role of zeolite-supported Rh species is not limited to the activation of H 2 , as these species significantly accelerate the formation of the C 4 hydrocarbons from C 2 H 4 even without the presence of H 2 in the feed. Using periodic density functional theory calculations, we examined several catalytic pathways that can lead to the conversion of C 2 H 4 into 1,3-butadiene over these materials and identified the reaction route via intermediate formation of rhodacyclopentane.},

  abstract = {Due to Fermi-level pinning in metal–two-dimensional MoS 2 junctions, improving the performance of MoS 2 -based electrical devices is still under extensive study. The device performance of few-layer MoS 2 depends strongly on the number of layers. In this work, via density-functional theory calculations, a comprehensive understanding from the atomistic view was reached for the interlayer interaction between metal and few-layer MoS 2 with phase-engineering and intercalation doping, which are helpful for improving the contact performance. These two methods are probed to tune the performance of few-layer MoS 2 -based field-effect transistors, and both of them can tune the Schottky barrier height. Phase-engineering, which means that the MoS 2 layer in contact with metal is converted to the T phase, can transform the Schottky barrier from n - to p -type. Intercalation doping, which takes advantage of annealing and results in metal atom interaction in between MoS 2 layers, makes the MoS 2 layers become quasi-freestanding and converts the indirect bandgap into direct bandgap. Our atomistic insights help improve the performance of few-layer MoS 2 -based electronic devices.},

From the simulations with the FSM, the kinetic growth coefficients are also determined for different orientations of the crystal, analyzing how the coupling to the thermostat affects the estimates of the growth coefficients. At T m , anisotropic interfacial stiffnesses and free energies as well as kinetic growth coefficients are determined from capillary wave fluctuations.

  abstract = {Over the past decade, single-atom alloys (SAAs) have been a lively topic of research due to their potential for achieving novel catalytic properties and circumventing some known limitations of heterogeneous catalysts, such as scaling relationships. In researching SAAs, it is important to recognize experimental evidence of peculiarities in their electronic structure. When an isolated atom is embedded in a matrix of foreign atoms, it exhibits spectroscopic signatures that reflect its surrounding chemical environment. In the present work, using photoemission spectroscopy and computational chemistry, we discuss the experimental evidence from Ag 0.98 Pd 0.02 SAAs that show free-atom-like characteristics in their electronic structure. In particular, the broad Pd4d valence band states of the bulk Pd metal become a narrow band in the alloy. The measured photoemission spectra were compared with the calculated photoemission signal of a free Pd atom in the gas phase with very good agreement, suggesting that the Pd4d states in the alloy exhibit very weak hybridization with their surroundings and are therefore electronically isolated. Since AgPd alloys are known for their superior performance in the industrially relevant semi-hydrogenation of acetylene, we considered whether it is worthwhile to drive the dilution of Pd in the inert Ag host to the single-atom level. We conclude that although site-isolation provides beneficial electronic structure changes to the Pd centers due to the difficulty in activating H 2 on Ag, utilizing such SAAs in acetylene semi-hydrogenation would require either a higher Pd concentration to bring isolated sites sufficiently close together or an H 2 -activating support.},

  abstract = {We use constant potential molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interfacial structure of the cholinium glycinate biocompatible ionic liquid (bio-IL) sandwiched between graphite electrodes with varying potential differences. Through number density profiles, we observe that the cation and anion densities oscillate up to ∼1.5 nm from the nearest electrode. The range of these oscillations does not change significantly with increasing electrode potential. However, the amplitudes of the cation (anion) density oscillations show a notable increase with increasing potential at the negative (positive) electrode. At higher potential differences, the bulkier N(CH 3 ) 3 CH 2 group of cholinium cations ([Ch] + ) overcomes the steric barrier and comes closer to the negative electrode as compared to oxygen atom ( O [ C h ] + ) ⁠ . We observe an increase in the interaction between O [ C h ] + and the positive electrode with a decrease in the distance between them on increasing the potential difference. We also observe hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of [Ch] + cations and oxygens of glycinate anions through the simulated tangential radial distribution function. Orientational order parameter analysis shows that the cation (anion) prefers to align parallel to the negative (positive) electrode at higher applied potential differences. Charge density profiles show a positive charge density peak near the positive electrode at all the potential differences because of the presence of partially positive charged hydrogen atoms of cations and anions. The differential capacitance ( C d ) of the bio-IL shows two constant regimes, one for each electrode. The magnitude of these C d values clearly suggests potential application of such bio-ILs as promising battery electrolytes.},

  abstract = {We have used reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and temperature programmed reaction (TPR) to study the selective hydrogenation of acetylene on both a clean Ag(111) surface and on a Pd/Ag(111) single-atom-alloy surface. The partial hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important catalytic process that is often carried out using PdAg alloys. It is challenging to study the reaction with ultrahigh vacuum techniques because H 2 does not dissociate on Ag(111), and while H 2 will dissociate at Pd sites, H-atom spillover from Pd to Ag sites does not generally occur. We bypassed the H 2 dissociation step by exposing the surfaces to atomic hydrogen generated by the hot filament of an ion gauge. We find that hydrogen atoms react with acetylene to produce adsorbed ethylene at 85 K, the lowest temperature studied. This is revealed by the appearance of a RAIRS peak at 950 cm −1 due to the out-of-plane wagging mode of adsorbed ethylene when acetylene is exposed to a surface on which H atoms are pre-adsorbed. The formation of both ethylene and ethane are detected with TPR, but no acetylene coupling products, such as benzene, were found. From quantitative analysis of the TPR results, the percent conversion and selectivities to ethylene and ethane were determined. Low coverages of Pd enhance the conversion but do so mainly by increasing ethane formation.},

Time scales of structural relaxation are derived as inverse peak frequencies for each investigated response function. For 1,2,6-hexanetriol, the ratios of the time scales are temperature-independent, while a decoupling of time scales is observed for squalane in accordance with the literature. An alternative evaluation approach is made on the squalane data, extracting time scales from the terminal relaxation mode instead of the peak position, and in this case, temperature-independent time-scale ratios are also found for squalane, despite its strong secondary relaxation contribution. Interestingly, the very same ordering of response-function-specific time scales is observed for these two liquids, which is also consistent with the observation made for simple van der Waals-bonded liquids reported previously [Jakobsen et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 136 , 081102 (2012)]. This time-scale ordering is based on the following response functions, from fast to slow dynamics: shear modulus, bulk modulus, dielectric permittivity, longitudinal thermal expansivity coefficient, and longitudinal specific heat. These findings indicate a general relation between the time scales of different response functions and, as inter-molecular interactions apparently play a subordinate role, suggest a rather generic nature of the process of structural relaxation.},

  abstract = {All lithium halides exist in the rock salt crystal structure under ambient conditions. In contrast, common lithium halide classical force fields more often predict wurtzite as the stable structure. This failure of classical models severely limits their range of application in molecular simulations of crystal nucleation and growth. Employing high accuracy density functional theory (DFT) together with classical models, we examine the relative stability of seven candidate crystal structures for lithium halides. We give a detailed examination of the influence of DFT inputs, including the exchange–correlation functional, basis set, and dispersion correction. We show that a high-accuracy basis set, along with an accurate description of dispersion, is necessary to ensure prediction of the correct rock salt structure, with lattice energies in good agreement with the experiment. We also find excellent agreement between the DFT-calculated rock salt lattice parameters and experiment when using the TMTPSS-rVV10 exchange–correlation functional and a large basis set. Detailed analysis shows that dispersion interactions play a key role in the stability of rock salt over closely competing structures. Hartree–Fock calculations, where dispersion interactions are absent, predict the rock salt structure only for LiF, while LiCl, LiBr, and LiI are more stable as wurtzite crystals, consistent with radius ratio rules. Anion–anion second shell dispersion interactions overcome the radius ratio rules to tip the structural balance to rock salt. We show that classical models can be made qualitatively correct in their structural predictions by simply scaling up the pairwise additive dispersion terms, indicating a pathway toward better lithium halide force fields.},

  abstract = {Sodium-based rechargeable battery technologies are being pursued as an alternative to lithium, in part due to the relative abundance of sodium compared to lithium. Despite their low dielectric constant, glyme-based electrolytes are particularly attractive for these sodium-based batteries due to their ability to chelate with the sodium ion and their high electrochemical stability. While the glyme chain length is a parameter that can be tuned to modify solvation properties, charge transport behavior, reactivity, and ultimately battery performance, anion identity provides another tunable variable. Trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate/OTf) and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (TFSI) are chemically similar anions, which are often used in battery electrolytes for lithium-based batteries. In this paper, molecular simulations are used to examine the differences in ion association and charge transport between sodium salts of these two anions at different salt concentrations in glymes with the increasing chain length. The use of the modified force field developed for NaOTf in glymes for the NaTFSI electrolytes was validated by comparing the TFSI–sodium ion radial distribution functions to the results from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on 1.5 M NaTFSI in diglyme. While the ion association behavior as a function of salt concentration showed similar trends for both NaOTf and NaTFSI in tetraglyme and triglyme electrolytes, the dominant solvation structures for the two sets of electrolytes are distinctly different in the monoglyme and diglyme cases. The conductivity is impacted by both the ion association behavior in these electrolytes and the non-vehicular or hopping transport of the anions in these systems.},

In this work, we study the adsorption of oxygen, nitrogen, deuterium, and deuteriated methane gases into MCM-41 using a combination of neutron diffraction analysis and atomistic computer modeling to interpret the measured data. Adsorption is achieved by immersing a sample of MCM-41 in a bath of the relevant gas, keeping the gas pressure constant (0.1 MPa), and lowering the temperature in steps toward the corresponding bulk liquid boiling point. All four gases have closely analogous behaviors, with an initial layering of liquid on the inside surface of the pores, followed by a relatively sharp capillary condensation (CC) when the pore becomes filled with dense fluid, signaled by a sharp decrease in the intensity of (100) Bragg diffraction reflection. At the temperature of CC, there is a marked distortion of the hexagonal lattice of pores, as others have seen, which relaxes close to the original structure after CC, and this appears to be accompanied by notable excess heterogeneity along the pore compared to when CC is complete. In none of the four gases studied does the final density of fluid in the pore fully attain the value of the bulk liquid at its boiling point at this pressure, although it does approach that limit closely near the center of the pore, and in all cases, the pronounced layering near the silica interface seen in previous studies is observed here as well.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a cheaper and greener alternative to conventional organic solvents. Choline chloride (ChCl) mixed with urea at a molar ratio of 1:2 is one of the most common DESs for a wide range of applications such as electrochemistry, material science, and biochemistry. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the effect of urea content on the thermodynamic and transport properties of ChCl and urea mixtures. With increased mole fraction of urea, the number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) between cation–anion and ion–urea decreases, while the number of HBs between urea–urea increases. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) for ChCl–urea and ChCl–ChCl pairs shows a significant decrease as the mole fraction of urea increases. Using the computed RDFs, Kirkwood–Buff Integrals (KBIs) are computed. KBIs show that interactions of urea–urea become stronger, while interactions of urea–ChCl and ChCl–ChCl pairs become slightly weaker with increasing mole fraction of urea. All thermodynamic factors are found larger than one, indicating a non-ideal mixture. Our results also show that self- and collective diffusivities increase, while viscosities decrease with increasing urea content. This is mainly due to the weaker interactions between ions and urea, resulting in enhanced mobilities. Ionic conductivities exhibit a non-monotonic behavior. Up to a mole fraction of 0.5, the ionic conductivities increase with increasing urea content and then reach a plateau.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and dilutions thereof (mainly in H 2 O but also in many other non-aqueous solvents and co-solvent mixtures) have recently attracted great attention. It is well known that DES dilutions exhibit deviations from ideality. Interestingly, the treatment of DES as a mixture of two components or a pseudo-component is by no means trivial when determining deviations in density and, mainly, in viscosity. Herein, we studied aqueous dilutions of one of the most widely studied DES, this is, that composed of choline chloride and urea in a 1:2 molar ratio (e.g., ChCl2U). Using density and viscosity data reported in previous works, we calculated the excess molar volumes ( V E ) and excess viscosities (ln η E ) considering ChCl2U as either a mixture of two components or a pseudo-component, that is, taking the DES molecular weight as M ChCl2U = f ChCl M ChCl + f U M U = 86.58 g mol −1 (with f ChCl = 1/3 and f U = 2/3) or as M * ChCl2U = M ChCl + 2 M U = 259.74 g mol −1 . We found that neither the sign of V E and V E * nor their evolution with temperature was influenced by the use of either M ChCl2U or M * ChCl2U , and only the absolute magnitude of the deviation and the DES content (in wt.\%) at which the minimum appears exhibited some differences. However, ln η E and ln η E * exhibited opposite signs, negative and positive, respectively. The odd achievement of negative ln η E in aqueous dilutions of ChCl2U characterized by the formation of HB networks suggest the treatment of ChCl2U as a pseudo-component as more appropriate. Moreover, the role played by the presence of U in the evolution of ln η E * with temperature was also discussed.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of the electron-nuclear dynamics and relaxation mechanisms of gold and silver nanoclusters and their alloys is important for future photocatalytic, light harvesting, and photoluminescence applications of these systems. In this work, the effect of silver doping on the nonradiative excited state relaxation dynamics of the atomically precise thiolate-protected gold nanocluster [Au 25- n Ag n (SH) 18 ] −1 ( n = 1, 12, 25) is studied theoretically. Time-dependent density functional theory is used to study excited states lying in the energy range 0.0–2.5 eV. The fewest switches surface hopping method with decoherence correction was used to investigate the dynamics of these states. The HOMO–LUMO gap increases significantly upon doping of 12 silver atoms but decreases for the pure silver nanocluster. Doped clusters show a different response for ground state population increase lifetimes and excited state population decay times in comparison to the undoped system. The ground state recovery times of the S 1 –S 6 states in the first excited peak were found to be longer for [Au 13 Ag 12 (SH) 18 ] −1 than the corresponding recovery times of other studied nanoclusters, suggesting that this partially doped nanocluster is best for preserving electrons in an excited state. The decay time constants were in the range of 2.0–20 ps for the six lowest energy excited states. Among the higher excited states, S 7 has the slowest decay time constant although it occurs more quickly than S 1 decay. Overall, these clusters follow common decay time constant trends and relaxation mechanisms due to the similarities in their electronic structures.},

Erbium ions produce single photons at low-loss fiber optic wavelengths, but they have low emission rates, making them challenging to isolate reliably. Here, we tune the size of gold double nanoholes (DNHs) to enhance the emission of single erbium emitters, achieving 50× enhancement over rectangular apertures previously demonstrated. This produces enough enhancement to show emission from single nanocrystals at wavelengths not seen in our previous work, i.e., 400 and 1550 nm. We observe discrete levels of emission for nanocrystals with low numbers of emitters and demonstrate isolating single emitters. We describe how the trapping time is proportional to the enhancement factor for a given DNH structure, giving us an independent way to measure the enhancement. This shows a promising path to achieving single emitter sources at 1550 nm.},

The purpose of this article is to show by means of molecular dynamics simulations how a laser-cooled ion cloud, confined in a linear radio-frequency trap, can reach the ultimate sensitivity providing the detection of individual charged heavy molecular ions. In our simulations, we model the laser-cooled Ca + ions as two-level atoms, confined thanks to a set of constant and time oscillating electrical fields. A singly charged molecular ion with a mass of 10 6 amu is propelled through the ion cloud. The induced change in the fluorescence rate of the latter is used as the detection signal. We show that this signal is due to a significant temperature variation triggered by the Coulomb repulsion and amplified by the radio-frequency heating induced by the trap itself. We identify the optimum initial energy for the molecular ion to be detected, and furthermore, we characterize the performance of the detector for a large range of confinement voltages.},

The realization of that goal depends on our ability to connect spectroscopic observables with molecular structural parameters. In this paper, we use a model Hamiltonian consisting of two anharmonically coupled vibrational modes in electronic ground and excited states with linear and bilinear vibronic coupling terms to simulate polarization-selective 2D EV and 2D VE spectra. We discuss the relationships between the linear vibronic coupling and two-dimensional Huang–Rhys parameters and between the bilinear vibronic coupling term and Duschinsky mixing. We develop a description of the vibronic transition dipoles and explore how the Hamiltonian parameters and non-Condon effects impact their amplitudes and orientations. Using simulated polarization-selective 2D EV and 2D VE spectra, we show how 2D peak positions, amplitudes, and anisotropy can be used to measure parameters of the vibronic Hamiltonian and non-Condon effects. This paper, along with the first in the series, provides the reader with a detailed description of reading, simulating, and analyzing multimode, polarization-selective 2D EV and 2D VE spectra with an emphasis on extracting vibronic coupling parameters from complex spectra.},

Time-dependent peak amplitudes of coherence peaks are also discussed as means for isolating desired signals within the time-domain.

  abstract = {Nanoporous single-layer graphene is promising as an ideal membrane because of its extreme thinness, chemical resistance, and mechanical strength, provided that selective nanopores are successfully incorporated. However, screening and understanding the transport characteristics of the large number of possible pores in graphene are limited by the high computational requirements of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the difficulty in experimentally characterizing pores of known structures. MD simulations cannot readily simulate the large number of pores that are encountered in actual membranes to predict transport, and given the huge variety of possible pores, it is hard to narrow down which pores to simulate. Here, we report alternative routes to rapidly screen molecules and nanopores with negligible computational requirement to shortlist selective nanopore candidates. Through the 3D representation and visualization of the pores’ and molecules’ atoms with their van der Waals radii using open-source software, we could identify suitable C-passivated nanopores for both gas- and liquid-phase separation while accounting for the pore and molecule shapes. The method was validated by simulations reported in the literature and was applied to study the mass transport behavior across a given distribution of nanopores. We also designed a second method that accounts for Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions between atoms to screen selective non-C-passivated nanopores for gas separations. Overall, these visualization methods can reduce the computational requirements for pore screening and speed up selective pore identification for subsequent detailed MD simulations and guide the experimental design and interpretation of transport measurements in nanoporous atomically thin membranes.},

  abstract = {Computation of intermolecular interactions is a challenge in drug discovery because accurate ab initio techniques are too computationally expensive to be routinely applied to drug–protein models. Classical force fields are more computationally feasible, and force fields designed to match symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) interaction energies can remain accurate in this context. Unfortunately, the application of such force fields is complicated by the laborious parameterization required for computations on new molecules. Here, we introduce the component-based machine-learned intermolecular force field (CLIFF), which combines accurate, physics-based equations for intermolecular interaction energies with machine-learning models to enable automatic parameterization. The CLIFF uses functional forms corresponding to electrostatic, exchange-repulsion, induction/polarization, and London dispersion components in SAPT. Molecule-independent parameters are fit with respect to SAPT2+(3) δ MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and molecule-dependent atomic parameters (atomic widths, atomic multipoles, and Hirshfeld ratios) are obtained from machine learning models developed for C, N, O, H, S, F, Cl, and Br. The CLIFF achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) no worse than 0.70 kcal mol −1 in both total and component energies across a diverse dimer test set. For the side chain–side chain interaction database derived from protein fragments, the CLIFF produces total interaction energies with an MAE of 0.27 kcal mol −1 with respect to reference data, outperforming similar and even more expensive methods. In applications to a set of model drug–protein interactions, the CLIFF is able to accurately rank-order ligand binding strengths and achieves less than 10\% error with respect to SAPT reference values for most complexes.},

These response states are then used to construct second-order response reduced one-particle density matrices (1PDMs), which, upon visualization in terms of natural orbitals (NOs), facilitate a rigorous and black-box mapping of the underlying electronic structure with β . We explain the interpretation of different components of the response 1PDMs and the corresponding NOs within both the undamped and damped response theory framework. We illustrate the utility of this new tool by deconstructing β for cis -difluoroethene, para -nitroaniline, and hemibonded OH · + H 2 O complex, computed within the framework of coupled-cluster singles and doubles response theory, in terms of the underlying response 1PDMs and NOs for a range of frequencies.},

This is reflected in the strong memory effect and the non-white noise spectrum, which must be incorporated into a coarse-grained description to correctly predict dynamic properties. To construct a stochastic model that gives rise to the correct non-Markovian dynamics, we propose a Galerkin projection approach, which transforms the exhausting effort of finding an appropriate model to choosing appropriate subspaces in terms of the derivatives of the coarse-grained variables and, at the same time, provides an accurate approximation to the generalized Langevin equation. We introduce the notion of fractional statistics that embodies nonlocal properties. More importantly, we show how to pick subspaces in the Galerkin projection so that those statistics are automatically matched.},

As an application, we study the excited state intramolecular proton transfer of 3-hydroxyflavone in two solvents: methanol and methylcyclohexane. By using a combination of molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling, we find an ultrafast component of the transfer, which is common to the two solvents, and a much slower component, which is active in the protic solvent only. The mechanisms of the two components are explained in terms of intramolecular vibrational redistribution and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding, respectively. Ground and excited state free energies along an effective reaction coordinate are finally obtained allowing for a detailed analysis of the solvent mediated mechanism.},

Using the basic properties of the Stratonovich–Weyl transformation, we further justify a Hamiltonian that we propose for the dynamical propagation of the coupled spin mapping variables and the nuclear ring polymer. The accuracy of the SM-NRPMD method is numerically demonstrated by computing the nuclear position and population auto-correlation functions of non-adiabatic model systems. The results obtained using the SM-NRPMD method agree very well with the numerically exact results. The main advantage of using the spin mapping variables over the harmonic oscillator mapping variables is numerically demonstrated, where the former provides nearly time-independent expectation values of physical observables for systems under thermal equilibrium. We also explicitly demonstrate that SM-NRPMD provides invariant dynamics upon various ways of partitioning the state-dependent and state-independent potentials.},

  abstract = {Spatial stochastic models of single cell kinetics are capable of capturing both fluctuations in molecular numbers and the spatial dependencies of the key steps of intracellular regulatory networks. The spatial stochastic model can be simulated both on a detailed microscopic level using particle tracking and on a mesoscopic level using the reaction–diffusion master equation. However, despite substantial progress on simulation efficiency for spatial models in the last years, the computational cost quickly becomes prohibitively expensive for tasks that require repeated simulation of thousands or millions of realizations of the model. This limits the use of spatial models in applications such as multicellular simulations, likelihood-free parameter inference, and robustness analysis. Further approximation of the spatial dynamics is needed to accelerate such computational engineering tasks. We here propose a multiscale model where a compartment-based model approximates a detailed spatial stochastic model. The compartment model is constructed via a first-exit time analysis on the spatial model, thus capturing critical spatial aspects of the fine-grained simulations, at a cost close to the simple well-mixed model. We apply the multiscale model to a canonical model of negative-feedback gene regulation, assess its accuracy over a range of parameters, and demonstrate that the approximation can yield substantial speedups for likelihood-free parameter inference.},

The effective force and effective mass matrix are important elements in the equations of motion of equilibrium continuity dynamics, where only the zeroth term of an exact series expansion of the phase space propagator is involved. We introduce a machine learning approach for fitting these elements in quantum phase space, leading to a much more efficient integration of the equations of motion. Proof-of-concept applications to realistic molecules demonstrate that machine learning phase space dynamics approaches are possible as well as competent in producing reasonably accurate results with a modest computation effort.},

  abstract = {Spurred by recent technological advances, there is a growing demand for computational methods that can accurately predict the dynamics of correlated electrons. Such methods can provide much-needed theoretical insights into the electron dynamics probed via time-resolved spectroscopy experiments and observed in non-equilibrium ultracold atom experiments. In this article, we develop and benchmark a numerically exact Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method for modeling the dynamics of correlated electrons in real time. AFQMC has become a powerful method for predicting the ground state and finite temperature properties of strongly correlated systems mostly by employing constraints to control the sign problem. Our initial goal in this work is to determine how well AFQMC generalizes to real-time electron dynamics problems without constraints. By modeling the repulsive Hubbard model on different lattices and with differing initial electronic configurations, we show that real-time AFQMC is capable of accurately capturing long-lived electronic coherences beyond the reach of mean field techniques. While the times to which we can meaningfully model decrease with increasing correlation strength and system size as a result of the exponential growth of the dynamical phase problem, we show that our technique can model the short-time behavior of strongly correlated systems to very high accuracy. Crucially, we find that importance sampling, combined with a novel adaptive active space sampling technique, can substantially lengthen the times to which we can simulate. These results establish real-time AFQMC as a viable technique for modeling the dynamics of correlated electron systems and serve as a basis for future sampling advances that will further mitigate the dynamical phase problem.},

Major advances in chemical synthesis have allowed us to discover new artificial water channels, rivaling with or even surpassing water conductance and selectivity of natural protein channels. In order to interpret experimental features and understand microscopic determinants for performance improvements, numerical approaches based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling methods have been proposed. In this study, we quantify the influence of microscopic observables, such as channel radius and hydrogen bond connectivity, and of meso-scale features, such as the size of self-assembly blocks, on the permeation rate of a self-assembled nanocrystal-like artificial water channel. Although the absolute permeation rate extrapolated from these simulations is overestimated by one order of magnitude compared to the experimental measurement, the detailed analysis of several observed conductive patterns in large assemblies opens new pathways to scalable membranes with enhanced water conductance for the future design.},

  abstract = {Due to the extraordinary catalytic activity in redox reactions, the noble metal, rhodium, has substantial industrial and laboratory applications in the production of value-added chemicals, synthesis of biomedicine, removal of automotive exhaust gas, and so on. The main drawback of rhodium catalysts is its high-cost, so it is of great importance to maximize the atomic efficiency of the precious metal by recognizing the structure–activity relationship of catalytically active sites and clarifying the root cause of the exceptional performance. This Perspective concerns the significant progress on the fundamental understanding of rhodium chemistry at a strictly molecular level by the joint experimental and computational study of the reactivity of isolated Rh-based gas phase clusters that can serve as ideal models for the active sites of condensed-phase catalysts. The substrates cover the important organic and inorganic molecules including CH 4 , CO, NO, N 2 , and H 2 . The electronic origin for the reactivity evolution of bare Rh x q clusters as a function of size is revealed. The doping effect and support effect as well as the synergistic effect among heteroatoms on the reactivity and product selectivity of Rh-containing species are discussed. The ingenious employment of diverse experimental techniques to assist the Rh 1 - and Rh 2 -doped clusters in catalyzing the challenging endothermic reactions is also emphasized. It turns out that the chemical behavior of Rh identified from the gas phase cluster study parallels the performance of condensed-phase rhodium catalysts. The mechanistic aspects derived from Rh-based cluster systems may provide new clues for the design of better performing rhodium catalysts including the single Rh atom catalysts.},

In this work, we investigate the interactions between BPQ and DNA molecules via first-principles calculations. We identify six possible DNA adducts with BPQ. In addition to the four adducts forming covalent bonds, there are two adducts bound purely by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Remarkably, the two vdW-bound adducts have comparable, if not larger, binding energies as the covalent adducts.

  abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is used to address the remarkable persistence of the native Arrhenius dependence of the 2-aminopropanol substrate radical rearrangement reaction in B 12 -dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL) from Salmonella typhimurium from physiological to cryogenic (220 K) temperatures. Two-component TEMPOL spin probe mobility in the presence of 10 mM (0.08\% v/v) 2-aminopropanol over 200–265 K demonstrates characteristic concentric aqueous-cosolvent mesodomain and protein-associated domain (PAD, hydration layer) solvent phases around EAL in the frozen solution. The mesodomain formed by the relatively small amount of 2-aminopropanol is highly confined, as shown by an elevated temperature for the order–disorder transition (ODT) in the PAD (230–235 K) and large activation energy for TEMPOL rotation. Addition of 2\% v/v dimethylsulfoxide expands the mesodomain, partially relieves PAD confinement, and leads to an ODT at 205–210 K. The ODT is also manifested as a deviation of the temperature-dependence of the EPR amplitude of cob(II)alamin and the substrate radical, bound in the enzyme active site, from Curie law behavior. This is attributed to an increase in sample dielectric permittivity above the ODT at the microwave frequency of 9.5 GHz. The relatively high frequency dielectric response indicates an origin in coupled protein surface group–water fluctuations of the Johari–Goldstein β type that span spatial scales of ∼0.1–10 Å on temporal scales of 10 −10 –10 −7 s. The orthogonal EPR spin probe rotational mobility and solvent dielectric measurements characterize features of EAL protein–solvent dynamical coupling and reveal that excess substrate acts as a fluidizing cryosolvent to enable native enzyme reactivity at cryogenic temperatures.},

  abstract = {One of the key bottlenecks in the development of high voltage electrical systems is the identification of suitable insulating materials capable of supporting high voltages. Under high voltage scenarios, conventional polymer based insulators, which are one of the popular choices of insulators, suffer from the drawback of space charge accumulation, which leads to degradation in desirable electronic properties and facilitates dielectric breakdown. In this work, we aid the development of novel polymers for high voltage insulation applications by enabling the rapid prediction of properties that are correlated with dielectric breakdown, i.e.,the bandgap ( E gap ) of the polymer and electron injection barrier (Φ e ) at the electrode–insulator interface. To accomplish this, density functional theory based methods are used to develop large, chemically diverse datasets of Φ e and E gap . The deviation of the computed properties from experimental observations is addressed using a statistical technique called Bayesian calibration. Furthermore, to enable rapid estimation of these properties for a large set of polymers, machine learning models are developed using the created dataset. These models are further used to predict E gap and Φ e for a set of 13k previously known polymers. Polymers with high values of these properties are selected as potential high voltage insulators and are recommended for synthesis. Finally, the models developed here are deployed at www.polymergenome.org to enable the community use.},

The classic methods to compute the polarizabilities of liquid crystals assume an average number density of molecules that is equal in all directions.

This new strategy hence allows for the computation of both the anisotropic polarizabilities and the anisotropic thermal-expansion coefficients of liquid crystals. The model is applied to the liquid crystals 4- n -pentyl-4′-cyanobiphenyl and N -(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline, yielding polarizabilities similar to those reported for these materials. For these nematic liquid crystals, the results imply the existence of a positive thermal-expansion coefficient in the direction perpendicular to the director vector throughout the entire nematic temperature range and a negative thermal-expansion coefficient parallel to the director vector near the temperature of the nematic–isotropic transition. At the isotropization temperature, there exists divergent and critical behavior of the anisotropic thermal-expansion coefficients, consistent with the typical discontinuity of volume in first-order transitions.},

To this end, we perform all-atom molecular dynamic simulations of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid membranes at different hydration levels at 308 K. As dehydration increases, the lipid area per head group decreases with an increase in bilayer thickness and lipid order parameters indicating bilayer ordering. Concurrently, translational and rotational dynamics of interfacial water (IW) molecules near membranes slow down. On the onset of bilayer ordering, the IW molecules exhibit prominent features of dynamical heterogeneity evident from non-Gaussian parameters and one-dimensional van Hove correlation functions. At a fully hydrated state, diffusion constants ( D ) of the IW follow a scaling relation, D ∼ τ α − 1 ⁠ , where the α relaxation time ( τ α ) is obtained from self-intermediate scattering functions. However, upon dehydration, the relation breaks and the D of the IW follows a power law behavior as D ∼ τ α − 0.57 ⁠ , showing the signature of glass dynamics. τ α and hydrogen bond lifetime calculated from intermittent hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions undergo a similar crossover in association with bilayer ordering on dehydration. The bilayer ordering is accompanied with an increase in fraction of caged lipids spanned over the bilayer surface and a decrease in fraction of mobile lipids due to the non-diffusive dynamics. Our analyses reveal that the microscopic mechanism of lipid ordering by dehydration is governed by dynamical heterogeneity. The fundamental understanding from this study can be applied to complex bio-membranes to trap functionally relevant gel-like domains at room temperature.},

Enclosure within a confined space can also influence energy transfer pathways, such as the enhancement of fluorescence over thermal relaxation. In this paper, the effect of confinement on the thermodynamic properties and reaction kinetics of small hydrophobic molecules confined in a soft polymeric template is detailed. A quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiment identified a substantial decrease in translational diffusion of pyrrole after solubilization within a hydrophobic cavity. This decrease in mobility is due to pyrrole’s closer packing and increased density under confinement vs the bulk liquid. The decreased mobility and increased density explain the spontaneous polymerization reaction of pyrrole observed within the cavity. The precise characterization of the polymerization kinetics under confinement found that the reaction is independent of pyrrole concentration, consistent with the close packing density. Kinetic data also show that confinement dimensionality finds a thermodynamic expression in the transition state entropy. The dynamics and kinetics experiments reported here offer rare empirical insight into the important influence that cavity geometry places on the reactions they host.},

The FTIR spectra were found to be relatively insensitive to all of these perturbations, and 2D-IR spectroscopy revealed that this was due to the overwhelming influence of heterogeneity on the spectral line shape. Surprisingly, the deconvoluted spectral line shapes showed that there were only slight differences in the heterogeneous and homogeneous dynamics even with the drastic macroscopic changes occurring in different systems. In the context of modeling polymer behavior, the results confirm that dynamics on the ultrafast time scale need not be included to properly model PDMS elasticity.},

  abstract = {Under numerous circumstances, many soft and hard materials are present in a puzzling wealth of non-equilibrium amorphous states, whose properties are not stationary and depend on preparation. They are often summarized in unconventional “phase diagrams” that exhibit new “phases” and/or “transitions” in which time, however, is an essential variable. This work proposes a solution to the problem of theoretically defining and predicting these non-equilibrium phases and their time-evolving phase diagrams, given the underlying molecular interactions. We demonstrate that these non-equilibrium phases and the corresponding non-stationary (i.e., aging) phase diagrams can indeed be defined and predicted using the kinetic perspective of a novel non-equilibrium statistical mechanical theory of irreversible processes. This is illustrated with the theoretical description of the transient process of dynamic arrest into non-equilibrium amorphous solid phases of an instantaneously quenched simple model fluid involving repulsive hard-sphere plus attractive square well pair interactions.},

  abstract = {The high activity and selectivity of Fe-based heterogeneous catalysts toward a variety of reactions that require the breaking of strong bonds are offset in large part by their considerable instability with respect to oxidative deactivation. While it has been shown that the stability of Fe catalysts is considerably enhanced by alloying them with precious metals (even at the single-atom limit), rational design criteria for choosing such secondary metals are still missing. Since oxidative deactivation occurs due to the strong binding of oxygen to Fe and reduction by adsorbed hydrogen mitigates the deactivation, we propose here to use the binding affinity of oxygen and hydrogen adatoms as the basis for rational design. As it would also be beneficial to use cheaper secondary metals, we have scanned over a large subset of 3d–5d mid-to-late transition metal single atoms and computationally determined their effect on the oxygen and hydrogen adlayer binding as a function of chemical potential and adsorbate coverage. We further determine the underlying chemical origins that are responsible for these effects and connect them to experimentally tunable quantities. Our results reveal a reliable periodic trend wherein oxygen binding is weakened greatest as one moves right and down the periodic table. Hydrogen binding shows the same trend only at high (but relevant) coverages and otherwise tends to have its binding slightly increased in all systems. Trends with secondary metal coverage are also uncovered and connected to experimentally tunable parameters.},

  abstract = {Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have recently gained considerable attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis research due to their potential for novel catalytic properties. While SAAs are often examined in reactions of reductive atmospheres, such as hydrogenation reactions, in the present work, we change the focus to AgPd SAAs in oxidative environments since Pd has the highest catalytic activity of all metals for oxidative reactions. Here, we examine how the chemical reactivity of AgPd SAAs differs from its constituent Pd in an oxidative atmosphere. For this purpose, electronic structure changes in an Ag 0.98 Pd 0.02 SAA foil in 1 mbar of O 2 were studied by in situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and compared with the electronic structure of a Pd foil under the same conditions. When heated in an oxidative atmosphere, Pd in Ag 0.98 Pd 0.02 partly oxidizes and forms a metastable PdO x surface oxide. By using a peak area modeling procedure, we conclude that PdO x on Ag 0.98 Pd 0.02 is present as thin, possibly monolayer thick, PdO x islands on the surface. In comparison to the PdO formed on the Pd foil, the PdO x formed on AgPd is substantially less thermodynamically stable, decomposing at temperatures about 270 °C lower than the native oxide on Pd. Such behavior is an interesting property of oxides formed on dilute alloys, which could be potentially utilized in catalytic oxidative reactions such as methane oxidation.},

The first of these defects is VO: the oxygen atom, twofold coordinated, saturates the unpaired electrons of two of the four carbon atoms on first neighbors of the vacancy. The two remaining unpaired electrons on the first neighbors of the vacancy can combine to give a triplet (S z = 1) or a singlet (S z = 0) state; both states are investigated for the neutral form of the defect, together with the doublet solution, the ground state of the negatively charged defect. Defects containing two, three, and four oxygen atoms, in conjunction with the vacancy V, are also investigated as reported in many experimental papers: VO 2 and VOO i (two oxygen atoms inside the vacancy, or one in the vacancy and one in interstitial position between two Si atoms) and VO 2 O i and VO 2 2O i (containing three and four oxygen atoms). This study integrates and complements a recent investigation referring to O i defects [Gentile et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 054502 (2020)].

However, the optimization of the catalyst remains desirable for industrial applications. Herein, 25 transition metals, including Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au, are selected to replace the central Fe atom for screening out better single-atom catalysts for the NCM. Using the performance on the activation of methane, such as the adsorption energy of methane, the dissociation energy, and the barrier of methane as the screening descriptors, Mn©SiO 2 , Fe©SiO 2 , W©SiO 2 , and Re©SiO 2 are first screened out. The remarkable performance of the four catalysts on methane activation is attributed to the unique geometric structure and the d z 2 orbitals of the central metal crossing over the Fermi level, which can benefit the interaction between methane and the catalysts. By considering the catalytic performance on the whole pathway of methane to ethylene, W©SiO 2 is finally selected as the most active catalyst for the NCM, which has the lowest rate-determining barrier of 1.62 eV and the smallest free energy span (1.06 eV) of the overall catalytic cycle.},

  abstract = {The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an insulating film on anode surfaces in Li-ion batteries, which forms via the reaction of Li ions with reduced electrolyte species. The SEI leads to a reduction in the electrochemical current in heterogeneous electrochemical redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Hence, the growth of the SEI is, in principle, self-limited. Toward our ultimate goal of an improved understanding of SEI formation, we develop a baseline quantitative model within Butler–Volmer electrode kinetics, which describes the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of a flat macroelectrode during SEI growth. Here, the SEI building up electrochemically during CV forms a homogeneous single-phase electronically insulating thin film due to the corresponding current. The model is based on a dynamically evolving electron tunneling barrier with increasing film thickness. Our objective is to provide a framework, which allows for both the qualitative, intuitive interpretation of characteristic features of CV measurements and the quantitative extraction of physicochemical parameters via model fitting. We also discuss the limitations of the baseline model and give a brief outlook for improvements. Finally, comparisons to exemplary CVs from the literature relevant to Li-ion battery science are presented.},

Because of the inertness of its basal plane, however, it is essential to find ways that make it catalytically active. Herein, by means of density functional theory based calculations of reaction pathways and activation energy barriers and accompanying kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that while S vacancy row structures activate the MoS 2 basal plane, further enhancement of chemical activity and selectivity can be achieved by interfacing the MoS 2 layer with a metallic support. When defect-laden MoS 2 is grown on Cu(111), there is not only an increase in the active region (surface area of active sites) but also charge transfer from Cu to MoS 2 , resulting in a shift of the Fermi level such that the frontier states (d orbitals of the exposed Mo atoms) appear close to it, making the MoS 2 /Cu(111) system ready for catalytic activity. Our calculated thermodynamics of reaction pathways lead to the conclusion that the Cu(111) substrate promotes both methanol and ethanol as the products, while kinetic Monte Carlo simulations suggest a high selectivity toward the formation of ethanol.},

With models corresponding to experimental concentrations of 50\% Zr and 50\% Ta cations, we search for, gather, and analyze two-level systems (TLSs) from molecular dynamic simulations. The mechanical loss function is calculated for each TLS individually. The results show that TLS with low asymmetry and large elastic coupling constants contribute the most to mechanical loss. We identify these as “bad actors.” The higher barriers relate to the mechanical loss at higher temperatures. The concept of the oxygen cage that describes the local structural environment surrounding a metal ion is introduced. The existence of a drastic change in local environment, or a cage-breaking process, enables us to understand the double peaks present in the asymmetry distribution and provides a pictorial interpretation to distinguish two types of TLS. Quantitatively, a cage-breaking event is related to at least one large distance change in an atom–atom pair, and non-cage-breaking transitions have only small rearrangements. The majority of TLSs are cage-breaking transitions, but non-cage-breaking TLS transitions show higher average mechanical loss in ZrO 2 -doped Ta 2 O 5 . By decomposing the contributions to mechanical loss, we find that the low temperature loss peak near 40 K mainly comes from non-cage-breaking TLS transitions and the second loss peak near 120 K originates from cage-breaking TLS transitions. This finding is important for understanding the interplay between the atomic structure of TLS and mechanical loss.},

We explore monodisperse systems with two patch geometries: a 12-patch geometry that enhances the formation of icosahedral clusters and an 8-patch geometry that does not appear to strongly favor any particular local structure. We show that both geometries avoid crystallization and present glassy features at low temperatures. However, the 8-patch geometry better preserves the structure of a simple liquid at a wide range of temperatures and packing fractions, making it a good candidate for a monodisperse glass former.},

  abstract = {Electrostatic properties are important for understanding and modeling many phenomena, such as the adsorption of a catalytic metal upon an oxide support. The charge transfer between the metal and the support can lead to positive or negative charges on the metal. Here, the static dipole polarizability is computed for atomic platinum in charge states 0, +1, and −1 in several low-lying electronic terms and levels. Core pseudopotentials are used along with coupled-cluster theory. The best results are estimates for the coupled-cluster CCSDTQ/q-aug-cc-pwCV∞Z-PP values for atomic terms, combined with compositional data from spin–orbit configuration interaction. The polarizability of the anion Pt − is especially challenging for the theory with wildly varying results from different coupled-cluster perturbative approximations such as CCSD(T). For atomic mercury (Hg), selected as a nearby experimental value, our polarizability volume is larger than experiment by 0.8 bohrs 3 (or 0.12 × 10 −30 m 3 ). For the ground level of neutral platinum, Pt( 3 D 3 ), we find α 0 = (41.2 ± 1.1) bohrs 3 or (6.10 ± 0.16) × 10 −30 m 3 . A handful of density functional theory methods are tested and found generally within 10\% of our best values.},

  abstract = {Vibrational predissociation processes of the H 2 O + Ar complex ion following mid-infrared excitations of the OH stretching modes and bending overtone of the H 2 O + unit were studied by photofragment ion imaging. The anisotropy parameters, β , of the angular distributions of the photofragment ions were clearly dependent on the type (branch) of rotational excitation, β &gt; 0 for the P-branch excitations, while β &lt; 0 for the Q-branch excitations, which were consistent with the previous theoretical predictions for the rotationally resolved optical transition of a prolate symmetric top. The translational energy distributions had a similar form, irrespective of the excitation modes. This result suggests that the prepared excited states underwent a common relaxation pathway via the bending or bending overtone state of the H 2 O + unit. In addition, the available energy was preferentially distributed into the rotational energy of the H 2 O + fragment ions rather than the translational energy. The mechanism of the rotational excitations of the H 2 O + fragment ions was discussed based on the steric configuration of the H 2 O + and Ar units at the moment of dissociation.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy provides access to equilibrium dynamics with the extraction of the frequency-fluctuation correlation function (FFCF) from the measured spectra. Several different methods of obtaining the FFCF from experimental spectra, such as the center line slope (CLS), ellipticity, phase slope, and nodal line slope, all depend on the geometrical nature of the 2D line shape and necessarily require spectral extent in order to achieve a measure of the FFCF. Amplitude measures, on the other hand, such as the inhomogeneity index, rely only on signal amplitudes and can, in principle, be computed using just a single point in a 2D spectrum. With a pulse shaper-based 2D-IR spectrometer, in conjunction with phase cycling, we separate the rephasing and nonrephasing signals used to determine the inhomogeneity index. The same measured data provide the absorptive spectrum, needed for the CLS. Both methods are applied to two model molecular systems: tungsten hexacarbonyl (WCO 6 ) and methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl [Cp′Mn(CO) 3 , MCMT]. The three degenerate IR modes of W(CO) 6 lack coherent modulation or noticeable intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) and are used to establish a baseline comparison. The two bands of the MCMT tripod complex include intraband coherences and IVR as well as likely internal torsional motion on a few-picosecond time scale. We find essentially identical spectral diffusion, but faster, non-equilibrium dynamics lead to differences in the FFCFs extracted with the two methods. The inhomogeneity index offers an advantage in cases where spectra are complex and energy transfer can mimic line shape changes due to frequency fluctuations.},

  abstract = {In condensed molecular matter, low-frequency modes (LFMs) associated with specific molecular motions are excited at room temperature and determine essential physical and chemical properties of materials. LFMs, with typical mode energies of up to ∼500 cm −1 (62 meV), contribute significantly to thermodynamic parameters and functions (e.g., heat capacity and entropy) and constitute the basis for room temperature molecular dynamics (e.g., conformational fluctuations and change). LFMs are often analyzed indirectly by the measurement of their effect on specific high-frequency modes (HFMs); the LFM–HFM coupling is reflected in the lineshape, as well as in the spectral and angular diffusion of the HFM. Two-dimensional terahertz-infrared-visible (2D TIRV) spectroscopy allows measuring the LFM–HFM coupling directly and can thereby provide new insights into the strength and nature of the coupling and the character of LFMs. However, the interference between the different signals generated by different excitation pathways can complicate 2D TIRV spectra, preventing a straightforward analysis. Here, we develop an experimental method to distinguish different excitation pathways in 2D TIRV spectroscopy and plot them separately in different quadrants of a 2D spectrum. We validate this method by measuring the spectra of CaF 2 and nitrogen gas. For CaF 2 , only sum-frequency mixing between infrared and terahertz fields generates the signal. In contrast, for N 2 , only difference-frequency mixing is observed. We then use this method to separate sum- and difference-frequency pathways in the 2D TIRV spectrum of liquid water, verifying the previous interpretation of the lineshape of the 2D TIRV spectrum of water.},

  abstract = {Cathodes are critical components of rechargeable batteries. Conventionally, the search for cathode materials relies on experimental trial-and-error and a traversing of existing computational/experimental databases. While these methods have led to the discovery of several commercially viable cathode materials, the chemical space explored so far is limited and many phases will have been overlooked, in particular, those that are metastable. We describe a computational framework for battery cathode exploration based on ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS), an approach that samples local minima on the potential energy surface to identify new crystal structures. We show that by delimiting the search space using a number of constraints, including chemically aware minimum interatomic separations, cell volumes, and space group symmetries, AIRSS can efficiently predict both thermodynamically stable and metastable cathode materials. Specifically, we investigate LiCoO 2 , LiFePO 4 , and Li x Cu y F z to demonstrate the efficiency of the method by rediscovering the known crystal structures of these cathode materials. The effect of parameters, such as minimum separations and symmetries, on the efficiency of the sampling is discussed in detail. The adaptation of the minimum interatomic distances on a species-pair basis, from low-energy optimized structures to efficiently capture the local coordination environment of atoms, is explored. A family of novel cathode materials based on the transition-metal oxalates is proposed. They demonstrate superb energy density, oxygen-redox stability, and lithium diffusion properties. This article serves both as an introduction to the computational framework and as a guide to battery cathode material discovery using AIRSS.},

  abstract = {Molecular modeling plays an important role in the discovery of organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) for zeolites. By quantifying the intensity of host–guest interactions, it is possible to select cost-effective molecules that maximize binding toward a given zeolite framework. Over the last few decades, a variety of methods and levels of theory have been used to calculate these binding energies. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the best calculation strategy for high-throughput virtual screening undertakings. In this work, we compare binding affinities from density functional theory (DFT) and Dreiding force field calculations for 272 zeolite–OSDA pairs obtained from static and time-averaged simulations. Enabled by automation software, we show that Dreiding binding energies from the frozen pose method correlate best with DFT energies. They are also less sensitive to the choice of initial lattice parameters and optimization algorithms, as well as less computationally expensive than their time-averaged counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a broader exploration of the conformation space from molecular dynamics simulations does not provide significant improvements in binding energy trends over the frozen pose method despite being orders of magnitude more expensive. The code and benchmark data are open-sourced and provide robust and computationally efficient guidelines to calculating binding energies in zeolite–OSDA pairs.},

  abstract = {In recent years, π-conjugated polymers are attracting considerable interest in view of their light-dependent torsional reorganization around the π-conjugated backbone, which determines peculiar light-emitting properties. Motivated by the interest in designing conjugated polymers with tunable photoswitchable pathways, we devised a computational framework to enhance the sampling of the torsional conformational space and, at the same time, estimate ground- to excited-state free-energy differences. This scheme is based on a combination of Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Method (REM), parallel bias metadynamics, and free-energy perturbation theory. In our scheme, each REM samples an intermediate unphysical state between the ground and the first two excited states, which are characterized by time-dependent density functional theory simulations at the B3LYP/6-31G * level of theory. We applied the method to a 5-mer of 9,9-dioctylfluorene and found that upon irradiation, this system can undergo a dihedral inversion from −155° to 155°, crossing a barrier that decreases from 0.1 eV in the ground state (S 0 ) to 0.05 eV and 0.04 eV in the first (S 1 ) and second (S 2 ) excited states. Furthermore, S 1 and even more S 2 were predicted to stabilize coplanar dihedrals, with a local free-energy minimum located at ±44°. The presence of a free-energy barrier of 0.08 eV for the S 1 state and 0.12 eV for the S 2 state can trap this conformation in a basin far from the global free-energy minimum located at 155°. The simulation results were compared with the experimental emission spectrum, showing a quantitative agreement with the predictions provided by our framework.},

We observe that this effect remains when all couplings besides nearest-neighbor are omitted from the Hamiltonian, which suggests that it is not sensitive to the rate of decay of the interactions. In contrast to DMRG, which is tailored to the one-dimensional case, ML-MCTDH (as implemented in the Heidelberg MCTDH package) requires more computational time and memory, although the requirements are still within reach of commodity hardware. The numerical convergence and computational demand of two practical implementations of ML-MCTDH and DMRG are presented in detail for various combinations of system parameters.},

  abstract = {A widely used strategy for simulating the charge transfer between donor and acceptor electronic states in an all-atom anharmonic condensed-phase system is based on invoking linear response theory to describe the system in terms of an effective spin-boson model Hamiltonian. Extending this strategy to photoinduced charge transfer processes requires also taking into consideration the ground electronic state in addition to the excited donor and acceptor electronic states. In this paper, we revisit the problem of describing such nonequilibrium processes in terms of an effective three-state harmonic model. We do so within the framework of nonequilibrium Fermi’s golden rule (NE-FGR) in the context of photoinduced charge transfer in the carotenoid–porphyrin–C 60 (CPC 60 ) molecular triad dissolved in explicit tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this end, we consider different ways for obtaining a three-state harmonic model from the equilibrium autocorrelation functions of the donor–acceptor, donor–ground, and acceptor–ground energy gaps, as obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the CPC 60 /THF system. The quantum-mechanically exact time-dependent NE-FGR rate coefficients for two different charge transfer processes in two different triad conformations are then calculated using the effective three-state model Hamiltonians as well as a hierarchy of more approximate expressions that lead to the instantaneous Marcus theory limit. Our results show that the photoinduced charge transfer in CPC 60 /THF can be described accurately by the effective harmonic three-state models and that nuclear quantum effects are small in this system.},

Once a has been calculated, the thermal conductivity can be obtained from λ = ρc V a , where ρ is the density of the liquid and c V is the constant-volume heat capacity. The use of this formula requires an accurate quantum mechanical heat capacity c V , which can be obtained from a path integral molecular dynamics simulation. The thermal diffusivity can be calculated either from the decay of the equilibrium density fluctuations in the liquid or by using the Green–Kubo relation to calculate the CMD approximation to λ and then dividing this by the corresponding approximation to ρc V . We show that both approaches give the same results for liquid para -hydrogen and that these results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity over a wide temperature range. In particular, they correctly predict a decrease in the thermal conductivity at low temperatures—an effect that stems from the decrease in the quantum mechanical heat capacity and has eluded previous para -hydrogen simulations. We also show that the method gives equally good agreement with the experimental measurements for the thermal conductivity of normal liquid helium.},

  abstract = {We investigate the validity of the classical approximation to the numerically exact quantum dynamics for infrared laser-driven control of isomerization processes. To this end, we simulate the fully quantum mechanical dynamics both by wavepacket propagation in position space and by propagating the Wigner function in phase space employing a quantum-mechanical correction term. A systematic comparison is made with purely classical propagation of the Wigner function. On the example of a one-dimensional double well potential, we identify two complementary classes of pulse sequences that invoke either a quantum mechanically or a classically dominated control mechanism. The quantum control relies on a sequence of excitations and de-excitations between the system’s eigenstates on a time scale far exceeding the characteristic vibrational oscillation periods. In contrast, the classical control mechanism is based on a short and strong few-cycle field exerting classical-like forces driving the wavepacket to the target potential well where it is slowed down and finally trapped. While in the first case, only the quantum mechanical propagation correctly describes the field-induced population transfer, the short pulse case is also amenable to a purely classical description. These findings shed light on the applicability of classical approximations to simulate laser-controlled dynamics and may offer a guideline for novel control experiments in more complex systems that can be analyzed and interpreted utilizing efficient state-of-the-art classical trajectory simulations based on ab initio molecular dynamics.},

Numerical tools for assessing drift in MD simulations are outlined, and drift rates of 10 −6 K/ μ s are demonstrated for molten salts, polar liquids, and room temperature ionic liquids. Such drift rates are six orders of magnitude smaller than those typically quoted in the literature. To achieve this, the standard Ewald method is slightly modified so the first four derivatives of the real space terms go smoothly to zero at the truncation distance, r c . New methods for determining standard Ewald errors and the new perturbation errors introduced by the smoothing procedure are developed and applied, these taking charge correlation effects explicitly into account. The shadow Hamiltonian, E s , is shown to be the strictly conserved quantity in these systems, and standard errors in the mean of one part in 10 10 are routinely calculated. Expressions for the shadow Hamiltonian are improved over previous work by accounting for O ( h 4 ) terms, where h is the MD time step. These improvements are demonstrated by means of extreme out-of-equilibrium simulations. Using the new methodology, the very low diffusion coefficients of room temperature 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride are determined from long NVE trajectories in which the equations of motion are known to be integrated correctly, with negligible drift.},

  abstract = {Ionization potential and electron affinity are essential molecular properties. The most straightforward method is to calculate them by taking the total energy differences of the initial and final states according to the definition. However, it often suffers from a serious convergence problem due to the requirement of the self-consistent field (SCF) calculations for the ionic states with non-Aufbau choices of occupations. In the present work, we have constructed a theoretical framework in view of perturbation theory to bypass the SCF calculations of the ionic states. To address the imbalance issue that arises from the precisely treated neutral ground state followed by the truncated perturbative treatment of the ionic states, an accurate yet effective method has been developed here, which adds back some terms from the higher order perturbations into the lower order to cancel out the most computationally cost terms in the truncated expansion, thus reaching a better convergence with less computation. The validity of the present methodology has been tested out by applying it to the Hartree–Fock (HF) method in combination with the correlation effect described at the second-order Møller–Plesset level in a frozen-orbital approximation. All the derivations in this work are given in a general framework, which are applicable not only to HF but also to a wide range of density functional theory methods from semi-local functionals to hybrid and doubly hybrid functionals.},

Tuning system parameters, such as temperature, viscosity, or concentration, can invert the effect of resetting on the mean completion time of the process, which leads to a resetting transition. Although the resetting transition has been recently studied for diffusion in a handful of model potentials, it is yet unknown whether the results follow any universality in terms of well-defined physical parameters. To bridge this gap, we propose a general framework that reveals that the resetting transition is governed by an interplay between the thermal and potential energy. This result is illustrated for different classes of potentials that are used to model a wide variety of stochastic processes with numerous applications.},

  abstract = {Magnesium and calcium play an essential role in the folding and function of nucleic acids. To correctly describe their interactions with DNA and RNA in biomolecular simulations, an accurate parameterization is crucial. In most cases, the ion parameters are optimized based on a set of experimental solution properties such as solvation free energies, radial distribution functions, water exchange rates, and activity coefficient derivatives. However, the transferability of such bulk-optimized ion parameters to quantitatively describe biomolecular systems is limited. Here, we extend the applicability of our previous bulk-optimized parameters by including experimental binding affinities toward the phosphate oxygen on nucleic acids. In particular, we systematically adjust the combination rules that are an integral part of the pairwise interaction potentials of classical force fields. This allows us to quantitatively describe specific ion binding to nucleic acids without changing the solution properties in the most simple and efficient way. We show the advancement of the optimized Lorentz combination rule for two representative nucleic acid systems. For double-stranded DNA, the optimized combination rule for Ca 2+ significantly improves the agreement with experiments, while the standard combination rule leads to unrealistically distorted DNA structures. For the add A-riboswitch, the optimized combination rule for Mg 2+ improves the structure of two specifically bound Mg 2+ ions as judged by the experimental distance to the binding site. Including experimental binding affinities toward specific ion binding sites on biomolecules, therefore, provides a promising perspective to develop a more accurate description of metal cations for biomolecular simulations.},

Here, we focus on the simplest nanopore system, where non-interacting particles diffuse through a pore separating reservoirs. We find that the concentration difference between both sides (akin to the osmotic pressure drop) exhibits fractional noise in time t with mean square average that grows as t 1/2 . This originates from the diffusive exchange of particles from one region to another. We fully rationalize this effect, with particle simulations and analytic solutions. We further infer the parameters (pore radius and pore thickness) that control this exotic behavior. As a consequence, we show that the number of particles within the pore also exhibits fractional noise. Such fractional noise is responsible for noise spectral density scaling as 1/ f 3/2 with frequency f , and we quantify its amplitude. Our theoretical approach is applicable to more complex nanoporous systems (for example, with adsorption within the pore) and drastically simplifies both particle simulations and analytic calculus.},

These methods are quite diverse, from many-body wave function techniques in real space or determinant space to being used to sum perturbative expansions. This growth has been spurred by the more favorable scaling with the number of electrons and often better parallelization over large numbers of central processing unit (CPU) cores or graphical processing units (GPUs) than for high-end non-stochastic wave function based methods. This special issue of the Journal of Chemical Physics includes 33 papers that describe recent developments and applications in this area. As seen from the articles in the issue, stochastic electronic structure methods are applicable to both molecules and solids and can accurately describe systems with strong electron correlation. This issue was motivated, in part, by the 2019 Telluride Science Research Center workshop on Stochastic Electronic Structure Methods that we organized. Below we briefly describe each of the papers in the special issue, dividing the papers into six subtopics.},

Interestingly, such studies of dihydrofolate reductase show that a single-site mutation from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid can reverse the pressure-dependent monotonic decrease in activity to that in a monotonic pressure-dependent activation. This residue is near the active site but is not thought to directly participate in the catalytic mechanism. Here, the ways that addition of one carbon to the entire protein could lead to such a profound difference in pressure effects are explored using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicate that the glutamate changes the coupling between a helix and the β -sheet due to the extra flexibility of the side chain, which further changes correlated motions of other regions of the protein.},

Nevertheless, questions related, in particular, to the allosteric coupling between its gates remain open. The many currently available x-ray crystallography structures appear to correspond to various stages of activation and inactivation, offering insights into the molecular basis of these mechanisms. Since these studies have required mutations, complexation with antibodies, and substitution of detergents in place of lipids, examining the channel under more native conditions is desirable. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) can be used to study the wild-type protein under activating conditions (low pH), at room temperature, and in bacteriomimetic liposomes. In this work, we sought to structurally assign the activated state present in SSNMR experiments. We used a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, chemical shift prediction algorithms, and Bayesian inference techniques to determine which of the most plausible x-ray structures resolved to date best represents the activated state captured in SSNMR. We first identified specific nuclei with simulated NMR chemical shifts that differed significantly when comparing partially open vs fully open ensembles from MD simulations. The simulated NMR chemical shifts for those specific nuclei were then compared to experimental ones, revealing that the simulation of the partially open state was in good agreement with the SSNMR data. Nuclei that discriminate effectively between partially and fully open states belong to residues spread over the sequence and provide a molecular level description of the conformational change.},

It is found that AlaN 3 is a positionally sensitive probe for the local dynamics, covering a frequency range of ∼15 cm −1 for the center frequency of the line shape. This is consistent with findings from selective replacements of amino acids in PDZ2, which reported a frequency span of ∼10 cm −1 for replacements of Val, Ala, or Glu by azidohomoalanine. For the frequency fluctuation correlation functions, the long-time decay constants τ 2 range from ∼1 to ∼10 ps, which compares with experimentally measured correlation times of 3 ps. Attaching azide to alanine residues can yield dynamics that decays to zero on the few ps time scale (i.e., static component Δ 0 ∼ 0 ps −1 ) or to a remaining, static contribution of ∼0.5 ps −1 (corresponding to 2.5 cm −1 ), depending on the local environment on the 10 ps time scale. The magnitude of the static component correlates qualitatively with the degree of hydration of the spectroscopic probe. Although attaching azide to alanine residues is found to be structurally minimally invasive with respect to the overall protein structure, analysis of the local hydrophobicity indicates that the hydration around the modification site differs for modified and unmodified alanine residues, respectively.},

Here, we use computer simulations and free-energy calculations to characterize vacancies and interstitials in FCC and BCC crystals of point-Yukawa particles.

We derive a zero-field theory for the disjoining pressure between two parallel flat plates. The polyelectrolyte is allowed to enter the confined interplate region at the cost of a conformational free energy penalty. The resulting disjoining pressure shows a crossover to a repulsive regime when the interplate separation gets smaller than the size of the polyelectrolyte chain, followed by an attractive part.

This elevated diffusion was observed over a small range of temperatures below T gs for these surfaces, and at other temperatures, the diffusion was similar to that on silicon, although the diffusion coefficient for PEO on polystyrene at temperatures above T gs did not completely decrease to that on silicon, in contrast to the PAMA surfaces. It is concluded that the enhanced surface mobility of the films near the surface glass transition temperature induces conformational changes in the adsorbed PEO. The origin of this narrow and dramatic increase in diffusion coefficient is not clear, but it is proposed that it is caused by a coupling of a dominant capillary mode in the liquid surface layer with the polymer. Friction force microscopy experiments also demonstrate an unexpected increase in friction at the same temperature as the increase in diffusion coefficient.},

  abstract = {We study a two-dimensional system composed by Active Brownian Particles (ABPs), focusing on the onset of Motility Induced Phase Separation (MIPS), by means of molecular dynamics simulations. For a pure hard-disk system with no translational diffusion, the phase diagram would be completely determined by their density and Péclet number. In our model, two additional effects are present: translational noise and the overlap of particles; we study the effects of both in the phase space. As we show, the second effect can be mitigated if we use, instead of the standard Weeks–Chandler–Andersen potential, a stiffer potential: the pseudo-hard sphere potential. Moreover, in determining the boundary of our phase space, we explore different approaches to detect MIPS and conclude that observing dynamical features, via the non-Gaussian parameter, is more efficient than observing structural ones, such as through the local density distribution function. We also demonstrate that the Vogel–Fulcher equation successfully reproduces the decay of the diffusion as a function of density, with the exception of very high densities. Thus, in this regard, the ABP system behaves similar to a fragile glass.},

  abstract = {Continuum computations of fluid flow in conduits approaching molecular scales are often executed with a certain level of abstractions via the imposition of a pre-defined slip condition at the wall. However, in reality, the interfacial slip may not be affixed a priori as a direct one-to-one mapping with the surface wettability and charge but is implicitly interconnected with the concomitant dynamical events that may be effectively captured only under flow conditions. The flow in nanofluidic channels with axially varying cross sections hallmarks such situations in which the effective slip at the wall gets dynamically modulated by upstream flow conditions and cannot be trivially stamped as guided by localized intermolecular interactions over interfacial scales alone. In an effort to capture such flows without resorting to full-domain molecular dynamics simulations, here we bring out advancements on hybrid molecular-continuum simulations and report predictions that closely capture molecular dynamics based predictions of water transport through converging nanopores. Our results turn out to be of significant implications toward designing of emerging nanoscale devices of multifarious applications ranging from miniaturized reactors to highly targeted drug delivery systems.},

The formulated DESs exhibit a large electrochemical window (ΔE &gt; 2.5 V), good thermal stability (∼150 °C) and ionic conductivity (3–4 mS cm −1 ), and moderate viscosity (11.3 mPa s). Through the Vogel–Tamman–Vulcher fitting equation, the evolution of pseudo-energy activation was delineated with respect to the nature of the H-bond donor or alkali salt. These electrolytes present a superionic character gleaned from the Walden classification, and their ionicity exceeds that of standard organic electrolytes based on similar alkali salts. The performance of the AC-based EDLC was assessed by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge, yielding 140 F g −1 with an 8\% capacity retention during 200 h of floating. Based on the physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance of these DESs, they represent a promising green-alternative electrolyte for supercapacitor applications.},

High selectivity of chemical products (methanol and acetaldehyde) was observed. Moreover, the hybrid photocatalyst’s solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency was 13.5 times higher than that of pure GO. The increased production yield stems from the co-catalytic and sensitizing role of P3HT in the hybrid system due to its ability to extend light absorption to the visible range and improve interfacial charge transfer to GO. The hybrid P3HT-GO formed a type II heterojunction, and its static and dynamic exciton behaviors were examined using fluorescence spectroscopy and exciton lifetime mapping. A reduced fluorescence decay time was observed by interfacial manipulation for improved dispersion, indicating a more efficient charge transfer from the excited P3HT to GO. Thus, the conducting polymer nanoparticles, 2D nanocarbon, have demonstrated superior performance as a metal-free, non-toxic, low-cost, and scalable heterogeneous photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction to solar fuel, a solid–gas system.},

  abstract = {Confinement plays an important role in determining ion transport in porous materials, which, in turn, may influence the performance of many energy storage and desalination devices. In this work, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with an implicit solvation model and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to investigate the effects of nanoconfinement on several solvated alkaline metal cations in a single-digit 1T-MoS 2 nanochannel. Our DFT calculations with a solvation model indicated that cations with stronger hydration energy introduce a higher number of co-intercalated water molecules into the channel, consistent with early experimental observation obtained for MXene (2D transition metal carbide) channels. The predicted optimal water numbers for the cations were then used for AIMD simulations that explicitly include the effects of the solvent. When compared with the cations in bulk solution, our simulations showed that the hydration structure and coordination number (CN) of the solvated cations confined in the MoS 2 channel can be significantly altered. We found that larger cations with weaker hydration energy (K + , Rb + , and Cs + ) exhibited a distinctive CN decrease under confinement, while smaller cations (Li + and Na + ) retained a similar hydration shell as in the bulk solution. More specifically, the hydration shell of large cations (K + , Rb + , and Cs + ) in MoS 2 showed similar features of the coordination angle to the bulk, which suggests the partially broken hydration shell with no geometry change under confinement. Our simulations provided insights into the change of the hydration structure of alkaline metal cations under confinement, which may have important implications on their transport in the 1T-MoS 2 channel.},

Herein, we present an in-depth study of the correlation between metal–oxide interactions and the properties of the supported metal using CO adsorption on Me 1 (Fe 1 , Co 1 , and Ni 1 ) loaded over CeO 2 (111) doped with divalent (Ca, Sr, and Ba), trivalent (Al, Ga, Sc, Y, and La), and quadrivalent (Hf and Zr) heterocations. CO adsorption over Me 1 is strongly dependent on the binding energies of Me 1 . Two factors led to this trend. First, the extent of the Me 1 –surface oxygen (Me 1 –O) bond relaxation during CO adsorption played a key role. Second, the d -band center shifted drastically because of charge transfer to the oxides. The shift is related to the oxophilicity of metals. Adsorption energies of Me 1 over oxides include the contributions of the factors described above. Therefore, we can predict the activities of Me 1 using the strength of anchoring by oxide supports. Results show that smaller ionic radii of the doped heterocations were associated with more tightly bound Me 1 . This finding sheds light on the possibility of heterocation-doping manipulating the reactivity of the Me 1 catalyst based on theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {The structure and dynamics of water droplets on a bilayer graphene surface are investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of solid/water and air/water interfaces on the local structure of water droplets are analyzed in terms of the hydrogen bond distribution and tetrahedral order parameter. It is found that the local structure in the core region of a water droplet is similar to that in liquid water. On the other hand, the local structure of water molecules at the solid/water and air/water interfaces, referred to as the interface and surface regions, respectively, consists mainly of three-coordinated molecules that are greatly distorted from a tetrahedral structure. This study reveals that the dynamics in different regions of the water droplets affects the intermolecular vibrational density of states: It is found that in the surface and interface regions, the intensity of vibrational density of states at ∼50 cm −1 is enhanced, whereas those at ∼200 and ∼500 cm −1 are weakened and redshifted. These changes are attributed to the increase in the number of molecules having fewer hydrogen bonds in the interface and surface regions. Both single-molecule and collective orientation relaxations are also examined. Single-molecule orientation relaxation is found to be marginally slower than that in liquid water. On the other hand, the collective orientation relaxation of water droplets is found to be significantly faster than that of liquid water because of the destructive correlation of dipole moments in the droplets. The negative correlation between distinct dipole moments also yields a blueshifted libration peak in the absorption spectrum. It is also found that the water–graphene interaction affects the structure and dynamics of the water droplets, such as the local water structure, collective orientation relaxation, and the correlation between dipole moments. This study reveals that the water/solid and water/air interfaces strongly affect the structure and intermolecular dynamics of water droplets and suggests that the intermolecular dynamics, such as energy relaxation dynamics, in other systems with interfaces are different from those in liquid water.},

  abstract = {Atomic force microscopy can observe structures of liquids (solvents) on solid surfaces as oscillating force curves. The oscillation originates from the solvation force, which is affected by the interaction between the probe, substrate, and solvents. To investigate the effects of the interactions on the force curve, we calculated the force curves by integral equation theory with various probe and substrate conditions. The probe solvophilicity affected the force curves more than the substrate solvophilicity in our calculation, and its reason is qualitatively explained by the amount of the desolvated solvents. We evaluated the probes and parameters in terms of the qualitative estimation of the number density distribution of the solvent on the wall. The negative of the force curve’s derivative with respect to the surface separation reflected the number density distribution better than the force curve. This parameter is based on the method that is proposed previously by Amano et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 18 , 15534 (2016)]. The normalized frequency shift can also be used for the qualitative estimation of the number density distribution if the cantilever amplitude is small. Solvophobic probes reflected the number density distribution better than the solvophilic probes. Solvophilic probes resulted in larger oscillation amplitudes than solvophobic probes and are suitable for measurements with a high S/N ratio.},

In this paper, we present a new approach to this problem by exploiting the artificial neural network to describe the vibrational frequencies without relying on the deconstruction of the vibrational Hamiltonian. To this end, we first explored the use of the methodology to predict the frequency fluctuations of the amide I mode of N-methylacetamide in water. The results show good performance compared with the previous experimental and theoretical results. In the second part, the neural network approach is used to investigate the frequency fluctuations of the highly coupled carbonyl stretch modes for the organic carbonates in the solvation shell of the lithium ion. In this case, the frequency fluctuation predicted by the neural networks shows a good agreement with the experimental results, which suggests that this model can be used to describe the dynamics of the frequency in highly coupled transitions.},

  abstract = {Complex formation between pyrene (Py) and N , N -dimethylaniline (DMA) is presented in a deep eutectic solvent constituting of tetra- n -butylammonium chloride (TBAC) and n -decanoic acid (DA) in a 1:2 mol ratio, respectively, named TBAC:DA. The addition of DMA to a Py solution of TBAC:DA results in the formation of a fluorescent Py-DMA charge-transfer complex, which is manifested via a broad structureless bathochromically shifted band centered at 550(±2) nm. The solvatochromic nature of the Py-DMA fluorescent complex indicates the solvent polarity of TBAC:DA to be higher than that of methanol. The absence of a negative pre-exponential factor in the intensity decay at 550 nm combined with the excitation scans implies the presence of weak interaction between Py and DMA in the ground-state, leading to the rapid formation of a Py-DMA complex possibly at a sub-nanosecond time scale. The Stern–Volmer quenching constant ( K SV ) varies from 53(±2) to 96(±1) M −1 , and the bimolecular quenching rate constant ( k q ) varies from 3.0(±0.4) × 10 8 to 8.8(±1.3) × 10 8 M −1 s −1 by increasing the temperature ( T ) from 283.15 to 313.15 K, implying efficient deactivation of electron-acceptor Py in the excited-state induced effectively by the electron-donor DMA within TBAC:DA. ln k q varies linearly with 1/ T with an activation energy ( E a ) of 26.4(±0.4) kJ mol −1 . The linear behavior between k q and 1/ η suggests conformity to the Stokes–Einstein relationship within TBAC:DA. The Py-DMA complex formation efficiency increases with an increase in T and reaches maxima at 298.15 K before decreasing with a further increase in T . The initial reduction in η favors Py-DMA complex formation; this effect is overcome by preferential thermal deactivation of the Py-DMA fluorescent complex as compared to that of pyrene.},

  abstract = {Frequency-dependence of specific heat in supercooled hard sphere liquid is computed using quantum mode-coupling theory (QMCT). Mode-coupling equations are solved using a recently proposed perturbative method that allows us to study relaxation in the moderate quantum regime where quantum effects assist liquid to glass transition. Zwanzig’s formulation is used to compute the frequency-dependent specific heat in the supercooled state using dynamical information from QMCT. Specific heat shows strong variation as the quantumness of the liquid is changed, which becomes more significant as density is increased. It is found that, near the transition point, different dynamical modes contribute to specific heat in classical and quantum liquids.},

  abstract = {Single-ion Soret coefficients α i characterize the tendency of ions in an electrolyte solution to move in a thermal gradient. When these coefficients differ between cations and anions, an electric field can be generated. For this so-called electrolyte Seebeck effect to occur, different thermodiffusive fluxes need to be blocked by boundaries—electrodes, for example. Local charge neutrality is then broken in the Debye-length vicinity of the electrodes. Confusingly, many authors point to these regions as the source of the thermoelectric field yet ignore them in derivations of the time-dependent Seebeck coefficient S ( t ), giving a false impression that the electrolyte Seebeck effect is purely a bulk phenomenon. Without enforcing local electroneutrality, we derive S ( t ) generated by a binary electrolyte with arbitrary ionic valencies subject to a time-dependent thermal gradient. Next, we experimentally measure S ( t ) for five acids, bases, and salts near titanium electrodes. For the steady state, we find S ≈ 2 mV K −1 for many electrolytes, roughly one order of magnitude larger than the predictions based on literature α i . We fit our expression for S ( t ) to the experimental data, treating the α i as fit parameters, and also find larger-than-literature values, accordingly.},

  abstract = {The Kauzmann temperature ( T K ) of a supercooled liquid is defined as the temperature at which the liquid entropy becomes equal to that of the crystal. The excess entropy, the difference between liquid and crystal entropies, is routinely used as a measure of the configurational entropy , whose vanishing signals the thermodynamic glass transition. The existence of the thermodynamic glass transition is a widely studied subject, and of particular recent interest is the role of dimensionality in determining the presence of a glass transition at a finite temperature. The glass transition in water has been investigated intensely and is challenging as the experimental glass transition appears to occur at a temperature where the metastable liquid is strongly prone to crystallization and is not stable. To understand the dimensionality dependence of the Kauzmann temperature in water, we study computationally bulk water (three-dimensions), water confined in the slit pore of the graphene sheet (two-dimensions), and water confined in the pore of the carbon nanotube of chirality (11,11) having a diameter of 14.9 Å (one-dimension), which is the lowest diameter where amorphous water does not always crystallize into nanotube ice in the supercooled region. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we compute the entropy of water in bulk and under reduced dimensional nanoscale confinement to investigate the variation of the Kauzmann temperature with dimension. We obtain a value of T K (133 K) for bulk water in good agreement with experiments [136 K (C. A. Angell, Science 319 , 582–587 (2008) and K. Amann-Winkel et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 110 , 17720–17725 (2013)]. However, for confined water, in two-dimensions and one-dimension, we find that there is no finite temperature Kauzmann point (in other words, the Kauzmann temperature is 0 K). Analysis of the fluidicity factor, a measure of anharmonicity in the oscillation of normal modes, reveals that the Kauzmann temperature can also be computed from the difference in the fluidicity factor between amorphous and ice phases.},

The generalization is convenient for constraining the center of mass in crystals with atoms of differing masses, and it helps to optimize the free energy calculations.

Using these center of mass finite size corrections, we compute the true free energies of these crystals for different system sizes to eliminate the intrinsic finite-size effects. These calculations help demonstrate the size of these finite-size corrections relative to other contributions to the absolute free energy of the crystals.},

The fraction of water in the DES was varied systematically to cover different regimes, starting from the pure DES and its water-in-DES mixtures to the diluted electrolyte solutions. Depending on these parameters, different physical states were examined, including low viscosity liquid, supercooled viscous liquid, amorphous solid, and freeze-concentrated solution. Both the ionic conductivity and the reorientational relaxation exhibited characteristic features of glassy dynamics that could be quantified from the deviation from the Arrhenius temperature dependence and non-exponential decay of the relaxation function. A transition occurred between the water-in-DES regime (40 wt.\%), where a clear rotation–translation decoupling was observed. This suggests that for a low water content, on the timescale covered by this study (∼10 −6 to 1 s), the rotational and transport properties of ethaline aqueous solutions obey classical hydrodynamic scaling despite these systems being presumably spatially microheterogeneous. A fractional scaling is observed in the DES-in-water regime due to the formation of a maximally freeze-concentrated DES aqueous solution coexisting with frozen water domains at sub-ambient temperature.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide and water can form solid clathrate structures in which water cages encapsulate the gas molecules. Such hydrates have sparked much interest due to their possible application in CO 2 sequestration. How the solid structure forms exactly from the liquid phase via a homogenous nucleation process is still poorly understood. This nucleation event is rare on the molecular timescale even under moderate undercooling or supersaturation conditions because of the large free energy barrier toward crystallization, rendering a brute force simulation of hydrate nucleation unfeasible for moderate undercooling or supersaturation. Here, we perform transition interface sampling simulations to quantify the homogenous nucleation rate for CO 2 hydrate formation using accurate atomistic force fields at 500 bars for three different temperatures between 260 and 273 K. Collecting more than 100 000 pathways comprising roughly two milliseconds of simulation time, we computed a nucleation rate in the amorphous phase of ∼10 21 nuclei s −1 cm −3 for a temperature of 260 K and a rate of ∼10 12 nuclei s −1 cm −3 for a temperature of 265 K. For a temperature of 273 K, we find that the hydrate forms an sI crystalline phase with a rate of order of ∼10 1 nuclei s −1 cm −3 . We compare these rates to classical nucleation theory estimates as well as experiments, and to nucleation rate estimates for methane hydrates and discuss possible causes of the observed differences. Our findings shed light on the kinetics of this important clathrate and should assist in future hydrate formation investigation.},

  abstract = {In fluids, the compressibility and related thermodynamic properties can be obtained from Kirkwood–Buff integrals (KBIs), i.e., infinite volume integrals over the radial distribution function (RDF). KBI theory has never been applied to crystals because the KBIs diverge when computed in the standard way as running integrals. Here, we show that KBI theory can be applied to solids without divergence, provided that the recently developed finite volume KBI method is used. In order to accelerate the integral convergence as a function of system size, we introduce a physically motivated convolution of the RDF. When using the convoluted RDF and an extrapolation of the finite-volume KBI, the zero-temperature KBI converges very fast to the exact value. We apply the theory to solid argon at finite temperatures. The RDF is computed with a Lennard-Jones potential using Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, and the isothermal compressibility κ T is obtained from the KBI. The variation of κ T with temperature agrees very well with experiment. The absolute value of κ T is, however, underestimated by 40\%–50\%, which is attributed to finite size effects of the RDF obtained from molecular simulation. The error can be corrected by a single scaling factor that can be easily calculated at zero temperature. By extending Kirkwood–Buff solution theory to solids, this work lays a new framework for the thermodynamic modeling of complex structures, alloys, and solid solutions.},

Many order parameters have been developed for various kinds of structures, such as body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and liquid. Order parameters for water have also been suggested but need further study. There has been no thorough investigation of the classification capability of many existing order parameters. In this work, we investigate the capability of 493 order parameters to classify the three structures of ice: Ih, Ic, and liquid. A total of 159 767 496 combinations of the order parameters are also considered. The investigation is automatically and systematically performed by machine learning. We find the best set of two bond-orientational order parameters, Q 4 and Q 8 , to distinguish the three structures with high accuracy and robustness. A set of three order parameters is also suggested for better accuracy.},

  abstract = {Classical molecular and lattice dynamics were applied to explore the structure and dynamics of water on different surfaces of vaterite, the least abundant calcium carbonate polymorph. Surfaces were generated starting from the three possible structural models for vaterite (monoclinic, hexagonal/trigonal, and triclinic) and pre-screened using their surface energies in an implicit solvent. Surfaces with energies lower than 0.55 J/m 2 were then run in explicit water. The majority of these surfaces dissolve in less than 100 ns, highlighting the low stability of this phase in abiotic environments. Three stable surfaces were identified; they exhibited only minor structural changes when in contact with explicit water and did not show any tendency to dissolve during 1 µ s molecular dynamics simulations. The computed water density profiles show that all these surfaces have two distinct hydration layers. The water residence time at the various calcium sites was computed to be within 0.7 and 20.5 ns, which suggests that specific Ca ions will be more readily available to bind with organic molecules present in solution. This analysis is a step forward in understanding the structure of this complex mineral and its role in biomineralization, as it provides a solid theoretical background to explore its surface chemistry. In particular, this study provides realistic surface models and predicts the effect of water exchange at the surface active sites on the adsorption of other molecules.},

It was determined that the type and magnitude of polar interactions have direct implications on the vapor–liquid equilibria (VLE), resulting in azeotropy for systems of either dipolar or quadrupolar fluids when mixed with non-polar or low polar strength fluids, while increasing the polar strength of one component shifts the VLE to be more ideal. Additionally, excess properties and interfacial properties such as interfacial tension, density profiles, and relative adsorption at the interface were also examined, establishing distinct enrichment in the case of mixtures with highly quadrupolar fluids. Finally, polar soft-SAFT was applied to describe the thermodynamic behavior of binary mixtures of experimental systems exhibiting various intermolecular interactions (non-polar and polar), not only demonstrating high accuracy and robustness through agreement with experimental data but also providing insights into the effect of polarity on the interfacial properties of the studied mixtures. This work proves the value of having an accurate theory for isolating the effect of polarity, especially for the design of ad hoc polar solvents.},

  abstract = {Germanium selenide glasses of compositions spanning the whole glass-formation range are aged at room temperature for up to 20 years. A prominent enthalpy relaxation process is observed in all glasses, and its structural origin is analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The structural relaxation is manifested in the Raman spectra as a decrease in the ratio of edge- to corner-sharing GeSe 4/2 tetrahedral units. This structural evolution can be explained in terms of configurational entropy and density changes. Changes in Raman features and enthalpy follow an identical stretched exponential relaxation function characteristic of aging in glasses. The compositional dependence of enthalpy relaxation after 20 years is in agreement with kinetic considerations based on the glass transition temperature of each glass. The relaxation behavior and heat capacity curves are consistent with standard glass relaxation models for all compositions. These results indicate that the non-reversing enthalpy obtained by modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), which suggests the existence of non-aging glasses, is not a reliable measure of the ability of a glass to relax. Instead, it is suggested that an interpretation of MDSC data in terms of complex heat capacity provides a more complete and reliable assessment of the relaxation properties of glasses.},

This implies that the classical fluctuation equation for the transient heat capacity, c v ( t ), is not applicable to the thermostatted molecular dynamics (apart from long enough times). To improve on this point, we derive a number of exact general expressions for the frequency-dependent heat capacity in terms of energy correlation functions, valid for the Nosé–Hoover and some other thermostats. We also establish a general relation between auto- and cross correlation functions of energy and temperature. Recommendations on how to use these relations to maximize the numerical precision are provided. It is demonstrated that our approach allows us to obtain c v ( t ) for a supercooled liquid system with high precision and over many decades in time reflecting all pertinent relaxation processes.},

The spectra are assigned using a combination of isotopically (H/D and 35 Cl/ 37 Cl) enriched samples, polarized IR absorption measurements, and four-line combination differences. The interchange-tunneling (IT) splitting in the ground vibrational state for in-plane and out-of-plane H 35 Cl–H 37 Cl dimers is 6.026(1) and 6.950(1) cm −1 , respectively, which are factors of 2.565 and 2.224 smaller than in the gas phase dimer. In contrast, the (DCl) 2 results show larger perturbations where the ground vibrational state IT splitting in D 35 Cl–D 37 Cl is 1.141(1) cm −1 , which is a factor of 5.223 smaller than in the gas phase, and the tunneling motion is quenched in excited intramolecular vibrational states. The results are compared to similar measurements on (HCl) 2 made in liquid helium nanodroplets to illustrate the similarities and differences in how both these quantum solvents interact with large amplitude tunneling motions of an embedded chromophore.},

In hydroperoxides, the OH-stretching and COOH torsion vibrations are strongly coupled. The double-well nature of the COOH torsion potential leads to tunneling splitting of the energy levels and, combined with the low frequency of the torsional vibration, results in spectra in the OH-stretching regions with multiple vibrational transitions. In each of the OH-stretching regions, both an OH-stretching and a stretch–torsion combination feature are observed, and we show direct evidence for the tunneling splitting in the OH-stretching fundamental region. We have developed two complementary vibrational models to describe the spectra of the OH-stretching regions, a reaction path model and a reduced dimensional local mode model, both of which describe the features of the vibrational spectra well. We also explore the torsional dependence of the OH-stretching transition dipole moment and show that a Franck–Condon treatment fails to capture the intensity in the region of the stretch–torsion combination features. The accuracy of the Franck–Condon treatment of these features improves with increasing Δv OH .},

The jet-cooled spectrum is recorded by IR multiphoton excitation with UV laser-induced fluorescence detection of OH radical products, while direct IR absorption is utilized under thermal conditions. Prior spectroscopic studies of TBHP and other hydroperoxides have shown that the OH-stretch and XOOH (X = H or C) torsion vibrations are strongly coupled, resulting in a double well potential associated with the torsional motion about the OO bond that is different for each of the OH-stretching vibrational states. A low barrier between the wells on the torsional potential results in tunneling split energy levels, which leads to four distinct transitions associated with excitation of the coupled OH-stretch-torsion states. In order to interpret the experimental results, two theoretical models are used that include the OH-stretch-torsion coupling in TBHP. Both methods are utilized to compute the vibrational transitions associated with the coupled OH-stretch-torsion states of TBHP, revealing the underlying transitions that compose the experimentally observed features. A comparison between theory and experiment illustrates the necessity for treatments that include OH-stretch and COOH torsion in order to unravel the spectral features observed in the first OH-stretching overtone region of TBHP.},

The geometries of Si 8 H 8 O 12 and Ge 8 H 8 O 12 are unstable under O h symmetry and distort to the rare T h molecular symmetry.

The potential energy curve is based on supermolecular coupled-cluster (CC) calculations at very high levels up to CC with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. Scalar and spin–orbit relativistic effects, the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction, and retardation of the dispersion interactions were taken into account. The interaction-induced polarizability curve, which in this work is only needed for the calculation of the second dielectric virial coefficient, is based on supermolecular calculations at levels up to CCSDT and includes a correction for scalar relativistic effects. In addition to these first-principles calculations, highly accurate dielectric-constant gas thermometry (DCGT) datasets measured at temperatures from 24.5 to 200 K were analyzed to obtain the difference between the second density and dielectric virial coefficients with previously unattained accuracy. The agreement of the DCGT values with the ones resulting from the first-principles calculations is, despite some small systematic deviations, very satisfactory. Apart from this combination of two virial coefficients, the calculated thermophysical property values of this work are significantly more accurate than any available experimental data.},

This reveals a strikingly rich conformational landscape for this secondary amine with two equivalent substituents. Experimentally, transitions belonging to four low energy conformers (I, II, III, and IV) were unequivocally assigned in the rotational spectrum, and their patterns were confirmed by the presence of the hyperfine structure owing to the 14 N quadrupolar nucleus. The relative intensities of the observed transitions suggest a conformational energy ordering of I &lt; II &lt; III &lt; IV. Natural bond orbital and non-covalent interaction calculations reveal that the geometric preferences for the observed conformers are governed by an interplay of subtle attractive interactions (including hyperconjugation involving the lone pair at nitrogen) and repulsive effects.},

We find that the ensuing chemistry is significantly characterized by the formation of large C x N y O z species, which are likely precursors to the experimentally observed carbon condensates. Beyond utility as a means of investigating detonation chemistry, the present approach can be used to generate quantum-based reference data for the development of full machine-learned interatomic potentials capable of simulation on even greater time and length scales, i.e., for applications where characteristic time scales exceed the reach of methods including Kohn–Sham density functional theory, which are commonly used for reference data generation.},

The approximation is tested for conventional and local density fitting (DF) SCF approaches combining various auxiliary basis sets, fitting metrics, and Fock-matrix construction algorithms in the initial and final iterations as well as for seminumerical SCF methods combining integration grids of different qualities. We also report the implementation of the occupied orbital resolution of identity exchange construction algorithm with local DF approximations.

  abstract = {The use of coarse-grained (CG) models is a popular approach to study complex biomolecular systems. By reducing the number of degrees of freedom, a CG model can explore long time- and length-scales inaccessible to computational models at higher resolution. If a CG model is designed by formally integrating out some of the system’s degrees of freedom, one expects multi-body interactions to emerge in the effective CG model’s energy function. In practice, it has been shown that the inclusion of multi-body terms indeed improves the accuracy of a CG model. However, no general approach has been proposed to systematically construct a CG effective energy that includes arbitrary orders of multi-body terms. In this work, we propose a neural network based approach to address this point and construct a CG model as a multi-body expansion. By applying this approach to a small protein, we evaluate the relative importance of the different multi-body terms in the definition of an accurate model. We observe a slow convergence in the multi-body expansion, where up to five-body interactions are needed to reproduce the free energy of an atomistic model.},

  abstract = {Analysis of electron flux within and in between molecules is crucial in the study of real-time dynamics of molecular electron wavepacket evolution such as those in attosecond laser chemistry and ultrafast chemical reaction dynamics. We here address two mutually correlated issues on the conservation law of molecular electronic flux, which serves as a key consistency condition for electron dynamics. The first one is about a close relation between “weak” nonadiabaticity and the electron dynamics in low-energy chemical reactions. We show that the electronic flux in adiabatic reactions can be consistently reproduced by taking account of nonadiabaticity. Such nonadiabaticity is usually weak in the sense that it does not have a major effect on nuclear dynamics, whereas it plays an important role in electronic dynamics. Our discussion is based on a nonadiabatic extension of the electronic wavefunction similar in idea to the complete adiabatic formalism developed by Nafie [J. Chem. Phys. 79 , 4950 (1983)], which has also recently been reformulated by Patchkovskii [J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 084109 (2012)]. We give straightforward proof of the theoretical assertion presented by Nafie using a time-dependent mixed quantum–classical framework and a standard perturbation expansion. Explicitly taking account of the flux conservation, we show that the nonadiabatically induced flux realizes the adiabatic time evolution of the electronic density. In other words, the divergence of the nonadiabatic flux equals the time derivative of the electronic density along an adiabatic time evolution of the target molecule. The second issue is about the accurate computationability of the flux. The calculation of flux needs an accurate representation of the (relative) quantum phase, in addition to the amplitude factor, of a total wavefunction and demands special attention for practical calculations. This paper is the first one to approach this issue directly and show how the difficulties arise explicitly. In doing so, we reveal that a number of widely accepted truncation techniques for static property calculations are potential sources of numerical flux non-conservation. We also theoretically propose alternative strategies to realize better flux conservation.},

  abstract = {Computational models of reaction–diffusion systems involving low copy numbers or strongly heterogeneous molecular spatial distributions, such as those frequently found in cellular signaling pathways, require approaches that account for the stochastic dynamics of individual particles, as opposed to approaches representing them through their average concentrations. Efforts to remedy the high computational cost associated with particle-based stochastic approaches by taking advantage of Green’s functions are hampered by the need to draw random numbers from complicated, and therefore costly, non-standard probability distributions to update particle positions. Here, we introduce an approach that permits the reconstruction of entire molecular trajectories, including bimolecular encounters, in retrospect, after a simulated time step, while avoiding inefficient draws from non-standard distributions. This means that highly accurate stochastic simulations can be performed for system sizes that would be prohibitively costly to simulate with conventional Green’s function based methods. The algorithm applies equally well to one, two, and three dimensional systems and can be readily extended to include deterministic forces specified by an interaction potential, such as the Coulomb potential.},

  abstract = {A unified treatment for the fast and spectrally accurate evaluation of electrostatic potentials with periodic boundary conditions in any or none of the three spatial dimensions is presented. Ewald decomposition is used to split the problem into real-space and Fourier-space parts, and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based Spectral Ewald (SE) method is used to accelerate computation of the latter, yielding the total runtime O ( N ⁡ log ( N ) ) for N sources. A key component is a new FFT-based solution technique for the free-space Poisson problem. The computational cost is further reduced by a new adaptive FFT for the doubly and singly periodic cases, allowing for different local upsampling factors. The SE method is most efficient in the triply periodic case where the cost of computing FFTs is the lowest, whereas the rest of the algorithm is essentially independent of periodicity. We show that removing periodic boundary conditions from one or two directions out of three will only moderately increase the total runtime, and in the free-space case, the runtime is around four times that of the triply periodic case. The Gaussian window function previously used in the SE method is compared with a new piecewise polynomial approximation of the Kaiser–Bessel window, which further reduces the runtime. We present error estimates and a parameter selection scheme for all parameters of the method, including a new estimate for the shape parameter of the Kaiser–Bessel window. Finally, we consider methods for force computation and compare the runtime of the SE method with that of the fast multipole method.},

  abstract = {Thermal stability and pressure-dependent changes are key to molecular crystals and their properties. The determination of their thermal properties from ab initio methods is, however, a challenging task. While the low-frequency phonon spectrum related to intermolecular vibrations remains difficult to describe, the Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA) also induces for molecular crystals a significant volume deviation, which makes their thermal behavior ill-determined. To overcome these difficulties, we consider a pragmatic energy correction (EC) that has long been used for atomic crystals, and we presently report the first ever use for molecular crystals. Applying the QHA in dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations with an ab initio parameterized EC, the resulting model can simultaneously and accurately derive thermal and mechanical properties of high-explosive molecular crystals. When compared to experiments, the mean absolute percent error of previous DFT-based thermomechanical models is 12\% for mechanical and 31\% for thermal properties. Our model performs significantly better and reduces these uncertainties to 4.1\% and 9.8\%, respectively. In particular, the agreement between our model and experiments for the thermal properties is three times better. This significant improvement greatly benefits the determination of thermomechanical properties such as the Grüneisen parameter and the shock properties. The method has been successfully applied to molecular crystals showing a large diversity of weak intermolecular interactions ( β -1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX), α -1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7), Triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB), ε -Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL20), and Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)-I). Due to its accuracy and transferability, our model is expected to work for a large class of computationally designed molecular crystals and co-crystals, providing a basis for a predictive framework.},

With TRAH-SCF, convergence can always be achieved even with tight convergence thresholds, which requires just a modest number of iterations. Our convergence benchmark study and our illustrative applications focus on open-shell molecules, also antiferromagnetically coupled systems, for which it is notoriously complicated to converge the Roothaan–Hall self-consistent field (SCF) equations. We compare the number of TRAH iterations to reach convergence with those of Pulay’s original and Kollmar’s (K) variants of the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) method and also analyze the obtained SCF solutions. Often, TRAH-SCF finds a symmetry-broken solution with a lower energy than DIIS and KDIIS. For unrestricted calculations, this is accompanied by a larger spin contamination, i.e., larger deviation from the desired spin-restricted ⟨ S 2 ⟩ expectation value. However, there are also rare cases in which DIIS finds a solution with a lower energy than KDIIS and TRAH. In rare cases, both TRAH-SCF and KDIIS may also converge to a non- aufbau solution. For those calculations, standard DIIS always diverges. For cases that converge smoothly with either method, TRAH usually needs more iterations to converge than DIIS and KDIIS because for every new set of orbitals, the level-shifted Newton–Raphson equations are solved approximately and iteratively. In such cases, the total runtime of TRAH-SCF is still competitive with the DIIS-based approaches even if extended basis sets are employed, which is illustrated for a large hemocyanin model complex.},

The electronic energies are calculated on a quantum computer using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. Algorithms for computation of analytical gradients entirely on a quantum computer require quantum fault-tolerant hardware, which is beyond NISQ-era. Therefore, we compute the energy gradients numerically using finite differences, the Hellmann–Feynman theorem, and a correlated sampling technique. This method only requires additional classical calculations of electron integrals for each degree of freedom without any additional computations on a quantum computer beyond the initial VQE run. As a proof of concept, AIMD simulations are demonstrated for the H 2 molecule on IBM quantum devices. In addition, we demonstrate the validity of the method for larger molecules using full configuration interaction wave functions. As quantum hardware and noise mitigation techniques continue to improve, the method can be utilized for studying larger molecular systems.},

We show that the AC correlation energy formula can be expressed in terms of the density linear response function as a sum of components related to positive and negative parts of the transition energy spectrum. Consequently, generalization of the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation theory to electronically excited states is obtained. The component of the linear response function related to the negative-transition energy enters the correlation energy expression with an opposite sign to that of the positive-transition part and is non-negligible in the description of excited states. To illustrate this, we analyze the approximate AC model in which the linear response function is obtained in the extended random phase approximation (ERPA). We demonstrate that AC can be successfully combined with the ERPA for excited states, provided that the negative-excitation component of the response function is rigorously accounted for. The resulting AC0D model, an extension of the AC0 scheme introduced in our earlier works, is applied to a benchmark set of singlet excitation energies of organic molecules. AC0D constitutes a significant improvement over AC0 by bringing the excitation energies of the lowest excited states to a satisfactory agreement with theoretical best estimates, which parallels or even exceeds the accuracy of the n -electron valence state perturbation theory method. For higher excitations, AC0D is less reliable due to the gradual deterioration of the underlying ERPA linear response.},

  abstract = {Emissive layers in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes commonly make use of guest–host blends such as Ir(ppy) 3 :CBP to achieve high external quantum efficiencies. However, while the Ir(ppy) 3 :CBP blend has been studied experimentally, crucial questions remain regarding how exciton diffusion is dependent on the distribution of the guest in the host, which can currently only be addressed at the atomic level via computational modeling. In this work, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are utilized to gain insight into exciton diffusion in Ir(ppy) 3 :CBP blend films. The effects of both guest concentration and exciton density on various system properties are analyzed, including the probability of singlet excitons being converted to triplets, and the probability of those triplets decaying radiatively. Significantly, these simulations suggest that triplet diffusion occurs almost exclusively via guest–guest Dexter transfer and that concentration quenching of triplets induced by guest–guest intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions has a negligible effect at high exciton densities due to the prevalence of triplet–triplet annihilation. Furthermore, results for vacuum deposited morphologies derived from molecular dynamics simulations are compared to the results obtained using a simple cubic lattice approximation with randomly distributed guest molecules. We show that while differences in host-based processes such as singlet diffusion are observed, overall, the results on the fate of the excitons are in good agreement for the two morphology types, particularly for guest-based processes at low guest concentrations where guest clustering is limited.},

  abstract = {The cell is an extremely crowded environment, which is known to have a profound impact on the thermodynamics, functionality, and conformational stability of biomolecules. Speculations from recent theoretical molecular dynamics studies suggest an intriguing size dependence to such purely entropic crowding effects, whereby small molecular weight crowders under constant enthalpy conditions are more effective than larger crowders on a per volume basis. If experimentally confirmed, this would be profoundly significant, as the cellular cytoplasm is also quite concentrated in smaller molecular weight solutes such as inorganic ions, amino acids, and various metabolites. The challenge is to perform such studies isolating entropic effects under isoenthalpic conditions. In this work, we first present results from single-molecule FRET spectroscopy (smFRET) on the molecular size-dependent crowding stabilization of a simple RNA tertiary motif (the GAAA tetraloop–tetraloop receptor), indeed providing evidence in support of the surprising notion in the crowding literature that “smaller is better.” Specifically, systematic smFRET studies as a function of crowder solute size reveal that smaller molecules both significantly increase the RNA tertiary folding rate and, yet, simultaneously decrease the unfolding rate , predicting strongly size-dependent stabilization of RNA tertiary structures under crowded cellular conditions. The size dependence of these effects has been explored via systematic variation of crowder size over a broad range of molecular weights (90–3000 amu). Furthermore, corresponding temperature dependent studies indicate the systematic changes in the folding equilibrium to be predominantly entropic in origin, i.e., consistent with a fundamental picture of entropic molecular crowding without additional enthalpic interactions. Most importantly, all trends in the single-molecule crowding data can be quantitatively recapitulated by a simple analytic depletion force model, whereby excluded volume interactions represent the major thermodynamic driving force toward folding. Our study, thus, not only provides experimental evidence and theoretical support for small molecule crowding but also predicts further enhancement of crowding effects for even smaller molecules on a per volume basis.},

  abstract = {Understanding the properties of water under either soft or hard confinement has been an area of great interest, but nanostructured amphiphilic polymers that provide a secondary confinement have garnered significantly less attention. Here, a series of statistical copolymers of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) and 2-( N -ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamido)ethyl methacrylate (FOSM) are swollen to equilibrium in water to form nanostructured physically cross-linked hydrogels to probe the effect of soft confinement on the dynamics of water. Changing the composition of the copolymer from 10 to 21 mol.\% FOSM decreases the average size of the assembled FOSM cross-link, but also the spacing between the cross-links in the hydrogels with the mean distance between the FOSM aggregates decreasing from 3.9 to 2.7 nm. The dynamics of water within the hydrogels were assessed with quasielastic neutron scattering. These hydrogels exhibit superior performance for inhibition of water crystallization on supercooling in comparison to analogous hydrogels with different hydrophilic copolymer chemistries. Despite the lower water crystallinity, the self-diffusion coefficient for these hydrogels from the copolymers of HEA and FOSM decreases precipitously below 260 K, which is a counter to the nearly temperature invariant water dynamics reported previously with an analogous hydrogel [Wiener et al. , J. Phys. Chem. B 120 , 5543 (2016)] that exhibits nearly temperature invariant dynamics to 220 K. These results point to chemistry dependent dynamics of water that is confined within amphiphilic hydrogels, where the interactions of water with the hydrophilic segments can qualitatively alter the temperature dependent dynamics of water in the supercooled state.},

We consider networks with a diamond-like architecture and different cross-link ratios, concurring with a wide range of the polymer volume fraction. We particularly focus on the effect and the competition of two independent component-specific solute–polymer interactions, i.e., we distinguish between chain-monomers and cross-linkers, which individually act on the solutes and are altered to cover attractive and repulsive regimes. For this purpose, we employ coarse-grained, Langevin computer simulations to study how the cross-link ratio of polymer networks controls the solute partitioning, diffusion, and permeability. We observe different qualitative behaviors as a function of the cross-link ratio and interaction strengths. The permeability can be tuned ranging over two orders of magnitude relative to the reference bulk permeability. Finally, we provide scaling theories for the partitioning and diffusion that explicitly account for the component-specific interactions as well as the cross-link ratio and the polymer volume fraction. These are in overall good agreement with the simulation results and grant insight into the underlying physics, rationalizing how the cross-link ratio can be exploited to tune the solute permeability of polymeric networks.},

  abstract = {We report extensive numerical simulations of different models of 2D polymer rings with internal elasticity. We monitor the dynamical behavior of the rings as a function of the packing fraction to address the effects of particle deformation on the collective response of the system. In particular, we compare three different models: (i) a recently investigated model [N. Gnan and E. Zaccarelli, Nat. Phys. 15 , 683 (2019)] where an inner Hertzian field providing the internal elasticity acts on the monomers of the ring, (ii) the same model where the effect of such a field on the center of mass is balanced by opposite forces, and (iii) a semi-flexible model where an angular potential between adjacent monomers induces strong particle deformations. By analyzing the dynamics of the three models, we find that in all cases, there exists a direct link between the system fragility and particle asphericity. Among the three, only the first model displays anomalous dynamics in the form of a super-diffusive behavior of the mean-squared displacement and of a compressed exponential relaxation of the density auto-correlation function. We show that this is due to the combination of internal elasticity and the out-of-equilibrium force self-generated by each ring, both of which are necessary ingredients to induce such a peculiar behavior often observed in experiments of colloidal gels. These findings reinforce the role of particle deformation, connected to internal elasticity, in driving the dynamical response of dense soft particles.},

  abstract = {Scaling of the behavior of a nanodevice means that the device function (selectivity) is a unique smooth and monotonic function of a scaling parameter that is an appropriate combination of the system’s parameters. For the uniformly charged cylindrical nanopore studied here, these parameters are the electrolyte concentration, c , voltage, U , the radius and the length of the nanopore, R and H , and the surface charge density on the nanopore’s surface, σ . Due to the non-linear dependence of selectivities on these parameters, scaling can only be applied in certain limits. We show that the Dukhin number, D u = | σ | / e R c ∼ | σ | λ D 2 / e R ( λ D is the Debye length), is an appropriate scaling parameter in the nanotube limit ( H → ∞ ). Decreasing the length of the nanopore, namely, approaching the nanohole limit ( H → 0), an alternative scaling parameter has been obtained, which contains the pore length and is called the modified Dukhin number: mDu ∼ Du H / λ D ∼ | σ | λ D H / eR . We found that the reason for non-linearity is that the double layers accumulating at the pore wall in the radial dimension correlate with the double layers accumulating at the entrances of the pore near the membrane on the two sides. Our modeling study using the Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo method and the Poisson–Nernst–Planck theory provides concentration, flux, and selectivity profiles that show whether the surface or the volume conduction dominates in a given region of the nanopore for a given combination of the variables. We propose that the inflection point of the scaling curve may be used to characterize the transition point between the surface and volume conductions.},

Based on this, a concise dissipative two-level electronic system coupled to a molecular vibrational mode is proposed and solved quantum mechanically. It is found that the charge transfer is enhanced substantially when the vibrational energy quanta is equal to the electronic energy loss across the interface. This vibration-mediate resonant charge transfer process is ultrafast, occurring within 100 fs, comparable to experimental findings. The open-system Ehrenfest dynamics simulation of the two-level model is carried out, and similar results are obtained, which confirms further that the earlier open-system Ehrenfest dynamics simulation indeed correctly predicted the occurrence of the resonant charge transfer across the donor–acceptor interface.},

While the former is traditionally discussed in the ferroelectrics community and the latter in the surface science community, we remind the reader that the two descriptions are conveniently unified within the modern theory of polarization. In both cases, the surface charge leads to electrostatic instability—the so-called “polar catastrophe”—if it is not compensated, and we review the range of phenomena that arise as a result of different compensation mechanisms. We illustrate these concepts using the example of the prototypical multiferroic bismuth ferrite, BiFeO 3 , which is unusual in that its spontaneous ferroelectric polarization and the polarization arising from its layer charges can be of the same magnitude. As a result, for certain combinations of polarization orientation and surface termination, its surface charge is self-compensating. We use density functional calculations of BiFeO 3 slabs and superlattices, analysis of high-resolution transmission electron micrographs, and examples from the literature to explore the consequences of this peculiarity.},

The correlations between the layer/spacer thickness ratio, elastic strain, chemical composition, and critical thickness are analyzed. The Matthews and Blakeslee model is revisited to find analytic conditions for the critical layer thickness resulting in phase transition.

ILs with various cationic species were used to examine the effect of viscosity and polarity on recombination dynamics. Experimentally obtained recombination yields and dynamics were found to be virtually independent of the cation species, despite the viscosity range of the solvent ILs being extensive, spanning from a few tens of mPa s to several hundred mPa s. We applied a theoretical analysis model based on the diffusion equation to the time profiles of the experimentally determined recombination yields of geminate PAPT radicals. The square well potential was incorporated into the diffusion equation to consider the concerted dynamics of solvent cage formation and recombination. A long-time asymptotic expression for the survival probability of the photodissociated products was derived and used to simulate the experimentally obtained time profile of the recombination yield. The time profiles in the range of 20–1000 ps and the final yield were successfully simulated by the asymptotic expression of the square well potential model. The optimized parameters used for the fit, including the mutual diffusion coefficient of the radical pairs, cage radius of the potential well, and well depth, were discussed in terms of the diffusion coefficient conventional theory and the potential mean force estimated from the molecular dynamics simulation for the photodissociation reaction in ILs.},

Deformations and defects are structural hallmarks of plasticity, ice formation, and crystal growth mechanisms. Partitioning topological networks into constituent crystal building blocks, which is the basis of topological identification criteria, is an intuitive approach for classification in both bulk and confinement. However, techniques reliant on the convex hull for assigning orientations of component units fail for non-convex blocks. Here, we propose a new framework, called Topological Unit Matching (TUM), which exploits information from topological criteria for an efficient shape-matching procedure. TUM is a general family of algorithms, capable of quantifying deformations and unambiguously determining grains of bulk and confined ice polymorphs. We show that TUM significantly improves the identification of quasi-one-dimensional ice by including deformed prism blocks. We demonstrate the efficacy of TUM by analyzing supercooled water nanoparticles, amorphous ice, and phase transitions in an ice nanotube. We also illustrate the superiority of TUM in resolving topological defect structures with minimal parameterization.},

We find that the mechanical compliance spectra can be well described by the random free-energy barrier hopping model, while the dielectric spectra on the same materials involve significant contributions arising from reorientational dynamics. The temperature-dependent viscosity and structural relaxation time, revealing non-Arrhenius behavior typical for glassy freezing, are compared to the ionic dc conductivity and relaxation times determined by broadband dielectric spectroscopy. For glyceline and ethaline, we find essentially identical temperature dependences for all dynamic quantities. These findings point to a close coupling of the ionic and molecular translational and reorientational motions in these systems. However, for reline, the ionic charge transport appears decoupled from the structural and reorientational dynamics, following a fractional Walden rule. In particular, at low temperatures, the ionic conductivity in this DES is enhanced by about one decade compared to expectations based on the temperature dependence of the viscosity. The results for all three DESs can be understood without invoking a revolving-door mechanism previously considered as a possible charge-transport mechanism in DESs.},

The early time dynamics of this CT were studied using time-dependent wavepacket propagation on three nonadiabatically coupled electronic states in a reduced three-dimensional space. The electronic states were treated using the XMS-CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ ab initio methodology. The population dynamics of the three coupled electronic states were analyzed in detail to reveal the initial stage of the PCET process up to ∼100 fs, while the branching ratio, χ = PT/(ET+PT), was determined after wavepacket propagations of up to 2000 fs. Another main result is the dependence of χ on the vibration levels of the initial precursor anion and the isotope substitution of the connecting H atom with deuterium and tritium.

These molecules are of current interest in experiments at ultra-cold conditions to explore the effects of the strong dipole–dipole forces on the collective many-body quantum behavior. New quantum phenomena are also anticipated in systems consisting of atomic species with different fermion/boson statistics. The model parameters are obtained by simultaneously fitting all five of the parameters to the extensive LIF-Fourier transform spectroscopy published by Tiemann and collaborators [e.g., Docenko et al. J. Phys. B: At., Mol. Opt. Phys. 39 , S929–S943 (2006)], who also report best fit potential curves. Although the new potentials are in good agreement with the earlier potentials, they have the advantage that they are continuous over the entire range of internuclear distances and have the correct long-range behavior. The scattering lengths for all isotope combinations show good agreement with dedicated experiments where available. The new potentials are also in excellent agreement with combining rules based on the potentials of the homonuclear systems.},

  abstract = {When the enhanced electromagnetic field of a confined light mode interacts with photoactive molecules, the system can be driven into the regime of strong coupling, where new hybrid light–matter states, polaritons, are formed. Polaritons, manifested by the Rabi split in the dispersion, have shown potential for controlling the chemistry of the coupled molecules. Here, we show by angle-resolved steady-state experiments accompanied by multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations that the molecular Stokes shift plays a significant role in the relaxation of polaritons formed by organic molecules embedded in a polymer matrix within metallic Fabry–Pérot cavities. Our results suggest that in the case of Rhodamine 6G, a dye with a significant Stokes shift, excitation of the upper polariton leads to a rapid localization of the energy into the fluorescing state of one of the molecules, from where the energy scatters into the lower polariton (radiative pumping), which then emits. In contrast, for excitonic J-aggregates with a negligible Stokes shift, the fluorescing state does not provide an efficient relaxation gateway. Instead, the relaxation is mediated by exchanging energy quanta matching the energy gap between the dark states and lower polariton into vibrational modes (vibrationally assisted scattering). To understand better how the fluorescing state of a molecule that is not strongly coupled to the cavity can transfer its excitation energy to the lower polariton in the radiative pumping mechanism, we performed multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The results of these simulations suggest that non-adiabatic couplings between uncoupled molecules and the polaritons are the driving force for this energy transfer process.},

The growth of the clusters has been achieved by increasing the previous cluster by one Pt 3 Cu unit at a time. To explore in detail the potential energy surface of these clusters, initial structures were obtained from Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics trajectories generated at different temperatures and spin multiplicities. For each cluster size, several dozens of structures were optimized without any constraints. The most stable structures were characterized by frequency analysis calculations. This study demonstrates that the obtained most stable structures prefer low spin multiplicities. To gain insight into the growing pattern of these systems, average bond lengths were calculated for the lowest stable structures. This work reveals that the Cu atoms prefer to be together and to localize inside the cluster structures. Moreover, these systems tend to form octahedra moieties in the size range of n going from 4 to 9 Pt 3 Cu units. Magnetic moment per atom and spin density plots were obtained for the neutral, cationic, and anionic ground state structures. Dissociation energies, ionization potential, and electron affinity were calculated, too. The dissociation energy and the electron affinity increase as the number of Pt 3 Cu units grows, whereas the ionization potential decreases.},

The pulse expansion wave tube is used to test three different pressure conditions, namely, 0.1, 1, and 2 MPa. In addition, a restricted series of nucleation experiments is presented for 25\% carbon dioxide mixtures at temperatures of 234 and 236 K at 0.1 MPa. As pressure and carbon dioxide content are increased, the nucleation rate increases accordingly. This behavior is attributed to the reduction in the water surface tension by the adsorption of carrier gas molecules. The new data are compared with theoretical predictions based on the classical nucleation theory and on extrapolations of empirical surface tension data to the supercooled conditions at 240 K. The extrapolation is carried out on the basis of a theoretical adsorption/surface tension model, extended to multi-component mixtures. The theoretical model appears to strongly overestimate the pressure and composition dependence. At relatively low pressures of 0.1 MPa, a reduction in the nucleation rates is found due to an incomplete thermalization of colliding clusters and carrier gas molecules. The observed decrease in the nucleation rate is supported by the theoretical model of Barrett, generalized here for water in multi-component carrier gas mixtures. The temperature dependence of the nucleation rate at 0.1 MPa follows the scaling model proposed by Hale [J. Chem. Phys. 122 , 204509 (2005)].},

(ii) Transient interband tunneling of electrons driven by ultrashort mid-infrared pulses can be effectively controlled by a low-frequency THz field with amplitudes below 50 kV/cm. The THz field controls the electron–hole separation modifying decoherence and the irreversibility of carrier generation.},

It can be used to probe biexciton dynamics in molecular systems and to observe exciton diffusion in extended systems such as polymers or light-harvesting complexes. The exciton transport strongly depends on the geometrical and energetic landscape and its perturbations. These can be of both local character, such as molecular orientation and energetic disorder, and long-range character, such as polymer kinks and structural domains. In the present theoretical work, we investigate the anisotropy in EEI2D spectroscopy. We introduce a general approach for how to calculate the anisotropy by using the response-function formalism in an efficient way. In numerical simulations, using a Frenkel exciton model with Redfield-theory dynamics, we demonstrate how the measurement of anisotropy in EEI2D spectroscopy can be used to identify various geometrical effects on exciton transport in dimers and polymers. Investigating a molecular heterodimer as an example, we demonstrate the utility of anisotropy in EEI2D spectroscopy for disentangling dynamic localization and annihilation. We further calculate the annihilation in extended systems such as conjugated polymers. In a polymer, a change in the anisotropy provides a unique signature for exciton transport between differently oriented sections. We analyze three types of geometry variations in polymers: a kink, varying geometric and energetic disorder, and different geometric domains. Our findings underline that employing anisotropy in EEI2D spectroscopy provides a way to distinguish between different geometries and can be used to obtain a better understanding of long-range exciton transport.},

To this end, we combine a quantum Langevin equation (QLE) approach for dissipation and a perturbative scheme to calculate three-pulse photon-echo polarizations based on wave packet dynamics under the influence of external fields. The proposed dynamical approach provides a consistent description of nuclear quantum dynamics, pulse-overlap effects, and vibrational relaxation, enabling simulations of 2D electronic spectra with explicit and non-perturbative treatment of coupled electronic–nuclear dynamics. We apply the method to simulate 2D electronic spectra of a displaced-oscillator model in the condensed phase and discuss the spectral and temporal evolutions of 2D signals. Our results show that the proposed QLE approach is capable of describing vibrational relaxation, decoherence, and vibrational coherence transfer, as well as their manifestations in spectroscopic signals. Furthermore, vibrational quantum beats specific for excited-state vs ground-state nuclear wave packet dynamics can also be identified. We anticipate that this method will provide a useful tool to conduct theoretical studies of 2D spectroscopy for strong vibronically coupled systems and to elucidate intricate vibronic couplings in complex molecular systems.},

  abstract = {The explicit split-operator algorithm has been extensively used for solving not only linear but also nonlinear time-dependent Schrödinger equations. When applied to the nonlinear Gross–Pitaevskii equation, the method remains time-reversible, norm-conserving, and retains its second-order accuracy in the time step. However, this algorithm is not suitable for all types of nonlinear Schrödinger equations. Indeed, we demonstrate that local control theory, a technique for the quantum control of a molecular state, translates into a nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a more general nonlinearity, for which the explicit split-operator algorithm loses time reversibility and efficiency (because it only has first-order accuracy). Similarly, the trapezoidal rule (the Crank–Nicolson method), while time-reversible, does not conserve the norm of the state propagated by a nonlinear Schrödinger equation. To overcome these issues, we present high-order geometric integrators suitable for general time-dependent nonlinear Schrödinger equations and also applicable to nonseparable Hamiltonians. These integrators, based on the symmetric compositions of the implicit midpoint method, are both norm-conserving and time-reversible. The geometric properties of the integrators are proven analytically and demonstrated numerically on the local control of a two-dimensional model of retinal. For highly accurate calculations, the higher-order integrators are more efficient. For example, for a wavefunction error of 10 −9 , using the eighth-order algorithm yields a 48-fold speedup over the second-order implicit midpoint method and trapezoidal rule, and a 400 000-fold speedup over the explicit split-operator algorithm.},

  abstract = {Cyclodextrins have a diverse range of applications, including as supramolecular hosts, as enzyme active-site analogs, in improving drug solubility and delivery, and in molecular selection. We have investigated their ability to form stable complexes with bullvalenes, unusual organic cage molecules that spontaneously interconvert between numerous degenerate isomers. The shape-shifting nature of substituted bullvalenes raises the potential for dynamic adaptive binding to biological targets. We tested whether β- and γ-cyclodextrins can capture particular bullvalene isomers and whether the preferred binding mode(s) differ between isomers. We first applied our computational host–guest interaction potential energy profiling to determine the best binding mode(s) of unsubstituted bullvalene and each isomer of methylenehydroxybullvalene to β- and γ-cyclodextrin. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations of the predicted host–guest complexes showed that while unsubstituted bullvalene has a single, albeit ill-defined, binding mode with either cyclodextrin, each isomer of methylenehydroxybullvalene has two possible modes of binding to β-cyclodextrin but only a single, nebulous mode of binding to γ-cyclodextrin. Experimental determination of the binding free energy of each methylenehydroxybullvalene–cyclodextrin complex showed that methylenehydroxybullvalene is more likely to bind to β-cyclodextrin than to γ-cyclodextrin, despite its smaller cavity. Together, our results suggest that β-cyclodextrin, but not γ-cyclodextrin, shows promise for conformational capture of mono-substituted bullvalenes. More broadly, our computational pipeline should prove useful for rapid characterization of cyclodextrin host–guest complexes, avoiding the need for costly synthesis of guest molecules that are unlikely to bind stably, as well as providing detailed atomic-level insight into the nature of complexation.},

This work allows for increased confidence given the agreement with respect to values recently obtained using the local natural orbital CCSD(T) for L7 and the canonical CCSD(T)/CBS result for the coronene dimer (C2C2PD). Therefore, these results can be considered pushing the CCSD(T)/CBS binding benchmark to the hundred-atom scale. The disagreements between the two state-of-the-art methods, CCSD(T) and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo, are substantial with at least 2.0 (∼10\%), 1.9 (∼5\%), and 10.3 kcal/mol (∼25\%) differences for C2C2PD in L7, DNA–ellipticine, and buckycatcher–C 60 , respectively. Such sizable discrepancy above “chemical accuracy” for large noncovalent complexes indicates how challenging it is to obtain benchmark binding interactions for systems beyond small molecules, although the three up-to-date density functionals, PBE0+D4, ω B97M-V, and B97M-V, agree better with CCSD(T) for these large systems. In addition to reporting these values, different basis sets and various CBS extrapolation parameters for Hartree–Fock and MP2 correlation energies were tested for the first time in large noncovalent complexes with the goal of providing some indications toward optimal cost effective routes to approach the CBS limit without substantial loss in quality.},

However, the solution of the OEP equation is computationally fairly expensive and has to be done in a self-consistent way. So far, large scale solid state applications have, therefore, been performed only using the quasiparticle approximation (QPA), neglecting certain dynamical screening effects. We obtain the exact RPA-OEP for 15 semiconductors and insulators by direct solution of the linearized Sham–Schlüter equation.

  abstract = {Mn(I) α -diimine carbonyl complexes have shown promise in the development of luminescent CO release materials (photoCORMs) for diagnostic and medical applications due to their ability to balance the energy of the low-lying metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and metal-centered (MC) states. In this work, the excited state dynamics of [Mn(im)(CO) 3 (phen)] + (im = imidazole; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) is investigated by means of wavepacket propagation on the potential energy surfaces associated with the 11 low-lying S n singlet excited states within a vibronic coupling model in a (quasi)-diabatic representation including 16 nuclear degrees of freedom. The results show that the early time photophysics (&lt;400 fs) is controlled by the interaction between two MC dissociative states, namely, S 5 and S 11 , with the lowest S 1 –S 3 MLCT bound states. In particular, the presence of S 1 /S 5 and S 2 /S 11 crossings within the diabatic picture along the Mn–CO axial dissociative coordinate ( q Mn–COaxial ) favors a two-stepwise population of the dissociative states, at about 60–70 fs (S 11 ) and 160–180 fs (S 5 ), which reaches about 10\% within 200 fs. The one-dimensional reduced densities associated with the dissociative states along q Mn–COaxial as a function of time clearly point to concurrent primary processes, namely, CO release vs entrapping into the S 1 and S 2 potential wells of the lowest luminescent MLCT states within 400 fs, characteristics of luminescent photoCORM.},

For research and (bio)technological purposes, it can be useful to concentrate bacteria, which is possible by adding nonadsorbing polymers. The induced phase separation originates from a polymer-mediated depletion interaction, first understood by Asakura and Oosawa. Here, it is shown that free volume theory (FVT) can semi-quantitatively describe the phase transitions observed when adding sodium polystyrene sulfonate polymers to E. coli bacteria [Schwarz-Linek et al. , Soft Matter 6 , 4540 (2010)] at high ionic strength. The E. coli bacteria are described as short, hard spherocylinders. FVT predicts that the phase transitions of the mixtures result from a fluid–ABC crystal solid phase coexistence of a hard spherocylinder–polymer mixture.},

Inspired by nature, dissipative self-assembly driven by periodic external fields is often adopted to obtain controlled out-of-equilibrium steady structures and materials in experiments. Although the phenomena in dissipative self-assembly have been discovered in the past few decades, fundamental methods to describe dynamical self-assembly processes and responsiveness are still lacking. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on the equations of motion and Floquet theory to reveal the dynamic behavior changing with frequency in the periodic external field driven self-assembly. Using the dissipative particle dynamics simulation method, we then construct a block copolymer model that can self-assemble in dilute solution to confirm the conclusions from the theory. Our theoretical framework facilitates the understanding of dynamic behavior in a periodically driven process and provides the theoretical guidance for designing the dissipative conditions.},

It is a theoretical challenge to build an appropriate model to handle such coacervate-driven self-assembly, which should capture the strong electrostatic correlations for highly charged polymers. In this paper, we develop the self-consistent field theory considering the ion paring effect to predict the phase behavior of block polyelectrolytes. In our model, two types of ion pairs, the binding between two oppositely charged monomers and the binding between charged monomers and counterions, are included. Their strength of formation is controlled by two parameters K aa and K ac , respectively. We give a detailed analysis about how the binding strength K ac and K aa and salt concentration affect the self-assembled nanostructure of diblock polyelectrolyte systems. The results show that the binding between two oppositely charged blocks provides driven force for microphase separation, while the binding between charged monomers and counterions competes with the polyion pairing and thus suppresses the microphase separation. The addition of salt has a shielding effect on the charges of polymers, which is a disadvantage to microphase separation. The phase diagrams as a function of polymer concentration and salt concentration at different situations are constructed, and the influence of K aa , K ac , and charged block composition f a is analyzed in depth. The obtained phase diagrams are in good agreement with currently existing experimental and theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Charged hydrogels are capable of swelling in aqueous salt solutions, whereby part of the salt ions is repelled due to the presence of fixed charged groups inside the hydrogel. This effect creates a concentration gradient between the absorbed solution and the surrounding fluid known as salt partitioning, offering a potential for these materials to be employed to desalinate saltwater. If the charged hydrogels are thermo-sensitive as well, then the purer, absorbed solution can be recovered by shrinking the hydrogels upon temperature change. To tailor that potential in water-purification and desalination applications, the main parameters influencing the salt partitioning, the deswelling of the hydrogels, and the recovery of water must be understood. In this paper, we analyze these factors based on equations derived from the Donnan theory. In addition, hydrogels composed of N -isopropyl acrylamide and acrylic acid are synthesized, and their salt rejection efficiency in a model desalination experiment is studied. A comparison of the experimental and the theoretical results demonstrates that the charge density of the hydrogels at their equilibrium swelling and the degree of water recovery are two parameters controlling the salt rejection efficiency. These parameters are individually controlled by the content of the ionic groups and the degree of cross-linking of the gel polymer network. In addition, the prediction of the theory and the experimental results demonstrate that the salt rejection efficiency can be significantly improved if a second water recovery step is performed by a secondary increase in the temperature in the deswelling process.},

  abstract = {The underlying physics governing the diffusion of a tracer particle in a viscoelastic material is a topic of some dispute. The long-term memory in the mechanical response of such materials should induce diffusive motion with a memory kernel, such as fractional Brownian motion (fBM). This is the reason that microrheology is able to provide the shear modulus of polymer networks. Surprisingly, the diffusion of a tracer particle in a network of a purified protein, actin, was found to conform to the continuous time random walk type (CTRW). We set out to resolve this discrepancy by studying the tracer particle diffusion using two different tracer particle sizes, in actin networks of different mesh sizes. We find that the ratio of tracer particle size to the characteristic length scale of a bio-polymer network plays a crucial role in determining the type of diffusion it performs. We find that the diffusion of the tracer particles has features of fBm when the particle is large compared to the mesh size, of normal diffusion when the particle is much smaller than the mesh size, and of the CTRW in between these two limits. Based on our findings, we propose and verify numerically a new model for the motion of the tracer in all regimes. Our model suggests that diffusion in actin networks consists of fBm of the tracer particle coupled with caging events with power-law distributed escape times.},

  abstract = {Copper sulfides have many applications from thermoelectrics to biotechnology. While the properties of different copper sulfide phases are well understood, controlling the deposited copper sulfide stoichiometry remains a significant challenge, especially in solution-phase synthesis techniques. In this work, we investigate the chemical bath deposition of Cu x S on functionalized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to analyze the deposited films. We show that the use of thiourea as a sulfur source leads to the deposition of different copper sulfide phases and is controlled by the interaction of sulfur-containing ions in solution with the functionalized SAMs. For –COOH terminated SAMs, copper sulfide deposition is controlled by the surface polarity of the substrate. At the bath pH used in these experiments, the –COOH terminal groups are deprotonated. The resulting –COO − terminated SAM surface repels negatively charged sulfur-containing ions, leading to the deposition of Cu 2 S. For –CH 3 terminated SAMs, which are non-polar, there is no specific interaction between the SAM terminal group and sulfur-containing ions and CuS is deposited. For –OH terminated SAMs, which have a polar terminal group, there are two competing effects: the repulsion of S-containing ions by the small negative charge of the terminal –OH group and the increase in the concentration of sulfur-containing ions in solution as the bath pH increases. This competition leads to the deposit stoichiometry changing from Cu 2 S at pH 9 to CuS at pH 12.},

The crystallization kinetics also have a thickness dependence with the thinner films crystallizing much slower than the thicker ones. Additional experiments showed that decane layers at both the substrate and vacuum interfaces can also affect the crystallization rates. A comparison of the crystallization rates for CH 3 CN and CD 3 CN films showed only an isotope effect of ∼1.09. When amorphous films were deposited on a crystalline film, the crystalline layer did not act as a template for the formation of a crystalline growth front.

The analysis of natural underwater adhesives shows that L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and functional amyloid nanostructures are key components that contribute to the adhesive powers of these natural glues. The combination of DOPA and amyloid-forming peptides into DOPA-amyloid(-forming peptide) conjugates provides a new approach to design generic underwater adhesives. However, it remains unclear how the DOPA monomers may interact with amyloid-forming peptides and how these interactions may influence the adhesive ability of the conjugates. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of DOPA monomers, (glycine-DOPA) 3 chains, and a KLVFFAE and DOPA-glycine chain conjugate in aqueous environments using molecular simulations. The DOPA monomers do not aggregate significantly at concentrations lower than 1.0M. Simulations of (glycine-DOPA) 3 chains in water were done to examine the intra-molecular interactions of the chain, wherein we found that there were unlikely to be interactions detrimental to the adhesion process. After combining the alternating DOPA-glycine chain with the amyloid-forming peptide KLVFFAE into a single chain conjugate, we then simulated the conjugate in water and saw the possibility of both intra-chain folding and no chain folding in the conjugate.},

  abstract = {Within the exploration of sustainable and functional materials, narrow bandgap magnesium silicide semiconductors have gained growing interest. Intriguingly, squeezing silicides to extreme pressures and exposing them to non-ambient temperatures proves fruitful to study the structural behavior, tune the electronic structure, or discover novel phases. Herein, structural changes and thermoelastic characteristics of magnesium silicides were probed with synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell and large volume press at high pressure and temperature and temperature-dependent synchrotron powder diffraction. Probing the ambient phase of Mg 2 Si (anti-CaF 2 -type Mg 2 Si, space group: Fm 3 ¯ m ) at static pressures of giga-Pascals possibly unveiled the transformation to metastable orthorhombic anti-PbCl 2 -type Mg 2 Si ( Pnma ). Interestingly, heating under pressures introduced the decomposition of Mg 2 Si to hexagonal Mg 9 Si 5 ( P 6 3 ) and minor Mg. Using equations of state (EoS), which relate pressure to volume, the bulk moduli of anti-CaF 2 -type Mg 2 Si, anti-PbCl 2 -type Mg 2 Si, and Mg 9 Si 5 were determined to be B 0 = 47(2) GPa, B 0 ≈ 72(5) GPa, and B 0 = 58(3) GPa, respectively. Employing a high-temperature EoS to the P – V – T data of anti-CaF 2 -type Mg 2 Si provided its thermoelastic parameters: B T 0 = 46(3) GPa, B ′ T 0 = 6.1(8), and ( ∂B T 0 / ∂T ) P = −0.013(4) GPa K −1 . At atmospheric pressure, anti-CaF 2 -type Mg 2 Si kept stable at T = 133–723 K, whereas Mg 9 Si 5 transformed to anti-CaF 2 -type Mg 2 Si and Si above T ≥ 530 K. This temperature stability may indicate the potential of Mg 9 Si 5 as a mid-temperature thermoelectric material, as suggested from previous first-principles calculations. Within this realm, thermal models were applied, yielding thermal expansion coefficients of both silicides together with estimations of their Grüneisen parameter and Debye temperature.},

As large broadening in the relaxation dispersion is identified in the mixtures of intermediate concentrations, strong temperature dependence of the relaxation dispersion is detected. The relation between the stretching exponent and non-linear factor derived from the Tool–Narayanaswamy–Moynihan–Hodge model shows a remarkable shift from the one established by pure molecular glass formers and symmetric mixtures.

The terahertz frequency-domain spectra (THz-FDS) of water are calculated by applying fast Fourier transform to the configurational data of water molecules. According to the characteristic frequencies in the THz-FDS, the dominant motions of water molecules in MIL-101(Cr) can be categorized into three types: (1) low-frequency translational motion (0–0.5 THz), (2) medium-frequency vibrational motion (2–2.5 THz), and (3) high-frequency vibrational motion (&gt;6 THz). Each type of water motion is confirmed by visualizing the water configuration in MIL-101(Cr). The ratio of the number of water molecules with low-frequency translational motion to the total number of water molecules increases with the increase in vapor pressure. In contrast, that with medium-frequency vibrational motion is found to decrease with vapor pressure, exhibiting a pronounced decrease after water condensation has started in the cavities. That with the high-frequency vibrational motion is almost independent of the vapor pressure. The interactions between different types of water molecules affect the THz-FDS. Furthermore, the self-diffusion coefficient and the velocity auto-correlation function are calculated to clarify the adsorption state of the water confined in MIL-101(Cr). To confirm that the general trend of the THz-FDS does not depend on the water model, the simulations are performed using three water models, namely, rigid SPC/E, flexible SPC/E, and rigid TIP5PEw.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs), the scope of applications of DESs has been expanded to include situations in which miscibility with water is undesirable. Whereas most studies have focused on the applications of hydrophobic DESs from a practical standpoint, few theoretical works exist that investigate the structural and thermodynamic properties at the nanoscale. In this study, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to model DESs composed of tetraalkylammonium chloride hydrogen bond acceptor and decanoic acid hydrogen bond donor (HBD) at a molar ratio of 1:2, with three different cation chain lengths (4, 7, and 8). After fine-tuning force field parameters, densities, viscosities, self-diffusivities, and ionic conductivities of the DESs were computed over a wide temperature range. The liquid structure was examined using radial distribution functions (RDFs) and hydrogen bond analysis. The MD simulations reproduced the experimental density and viscosity data from the literature reasonably well and were used to predict diffusivities and ionic conductivities, for which experimental data are scarce or unavailable. It was found that although an increase in the cation chain length considerably affected the density and transport properties of the DESs (i.e., yielding smaller densities and slower dynamics), no significant influence was observed on the RDFs and the hydrogen bonds. The self-diffusivities showed the following order for the mobility of the various components: HBD &gt; anion &gt; cation. Strong hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups of decanoic acid and between the hydroxyl group of decanoic acid and chloride were observed to dominate the intermolecular interactions.},

  abstract = {The interaction of ions and water at high pressure and temperature plays a critical role in Earth and planetary science yet remains poorly understood. Aqueous fluids affect geochemical properties ranging from water phase stability to mineral solubility and reactivity. Here, we report first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of mono-valent ions (Li + , K + , Cl − ) as well as NaCl in liquid water at temperatures and pressures relevant to the Earth’s upper mantle (11 GPa, 1000 K) and concentrations in the dilute limit (0.44–0.88 m), in the regime of ocean salinity. We find that, at extreme conditions, the average structural and vibrational properties of water are weakly affected by the presence of ions, beyond the first solvation shell, similar to what was observed at ambient conditions. We also find that the ionic conductivity of the liquid increases in the presence of ions by less than an order of magnitude and that the dielectric constant is moderately reduced by at most ∼10\% at these conditions. Our findings may aid in the parameterization of deep earth water models developed to describe water–rock reactions.},

The phenomenological parameters characterizing the transitions between rovibrational states of the system induced by collisions can be extracted from experimental transition kinetic constants, relying on energy gap fitting laws. As the availability of these kinds of experimental data can be limited, this work relied on experimental line broadening coefficients, however still using energy gap fitting laws. The 3 μ m infrared spectral range of acetylene was chosen to illustrate the proposed approach. The method shows fair agreement with available experimental data while being computationally inexpensive. The results are discussed in the context of state laser quantum control.},

  abstract = {Generalization of an earlier reduced-density-matrix-based vibrational assignment algorithm is given, applicable for systems exhibiting both large-amplitude motions, including tunneling, and degenerate vibrational modes. The algorithm developed is used to study the structure of the excited vibrational wave functions of the ammonia molecule, 14 NH 3 . Characterization of the complex dynamics of systems with several degenerate vibrations requires reconsidering the traditional degenerate-mode description given by vibrational angular momentum quantum numbers and switching to a symmetry-based approach that directly predicts state degeneracy and uncovers relations between degenerate modes. Out of the 600 distinct vibrational eigenstates of ammonia obtained by a full-dimensional variational computation, the developed methodology allows for the assignment of about 500 with meaningful labels. This study confirms that vibrationally excited states truly have modal character recognizable up to very high energies even for the non-trivial case of ammonia, a molecule which exhibits a tunneling motion and has two two-dimensional normal modes. The modal characteristics of the excited states and the interplay of the vibrational modes can be easily visualized by the reduced-density matrices, giving an insight into the complex modal behavior directed by symmetry.},

Time-dependent oscillations are observed in both the photoelectron yields and the photoelectron angular distributions, providing insight into the interactions among the resonant intermediate states. In addition, for most states, we observe an exponential decay of the photoelectron yield that depends on the ionic final state. This observation can be rationalized by the different lifetimes for the intermediate states contributing to a particular ionization channel.

  abstract = {Octyl methoxycinnamate (2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, OMC) is a commercial sunscreen known as octinoxate with excellent UVB filter properties. However, it is known to undergo a series of photodegradation processes that decrease its effectiveness as a UVB filter. In particular, the trans (E) form—which is considered so far as the most stable isomer—converts to the cis (Z) form under the effect of light. In this work, by using post-Hartree–Fock approaches [CCSD, CCSD(t), and CCSD + T(CCSD)] on ground state OMC geometries optimized at the MP2 level, we show that the cis and trans forms of the gas-phase OMC molecule have comparable stability. Test calculations on the same structures with a series of dispersion-corrected density functional theory-based approaches including the B2PLYP double hybrid predict the trans structures to be energetically favored, missing the subtle stabilization of cis -OMC. Our results suggest that the cis form is stabilized by intra-molecular dispersion interactions, leading to a folded more compact structure than the trans isomer.},

It has been established that the process followed by these enzymes starts with the deprotonation of the substrate forming an enolate. In a second stage, the peroxidation of the enolate formation occurs, a process in which the system changes its spin multiplicity from a triplet state to a singlet state. In this article, we study the addition of O 2 to enolates using state-of-the-art multi-reference and single-reference methods. Our results confirm that intersystem crossing is promoted by stabilization of the singlet state along the reaction path. When multi-reference methods are used, large active spaces are required, and in this situation, semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction emerges as a powerful method to study these multi-configurational systems and is in good agreement with PNO-LCCSD(T) when the system is well-represented by a single-configuration.},

The measured binding energy spectra show that the formation of C 4 H 4 + can be attributed to the ionization of the outermost 1 π u orbital of acetylene. The kinetic energy distributions of the ionic fragments indicate that the C 4 H 4 + ions originate from direct ionization of acetylene dimers while ions resulting from the fragmentation of larger clusters would obtain significantly larger momenta. The formation of C 4 H 4 + through the evaporation mechanism in larger clusters is not identified in the present experiments.

In this work, an approach is proposed and demonstrated for simultaneous acquisition of ZULF-NMR spectra of individual 13 C-containing isotopomers of chemical compounds in a complex mixture. The method makes use of fast field cycling such that the spin evolution takes place under ZULF conditions, whereas signal detection is performed in a high-field NMR spectrometer. This method has excellent sensitivity, also allowing easy assignment of ZULF-NMR spectra to specific analytes in the mixture. We demonstrate that the spectral information is the same as that given by ZULF-NMR, which makes the method suitable for creating a library of ZULF-NMR spectra of various compounds and their isotopomers. The results of the field-cycling experiments can be presented in a convenient way as 2D-NMR spectra with the direct dimension giving the high-field 13 C-NMR spectrum (carrying the chemical-shift information) and the indirect dimension giving the ZULF-NMR spectrum (containing information about proton–carbon J-couplings). Hence, the method can be seen as a variant of heteronuclear J-resolved spectroscopy, one of the first 2D-NMR techniques.},

  abstract = {Matrix elements between nonorthogonal Slater determinants represent an essential component of many emerging electronic structure methods. However, evaluating nonorthogonal matrix elements is conceptually and computationally harder than their orthogonal counterparts. While several different approaches have been developed, these are predominantly derived from the first-quantized generalized Slater–Condon rules and usually require biorthogonal occupied orbitals to be computed for each matrix element. For coupling terms between nonorthogonal excited configurations, a second-quantized approach such as the nonorthogonal Wick’s theorem is more desirable, but this fails when the two reference determinants have a zero many-body overlap. In this contribution, we derive an entirely generalized extension to the nonorthogonal Wick’s theorem that is applicable to all pairs of determinants with nonorthogonal orbitals. Our approach creates a universal methodology for evaluating any nonorthogonal matrix element and allows Wick’s theorem and the generalized Slater–Condon rules to be unified for the first time. Furthermore, we present a simple well-defined protocol for deriving arbitrary coupling terms between nonorthogonal excited configurations. In the case of overlap and one-body operators, this protocol recovers efficient formulas with reduced scaling, promising significant computational acceleration for methods that rely on such terms.},

  abstract = {Hybridization functions are an established tool for investigating the coupling between a correlated subsystem (often a single transition metal atom) and its uncorrelated environment (the substrate and any ligands present). The hybridization function can provide valuable insight into why and how strong correlation features such as the Kondo effect can be chemically controlled in certain molecular adsorbates. To deepen this insight, we introduce a local decomposition of the hybridization function, based on a truncated cluster approach, enabling us to study individual effects on this function coming from specific parts of the systems (e.g., the surface, ligands, or parts of larger ligands). It is shown that a truncated-cluster approach can reproduce the Co 3 d and Mn 3 d hybridization functions from periodic boundary conditions in Co(CO) 4 /Cu(001) and MnPc/Ag(001) qualitatively well. By locally decomposing the hybridization functions, it is demonstrated at which energies the transition metal atoms are mainly hybridized with the substrate or with the ligand. For the Kondo-active 3 d x 2 − y 2 orbital in Co(CO) 4 /Cu(001), the hybridization function at the Fermi energy is substrate-dominated, so we can assign its enhancement compared with ligand-free Co to an indirect effect of ligand–substrate interactions. In MnPc/Ag(001), the same is true for the Kondo-active orbital, but for two other orbitals, there are both direct and indirect effects of the ligand, together resulting in such strong screening that their potential Kondo activity is suppressed. A local decomposition of hybridization functions could also be useful in other areas, such as analyzing the electrode self-energies in molecular junctions.},

  abstract = {A proper understanding and description of the electronic response of the electrode surfaces in electrochemical systems are quite important because the interactions between the electrode surface and electrolyte give rise to unique and useful interfacial properties. Atomistic modeling of the electrodes requires not only an accurate description of the electronic response under a constant-potential condition but also computational efficiency in order to deal with systems large enough to investigate the interfacial electrolyte structures. We thus develop a self-consistent-charge density functional tight binding based method to model a pair of electrodes in electrochemical cells under the constant-potential condition. The method is more efficient than the ( ab initio ) density functional theory calculations so that it can treat systems as large as those studied in classical atomistic simulations. It can also describe the electronic response of electrodes quantum mechanically and more accurately than the classical counterparts. The constant-potential condition is introduced through a Legendre transformation of the electronic energy with respect to the difference in the number of electrons in the two electrodes and their electrochemical potential difference, through which the Kohn–Sham equations for each electrode are variationally derived. The method is applied to platinum electrodes faced parallel to each other under an applied voltage. The electronic response to the voltage and a charged particle is compared with the result of a classical constant-potential method based on the chemical potential equalization principle.},

The ML-GMCTDH scheme provides an embedding of a variationally evolving Gaussian wavepacket basis into a hierarchical tensor representation of the wavefunction. A first-principles parameterized model Hamiltonian for ultrafast non-adiabatic dynamics in an oligothiophene–fullerene charge transfer complex is employed, relying on a two-state linear vibronic coupling model that combines a distribution of tuning type modes with an intermolecular coordinate that also modulates the electronic coupling. Efficient ML-GMCTDH simulations are carried out for up to 300 vibrational modes using an implementation within the QUANTICS program. Excellent agreement with reference ML-MCTDH calculations is obtained.},

  abstract = {Fast methods for calculating two-body interactions have many applications, and for molecular science and cosmology, it is common to employ periodic boundary conditions. However, for the 1/ r potential, the energy and forces are ill-defined. Adopted here is the model given by the classic Ewald sum. For the fast calculation of two-body forces, the most celebrated method is the fast multipole method and its tree-code predecessor. However, molecular simulations typically employ mesh-based approximations and the fast Fourier transform. Both types of methods have significant drawbacks, which, in most respects, are overcome by the less well-known multilevel summation method (MSM). Presented here is a realization of the MSM, which can be regarded as a multilevel extension of the (smoothed) particle mesh Ewald (PME) method, but with the Ewald softening replaced by one having a finite range. The two-level (single-grid) version of MSM requires fewer tuning parameters than PME and is marginally faster. Additionally, higher-level versions of MSM scale well to large numbers of processors, whereas PME and other two-level methods do not. Although higher-level versions of MSM are less efficient on a single processor than the two-level version, evidence suggests that they are more efficient than other methods that scale well, such as the fast multipole method and tree codes.},

In order to study quantum dynamics of the PPCET process under an interaction with the non-Markovian environment, we employ the hierarchical equations of motion. We calculate transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and a newly defined two-dimensional resonant electronic–vibrational spectroscopy (2DREVS) signals in order to study the nonequilibrium reaction dynamics.

In this work, we revisit the uniform electron gas at finite temperature, as it is relevant to contemporary research, e.g., in the field of warm dense matter. In particular, we present a new scheme to eliminate finite-size effects both in the static structure factor S ( q ) and in the interaction energy v ⁠ , which is based on the density response formalism. We demonstrate that this method often allows us to obtain v in the thermodynamic limit within a relative accuracy of ∼0.2\% from as few as N = 4 electrons without any empirical choices or knowledge of results for other values of N .

Different FSSH parameters are benchmarked against multi-configurational time dependent Hartree (MCTDH) reference calculations using SO 2 and 2-thiocytosine as model, yet realistic, molecular systems. Qualitatively, FSSH is able to reproduce the trends in the MCTDH dynamics with (also without) an explicit external field; however, no set of FSSH parameters is ideal. The adequate treatment of the overcoherence in FSSH is revealed as the driving factor to improve the description of the excitation process with respect to the MCTDH reference. Here, two corrections were tested: the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH) correction and the energy-based decoherence correction. A dependence on the employed basis is detected in AFSSH, performing better when spin–orbit and external laser field couplings are treated as off-diagonal elements instead of projecting them onto the diagonal of the Hamilton operator. In the presence of an electric field, the excited state dynamics was found to depend strongly on the vector used to rescale the kinetic energy along after a transition between surfaces. For SO 2 , recurrence of the excited wave packet throughout the duration of the applied laser pulse is observed for laser pulses (&gt;100 fs), resulting in additional interferences missed by FSSH and only visible in variational multi-configurational Gaussian when utilizing a large number of Gaussian basis functions. This feature vanishes when going toward larger molecules, such as 2-thiocytosine, where this effect is barely visible in a laser pulse 200 fs long.},

The results are general and not limited by values of gas supersaturation and gas solubility in the surrounding liquid solution. It is shown how the nonuniform concentration profile of the dissolved gas in supersaturated solution around the growing bubble changes with time and distance from the center of the overcritical bubble and gradually transforms into a stationary (at low solubility and moderate supersaturation of the dissolved gas) or self-similar profile (at large solubility and supersaturation of the dissolved gas). The kinetic theory of the nucleation stage with the excluded volume has been extended to the case of non-stationary gas concentration profiles due to viscous and capillary forces. The general approach has been illustrated in the limiting case of negligible viscous but significant capillary contributions to the vapor pressure in the bubble and in the case when the approximation of the mean field of gas supersaturation can be applied.},

  abstract = {Reversibly photoswitchable probes allow for a wide variety of optical imaging applications. In particular, photoswitchable fluorescent probes have significantly facilitated the development of super-resolution microscopy. Recently, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging, a sensitive and chemical-specific optical microscopy, has proven to be a powerful live-cell imaging strategy. Driven by the advances of newly developed Raman probes, in particular the pre-resonance enhanced narrow-band vibrational probes, electronic pre-resonance SRS (epr-SRS) has achieved super-multiplex imaging with sensitivity down to 250 nM and multiplexity up to 24 colors. However, despite the high demand, photoswitchable Raman probes have yet to be developed. Here, we propose a general strategy for devising photoswitchable epr-SRS probes. Toward this goal, we exploit the molecular electronic and vibrational coupling, in which we switch the electronic states of the molecules to four different states to turn their ground-state epr-SRS signals on and off. First, we showed that inducing transitions to both the electronic excited state and triplet state can effectively diminish the SRS peaks. Second, we revealed that the epr-SRS signals can be effectively switched off in red-absorbing organic molecules through light-facilitated transitions to a reduced state. Third, we identified that photoswitchable proteins with near-infrared photoswitchable absorbance, whose states are modulable with their electronic resonances detunable toward and away from the pump photon energy, can function as the photoswitchable epr-SRS probes with desirable sensitivity (40 cycles). These photophysical characterizations and proof-of-concept demonstrations should advance the development of novel photoswitchable Raman probes and open up the unexplored Raman imaging capabilities.},

  abstract = {Intermolecular interactions between cholesterol and lipids in cell membranes, which play critical roles in cellular processes such as the formation of nano-domains, depend on the molecular structure of the lipids. The diffusion and the spatial arrangement of cholesterol within the lipid membranes also change with the type of lipids. For example, the flip-flop, an important transport mechanism for cholesterol in the membranes, can be facilitated significantly by the presence of unsaturated lipids. However, how the structure of lipids affects the spatial arrangement and the dynamics of cholesterol remains elusive at a molecular level. In this study, we investigate the effects of lipid–cholesterol interactions on the spatial arrangement and the dynamics of cholesterol. We perform molecular dynamics simulations for the binary component membranes of lipids and cholesterol. We employ seven different kinds of lipids by changing either the degree of a saturation level or the length of lipid tails. We find from our simulations that the rate of cholesterol flip-flop is enhanced as the lipids are either less saturated or shorter, which is consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, when the lipid tails are fully saturated and sufficiently long, the center in between two leaflets becomes metastable for cholesterol to stay at. Because the cholesterol at the membrane center diffuses faster than that within leaflets, regardless of the lipid type, such an emergence of the metastable state (in terms of the cholesterol position) complicates the cholesterol diffusion significantly.},

  abstract = {Cosolvent effects on the coil–globule transitions in aqueous polymer solutions are not well understood, especially in the case of amphiphilic cosolvents that preferentially adsorb on the polymer and lead to both polymer swelling and collapse. Although a predominant focus in the literature has been placed on the role of polymer–cosolvent attractive interactions, our recent work has shown that excluded-volume interactions (repulsive interactions) can drive both preferential adsorption of the cosolvent and polymer collapse via a surfactant-like mechanism. Here, we further study the role of polymer–(co)solvent attractive interactions in two kinds of polymer solutions, namely, good solvent (water)–good cosolvent (alcohol) (GSGC) and poor solvent–good cosolvent (PSGC) solutions, both of which exhibit preferential adsorption of the cosolvent and a non-monotonic change in the polymer radius of gyration with the addition of the cosolvent. Interestingly, at low concentrations, the polymer–(co)solvent energetic interactions oppose polymer collapse in the GSGC solutions and contrarily support polymer collapse in the PSGC solutions, indicating the importance of the underlying polymer chemistry. Even though the alcohol molecules are preferentially adsorbed on the polymer, the trends of the energetic interactions at low cosolvent concentrations are dominated by the polymer–water energetic interactions in both the cases. Therefore, polymer–(co)solvent energetic interactions can either reinforce or compensate the surfactant-like mechanism, and it is this interplay that drives coil-to-globule transitions in polymer solutions. These results have implications for rationalizing the cononsolvency transitions in real systems such as polyacrylamides in aqueous alcohol solutions where the understanding of microscopic driving forces is still debatable.},

Notwithstanding this, the structure of concentrated electrolytes remains enigmatic. Many theoretical approaches attempt to model the concentrated electrolyte by introducing the idea of ion pairs, with ions either being tightly “paired” with a counter-ion or “free” to screen charge. In this study, we reframe the problem into the language of computational statistics and test the null hypothesis that all ions share the same local environment. Applying the framework to molecular dynamics simulations, we find that this null hypothesis is not supported by data. Our statistical technique suggests the presence of two distinct local ionic environments at intermediate concentrations, whose differences surprisingly originate in like charge correlations rather than unlike charge attraction. Through considering the effect of these “aggregated” and “non-aggregated” states on bulk properties including effective ion concentration and dielectric constant, we identify a scaling relation between the effective screening length and theoretical Debye length, which applies across different dielectric constants and ion concentrations.},

The binary patchy colloid system consists of solute molecules with spherically symmetric bonding sites and solvents with two singly bondable sites. Wertheim’s first order thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1) has been widely applied to the patchy colloids system and it has been combined with percolation theory to study the percolation threshold. However, due to assumptions behind TPT1, it will lose accuracy for a system in which particles have multiple association sites or multiply bondable sites. A recently proposed cluster distribution theory accurately models association at sites that can form multiple bonds. In this work, we investigate the comparison among cluster distribution theory, TPT1, and Monte Carlo simulation for the bonding states of this binary system in which cluster distribution theory shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulation, while TPT1 has a large deviation with the simulation. Cluster distribution theory was further combined with the Flory and Stockmayer percolation theory to investigate the interplay between phase behavior and percolation threshold. We found that the reduced density and the relative bonding strength of solvent–solvent association and solute–solvent association are key factors for the phase behavior and percolation. Percolation can form at low density and low temperature in the vapor phase of this binary system, where the star-like molecules with 12 long branches formed.},

  abstract = {Elemental copper and potassium are immiscible under ambient conditions. It is known that pressure is a useful tool to promote the reaction between two different elements by modifying their electronic structure significantly. Here, we predict the formation of four K–Cu compounds (K 3 Cu 2 , K 2 Cu, K 5 Cu 2 , and K 3 Cu) under moderate pressure through unbiased structure search and first-principles calculations. Among all predicted structures, the simulated x-ray diffraction pattern of K 3 Cu 2 perfectly matches a K–Cu compound synthesized in 2004. Further simulations indicate that the K–Cu compounds exhibit diverse structural features with novel forms of Cu aggregations, including Cu dimers, linear and zigzag Cu chains, and Cu-centered polyhedrons. Analysis of the electronic structure reveals that Cu atoms behave as anions to accept electrons from K atoms through fully filling 4 s orbitals and partially extending 4 p orbitals. Covalent Cu–Cu interaction is found in these compounds, which is associated with the sp hybridizations. These results provide insights into the understanding of the phase diversity of alkali/alkaline earth and metal systems.},

Herein, we report experiments designed to probe the electrochemical properties of solid–liquid interfaces using a model system of a single polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pore in contact with aqueous and propylene carbonate solutions of LiClO 4 . First, the existence and polarity of surface charges were inferred from current–voltage curves recorded when a pore was placed in contact with a LiClO 4 concentration gradient. Second, the electro-osmotic transport of uncharged polystyrene particles through the PET pore provided information on the polarity and the magnitude of the pore walls’ zeta potential. Our experiments show that the PET pores become effectively positively charged when in contact with LiClO 4 solutions in propylene carbonate, even though in aqueous LiClO 4 , the same pores are negatively charged. Additionally, the electro-osmotic velocity of the particles revealed a significantly higher magnitude of the positive zeta potential of the pores in propylene carbonate compared to the magnitude of the negative zeta potential in water. The presented methods of probing the properties of solid–liquid interfaces are expected to be applicable to a wide variety of solid and liquid systems.},

We have considered the adsorption of Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, and Pt atoms on crystalline silica bilayers, either free-standing or supported on Ru(0001) and Pt(111) metal surfaces. These systems have been compared with an hydroxylated SiO 2 /Si(100) film simulating the native oxide formed on a silicon wafer. The properties of the TM atoms change significantly on the various supports. While the unsupported silica bilayer weakly binds some of the TM atoms studied, the SiO 2 /Ru(0001) or SiO 2 /Pt(111) supports exhibit enhanced reactivity, sometimes resulting in a net electron transfer with the formation of charged species. Differences in the behavior of SiO 2 /Ru(0001) and SiO 2 /Pt(111) are rationalized in terms of different work functions and metal/oxide interfacial distances. No electron transfer is observed on the SiO 2 /Si(100) films. Here, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface provides relatively strong binding sites for the TM atoms that can be stabilized by the interaction with one or two OH groups. The final aspect that has been investigated is the porosity of the silica bilayer, at variance with the dense SiO 2 /Si(100) film. Depending on the atomic size, some TM atoms can penetrate spontaneously through the six-membered silica rings and become stabilized in the pores of the bilayer or at the SiO 2 /metal interface. This study shows how very different chemical properties can be obtained by depositing the same TM atom on different silica supports.},

The ice crystals gradually decrease in size with increasing substrate temperature and completely vanish at about 80 °C. Further heating to 100 °C induces changes in water droplet density, size, and shape through droplet coalescence and dissolution. However, even prolonged annealing at 100 °C does not completely dry the interface. The dewetting dynamics are controlled by the graphene cover. Thicker graphene flakes allow faster water diffusion as a consequence of the reduction of graphene’s conformity along the ice crystal’s edges, which leaves enough space for water molecules to diffuse along the ice edges and evaporate to the environment through defects in the graphene cover.},

Inside the nanopore, at the interface, properties of ions differ from those predicted by the classical ionic layering models (e.g., Gouy–Chapman electric double layer) when the thickness of the nanopore approaches the size of a single atom (e.g., nanopores in a single-layer graphene membrane). Here, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, the structure and dynamics of aqueous ions inside nanopores are studied for different thicknesses, diameters, and surface charge densities of carbon-based nanopores [ultrathin graphene and finite-thickness carbon nanotubes (CNTs)]. The ion concentration and diffusion coefficient in ultrathin nanopores show no indication of the formation of a Stern layer (an immobile counter-ionic layer) as the counter-ions and nanopore atoms are weakly correlated in time compared to the strong correlation observed in thick nanopores. The weak correlation observed in ultrathin nanopores is indicative of a weak adsorption of counter-ions onto the surface compared to that of thick pores. The vanishing counter-ion adsorption (ion–wall correlation) in ultrathin nanopores leads to several orders of magnitude shorter ionic residence times (picoseconds) compared to the residence times in thick CNTs (seconds). The results of this study will help better understand the structure and dynamics of aqueous ions in ultrathin nanopores.},

Here, we unveil the complete phase transition behavior of hexagonal bundles of double-walled (DW) BNNTs of different chirality and diameters under hydrostatic pressures of up to 60 GPa. A series of new monolith phases are obtained from the compressed DW-BNNT bundles, whose structures can be well retained even after releasing the pressure. The bonding characters; electronic, optical, and mechanical properties; and Raman signature of these monolith phases are elucidated, which provide essential guidance for synthesis of new boron nitride materials with unprecedented properties for technological applications.},

As a result, the surface segregation and aggregation of Pd on the AgPd surface under reaction conditions of selective hydrogenation of acrolein are of great interest. In this work, we lay out a workflow that can predict the surface segregation and aggregation of Pd on a FCC(111) AgPd surface with and without the presence of acrolein. We use machine learning surrogate models to predict the AgPd bulk energy, AgPd slab energy, and acrolein adsorption energy on AgPd slabs. Then, we use the semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation to predict the surface segregation and aggregation under different bulk Pd concentrations. Under vacuum conditions, our method predicts that only trace amount of Pd will exist on the surface at Pd bulk concentrations less than 20\%. However, with the presence of acrolein, Pd will start to aggregate as dimers on the surface at Pd bulk concentrations as low as 6.5\%.},

In this study, we present a new parameterization method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is a stochastic population-based optimization method. Using glassy silica as a case study, we introduce two interatomic potentials using PSO, which are parameterized so as to match structural features obtained from ab initio simulations and experimental neutron diffraction data. We find that the PSO algorithm is highly efficient at searching for and identifying viable potential parameters that reproduce the structural features used as the target in the parameterization. The presented approach is very general and can be easily applied to other interatomic potential parameterization schemes.},

Yet, some of its hydrogen-bonded water molecules display significant orientational order. Upon cooling pure ice V, additional orientational ordering cannot be achieved on the experimental time scale. Doping with hydrochloric acid has been shown to be most effective in enabling the phase transition of ice V to its hydrogen-ordered counterpart ice XIII. Here, we present a detailed crystallographic study of this phase transition investigating the effects of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid as well as lithium and potassium hydroxide doping. The magnitudes of the stepwise changes in the lattice constants during the phase transition are found to be more sensitive indicators for the extent of hydrogen order in ice XIII than the appearance of new Bragg peaks. Hydrofluoric acid and lithium hydroxide doping enable similar ordering processes as hydrochloric acid but with slower kinetics. The various possible space groups and ordered configurations of ice XIII are examined systematically, and the previously determined P 2 1 / a structure is confirmed. Interestingly, the partial hydrogen order already present in ice V is found to perpetuate into ice XIII, and these ordering processes are found to be independent of pressure. Overall, the hydrogen ordering goes along with a small increase in volume, which appears to be the origin of the slower hydrogen-ordering kinetics under pressure. Heating pressure-quenched samples at ambient pressure revealed low-temperature “transient ordering” features in both diffraction and calorimetry.},

It is found that on the PEL, the signatures of the out-of-equilibrium LDA–HDA transition are reminiscent of those of the equilibrium LLPT in terms of pressure, inherent structure pressure, inherent structure energy, and shape function, indicating that the LDA–HDA transformation is a first-order-like transition. However, differences are also found between the out-of-equilibrium phase transition and the equilibrium one, for example, the path from LDA to HDA on the PEL cannot be accessed by the path from LDL to HDL. Our results also suggest that the signatures of the out-of-equilibrium transition in gallium are rather general features of systems with an accessible LLPT—not only systems with pairwise interactions but also those with many-body interactions. This finding is of crucial importance for obtaining a deeper understanding of the nature of transitions in the polyamorphic family.},

The 2D-IR experiments were performed in both parallel (⟨ ZZZZ ⟩) and perpendicular (⟨ ZZXX ⟩) polarizations at room temperature. In EAN, the non-Gaussian lineshape in the FTIR spectrum of SCN − suggests two sub-ensembles. Vibrational relaxation rates extracted from the 2D-IR spectra provide evidence of the dynamical differences between the two sub-ensembles. We support the interpretation of two sub-ensembles with response function simulations of two overlapping bands with different vibrational relaxation rates and, otherwise, similar dynamics. The measured rates for spectral diffusion depend on polarization, indicating reorientation-induced spectral diffusion (RISD). A model of restricted molecular rotation (wobbling in a cone) fully describes the observed spectral diffusion in EAN. In H 2 O, both RISD and structural spectral diffusion contribute with similar timescales. This complete characterization of the dynamics at room temperature provides the basis for the temperature-dependent measurements in Paper II of this series.},

Hidden scale invariance of the potential-energy function is established by showing that mean-squared displacement and the static structure factor are invariant along the lines of constant excess entropy (isomorphs). The isomorph theory of melting [Pedersen et al. , Nat. Commun. 7 , 12386 (2016)] is used to predict from simulations at a single state point the freezing line’s shape, the entropy of melting, and the Lindemann parameter of the crystal at melting. Finally, our results suggest that the body-centered cubic crystal is the thermodynamically stable phase at high pressures.},

  abstract = {It is well known that ultraviolet photoexcitation of iron pentacarbonyl results in rapid loss of carbonyl ligands leading to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated iron carbonyl compounds. We employ ultrafast mid-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy to probe the photodissociation dynamics of gas-phase iron pentacarbonyl following ultraviolet excitation at 265 and 199 nm. After photoexcitation at 265 nm, our results show evidence for sequential dissociation of iron pentacarbonyl to form iron tricarbonyl via a short-lived iron tetracarbonyl intermediate. Photodissociation at 199 nm results in the prompt production of Fe(CO) 3 within 0.25 ps via several energetically accessible pathways. An additional 15 ps time constant extracted from the data is tentatively assigned to intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold of iron tricarbonyl or iron dicarbonyl. Mechanisms for formation of iron tetracarbonyl, iron tricarbonyl, and iron dicarbonyl are proposed and theoretically validated with one-dimensional cuts through the potential energy surface as well as bond dissociation energies. Ground state calculations are computed at the CCSD(T) level of theory and excited states are computed with EOM-EE-CCSD(dT).},

An optical centrifuge with tunable bandwidth is used to control the extent of rotational excitation in the sample. The rotational distributions are inverted with a maximum population in J = 62. Rotational levels with J &gt; 62 have populations that correlate with the intensity profile of the optical trap. The full bandwidth trap excites CO up to the J = 80 level, while J = 67 is the highest level observed in the reduced bandwidth trap. Polarization-sensitive transient spectroscopy shows that the initial orientational anisotropy is r = 0.8 for levels with J ≥ 55, while anisotropy values are near r = 0.4 for levels with J 50 is broadened slightly by collisions, consistent with small | Δ J | propensity rules for rotational energy transfer. Doppler-broadened line profiles show that the J = 60–80 levels have translational temperatures near T trans = 300 K and that these temperatures remain constant for as much as 24 gas kinetic collisions. Doppler linewidths for levels with J &lt; 60 are broadened by non-resonant rotation-to-translation energy transfer. Kinetic analysis of transient signals shows that collisions with thermal bath molecules are the predominant relaxation pathway.},

To support interpretation, theoretical approaches are needed that can describe both the nuclear and electron dynamics. Hence, we revisit and expand our ansatz for the coupled description of the nuclear and electron dynamics in molecular systems (NEMol). In this purely quantum mechanical ansatz, the quantum-dynamical description of the nuclear motion is combined with the calculation of the electron dynamics in the eigenfunction basis. The NEMol ansatz is applied to simulate the coupled dynamics of the molecule NO 2 in the vicinity of a conical intersection (CoIn) with a special focus on the coherent electron dynamics induced by the non-adiabatic coupling. Furthermore, we aim to control the dynamics of the system when passing the CoIn. The control scheme relies on the carrier envelope phase of a few-cycle IR pulse. The laser pulse influences both the movement of the nuclei and the electrons during the population transfer through the CoIn.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding involving sulfur atoms as acceptors is studied using two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy. The molecular system is a tertiary alcohol whose donating hydroxy group is embedded in a hydrogen-bond potential with torsional C 3 -symmetry about the carbon–oxygen bond. The linear and 2DIR-spectra recorded in the OH-stretching region of the alcohol can be simulated very well using Kubo’s line shape theory based on the cumulant expansion for evaluating the linear and nonlinear optical response functions. The correlation function for OH-stretching frequency fluctuations reveals an ultrafast component decaying with a time constant of 700 fs, which is in line with the apparent decay of the center line slopes averaged over absorption and bleach/emission signals. In addition, a quasi-static inhomogeneity is detected, which prevents the 2DIR line shape to fully homogenize within the observation window of 4 ps. The experimental data were then analyzed in more detail using a full ab initio approach that merges time-dependent structural information from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an OH-stretching frequency map derived from density functional theory (DFT). The latter method was also used to obtain a complementary transition dipole map to account for non-Condon effects. The 2DIR-spectra obtained from the MD/DFT method are in good agreement with the experimental data at early waiting delays, thereby corroborating an assignment of the fast decay of the correlation function to the dynamics of hydrogen-bond breakage and formation.},

  abstract = {We discovered a way to funnel high-frequency vibrational quanta rapidly and unidirectionally over large distances using oligo( p -phenylene) chains. After mid-IR photon photoexcitation of a —COOH end group, the excess energy is injected efficiently into the chain, forming vibrational wavepackets that propagate freely along the chain. The transport delivers high-energy vibrational quanta with a range of transport speeds reaching 8.6 km/s, which exceeds the speed of sound in common metals (∼5 km/s) and polymers (∼2 km/s). Efficiencies of energy injection into the chain and transport along the chain are found to be very high and dependent on the extent of conjugation across the structure. By tuning the degree of conjugation via electronic doping of the chain, the transport speed and efficiency can be controlled. The study opens avenues for developing materials with controllable energy transport properties for heat management, schemes with efficient energy delivery to hard-to-reach regions, including transport against thermal gradients, and ways for initiating chemical reactions remotely.},

By doping neutral droplets with Rhodamine 6G cations produced from an electrospray ionization source and detecting the positively charged droplets at two different locations along the beam path, we determine the velocities of the different groups of droplets. By subjecting the doped droplet beam to a retardation field, size distributions can then be analyzed. We discover that at stagnation temperatures above 8.0 K, a single group of droplets is observed at both locations, but at 8.0 K and below, two different groups of droplets with different velocities are detectable. The slower group, considered from fragmentation of liquid helium, cannot be deterred by the retardation voltage at 9 kV, implying an exceedingly large size. The faster group, considered from condensation of gaseous helium, has a bimodal distribution when the stagnation temperatures are below 12.3 K at 20 and 40 atm, or 16.1 K at 60 atm. We also report similar size measurements using low energy electrons for impact ionization, and this latter method can be used for facile in situ characterization of pulsed droplet beams. The mechanism of the bimodal size distribution of the condensation group and the reason for the coexistence of both the condensation and fragmentation groups remain elusive.},

Most of these studies have focused on the spectral signature for the H + stretch (ν 3 ) and its combination bands with the intermolecular stretch coordinate (ν 1 ). However, little attention has been paid to the Fermi resonance interaction between the H + stretch (ν 3 ) and H + bend overtone (2ν 2 ) in the asymmetric proton-bound rare gas dimers, RgH + Rg′. In this work, we have investigated this interaction on KrH + Rg and XeH + Rg with Rg = (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe). A multilevel potential energy surface (PES) was used to simulate the vibrational structure of these complexes. This PES is a dual-level comprising of second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory and coupled-cluster singles doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] levels of ab initio theories. We found that when both the combination bands (nν 1 + ν 3 ) and bend overtone 2ν 2 compete to borrow intensity from the ν 3 band, the latter wins over the former, which then results in the suppression of the nν 1 + ν 3 bands. The current simulations offer new assignments for the ArH + Xe and KrH + Xe spectra. Complete basis set (CBS) binding energies for these complexes were also calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level.},

  abstract = {This paper is a theoretical “proof of concept” on how the on-site first-order spin–orbit coupling (SOC) can generate giant Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions in binuclear transition metal complexes. This effective interaction plays a key role in strongly correlated materials, skyrmions, multiferroics, and molecular magnets of promising use in quantum information science and computing. Despite this, its determination from both theory and experiment is still in its infancy and existing systems usually exhibit very tiny magnitudes. We derive analytical formulas that perfectly reproduce both the nature and the magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction calculated using state-of-the-art ab initio calculations performed on model bicopper(II) complexes. We also study which geometrical structures/ligand-field forces would enable one to control the magnitude and the orientation of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector in order to guide future synthesis of molecules or materials. This article provides an understanding of its microscopic origin and proposes recipes to increase its magnitude. We show that (i) the on-site mixings of 3d orbitals rule the orientation and magnitude of this interaction, (ii) increased values can be obtained by choosing more covalent complexes, and (iii) huge values (∼1000 cm −1 ) and controlled orientations could be reached by approaching structures exhibiting on-site first-order SOC, i.e., displaying an “unquenched orbital momentum.”},

Deciphering these patterns required analysis and modeling, involving both their predictions from convolved spatial and velocity distributions and fitting observed images to kinetic energies (KEs) and anisotropy parameters ( β s). As the first demonstration of this capability of SMI, the ensuing photoelectrons resulting from (2 + 1) resonant ionization of water in a selected rotational state were chosen to provide a rigorous basis for comparison to VMI. Operation with low acceleration voltages led to a measured SMI pattern with a unique vertical intensity profile that could be least-squares fitted to yield KE and β , in good agreement with VMI measurement. Due to the potential for improved resolution and the extended KE range achievable by this new technique, we expect that it might augment VMI in applications that require the analysis of charged particles and particularly in processes with high KE release.},

  abstract = {Free energies govern the behavior of soft and liquid matter, and improving their predictions could have a large impact on the development of drugs, electrolytes, or homogeneous catalysts. Unfortunately, it is challenging to devise an accurate description of effects governing solvation such as hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals interactions, or conformational sampling. We present a Free energy Machine Learning (FML) model applicable throughout chemical compound space and based on a representation that employs Boltzmann averages to account for an approximated sampling of configurational space. Using the FreeSolv database, FML’s out-of-sample prediction errors of experimental hydration free energies decay systematically with training set size, and experimental uncertainty (0.6 kcal/mol) is reached after training on 490 molecules (80\% of FreeSolv). Corresponding FML model errors are on par with state-of-the art physics based approaches. To generate the input representation for a new query compound, FML requires approximate and short molecular dynamics runs. We showcase its usefulness through analysis of solvation free energies for 116k organic molecules (all force-field compatible molecules in the QM9 database), identifying the most and least solvated systems and rediscovering quasi-linear structure–property relationships in terms of simple descriptors such as hydrogen-bond donors, number of NH or OH groups, number of oxygen atoms in hydrocarbons, and number of heavy atoms. FML’s accuracy is maximal when the temperature used for the molecular dynamics simulation to generate averaged input representation samples in training is the same as for the query compounds. The sampling time for the representation converges rapidly with respect to the prediction error.},

A subtle interplay among low-energy excited states having dominant charge-transfer and local character then governs TADF efficiency, making models for environmental effects both crucial and challenging. The main message of this paper is a warning to the community of chemists, physicists, and material scientists working in the field: the adiabatic approximation implicitly imposed to the treatment of fast environmental degrees of freedom in quantum–classical and continuum solvation models leads to uncontrolled results. Several approximation schemes were proposed to mitigate the issue, but we underline that the adiabatic approximation to fast solvation is inadequate and cannot be improved; rather, it must be abandoned in favor of an antiadiabatic approach.},

  abstract = {The ability to make sense of the massive amounts of high-dimensional data generated from molecular dynamics simulations is heavily dependent on the knowledge of a low-dimensional manifold (parameterized by a reaction coordinate or RC) that typically distinguishes between relevant metastable states, and which captures the relevant slow dynamics of interest. Methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence have been proposed over the years to deal with learning such low-dimensional manifolds, but they are often criticized for a disconnect from more traditional and physically interpretable approaches. To deal with such concerns, in this work we propose a deep learning based state predictive information bottleneck approach to learn the RC from high-dimensional molecular simulation trajectories. We demonstrate analytically and numerically how the RC learnt in this approach is connected to the committor in chemical physics and can be used to accurately identify transition states. A crucial hyperparameter in this approach is the time delay or how far into the future the algorithm should make predictions about. Through careful comparisons for benchmark systems, we demonstrate that this hyperparameter choice gives useful control over how coarse-grained we want the metastable state classification of the system to be. We thus believe that this work represents a step forward in systematic application of deep learning based ideas to molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict not only what organic crystal structures might occur but also the thermodynamic conditions under which they are the most stable would be extremely useful for discovering and designing new organic materials. The present study takes a step in that direction by predicting the temperature- and pressure-dependent phase boundary between the α and β polymorphs of resorcinol using density functional theory (DFT) and the quasi-harmonic approximation. To circumvent the major computational bottleneck associated with computing a well-converged phonon density of states via the supercell approach, a recently developed approximation is employed, which combines a supercell phonon density of states from dispersion-corrected third-order density functional tight binding [DFTB3-D3(BJ)] with frequency corrections derived from a smaller B86bPBE-XDM functional DFT phonon calculation on the crystallographic unit cell. This mixed DFT/DFTB quasi-harmonic approach predicts the lattice constants and unit cell volumes to within 1\%–2\% at lower pressures. It predicts the thermodynamic phase boundary in almost perfect agreement with the experiment, although this excellent agreement does reflect fortuitous cancellation of errors between the enthalpy and entropy of transition.},

We show the enhancement of success probabilities of the catalyst-assisted procedure compared to the case where no catalysts are used. The optimal two-qubit catalyst and the maximum probability of the transformation using such catalysts can be obtained analytically. The enhancement of concentration success probability using catalysts of higher dimensions is demonstrated numerically.

  abstract = {The interactions of the polar chemical bonds such as C=O and N–H with an external electric field were investigated, and a linear relationship between the QM/MM interaction energies and the electric field along the chemical bond is established in the range of weak to intermediate electrical fields. The linear relationship indicates that the electrostatic interactions of a polar group with its surroundings can be described by a simple model of a dipole with constant moment under the action of an electric field. This relationship is employed to develop a general approach to generating an electrostatic energy-based charge (EEC) model for molecules containing single or multiple polar chemical bonds. Benchmark test studies of this model were carried out for (CH 3 ) 2 –CO and N -methyl acetamide in explicit water, and the result shows that the EEC model gives more accurate electrostatic energies than those given by the widely used charge model based on fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP) in direct comparison to the energies computed by the QM/MM method. The MD simulations of the electric field at the active site of ketosteroid isomerase based on EEC demonstrated that EEC gave a better representation of the electrostatic interaction in the hydrogen-bonding environment than the Amber14SB force field by comparison with experiment. The current study suggests that EEC should be better suited for molecular dynamics study of molecular systems with polar chemical bonds such as biomolecules than the widely used ESP or RESP (restrained ESP) charge models.},

The benchmark interaction energies are obtained at the restricted open-shell CCSD(T) level of theory with complete basis set extrapolation (from aug-cc-pVQZ to aug-cc-pV5Z). We have analyzed the performance of selected wave function methods MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) as well as the F12a and F12b variants of coupled-cluster theory. In addition, we have tested dispersion-corrected density functional theory methods based on the PBE exchange-correlation model. The O24 × 5 dataset is a challenge to approximate methods due to the wide range of interaction energy strengths it spans. For the dispersion-dominated and mixed-type subsets, any tested method that does not include the triples contribution yields errors on the order of tens of percent. The electrostatic subset is less demanding with errors that are typically an order of magnitude smaller than the mixed and dispersion-dominated subsets.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations generate microscopic trajectories of complex systems at a single thermodynamic state point. We recently introduced a Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) approach for dynamical reweighting. Our approach mapped these trajectories to a Markovian description on the configurational coordinates and reweighted path probabilities as a function of external forces. Trajectory probabilities can be dynamically reweighted both from and to equilibrium or non-equilibrium steady states. As the system’s dimensionality increases, an exhaustive description of the microtrajectories becomes prohibitive—even with a Markovian assumption. Instead, we reduce the dimensionality of the configurational space to collective variables (CVs). Going from configurational to CV space, we define local entropy productions derived from configurationally averaged mean forces. The entropy production is shown to be a suitable constraint on MaxCal for non-equilibrium steady states expressed as a function of CVs. We test the reweighting procedure on two systems: a particle subject to a two-dimensional potential and a coarse-grained peptide. Our CV-based MaxCal approach expands dynamical reweighting to larger systems, for both static and dynamical properties, and across a large range of driving forces.},

Notable among them is the neglect of the vibrational relaxation in the reactant (donor) and product (acceptor) manifolds. Vibrational relaxation can play an important role when the energy transfer rate is faster than the vibrational relaxation rate. Under such conditions, donor to acceptor energy transfer can occur from the excited vibrational states. This phenomenon is not captured by the usual formulation based on the overlap of donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra. Here, we develop a Green’s function-based generalized formalism and obtain an exact solution for the excited state population relaxation and the rate of energy transfer in the presence of vibrational relaxation. We find that the application of the well-known Förster’s expression might lead to overestimation of R.},

  abstract = {The accurate description of biradical systems, and in particular the resolution of their singlet–triplet gaps, has long posed a major challenge to the development of electronic structure theories. Biradicaloid singlet ground states are often marked by strong correlation and, hence, may not be accurately treated by mainstream, single-reference methods such as density functional theory or coupled cluster theory. The anti-Hermitian contracted Schrödinger equation (ACSE), whose fundamental quantity is the two-electron reduced density matrix rather than the N -electron wave function, has previously been shown to account for both dynamic and strong correlations when seeded with a strongly correlated guess from a complete active space (CAS) calculation. Here, we develop a spin-averaged implementation of the ACSE, allowing it to treat higher multiplicity states from the CAS input without additional state preparation. We apply the spin-averaged ACSE to calculate the singlet–triplet gaps in a set of small main group biradicaloids, as well as the organic four-electron biradicals trimethylenemethane and cyclobutadiene, and naphthalene, benchmarking the results against other state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature.},

Here, we focus on LS-THC-MP3 and identify four variants with differing errors and efficiency characteristics. The performance of LS-THC-MP3 is analyzed for regular test systems with up to 40 first-row atoms. We also analyze the size-extensivity/size-consistency and grid- and basis set dependence of LS-THC-MP3. Overall, the errors observed are favorably small in comparison with standard density fitting, and a more streamlined method of generating grids via pruning is suggested. A practical crossover (the point at which LS-THC-MP3 is cheaper than the canonical method) is achieved around 240 correlated electrons. Despite several drawbacks of LS-THC that have been identified: an initial non-linearity of error when increasing system size, poor description of angular correlation, and a potentially large increase in error with the basis set size, the results show that LS-THC has significant potential for practical application to MP3 and other wavefunction methods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an application of mean force kinetic theory (MFT) to the calculation of the self-diffusivity of CO 2 in the supercritical fluid regime. Two modifications to the typical application of MFT are employed to allow its application to a system of molecular species. The first is the assumption that the inter-particle potential of mean force can be obtained from the molecule center-of-mass pair correlation function, which in the case of CO 2 is the C–C pair correlation function. The second is a new definition of the Enskog factor that describes the effect of correlations at the surface of the collision volume. The new definition retains the physical picture that this quantity represents a local density increase, resulting from particle correlations, relative to that in the zero density homogeneous fluid limit. These calculations are facilitated by the calculation of pair correlation functions from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the FEPM2 molecular CO 2 model. The self-diffusivity calculated from theory is in good agreement with that from MD simulations up to and slightly beyond the density at the location of the Frenkel line. The calculation is compared with and is found to perform similarly well to other commonly used models but has a greater potential for application to systems of mixed species and to systems of particles with long range interatomic potentials due to electrostatic interactions.},

Numerical results on a few three-dimensional solids show about ten-fold speedups over the previously developed GDF with little precision loss.

The single-atom dispersion of cobalt is confirmed by high-angle annular dark field-STEM and x-ray absorption fine structure techniques. In the epoxidation of methyl oleate under mild reaction conditions (35 °C, 0.1 MPa O 2 ), 99\% selectivity to the desired product is achieved at full conversion. Even for crude oils, Co-N-C/SiO 2 is also effective and good yields of the corresponding epoxides are obtained. In addition, the catalyst is easily recovered and can be reused five times without obvious decay in catalytic activity/selectivity. A superoxide radical involved reaction mechanism is proposed on the basis of kinetic study and EPR experiment.},

In a recent paper [Jeanmairet et al. , Chem. Sci. 10 , 2130–2143 (2019)], we introduced the framework to compute the energy gap, free energy profile, and reorganization free energy using molecular density functional theory. However, this technique, as other molecular liquid state theories, overestimates the bulk pressure of the fluid. Because of the very high pressure, the predicted free energy is dramatically exaggerated. Several attempts were made to fix this issue, either based on simple a posteriori correction or by introducing bridge terms. By studying two model half reactions in water, Cl → Cl + and Cl → Cl − , we assess the correctness of these two types of corrections to study electron transfer reactions. We found that a posteriori correction, because it violates the Variational principle, leads to an inconsistency in the definition of the reorganization free energy and should not be used to study electron transfer reactions. The bridge approach, because it is theoretically well grounded, is perfectly suitable for this type of systems.},

  abstract = {When calculating the spin multiplicity at either the second-order Møller-Plesset (MP2) or the iterative second-order approximate coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CC2) levels of theory using the same strategy for the calculation of the expectation value as in regular CC theory together with the usual definitions of the MP2 and CC2 density matrices, artificial spin contamination occurs in closed-shell molecules. Non-intuitively, for open-shell systems, results at the MP2 or CC2 levels of theory based on this procedure even suggest stronger contamination at the correlated level than for the Hartree–Fock reference, although treatment of electron correlation should lower spin contamination. In this Communication, the reasons behind this inconsistency are investigated and a solution is proposed, which removes spin contamination for closed-shell molecules and leads to physically meaningful results for open-shell cases. Additionally, we show that CC2 significantly outperforms MP2 in describing systems with a strongly spin-contaminated reference with a performance similar to that of full coupled-cluster with singles and doubles substitutions (CCSD).},

  abstract = {We review the trade-offs between speed, fluctuations, and thermodynamic cost involved with biological processes in nonequilibrium states and discuss how optimal these processes are in light of the universal bound set by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). The values of the uncertainty product Q of TUR, which can be used as a measure of the precision of enzymatic processes realized for a given thermodynamic cost, are suboptimal when the substrate concentration is at the Michaelis constant, and some of the key biological processes are found to work around this condition. We illustrate the utility of Q in assessing how close the molecular motors and biomass producing machineries are to the TUR bound, and for the cases of biomass production (or biological copying processes), we discuss how their optimality quantified in terms of Q is balanced with the error rate in the information transfer process. We also touch upon the trade-offs in other error-minimizing processes in biology, such as gene regulation and chaperone-assisted protein folding. A spectrum of Q recapitulating the biological processes surveyed here provides glimpses into how biological systems are evolved to optimize and balance the conflicting functional requirements.},

  abstract = {The deposition of pathological protein aggregates in the brain plays a central role in cognitive decline and structural damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease, the formation of amyloid- β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of the tau protein is associated with the appearance of symptoms and pathology. Detailed models for the specific mechanisms of aggregate formation, such as nucleation and elongation, exist for aggregation in vitro where the total protein mass is conserved. However, in vivo , an additional class of mechanisms that clear pathological species is present and is believed to play an essential role in limiting the formation of aggregates and preventing or delaying the emergence of disease. A key unanswered question in the field of neuro-degeneration is how these clearance mechanisms can be modeled and how alterations in the processes of clearance or aggregation affect the stability of the system toward aggregation. Here, we generalize classical models of protein aggregation to take into account both production of monomers and the clearance of protein aggregates. We show that, depending on the specifics of the clearance process, a critical clearance value emerges above which accumulation of aggregates does not take place. Our results show that a sudden switch from a healthy to a disease state can be caused by small variations in the efficiency of the clearance process and provide a mathematical framework to explore the detailed effects of different mechanisms of clearance on the accumulation of aggregates.},

  abstract = {Mechanical spectral hole burning (MSHB) has been used to investigate the nonlinear dynamics in polymers, ranging from melts, solutions, block co-polymers, and glasses. MSHB was developed as an analog to the dielectric spectral hole burning method, which is not readily applicable in polymers due to weak dielectric response. While similar holes were observed in both mechanical and dielectric hole burning, the interpretations were different. In the latter case, it has been argued that the holes are related to dynamic heterogeneity as related to an increase in the local temperature of molecular sub-ensembles (spatial heterogeneity), while in the former case, the holes have been related to the type of dynamics (rubbery, Rouse, etc.). Recent work from our laboratories used MSHB to investigate glassy poly(methyl methacrylate) and showed evidence of hole burning and supported the hypothesis that the origin of holes was related to dynamic heterogeneity as evidenced by the holes being developed near the strong β-relaxation in PMMA. In this work, MSHB is used to study polycarbonate, which has a weak β-relaxation, and the results are compared with those observed in PMMA. We observe that the polycarbonate exhibits weak holes and the nature of the holes with a change in pump amplitude and frequency is different than observed in PMMA. These results support the hypothesis that the hole burning observed in amorphous polymers below the glass transition temperature is related to the strength of the β-transition, which, in turn, is related to molecular level heterogeneity in the material dynamics.},

  abstract = {Well-dispersed composites of polymer and nanorods have many emerging applications and, therefore, are an important area of research. Polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory and molecular dynamics simulations have become powerful tools in the study of the structure and phase behavior of polymer nanocomposites. In this work, we employ both PRISM theory and molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structure and spinodal phase diagram of 1\% volume fraction of nanorods in a polymer melt. We make quantitative comparisons between the phase diagrams, which are reported as a function of nanorod aspect ratio and polymer–nanorod interactions. We find that both PRISM theory and molecular dynamics simulations predict the formation of contact aggregates at low polymer–nanorod attraction strength ( γ ) and bridged aggregates at high polymer–nanorod attraction strength. They predict an entropic depletion-driven phase separation at low γ and a bridging-driven spinodal phase separation at high γ . The polymer and nanorods are found to form stable composites at intermediate values of the polymer–nanorod attraction strength. The fall of the bridging boundary and the gradual rise of the depletion boundary with the nanorod aspect ratio are predicted by both PRISM theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Hence, the miscible region narrows with increasing aspect ratio. The depletion boundaries predicted by theory and simulation are quite close. However, the respective bridging boundaries present a significant quantitative difference. Therefore, we find that theory and simulations qualitatively complement each other and display quantitative differences.},

This procedure allows us to determine good fitting parameters for homogeneous materials but is less effective for polymer mixtures. From a molecular simulation point of view, the timescales needed to derive those parameters are often accessed through the use of coarse-grain potentials. However, these potentials are often derived from linear model systems and the transferability to a more complex structure is not straightforward. Here, we verify the transferability of a potential computed from linear polymer simulations to more complex molecular shapes and present a type of analysis, which was recently formulated in the framework of a tube theory, to a coarse-grain molecular approach in order to derive the input parameters for a rheological model. We describe the different behaviors arising from the local topological structure of molecular sub-units. Coarse-grain models and mean-field based tube theory for polymers form a powerful combination with potentially important applications.},

The dominant contribution to the random energy landscape is provided by electrostatic contributions from dipoles or quadrupoles. An assumption of the preferable parallel orientation of neighbor quadrupoles or antiparallel orientation of dipoles directly leads to the formation of the exponential tails of the DOS even for a moderate size of the ordered domains. The insensitivity of the exponential tail formation to the details of the microstructure of the material suggests that this mechanism is rather common in amorphous organic semiconductors.},

The electronic structure and optical and magnetic properties of Cu 3+ ( d 8 )-, Cu 2+ ( d 9 )-, and Cu + ( d 10 )-doped ZnO QDs with sizes up to 1.5 nm are investigated using the GGA+ U approximation, with the + U corrections applied to d (Zn), p (O), and d (Cu) orbitals. Taking + U s parameters, as optimized in previous bulk calculations, we obtain the correct band structure of ZnO QDs. Both the description of electronic structure and thermodynamic charge state transitions of Cu in ZnO QDs agree with the results of bulk calculations due to the strong localization of Cu defect energy levels. Atomic displacements around Cu are induced by strong Jahn–Teller distortion and affect Kohn–Sham energies and thermodynamic transition levels. The average bond length of Cu–O and the defect structure are crucial factors influencing the electronic properties of Cu in ZnO QDs. The analysis of the optical properties of Cu in ZnO QDs is reported. The GGA+U results, compared with the available experimental data, support Dingle’s model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 23 , 579 (1969)], in which the structured green luminescence observed in bulk and nanocrystals originates from the [(Cu + , hole) → Cu 2+ ] transition. We also examine the magnetic interaction between the copper pair for two charge states: 0 and +2, and four positions relative to the center of QDs. Ferromagnetic interaction between ions is obtained for every investigated configuration. The magnitude of ferromagnetism increases for positive charge defects due to the strong hybridization of the d (Cu) and p (O) states.},

Qualitatively and quantitatively, the energy dependence is almost identical to the adsorption dynamics of diethyl ether on Si(001).

Uniform volume compression through hydrostatic high-pressure applications could decrease the energy gap between the valence and core bands, potentially shifting the CL emission wavelength to the ultraviolet (UV) region from 200 nm (6.2 eV) to 300 nm (4.1 eV). The ability to tune and shift the CL emission to UV wavelengths allows for the detection of the CL emission using UV-sensitive photodetectors in ambient atmosphere instead of highly specialized vacuum UV detectors operating in vacuum while maintaining the intrinsically fast CL decay times, thereby opening up new possibilities for KMgF as a fast-response scintillator.},

This can be beneficial for the design of new catalysts and electronic and data-storage devices. However, the growth of such surface nanostructures is not straightforward at the atomic scale. The cluster-based bulk structure of intermetallic compounds presents an original alternative to build surfaces with specific morphologies, in comparison to more traditional methods based on mechanical, chemical, or plasma treatments. It relies on their specific electronic structures—built from a network of bonds with a combination of ionic, covalent-like, and metallic characters, and also depends on the experimental conditions. In this paper, a few surface structures of cluster-based intermetallics are reviewed, with a special emphasis on quasicrystals and clathrates. We show how the intrinsic electronic properties of such compounds, as well as the surface preparation conditions, impact their surface morphologies, which can further influence the growth of atomic and molecular thin films at their surface.},

  abstract = {Semilocal (SL) density functional approximations (DFAs) are widely applied but have limitations due to their inability to incorporate long-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Non-local functionals (vdW-DF, VV10, and rVV10) or empirical methods (DFT+D, DFT+vdW, and DFT+MBD) are used with SL-DFAs to account for such missing interaction. The physisorption of a molecule on the surface of the coinage metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) is a typical example of systems where vdW interaction is significant. However, it is difficult to find a general method that reasonably describes both adsorption energy and geometry of even the simple prototypes of cyclic and heterocyclic aromatic molecules such as benzene (C 6 H 6 ) and thiophene (C 4 H 4 S), respectively, with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we present an alternative scheme based on Zaremba–Kohn theory, called DFT+vdW-dZK. We show that unlike other popular methods, DFT+vdW-dZK and particularly SCAN+vdW-dZK give an accurate description of the physisorption of a rare-gas atom (xenon) and two small albeit diverse prototype organic molecules on the (111) surfaces of the coinage metals.},

  abstract = {Domain boundaries are a determining factor in the performance of organic electronic devices since they can trap mobile charge carriers. We point out the possibility of time-dependent motion of these boundaries and suggest that their thermal fluctuations can be a source of dynamic disorder in organic films. In particular, we study the C8-BTBT monolayer films with several different domain boundaries. After characterizing the crystallography and diversity of structures in the first layer of C8-BTBT on Au(111), we focus on quantifying the domain boundary fluctuations in the saturated monolayer. We find that the mean squared displacement of the boundary position grows linearly with time at early times but tends to saturate after about 7 s. This behavior is ascribed to confined diffusion of the interface position based on fits and numerical integration of a Langevin equation for the interface motion.},

These isomers are molecularly adsorbed onto SiO 2 through π-hydrogen bonds with surface hydroxyl groups. However, experimental results suggest that the strength of interaction of these compounds with the SiO 2 surface varies for each isomer, with α-pinene showing the weakest interaction. This observation is supported by molecular dynamics simulations that α-pinene adsorbed on the SiO 2 surface has lower free energy of desorption and a lower mass accommodation coefficient compared to other isomers. Additionally, our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show lower π-hydrogen bonding probabilities for α-pinene compared to the other three constitutional isomers. Importantly, these interactions are most likely present for a range of other systems involving organic compounds and solid surfaces and, thus, provide a thorough framework for comparing the interactions of organic molecules on indoor relevant surfaces.},

The protonation states of the four —COOH groups of the N3 dye change according to the modified pH conditions, thus affecting the number of —COOH and —NCS functional groups that participate in the adsorption to gold. Here, we use heterodyne detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) spectroscopy to obtain surface specific vibrational information on both —COOH and —NCS groups as a function of pH of the deposition conditions. Polarization-dependent HD-VSFG yields sets of complex χ (2) spectra, enabling us to perform a simultaneous fitting procedure to the polarization-dependent real and imaginary components and thus extract detailed structural information of the N3/gold interface. Our results show that N3 preferentially adsorbs to gold either with two —COOH groups and one —NCS group in more acidic conditions or with one —COOH group and two —NCS groups in more basic conditions.},

  abstract = {Electric double layer (EDL) represents one of the most basic concepts in electrochemistry and is pertinent to diverse engineering applications ranging from electrocatalysis to energy storage. Whereas phenomenological and coarse-grained models have been long established to describe ionic distributions in the diffuse layer, a faithful prediction of the physicochemical properties of the electrode–electrolyte interface from a molecular perspective remains a daunting challenge. In this work, we investigate the charging behavior of an Ag (111) electrode in NaF aqueous solutions leveraging experimental results and theoretical calculations based on the classical density functional theory for ion distributions in the diffuse layer and on the joint density functional theory (JDFT) for the electronic structure. When the Ag electrode is applied with a negative voltage, the surface charge density can be reasonably described by assuming a neutral Stern layer with the dielectric constant dependent on the local electric field as predicted by the Kirkwood equation. However, the specific adsorption of F − ions must be considered when the electrode is positively charged and the fluoride adsorption can be attributed to both physical and chemical interactions. Qualitatively, F − binding and partial charge transfer are supported by JDFT calculations, which predict an increased binding energy as the voltage increases. Our findings shed insight on the molecular characteristics of the Stern layer and the charge behavior of adsorbed species not specified by conventional EDL models.},

We investigate the asymptotic decay lengths of the one-body ionic density profiles for the RPM in contact with a planar electrode using classical Density Functional Theory (DFT) and compare these with the decay lengths of the corresponding two-body correlation functions in bulk systems, obtained in previous Integral Equation Theory (IET) studies. Extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to complement the DFT and IET predictions. Our DFT calculations incorporate electrostatic interactions between the ions using three different (existing) approaches: one is based on the simplest mean-field treatment of Coulomb interactions (MFC), while the other two employ the Mean Spherical Approximation (MSA). The MSAc invokes only the MSA bulk direct correlation function, whereas the MSAu also incorporates the MSA bulk internal energy. Although MSAu yields profiles that are in excellent agreement with MD simulations in the near field, in the far field, we observe that the decay lengths are consistent between IET, MSAc, and MD simulations, whereas those from MFC and MSAu deviate significantly. Using DFT, we calculated the solvation force, which relates directly to surface force experiments. We find that its decay length is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively close to the large decay lengths measured in experiments and conclude that the latter cannot be accounted for by the primitive model. The anomalously large decay lengths found in surface force measurements require an explanation that lies beyond primitive models.},

The 1 H NMR spin-lattice relaxation rates R 1 ( ω ) probed in the FC measurements for different isotope-labelled compounds are computed from the MD trajectories for broad frequency and temperature ranges. We find high correspondence between experiment and simulation. Concerning the rotational motion, we observe that the aliphatic and hydroxyl groups show similar correlation times but different stretching parameters, while the overall reorientation associated with the structural relaxation remains largely isotropic. Additional analysis of the simulation results reveals that transitions between different molecular configurations are slow on the time scale of the structural relaxation at least at sufficiently high temperatures, indicating that glycerol rotates at a rigid entity, but the reorientation is slower for elongated than for compact conformers. The translational contribution to R 1 ( ω ) is well described by the force-free hard sphere model. At sufficiently low frequencies, universal square-root laws provide access to the molecular diffusion coefficients. In both experiment and simulation, the time scales of the rotational and translational motions show an unusually large separation, which is at variance with the Stokes–Einstein–Debye relation. To further explore this effect, we investigate the structure and dynamics on various length scales in the simulations. We observe that a prepeak in the static structure factor S ( q ), which is related to a local segregation of aliphatic and hydroxyl groups, is accompanied by a peak in the correlation times τ ( q ) from coherent scattering functions.},

As an illustration, we compute the chemical potentials of the constituent particles of a two-component Kob–Andersen model glass former. To compute the chemical potential for different components, we combine the calculation of the overall free energy of the glass with a calculation of the chemical potential difference of the two components. We find that the standard method to compute chemical potential differences by thermodynamic integration yields not only a wide scatter in the chemical potential values, but also, more seriously, the average of the thermodynamic integration results is well above the extrapolated value for the supercooled liquid. However, we find that if we compute the difference in the chemical potential of the components with the non-equilibrium free-energy expression proposed by Jarzynski, we obtain a good match with the extrapolated value of the supercooled liquid. The extension of the Jarzynski method that we propose opens a potentially powerful route to compute the free-energy related equilibrium properties of glasses. We find that the solubility estimate of amorphous materials obtained from direct-coexistence simulations is only in fair agreement with the solubility prediction based on the chemical potential calculations of a hypothetical “well-equilibrated glass.” In direct-coexistence simulations, we find that, in qualitative agreement with experiments, the amorphous solubility decreases with time and attains a low solubility value.},

In this study, we investigate how to include the formation of these ion pairs in the extended Donnan steric partitioning pore model. We study the desalination of a water source where three ion pairs can be formed (NaCl, MgCl + , and MgCl 2 ) and also include water self-dissociation and the carbonate system. The model assumes infinitely fast reactions, which means that the participating ions are locally at chemical equilibrium with one another. A square stoichiometric reaction matrix composed of active species, moieties, and reactions is formulated. As the final constraint equation, we use the charge balance. The model predicts profiles in concentration, flux, and reaction rates across the membrane for all species and calculates the retention per group of ions. Ion pair formation has an influence on the fluxes of individual ions and therefore influences the retention of ions.},

The main forensic fingerprinting reagents (FFRs) currently in use can require multiple treatment steps to produce fingerprints of sufficient quality. Therefore, the development of new, more effective FFRs that require minimal chemical treatment is of great interest in forensic chemistry. In this work, prudently crafted density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations are utilized to derive mechanistic insight into the optical activity of the non-fluorescent product of ninhydrin, diketohydrindylidenediketohydrindamine (DYDA), and fluorescent product of DFO (1,8-diazafluoren-9-one). We investigate various protonation sites to gain an understanding of isomeric preference in the solid-state material. A relaxed scan of a single torsion angle rotation in the S 1 minimized geometry of the O-protonated DYDA isomer suggests a conical intersection upon ∼10° rotation. We show that the absence of a rigid hydrogen-bonded network in the crystal structure of DYDA supports the hypothesis of torsion rotation, which leads de-excitation to occur readily. Conversely, for the fluorescent DFO product, our calculations support an avoided crossing suggestive of a non-radiative mechanism when the torsion angle is rotated by about ∼100°. This mechanistic insight concurs with experimental observations of fluorescence activity in DFO and may aid the photophysical understanding of poorly visualized fingerprints due to weak fluorescence. We show that identifying suggestive avoided crossings via the method described here can be used to initialize thoughts toward the computational design of FFRs.},

From the evolution of the spectra during the ortho – para conversion process, the spectral lines were identified as para -H 2 O and ortho -H 2 O transitions. Eight vibrational transitions with rotational side peaks were observed in the mid-infrared: ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 , 2 ω 1 , 2 ω 2 , ω 1 + ω 3 , ω 2 + ω 3 , and 2 ω 2 + ω 3 . The vibrational frequencies ω 2 and 2 ω 2 are lower by 1.6\% and the rest by 2.4\%, as compared to those of free H 2 O. A model consisting of a rovibrational Hamiltonian with the dipole and quadrupole moments of H 2 O interacting with the crystal field was used to fit the infrared absorption spectra. The electric quadrupole interaction with the crystal field lifts the degeneracy of the rotational levels. The finite amplitudes of the pure v 1 and v 2 vibrational transitions are consistent with the interaction of the water molecule dipole moment with a lattice-induced electric field. The permanent dipole moment of encapsulated H 2 O is found to be 0.50 ± 0.05 D as determined from the far-infrared rotational line intensities. The translational mode of the quantized center-of-mass motion of H 2 O in the molecular cage of C 60 was observed at 110 cm −1 (13.6 meV).},

  abstract = {Nonadiabatic coupling is absent between the electronic ground X and first excited (singlet) A states of formaldehyde. As laser fields can induce conical intersections between these two electronic states, formaldehyde is particularly suitable for investigating light-induced nonadiabaticity in a polyatomic molecule. The present work reports on the spectrum induced by light—the so-called field-dressed spectrum—probed by a weak laser pulse. A full-dimensional ab initio approach in the framework of Floquet-state representation is applied. The low-energy spectrum, which without the dressing field would correspond to an infrared vibrational spectrum in the X-state, and the high-energy spectrum, which without the dressing field would correspond to the X → A spectrum, are computed and analyzed. The spectra are shown to be highly sensitive to the frequency of the dressing light allowing one to isolate different nonadiabatic phenomena.},

  abstract = {Resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy has been employed to observe sharp predissociation thresholds in the spectra of the lanthanide sulfides and selenides for the 4f metals Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Lu. As these molecules possess a large density of electronic states near the ground separated atom limit, these predissociation thresholds are argued to coincide with the true 0 K bond dissociation energies (BDEs). This is because spin–orbit and nonadiabatic couplings among these states allow the molecules to predissociate rapidly when the BDE is reached or exceeded. The measured BDEs, in eV, are as follows: 5.230(3) (PrS), 4.820(3) (NdS), 4.011(17) (SmS), 3.811(8) (EuS), 5.282(5) (GdS), 5.292(3) (TbS), 4.298(3) (DyS), 4.251(3) (HoS), 4.262(3) (ErS), 5.189(3) (LuS), 4.496(3) (PrSe), 4.099(3) (NdSe), 3.495(17) (SmSe), 3.319(3) (EuSe), 4.606(3) (GdSe), 4.600(6) (TbSe), 3.602(3) (DySe), 3.562(3) (HoSe), 3.587(3) (ErSe), and 4.599(6) (LuSe). Through the use of thermochemical cycles, the 0 K gaseous heat of formation, Δ f H 0 K ○ ⁠ , is reported for each molecule. A threshold corresponding to the onset of two-photon ionization in EuSe was also observed, providing the ionization energy of EuSe as 6.483(10) eV. Through a thermochemical cycle and the above reported BDE of the neutral EuSe molecule, the BDE for the Eu + -Se cation was also determined as D 0 (Eu + -Se) = 2.506(10) eV. Bonding trends of the lanthanide sulfides and selenides are discussed. Our previous observation that the transition metal sulfides are 15.6\% more strongly bound than the corresponding selenides continues to hold true for the lanthanides as well.},

Furthermore, the usage of the energy decomposition analysis approach provides further understanding of the characteristics of the van der Waals interactions. Additionally, ab initio calculations and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory analysis of the binary complexes of DEDS with He, Ne, Kr, and Xe atoms were carried out to get further insight into the characteristics of the van der Waal interactions of the disulfide bond.},

  abstract = {We present a first-principles study of the static and dynamic aspects of the strong Jahn–Teller (JT) and pseudo-JT (PJT) effects in niobium tetrafluoride, NbF 4 , in the manifold of its electronic ground state, 2 E , and its first excited state, 2 T 2 . The complex topography of the full-dimensional multi-sheeted adiabatic JT/PJT surfaces is analyzed computationally at the complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) and multireference second-order perturbation levels of electronic structure theory, providing a detailed characterization of minima, saddle points, and minimum-energy conical intersection points. The calculations reveal that the tetrahedral ( T d ) configuration of NbF 4 undergoes strong JT distortions along the bending mode of e symmetry, yielding tetragonal molecular structures of D 2 d symmetry with T d → D 2 d stabilization energies of about 2000 cm −1 in the X ̃ 2 E state and about 6400 cm −1 in the Ã 2 T 2 state. In addition, there exists strong X ̃ 2 E − Ã 2 T 2 PJT coupling via the bending mode of t 2 symmetry, which becomes important near the crossing seam of the X ̃ 2 E and Ã 2 T 2 potential energy surfaces. A five-state five-mode JT/PJT vibronic-coupling Hamiltonian is constructed in terms of symmetry-invariant polynomial expansions of the X ̃ 2 E and Ã 2 T 2 diabatic potential energy surfaces in the e and t 2 bending coordinates. The parameters of the Hamiltonian are determined by a least-squares fit of its eigenvalues to the CASSCF ab initio data. The vibronic spectra and the time evolution of adiabatic electronic population probabilities are computed with the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method. The complexity of the spectra reflects the effects of the exceptionally strong E × e and T 2 × e JT couplings and ( E + T 2 ) × ( e + t 2 ) PJT coupling. The time evolution of the populations of the adiabatic electronic states after the initial preparation of the Ã 2 T 2 state reveals the femtosecond nonadiabatic dynamics through a multidimensional seam of conical intersection. These results represent the first study of the static and dynamical JT/PJT effects in the X ̃ 2 E and Ã 2 T 2 electronic states of NbF 4 .},

  abstract = {Shape resonances appear when the system is trapped in an internuclear potential well after tunneling through a barrier. They manifest as peaks in the collision energy dependence of the cross section (excitation function), and in many cases, their presence can be observed experimentally. High-resolution crossed-beam experiments on the S( 1 D) + H 2 ( j = 0) reaction in the 0.81–8.5 meV collision energy range reaction revealed non-monotonic behavior and the presence of oscillations in the reaction cross section as a function of the collision energy, as predicted by quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. In this work, we have analyzed the effect of shape resonances on the differential cross sections for this insertion reaction by performing additional QM calculations. We have found that, in some cases, the resonance gives rise to a large enhancement of extreme backward scattering for specific final states. Our results also show that, in order to yield a significant change in the state-resolved differential cross section, the resonance has to be associated with constructive interference between groups of partial waves, which requires not getting blurred by the participation of many product helicity states.},

A full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface for the ground electronic state of Li 2 Na is utilized that includes an accurate treatment of the long-range interactions. The Li + LiNa reaction is barrierless and exoergic and exhibits a deep attractive potential well that supports complex formation. Thus, significant reactivity occurs even for collision temperatures approaching absolute zero. The reactive scattering calculations are based on a numerically exact time-independent quantum dynamics methodology in hyperspherical coordinates. Total and rotationally resolved rate coefficients are reported at 56 collision energies and include all contributing partial waves. Several shape resonances are observed in many of the rotationally resolved rate coefficients and a small resonance feature is also reported in the total rate coefficient near 50 mK. Of particular interest, the angular distributions or differential cross sections are reported as a function of both the collision energy and scattering angle. Unique quantum fingerprints (bumps, channels, and ripples) are observed in the angular distributions for each product rotational state due to quantum interference and shape resonance contributions. The Li + LiNa reaction is under active experimental investigation so that these intriguing features could be verified experimentally when sufficient product state resolution becomes feasible for collision energies below 1 K.},

The observed cationic products are IrO + , IrS + , and IrSO + , formed in endothermic reactions. Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the products are determined by modeling the kinetic energy dependent product cross sections: D 0 (Ir + –O) = 4.27 ± 0.11 eV, D 0 (Ir + –S) = 4.03 ± 0.06 eV, and D 0 (Ir + –SO) ≥ 2.95 ± 0.06 eV. The oxide BDE agrees well with literature values, whereas the two latter results are novel measurements. Quantum mechanical calculations are performed at the B3LYP level of theory using the def2-TZVPPD basis set for all product BDEs with additional calculations for IrS + , IrO 2 + , and IrSO + at the coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitation levels with def2-QZVPPD and aug-cc-pVXZ (X = T and Q and for IrS + , also X = 5) basis sets and complete basis set extrapolations. These theoretical BDEs agree reasonably well with the experimental values. 1 A 1 (IrO 2 + ), 5 Δ 4 (IrS + ), and 3 A″/ 1 A′ (IrSO + ) are found to be the ground states after including empirical spin–orbit corrections. The potential energy surfaces including intermediates and transition states for each reaction are also calculated at the B3LYP/def2-TZVPPD level. The formation of MO + (M = Re, Os, and Ir) from M + + SO 2 reactions is compared with those from the M + + O 2 and M + + CO reactions, where interesting trends in cross sections are observed. Overall, these studies suggest that the M + + O 2 reactions had restrictions associated with reactions along A′ and A″ surfaces.},

The magnetic properties and behavior of the “blue” electron were studied by a modified Evans nuclear magnetic resonance method (small downshift of the 31 P signal) and variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance ( g = 1.936 for Mo V ). The intermolecular exchange of the “blue” electron was limited by a geometrical factor, which requires the contact between Mo caps to exchange it between the heteropoly couple. The intramolecular exchange of the “blue” electron between Mo atoms was rather fast (5.3 × 10 9 s −1 ), with a rate of more than six orders of magnitude larger than the intermolecular exchange rate. Density functional theory was used to determine the most prevalent protonation sites in the mixed lacunary isomers with the aim of studying the intramolecular electron transfer pathway in the isolated [H 4 PW 9 Mo 2 O 39 ] 4− species. The singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essentially localized in one of the two nonequivalent molybdenum sites. The kinetics of the intramolecular electron exchange equilibrium Mo V + Mo VI → Mo VI + Mo V between the two molybdenum atoms bridged by an oxygen atom was found to be fast in agreement with the experimental result. The transition state is of mixed-valence type, with the SOMO delocalized over the Mo—O—Mo group. Spectroscopic parameters were found to be in fair agreement with experimental results.},

  abstract = {Amide I difference spectroscopy is widely used to investigate protein function and structure changes. In this article, we show that the common approach of assigning features in amide I difference signals to distinct secondary structure elements in many cases may not be justified. Evidence comes from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and 2D-IR spectroelectrochemistry of the protein cytochrome c in the amide I range, in combination with computational spectroscopy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This combination reveals that each secondary structure unit, such as an alpha-helix or a beta-sheet, exhibits broad overlapping contributions, usually spanning a large part of the amide I region, which in the case of difference absorption experiments (such as in FTIR spectroelectrochemistry) may lead to intensity-compensating and even sign-changing contributions. We use cytochrome c as the test case, as this small electron-transferring redox-active protein contains different kinds of secondary structure units. Upon switching its redox-state, the protein exhibits a different charge distribution while largely retaining its structural scaffold. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the change in charge distribution contributes to the spectral changes and that structural changes are small. However, in order to confidently interpret FTIR amide I difference signals in cytochrome c and proteins in general, MD simulations in combination with additional experimental approaches such as isotope labeling, the insertion of infrared labels to selectively probe local structural elements will be required. In case these data are not available, a critical assessment of previous interpretations of protein amide I 1D- and 2D-IR difference spectroscopy data is warranted.},

In this paper, we present developments to the DD-vMCG algorithm that improve both its accuracy and efficiency. First, a new, efficient parallel algorithm to control the DD-vMCG database of quantum chemistry points is presented along with improvements to the Shepard interpolation scheme. Second, the use of symmetry in describing the potential surfaces is introduced along with a new phase convention in the propagation diabatization. Benchmark calculations on the allene radical cation including all degrees of freedom then show that the new scheme is able to produce a consistent non-adiabatic coupling vector field. This new DD-vMCG version thus opens the route for effectively and accurately treating complex chemical systems using quantum dynamics simulations.},

This wavefunction physically represents a mean-field of pairs of electrons (geminals) with a constant pairing strength. To move beyond the mean-field, one must develop the wavefunction on the basis of all the RG states. This requires both practical expressions for transition density matrices and an idea of which states are most important in the expansion. In this contribution, we present expressions for the transition density matrix elements and calculate them numerically for half-filled picket–fence models (reduced BCS models with constant energy spacing). There are no Slater–Condon rules for RG states, though an analog of the aufbau principle proves to be useful in choosing which states are important.},

This new formalism is derived based on the generalized Kubo-transformed TCF using the Wigner representation for both the nuclear degrees of freedom and the electronic mapping variables. By dropping the non-Matsubara nuclear normal modes in the quantum Liouvillian and explicitly integrating these modes out from the expression of the TCF, we derived the non-adiabatic Matsubara dynamics approach. Further making the approximation to drop the imaginary part of the Matsubara Liouvillian and enforce the nuclear momentum integral to be real, we arrived at the non-adiabatic ring-polymer molecular dynamics (NRPMD) approach. We have further justified the capability of NRPMD for simulating the non-equilibrium TCF. This work provides the rigorous theoretical foundation for several recently proposed state-dependent RPMD approaches and offers a general framework for developing new non-adiabatic quantum dynamics methods in the future.},

The NNs are trained with data from molecular dynamics simulations of monoatomic gases and liquids, sampled in the NVT ensemble at various densities. We find that the NNs provide much more accurate results compared to the analytic low-density limit estimate of the second virial coefficient and the Carnahan–Starling equation of state for hard sphere liquids. Furthermore, we design and train NNs for computing (effective) pair potentials from radial pair distribution functions, g ( r ), a task that is often performed for inverse design and coarse-graining. Providing the NNs with additional information on the forces greatly improves the accuracy of the predictions since more correlations are taken into account; the predicted potentials become smoother, are significantly closer to the target potentials, and are more transferable as a result.},

We show that, depending on the occupation of the transition metal d orbitals, the Hubbard U correction can cause severe instabilities in the migration barrier energies predicted using generalized gradient approximation density functional theory (GGA DFT). For the d 0 oxide SrTiO 3 , applying a Hubbard correction to the Ti 4+ 3d orbitals below 4–5 eV yields a migration barrier of ∼0.4 eV. However, above this threshold, the barrier increases suddenly to ∼2 eV. This sudden increase in the transition state barrier arises from the Hubbard U correction changing the Ti 4+ t 2g /e g orbital occupation, and hence electron density localization, along the migration pathway. Similar results are observed in the d 10 oxide ZnO; however, significantly larger Hubbard U corrections must be applied to the Zn 2+ 3d orbitals for the same instability to be observed. These results highlight important limitations to the application of the Hubbard U correction when modeling reactive pathways in solid state materials using GGA DFT.},

  abstract = {Diabatization of the molecular Hamiltonian is a standard approach to remove the singularities of nonadiabatic couplings at conical intersections of adiabatic potential energy surfaces. In general, it is impossible to eliminate the nonadiabatic couplings entirely—the resulting “quasidiabatic” states are still coupled by smaller but nonvanishing residual nonadiabatic couplings, which are typically neglected. Here, we propose a general method for assessing the validity of this potentially drastic approximation by comparing quantum dynamics simulated either with or without the residual couplings. To make the numerical errors negligible to the errors due to neglecting the residual couplings, we use the highly accurate and general eighth-order composition of the implicit midpoint method. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated on nonadiabatic simulations in the cubic Jahn–Teller model of nitrogen trioxide and in the induced Renner–Teller model of hydrogen cyanide. We find that, depending on the system, initial state, and employed quasidiabatization scheme, neglecting the residual couplings can result in wrong dynamics. In contrast, simulations with the exact quasidiabatic Hamiltonian, which contains the residual couplings, always yield accurate results.},

  abstract = {The recent boom in computational chemistry has enabled several projects aimed at discovering useful materials or catalysts. We acknowledge and address two recurring issues in the field of computational catalyst discovery. First, calculating macro-scale catalyst properties is not straightforward when using ensembles of atomic-scale calculations [e.g., density functional theory (DFT)]. We attempt to address this issue by creating a multi-scale model that estimates bulk catalyst activity using adsorption energy predictions from both DFT and machine learning models. The second issue is that many catalyst discovery efforts seek to optimize catalyst properties, but optimization is an inherently exploitative objective that is in tension with the explorative nature of early-stage discovery projects. In other words, why invest so much time finding a “best” catalyst when it is likely to fail for some other, unforeseen problem? We address this issue by relaxing the catalyst discovery goal into a classification problem: “What is the set of catalysts that is worth testing experimentally?” Here, we present a catalyst discovery method called myopic multiscale sampling, which combines multiscale modeling with automated selection of DFT calculations. It is an active classification strategy that seeks to classify catalysts as “worth investigating” or “not worth investigating” experimentally. Our results show an ∼7–16 times speedup in catalyst classification relative to random sampling. These results were based on offline simulations of our algorithm on two different datasets: a larger, synthesized dataset and a smaller, real dataset.},

Several high-level ab initio investigations calculated the binding energies of these dimers using the coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and quasi-perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] method at the complete basis set [CBS] limit using various approaches such as reduced virtual orbital spaces and/or MP2-based basis set corrections. Here, we obtain CCSDT(Q) binding energies using a Weizmann-3-type approach. In particular, we extrapolate the self-consistent field (SCF), CCSD, and (T) components using large heavy-atom augmented Gaussian basis sets [namely, SCF/jul-cc-pV{5,6}Z, CCSD/jul-cc-pV{Q,5}Z, and (T)/jul-cc-pV{T,Q}Z]. We consider post-CCSD(T) contributions up to CCSDT(Q), inner-shell, scalar-relativistic, and Born–Oppenheimer corrections. Overall, our best relativistic, all-electron CCSDT(Q) binding energies are ∆ E e,all,rel = 1.234 (benzene–ethene) and 2.550 (benzene–benzene PD), ∆ H 0 = 0.949 (benzene–ethene) and 2.310 (benzene–benzene PD), and ∆ H 298 = 0.130 (benzene–ethene) and 1.461 (benzene–benzene PD) kcal mol −1 . Important conclusions are reached regarding the basis set convergence of the SCF, CCSD, (T), and post-CCSD(T) components. Explicitly correlated calculations are used as a sanity check on the conventional binding energies. Overall, post-CCSD(T) contributions are destabilizing by 0.028 (benzene–ethene) and 0.058 (benzene–benzene) kcal mol −1 , and thus, they cannot be neglected if sub-chemical accuracy is sought (i.e., errors below 0.1 kcal mol −1 ). CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pwCVTZ core–valence corrections increase the binding energies by 0.018 (benzene–ethene) and 0.027 (benzene–benzene PD) kcal mol −1 . Scalar-relativistic and diagonal Born–Oppenheimer corrections are negligibly small.

  abstract = {Electronic structure methods emerging from the combination of multiconfigurational wave functions and density functional theory (DFT) aim to take advantage of the strengths of the two nearly antagonistic theories. One of the common strategies employed to merge wave function theory (WFT) with DFT relies on the range separation of the Coulomb operator in which DFT functionals take care of the short-distance part, while long-range inter-electronic interactions are evaluated by using the chosen wave function method (WFT– sr DFT). In this work, we uncover the limitations of WFT– sr DFT in the characterization of open-shell systems. We show that spin polarization effects have a major impact on the (short-range) DFT exchange energy and are of vital importance in order to provide a balanced description between closed and open-shell configurations. We introduce different strategies to account for spin polarization in the short range based on the definition of a spin polarized electron density and with the use of short-range exact exchange. We test the performance of these approaches in the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule, the calculation of energy gaps in spin-triplet atoms and molecular diradicals, and the characterization of low-lying states of the gallium dimer. Our results indicate that the use of short-range DFT correlation in combination with a (full-range) multiconfigurational wave function might be an excellent approach for the study of open-shell molecules and largely improves the performance of WFT and WFT– sr DFT.},

This approach overcomes the difficulty of 2D Raman spectroscopy in dealing with small-signal extraction and avoids complicated low-order cascading effects, thus providing a new possibility for measuring the intramolecular and intermolecular modes of molecular liquids using fifth-order 2D Raman spectroscopy. Recently, for quantitatively investigating the mode–mode coupling mechanism, Hurwitz et al. [Opt. Express 28 , 3803 (2020)] have developed a new pulse design for this measurement to separate the contributions of the fifth- and third-order polarizations, which are often overlapped in the original single-beam measurements. Here, we describe a method for simulating these original measurements and the new 2D Raman measurements on the basis of a second-order response function approach. We carry out full molecular dynamics simulations for carbon tetrachloride and liquid water using an equilibrium–nonequilibrium hybrid algorithm, with the aim of explaining the key features of the SBSC 2D Raman spectroscopic method from a theoretical point of view.

In a simulation trajectory, these slow fluctuations are commonly identified using a principal component analysis (PCA). Despite the popularity of this method, a complete analysis of its predictions based on the physics of protein motion has been so far limited. This study formally connects the PCA to a Langevin model of protein dynamics and analyzes the contributions of energy barriers and hydrodynamic interactions to the slow PCA modes of motion. To do so, we introduce an anisotropic extension of the Langevin equation for protein dynamics, called the LE4PD-XYZ, which formally connects to the PCA “essential dynamics.” The LE4PD-XYZ is an accurate coarse-grained diffusive method to model protein motion, which describes anisotropic fluctuations in the alpha carbons of the protein. The LE4PD accounts for hydrodynamic effects and mode-dependent free-energy barriers. This study compares large-scale anisotropic fluctuations identified by the LE4PD-XYZ to the mode-dependent PCA predictions, starting from a microsecond-long alpha carbon molecular dynamics atomistic trajectory of the protein ubiquitin. We observe that the inclusion of free-energy barriers and hydrodynamic interactions has important effects on the identification and timescales of ubiquitin’s slow modes.},

  abstract = {The topology of two-dimensional network materials is investigated by persistent homology analysis. The constraint of two dimensions allows for a direct comparison of key persistent homology metrics (persistence diagrams, cycles, and Betti numbers) with more traditional metrics such as the ring-size distributions. Two different types of networks are employed in which the topology is manipulated systematically. In the first, comparatively rigid networks are generated for a triangle-raft model, which are representative of materials such as silica bilayers. In the second, more flexible networks are generated using a bond-switching algorithm, which are representative of materials such as graphene. Bands are identified in the persistence diagrams by reference to the length scales associated with distorted polygons. The triangle-raft models with the largest ordering allow specific bands B n ( n = 1, 2, 3, …) to be allocated to configurations of atoms separated by n bonds. The persistence diagrams for the more disordered network models also display bands albeit less pronounced. The persistent homology method thereby provides information on n -body correlations that is not accessible from structure factors or radial distribution functions. An analysis of the persistent cycles gives the primitive ring statistics, provided the level of disorder is not too large. The method also gives information on the regularity of rings that is unavailable from a ring-statistics analysis. The utility of the persistent homology method is demonstrated by its application to experimentally-obtained configurations of silica bilayers and graphene.},

  abstract = {Variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is an ab initio method for solving the electronic Schrödinger equation that is exact in principle, but limited by the flexibility of the available Ansätze in practice. The recently introduced deep QMC approach, specifically two deep-neural-network Ansätze PauliNet and FermiNet, allows variational QMC to reach the accuracy of diffusion QMC, but little is understood about the convergence behavior of such Ansätze . Here, we analyze how deep variational QMC approaches the fixed-node limit with increasing network size. First, we demonstrate that a deep neural network can overcome the limitations of a small basis set and reach the mean-field (MF) complete-basis-set limit. Moving to electron correlation, we then perform an extensive hyperparameter scan of a deep Jastrow factor for LiH and H 4 and find that variational energies at the fixed-node limit can be obtained with a sufficiently large network. Finally, we benchmark MF and many-body Ansätze on H 2 O, increasing the fraction of recovered fixed-node correlation energy of single-determinant Slater–Jastrow-type Ansätze by half an order of magnitude compared to previous variational QMC results, and demonstrate that a single-determinant Slater–Jastrow-backflow version of the Ansatz overcomes the fixed-node limitations. This analysis helps understand the superb accuracy of deep variational Ansätze in comparison to the traditional trial wavefunctions at the respective level of theory and will guide future improvements of the neural-network architectures in deep QMC.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear optical properties of organic chromophores are of great interest in diverse photonic and optoelectronic applications. To elucidate general trends in the behaviors of molecules, large amounts of data are required. Therefore, both an accurate and a rapid computational approach can significantly promote the theoretical design of molecules. In this work, we combined quantum chemistry and machine learning (ML) to study the first hyperpolarizability ( β ) in [2.2]paracyclophane-containing push–pull compounds with various terminal donor/acceptor pairs and molecular lengths. To generate reference β values for ML, the ab initio elongation finite-field method was used, allowing us to treat long polymer chains with linear scale efficiency and high computational accuracy. A neural network (NN) model was built for β prediction, and the relevant molecular descriptors were selected using a genetic algorithm. The established NN model accurately reproduced the β values ( R 2 &gt; 0.99) of long molecules based on the input quantum chemical properties (dipole moment, frontier molecular orbitals, etc.) of only the shortest systems and additional information about the actual system length. To obtain general trends in molecular descriptor–target property relationships learned by the NN, three approaches for explaining the ML decisions (i.e., partial dependence, accumulated local effects, and permutation feature importance) were used. The effect of donor/acceptor alternation on β in the studied systems was examined. The asymmetric extension of molecular regions end-capped with donors and acceptors produced unequal β responses. The results revealed how the electronic properties originating from the nature of substituents on the microscale controlled the magnitude of β according to the NN approximation. The applied approach facilitates the conceptual discoveries in chemistry by using ML to both (i) efficiently generate data and (ii) provide a source of information about causal correlations among system properties.},

Using the maximum overlap method to guide optimization of the excited state, ΔSCF has been shown to predict excitation energies with a level of accuracy that is competitive with, and sometimes better than, that of time-dependent density functional theory. Here, we benchmark ΔSCF on a larger set of molecules than has previously been considered, and, in particular, we examine the performance of ΔSCF in predicting transition dipole moments, the essential quantity for spectral intensities. A potential downfall for ΔSCF transition dipoles is origin dependence induced by the nonorthogonality of ΔSCF ground and excited states. We propose and test a simple correction for this problem, based on symmetric orthogonalization of the states, and demonstrate its use on bacteriochlorophyll structures sampled from the photosynthetic antenna in purple bacteria.},

In this work, we observed a wide variation in Ca 2+ binding loop conformations of the Ca 2+ -binding protein calmodulin, which adopts the most populated ternary structures determined from the molecular dynamics simulations, followed by ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on all 12 amino acids in the loop that coordinate Ca 2+ in aqueous solution. Ca 2+ charges were derived by fitting to the electrostatic potential in the context of a classical or polarizable force field (PFF). We discovered that the atomic radius of Ca 2+ in conventional force fields is too large for the QM calculation to capture the variation in the coordination geometry of Ca 2+ in its ionic form, leading to unphysical charges. Specifically, we found that the fitted atomic charges of Ca 2+ in the context of PFF depend on the coordinating geometry of electronegative atoms from the amino acids in the loop. Although nearby water molecules do not influence the atomic charge of Ca 2+ , they are crucial for compensating for the coordination of Ca 2+ due to the conformational flexibility in the EF-hand loop. Our method advances the development of force fields for metal ions and protein binding sites in dynamic environments.},

The ability of the semi-stochastic CC( P ; Q ) formalism to recover the CCSDT and CCSDTQ energies, even when electronic quasi-degeneracies and triply and quadruply excited clusters become substantial, is illustrated by a few numerical examples, including the F–F bond breaking in F 2 , the automerization of cyclobutadiene, and the double dissociation of the water molecule.},

  abstract = {The training set of atomic configurations is key to the performance of any Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF) and, as such, the training set selection determines the applicability of the MLFF model for predictive molecular simulations. However, most atomistic reference datasets are inhomogeneously distributed across configurational space (CS), and thus, choosing the training set randomly or according to the probability distribution of the data leads to models whose accuracy is mainly defined by the most common close-to-equilibrium configurations in the reference data. In this work, we combine unsupervised and supervised ML methods to bypass the inherent bias of the data for common configurations, effectively widening the applicability range of the MLFF to the fullest capabilities of the dataset. To achieve this goal, we first cluster the CS into subregions similar in terms of geometry and energetics. We iteratively test a given MLFF performance on each subregion and fill the training set of the model with the representatives of the most inaccurate parts of the CS. The proposed approach has been applied to a set of small organic molecules and alanine tetrapeptide, demonstrating an up to twofold decrease in the root mean squared errors for force predictions on non-equilibrium geometries of these molecules. Furthermore, our ML models demonstrate superior stability over the default training approaches, allowing reliable study of processes involving highly out-of-equilibrium molecular configurations. These results hold for both kernel-based methods (sGDML and GAP/SOAP models) and deep neural networks (SchNet model).},

Here, we apply a general procedure to analyze the adiabatic exciton states derived from time-dependent density functional theory calculations, in terms of diabatic states chosen to coincide with local excitations within a restricted orbital space. In parallel, motivated by the need of cost-effective approaches to afford the study of larger aggregates, we propose to build a model Hamiltonian based on calculations carried out on dimers composing the aggregate. Both approaches are applied to study excitation energy profiles and CT character modulation induced by interchromophore rearrangements in perylene bisimide aggregates up to a tetramer. The dimer-based approach closely reproduces the results of full-aggregate calculations, and an analysis in terms of symmetry-adapted diabatic states discloses the effects of CT/FE interactions on the interchange of the H-/J-character for small longitudinal shifts of the chromophores.},

The first-principles description of the spectra requires an efficient and accurate treatment of all many-body effects. This is especially challenging for inner valence excitations where the single QP picture breaks down. Here, we provide the full valence spectra of small closed-shell molecules, exploring the independent and interacting quasiparticle regimes, computed with the fully correlated adaptive sampling configuration interaction method. We critically compare these results to calculations with the many-body perturbation theory, based on the GW and vertex corrected GW Γ approaches. The latter explicitly accounts for two-QP quantum interactions, which have often been neglected. We demonstrate that for molecular systems, the vertex correction universally improves the theoretical spectra, and it is crucial for the accurate prediction of QPs as well as capturing the rich satellite structures of high-energy excitations. GW Γ offers a unified description across all relevant energy scales. Our results suggest that the multi-QP regime corresponds to dynamical correlations, which can be described via perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {Optical nonlinear spectroscopies carry a high amount of information about the systems under investigation; however, as they report polarization signals, the resulting spectra are often congested and difficult to interpret. To recover the landscape of energy states and physical processes such as energy and electron transfer, a clear interpretation of the nonlinear signals is prerequisite. Here, we focus on the interpretation of the electrochromic band-shift signal, which is generated when an internal electric field is established in the system following optical excitation. Whereas the derivative shape of the band-shift signal is well understood in transient absorption spectroscopy, its emergence in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has not been discussed. In this work, we employed 2DES to follow the dynamic band-shift signal in reaction centers of purple bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides at 77 K. The prominent two-dimensional derivative-shape signal appears with the characteristic formation time of the charge separated state. To explain and characterize the band-shift signal, we use expanded double-sided Feynman diagram formalism. We propose to distinguish two types of Feynman diagrams that lead to signals with negative amplitude: excited state absorption and re-excitation. The presented signal decomposition and modeling analysis allows us to recover precise electrochromic shifts of accessory bacteriochlorophylls, identify additional signals in the B band range, and gain a further insight into the electron transfer mechanism. In a broader perspective, expanded Feynman diagram formalism will allow for interpretation of all 2D signals in a clearer and more intuitive way and therefore facilitate studying the underlying photophysics.},

  abstract = {In a two-state molecular system, transition paths comprise the portions of trajectories during which the system transits from one stable state to the other. Because of their low population, it is essentially impossible to obtain information on transition paths from experiments on a large sample of molecules. However, single-molecule experiments such as laser optical tweezers or Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy have allowed transition-path durations to be estimated. Here, we use molecular simulations to test the methodology for obtaining information on transition paths in single-molecule FRET by generating photon trajectories from the distance trajectories obtained in the simulation. Encouragingly, we find that this maximum likelihood analysis yields transition-path times within a factor of 2–4 of the values estimated using a good coordinate for folding, but tends to systematically underestimate them. The underestimation can be attributed partly to the fact that the large changes in the end–end distance occur mostly early in a folding trajectory. However, even if the transfer efficiency is a good reaction coordinate for folding, the assumption that the transition-path shape is a step function still leads to an underestimation of the transition-path time as defined here. We find that allowing more flexibility in the form of the transition path model allows more accurate transition-path times to be extracted and points the way toward further improvements in methods for estimating transition-path time and transition-path shape.},

  abstract = {Translocation of a polymer through a nano-pore is relevant in a variety of contexts such as passage of RNAs through a nuclear pore and transportation of proteins across a membrane. An essential step in polymer translocation is for the end monomers to search the pore. This process requires a characteristic time, referred to as the “attempt time” in this work. Here, we study the attempt time τ of a confined polymer inside a spherical surface by combining a scaling approach and Langevin dynamics simulations. For a moderately to strongly confined polymer, our results suggest that τ ∼ R 3.67 for R &gt; P and τ ∼ R 2.67 for R &lt; P , where R is the radius of the spherical surface and P is the persistence length of the polymer. All simulation data obtained for an intermediate range of the volume fraction of monomers ϕ (≲ 0.2) tend to collapse onto each other. This implies that τ does not explicitly depend on ϕ , in agreement with the theoretical predictions. These results will be useful for interpreting translocation as a two-step process: the initial attempt to find the pore and eventual pore crossing.},

  abstract = {The Gibbs–Thomson (GT) equation describes the shift of the crystallization temperature for a confined fluid with respect to the bulk as a function of pore size. While this century old relation is successfully used to analyze experiments, its derivations found in the literature often rely on nucleation theory arguments (i.e., kinetics instead of thermodynamics) or fail to state their assumptions, therefore leading to similar but different expressions. Here, we revisit the derivation of the GT equation to clarify the system definition, corresponding thermodynamic ensemble, and assumptions made along the way. We also discuss the role of the thermodynamic conditions in the external reservoir on the final result. We then turn to numerical simulations of a model system to compute independently the various terms entering in the GT equation and compare the predictions of the latter with the melting temperatures determined under confinement by means of hyper-parallel tempering grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. We highlight some difficulties related to the sampling of crystallization under confinement in simulations. Overall, despite its limitations, the GT equation may provide an interesting alternative route to predict the melting temperature in large pores using molecular simulations to evaluate the relevant quantities entering in this equation. This approach could, for example, be used to investigate the nanoscale capillary freezing of ionic liquids recently observed experimentally between the tip of an atomic force microscope and a substrate.},

  abstract = {Various emerging carbon capture technologies depend on being able to reliably and consistently grow carbon dioxide hydrate, particularly in packed media. However, there are limited kinetic data for carbon dioxide hydrates at this length scale. In this work, carbon dioxide hydrate propagation rates and conversion were evaluated in a high pressure silicon microfluidic device. The carbon dioxide phase boundary was first measured in the microfluidic device, which showed little deviation from bulk predictions. Additionally, measuring the phase boundary takes on the order of hours compared to weeks or longer for larger scale experimental setups. Next, propagation rates of carbon dioxide hydrate were measured in the channels at low subcoolings (&lt;2 K from phase boundary) and moderate pressures (200–500 psi). Growth was dominated by mass transfer limitations until a critical pressure was reached, and reaction kinetics limited growth upon further increases in pressure. Additionally, hydrate conversion was estimated from Raman spectroscopy in the microfluidics channels. A maximum value of 47\% conversion was reached within 1 h of a constant flow experiment, nearly 4\% of the time required for similar results in a large scale system. The rapid reaction times and high throughput allowed by high pressure microfluidics provide a new way for carbon dioxide gas hydrate to be characterized.},

In contrast to our previous studies, where redox potentials of several cathode materials have been calculated in a good agreement with experiment (e.g., NaMnO 2 , LiFePO 4 , and LiTiS 2 ), herein, we analyze other cathode materials, such as LiNiO 2 and Ni- and V-containing phosphates for which this method provides much underestimated redox voltages. We ascribe this limited predictive power of the DFT+ U method, parameterized via LR, to the absence of corrections of Coulomb interactions between the electrons with opposite spins. Using the recently proposed extended DFT+ U + U ↑↓ functional, which includes the aforementioned corrections, we show how redox potentials of Ni- and V-based compounds could be calculated in a much better agreement with experiment, also proposing a procedure of parameterization of such calculations. Thus, our extended method allows us to calculate redox potentials of several important materials more accurately while retaining good agreement with experiment for structures where the standard DFT+ U method also accurately predicts electrochemical properties.},

The water dissociation fractions in this layer are &gt;20\% and &gt;30\% on the flat and stepped surfaces, respectively. Slightly above the first water layer, we observe metastable OH groups perpendicular to the interface, similar to those reported in low temperature studies of water monolayers on MgO. These species receive hydrogen bonds from four nearby water molecules in the first layer and have their hydrophobic H end directed toward bulk water, while their associated protons are bound to surface oxygens. The formation of these OH species is attributed to the strong basicity of the MgO surface and can be relevant for understanding various phenomena from morphology evolution and growth of (nano)crystalline MgO particles to heterogeneous catalysis.},

  abstract = {Gas adsorption is a standard method for measuring pore-size distributions of nanoporous materials. This method is often based on assuming the pores as separate entities of a certain simple shape: slit-like, cylindrical, or spherical. Here, we study the effect of interconnections on gas adsorption in materials with spherical pores, such as three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOm) carbons. We consider interconnected systems with two, four, and six windows of various sizes. We propose a simple method based on the integration of solid–fluid interactions to take into account these windows. We used Monte Carlo simulations to model argon adsorption at the normal boiling point and obtained adsorption isotherms for the range of systems. For a system with two windows, we obtained a remarkably smooth transition from the spherical to cylindrical isotherm. Depending on the size and number of windows, our system resembles both spherical and cylindrical pores. These windows can drastically shift the point of capillary condensation and result in pore-size distributions that are very different from the ones based on a spherical pore model. Our results can be further used for modeling fluids in a system of interconnected pores using Monte Carlo and density functional theory methods.},

  abstract = {A high battery temperature has been shown to be critical for lithium-ion batteries in terms of performance, degradation, and safety. Therefore, a precise knowledge of heat sources and sinks in the battery is essential. We have developed a thermal model for lithium-ion batteries, a model that includes terms not included before, namely, Peltier and Dufour heat effects. The model is derived using non-equilibrium thermodynamics for heterogeneous systems, the only theory which is able to describe in a systematic manner the coupling of heat, mass, and charge transport. The idea of this theory is to deal with surfaces as two-dimensional layers. All electrochemical processes in these layers are defined using excess variables, implying, for instance, that the surface has its own temperature. We show how the Peltier and Dufour heats affect a single cell and may produce an internal temperature rise of 8.5 K in a battery stack with 80 modules. The heat fluxes leaving the cell are also functions of these reversible heat effects. Most of the energy that is dissipated as heat occurs in the electrode surfaces and the electrolyte-filled separator. The analysis shows that better knowledge of experimental data on surface resistances, transport coefficients, and Dufour and Peltier heats is essential for further progress in thermal modeling of this important class of systems.},

However, interpreting SFG spectra of systems containing several internal interfaces, such as thin film electronics, electrochemical cells, and biofilms, is challenging as different interfaces within these structures can produce interfering SFG signals. One potential way to address this issue is to carefully select experimental conditions that amplify the SFG signal of an interface of interest over all others. In this report, we investigate a model two-interface system to assess our ability to isolate the SFG signal from each interface. For SFG experiments performed in a reflective geometry, we find that there are few experimental conditions under which the SFG signal originating from either interface can be amplified and isolated from the other. However, by performing several measurements under conditions that alter their interference, we find that we can reconstruct each signal even in cases where the SFG signal from one interface is more than an order of magnitude smaller than its counterpart. The number of spectra needed for this reconstruction varies depending on the signal-to-noise level of the SFG dataset and the degree to which different experiments in a dataset vary in their sensitivity to each interface. Taken together, our work provides general guidelines for designing experimental protocols that can isolate SFG signals stemming from a particular region of interest within complex samples.},

The degree of dispersion depends on the affinity between surface-modified nanoparticles and solvents, which can be quantified using the work of adhesion at the interface. Herein, the affinity between a surface-modified inorganic solid and an organic solvent was evaluated by calculating the work of adhesion at the interface. The phantom-wall method, which is a thermodynamic route for evaluating the work of adhesion at an interface using molecular dynamics simulations, was applied to the decanoic acid-modified Al 2 O 3 /hexane interface. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for flat interface systems to focus on the interactions between substances that affect the affinity on the surface. As a result, the surface coverage of decanoic acid was found to affect the work of adhesion, with a maximum value of 45.66 ± 0.75 mJ/m 2 at a surface coverage of 75\%. An analysis of the mass density profiles of Al 2 O 3 , decanoic acid, and hexane in the vicinity of the interface showed that the increase in the work of adhesion with the surface coverage was due to the penetration of hexane molecules into the decanoic acid layer on the Al 2 O 3 surface. At a surface coverage of 75\%, some hexane molecules were trapped in the layer of oriented decanoic acid molecules. These results suggested that the interfacial affinity can be enhanced by controlling the surface modification so that the solvent can penetrate the layer of the modifier.},

The graphene layer was grown through exposure to ethylene using a method that has previously been shown to completely cover the surface. As CO adsorbs on Ru(0001) but not on graphene, the complete coverage of the Ru(0001) surface by graphene was verified with TPD as no CO adsorption was detectable. Previous work has demonstrated that Pt nanoclusters nucleate in the moiré unit cells of the Gr/Ru(0001) surface. Exposure of the Pt/Gr/Ru(0001) surface to CO gives rise to strong RAIRS peaks at 2065–2085 cm −1 assigned to CO at Pt atop sites and at 1848 cm −1 due to CO at Pt bridge sites. The CO TPD peak areas were used to quantify the CO coverage, which allowed for the determination of the RAIRS peak areas per CO molecule. It was found that the RAIRS intensity for CO on Pt/Gr/Ru(0001) is as much as nine times the intensity of CO on Ru(0001) on a per molecule basis.

  abstract = {Dielectric properties of nano-confined water are important in several areas of science, i.e., it is relevant in the dielectric double layer that exists in practically all heterogeneous fluid-based systems. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict the in-plane dielectric properties of confined water in planar channels of width ranging from sub-nanometer to bulk. Because of suppressed rotational degrees of freedom near the confining walls, the dipole of the water molecules tends to be aligned parallel to the walls, which results in a strongly enhanced in-plane dielectric constant ( ε ∥ ) reaching values of about 120 for channels with height 8 Å 70 Å. A stratified continuum model is proposed that reproduces the h &gt; 10 Å dependence of ε ∥ . For sub-nanometer height channels, abnormal behavior of ε ∥ is found with two orders of magnitude reduction of ε ∥ around h ∼ 7.5 Å, which is attributed to the formation of a particular ice phase that exhibits long-time (∼ μ s) stable ferroelectricity. This is of particular importance for the understanding of the influence of confined water on the functioning of biological systems.},

  abstract = {Ice III is a hydrogen-disordered phase of ice that is stable between about 0.2 and 0.35 GPa. Upon cooling, it transforms to its hydrogen-ordered counterpart ice IX within the stability region of ice II. Here, the effect of ammonium fluoride doping on this phase transition is investigated, which is followed for the first time with in situ neutron diffraction. The a and c lattice constants are found to expand and contract, respectively, upon hydrogen ordering, yielding an overall negative volume change. Interestingly, the anisotropy in the lattice constants persists when ice IX is fully formed, and negative thermal expansion is observed. Analogous to the isostructural keatite and β -spodumenes, the negative thermal expansion can be explained through the buildup of torsional strain within the a – b plane as the helical “springs” within the structure expand upon heating. The reversibility of the phase transition was demonstrated upon heating. As seen in diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, the ammonium fluoride doping induces additional residual hydrogen disorder in ice IX and is suggested to be a chemical way for the “excitation” of the configurational ice-rules manifold. Compared to ice VIII, the dopant-induced hydrogen disorder in ice IX is smaller, which suggests a higher density of accessible configurational states close to the ground state in ice IX. This study highlights the importance of dopants for exploring the water’s phase diagram and underpins the highly complex solid-state chemistry of ice.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal oscillations can be induced under batch conditions with ubiquitous bimolecular reactions in the absence of any nonlinear chemical feedback, thanks to an active interplay between the chemical process and chemically driven hydrodynamic flows. When two reactants A and B, initially separated in space, react upon diffusive contact, they can power convective flows by inducing a localized variation of surface tension and density at the mixing interface. These flows feedback with the reaction-diffusion dynamics, bearing damped or sustained spatio-temporal oscillations of the concentrations and flow field. By means of numerical simulations, we detail the mechanism underlying these chemohydrodynamic oscillations and classify the main dynamical scenarios in the relevant space drawn by parameters Δ M and Δ R , which rule the surface tension- and buoyancy-driven contributions to convection, respectively. The reactor height is found to play a critical role in the control of the dynamics. The analysis reveals the intimate nature of these oscillatory phenomena and the hierarchy among the different phenomena at play: oscillations are essentially hydrodynamic and the chemical process features the localized trigger for Marangoni flows unstable toward oscillatory instabilities. The characteristic size of Marangoni convective rolls mainly determines the critical conditions and properties of the oscillations, which can be further tuned or suppressed by the buoyancy competition. We finally discuss the possible experimental implementation of such a class of chemo-hydrodynamic oscillator and its implications in fundamental and applied terms.},

We study the static electric dipole polarizabilities and the vertical ionization potentials of polyacenes from benzene to pentacene using the Fermi–Löwdin orbital-based self-interaction corrected (FLOSIC) density functional method. The orbital by orbital self-interaction correction corrects for the overestimation tendency of DFAs. The polarizabilities calculated with FLOSIC-DFA are, however, overly corrected. We also tested the recently developed locally scaled self-interaction correction (LSIC) method on polyacenes. The local-scaling method applies full SIC in the one-electron regions and restores the proper behavior of the SIC exchange–correlation functionals in the uniform density limit. The results show that LSIC removes the overcorrection tendency of the FLOSIC-DFA and produces results that are in excellent agreement with reference coupled-cluster single and double values. The vertical ionization potentials with LSIC also show good agreement with available experimental values.},

The frequencies have been determined with an uncertainty of less than 1 MHz, representing a more than 1000-fold improvement over previous measurements. Spectral traces are measured by scanning a frequency comb stabilized continuous-wave spectroscopy laser over the molecular transitions and detecting laser-induced fluorescence from SH molecules in a highly collimated molecular beam. To determine the absolute transition frequencies, the traces are fit with a quantum-mechanical model that accounts for saturation effects and shifts due to quantum interference. The model also provides estimates of the predissociation rate of the excited-state levels. Weighted averages of the hyperfine-resolved transition frequencies are computed in order to enable comparisons to measurements where the hyperfine structure is not resolved. These hyperfine-averaged frequencies indicate that the absolute transition frequencies determined in previous measurements were about ∼2.1 GHz (0.07 cm −1 ) too high. Finally, the measured transition frequencies are fit using an effective Hamiltonian model, resulting in more precise estimates of the spectroscopic constants.},

  abstract = {It is still challenging to accurately qualify the rate coefficients for vibrationally excited molecules in experiment. In particular, for the energy transfer between HF ( v = 7) and D 2 ( v = 0), which is a prototype for near resonant collisional transfer of vibrational excitation from one molecule to the other, the two available experimental results of rate coefficients contradict each other by a factor of nearly 20. In order to benchmark these data, in this work, the rate coefficients of vibration–vibration energy transfer processes of this system at temperatures ranging from 100 to 1500 K were calculated by employing the coupled-states approximation based on our recently developed full-dimensional ab initio intermolecular potential energy surface. The state-to-state rate coefficients were found to follow the general energy gap law. The calculated total vibration–vibration energy transfer rate coefficients decrease with the increase in the angular momentum of HF at most temperatures. The vibrational relaxation rate coefficient decreases monotonously with the temperature, and the calculated result of 8.1 × 10 −11 cm 3 mol −1 s −1 at room temperature is in very good agreement with the experimental value reported by Dzelzkalns and Kaufman [J.

Oxygen 1s ionization leads to the CO + + NH + ion pairs, while nitrogen 1s ionization results in three-body dissociation and an efficient fragmentation of the H–N bond in the dication. Upon 1s → 10a′ resonant excitation, clear differences between O and N sites are discernible as well. In both cases, the correlation between the dissociation channel and the binding energy of the normal Auger electrons indicates that the fragmentation pattern is governed by the excess energy available in the final ionic state. High-level multireference calculations suggest pathways to the formation of the fragment ions NO + and HCO + , which are observed although the parent compound contains neither N–O nor H–C bonds. This work contributes to the goal to achieve and understand site-selective fragmentation upon ionization and excitation of molecules with soft x-ray radiation.},

  abstract = {We investigate the role of intramolecular normal mode vibrations in the excitation energy transfer (EET) dynamics of perylene bisimide J-aggregates composed of 2 or 25 units using numerically exact methods. The calculations employ a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian where the ground and excited electronic states of each molecular unit are coupled to 28 intramolecular normal mode vibrations at various temperatures. The electronic populations exhibit strong damping effects, a lengthening of the EET time scale, and complex dynamical patterns, which depend on aggregate length, temperature, as well as electronic and vibrational initial conditions and which are not additive. The early evolution is dominated by high-frequency vibrational modes, but all modes are responsible for the observed dynamics after the initial 25 fs. Overall, we observe significant changes in the electronic populations upon varying the temperature between 0 and 600 K. With a Franck–Condon (FC) initial excitation, a strongly coupled vibrational mode introduces new peaks to the dimer populations, which show very weak temperature sensitivity. The first of these peaks is also seen in the long aggregate, but subsequent recurrences appear strongly quenched and merged. These structures are drastically altered if a non-FC initial condition is assumed. Additional insights are obtained from the diagonal elements of the dimer electronic-vibrational reduced density matrix. We find that the vibronic peaks result from depletion of the crossing region during the early coherent evolution of the vibrational density away from the crossing point, which allows the premature back-transfer of excitation to the initially excited unit.},

  abstract = {Encoding the complex features of an energy landscape is a challenging task, and often, chemists pursue the most salient features (minima and barriers) along a highly reduced space, i.e., two- or three-dimensions. Even though disconnectivity graphs or merge trees summarize the connectivity of the local minima of an energy landscape via the lowest-barrier pathways, there is much information to be gained by also considering the topology of each connected component at different energy thresholds (or sublevelsets). We propose sublevelset persistent homology as an appropriate tool for this purpose. Our computations on the configuration phase space of n -alkanes from butane to octane allow us to conjecture, and then prove, a complete characterization of the sublevelset persistent homology of the alkane C m H 2 m +2 Potential Energy Landscapes (PELs), for all m , in all homological dimensions. We further compare both the analytical configurational PELs and sampled data from molecular dynamics simulation using the united and all-atom descriptions of the intramolecular interactions. In turn, this supports the application of distance metrics to quantify sampling fidelity and lays the foundation for future work regarding new metrics that quantify differences between the topological features of high-dimensional energy landscapes.},

In particular, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides a probe of coherence and the flow of energy within quantum systems, which is not possible with more conventional techniques. While heterodyne-detected (HD) 2DES is increasingly common, more recently fluorescence-detected (FD) 2DES offers new opportunities, including single-molecule experiments. However, in both techniques, it can be difficult to unambiguously identify the pathways that dominate the signal. Therefore, the use of numerically modeling of 2DES is vitally important, which, in turn, requires approximating the pulsing scheme to some degree. Here, we employ non-perturbative time evolution to investigate the effects of finite pulse width and amplitude on 2DES signals. In doing so, we identify key differences in the response of HD and FD detection schemes, as well as the regions of parameter space where the signal is obscured by unwanted artifacts in either technique. Mapping out parameter space in this way provides a guide to choosing experimental conditions and also shows in which limits the usual theoretical approximations work well and in which limits more sophisticated approaches are required.},

We have applied the RED scheme to weighted ensemble simulations of a variety of rare-event processes that range in complexity: residue-level simulations of protein conformational switching, atomistic simulations of Na + /Cl − association in explicit solvent, and atomistic simulations of protein–protein association in explicit solvent. Rate constants were estimated with up to 50\% greater efficiency than the original weighted ensemble scheme. Importantly, our scheme accounts for the systematic error that results from statistical bias toward the observation of events with short durations and reweights the event duration distribution accordingly. The RED scheme is relevant to any simulation strategy that involves unbiased trajectories of similar length to the most probable event duration, including weighted ensemble, milestoning, and standard simulations as well as the construction of Markov state models.},

  abstract = {Physically motivated and mathematically robust atom-centered representations of molecular structures are key to the success of modern atomistic machine learning. They lie at the foundation of a wide range of methods to predict the properties of both materials and molecules and to explore and visualize their chemical structures and compositions. Recently, it has become clear that many of the most effective representations share a fundamental formal connection. They can all be expressed as a discretization of n -body correlation functions of the local atom density, suggesting the opportunity of standardizing and, more importantly, optimizing their evaluation. We present an implementation, named librascal, whose modular design lends itself both to developing refinements to the density-based formalism and to rapid prototyping for new developments of rotationally equivariant atomistic representations. As an example, we discuss smooth overlap of atomic position (SOAP) features, perhaps the most widely used member of this family of representations, to show how the expansion of the local density can be optimized for any choice of radial basis sets. We discuss the representation in the context of a kernel ridge regression model, commonly used with SOAP features, and analyze how the computational effort scales for each of the individual steps of the calculation. By applying data reduction techniques in feature space, we show how to reduce the total computational cost by a factor of up to 4 without affecting the model’s symmetry properties and without significantly impacting its accuracy.},

  abstract = {Confined nanoscale spaces, electric fields, and tunneling currents make the molecular electronic junction an experimental device for the discovery of new out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions. Reaction-rate theory for current-activated chemical reactions is developed by combining the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green’s function treatment of electrons, Fokker–Planck description of the reaction coordinate, and Kramers first-passage time calculations. The nonequilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF) provide an adiabatic potential as well as a diffusion coefficient and temperature with local dependence on the reaction coordinate. Van Kampen’s Fokker–Planck equation, which describes a Brownian particle moving in an external potential in an inhomogeneous medium with a position-dependent friction and diffusion coefficient, is used to obtain an analytic expression for the first-passage time. The theory is applied to several transport scenarios: a molecular junction with a single reaction coordinate dependent molecular orbital and a model diatomic molecular junction. We demonstrate the natural emergence of Landauer’s blowtorch effect as a result of the interplay between the configuration dependent viscosity and diffusion coefficients. The resultant localized heating in conjunction with the bond-deformation due to current-induced forces is shown to be the determining factors when considering chemical reaction rates, each of which results from highly tunable parameters within the system.},

  abstract = {We introduce a collocation-based multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method that uses more collocation points than basis functions. We call it the rectangular collocation MCTDH (RC-MCTDH) method. It does not require that the potential be a sum of products. RC-MCTDH has the important advantage that it makes it simple to use time-independent collocation points. When using time-independent points, it is necessary to evaluate the potential energy function only once and not repeatedly during an MCTDH calculation. It is inexpensive and straightforward to use RC-MCTDH with combined modes. Using more collocation points than basis functions enables one to reduce errors in energy levels without increasing the size of the single-particle function basis. On the contrary, whenever a discrete variable representation is used, the only way to reduce the quadrature error is to increase the basis size, which then also reduces the basis-set error. We demonstrate that with RC-MCTDH and time-independent points, it is possible to calculate accurate eigenenergies of CH 3 and CH 4 .},

This sets a limit on the single- and double-ionization energies of the system(s) that can further undergo sequential absorption of two photons, leading to a dication (PAH +2 ). Here, we report the single-ionization (I +1 ) and double-ionization (I +2 ) energies and the I +2 /I +1 ratio for some selected PAHs and conjugated polyenes obtained using the Fock space coupled cluster technique, enabling simultaneous consideration of several electronic states of different characters. The I +2 to I +1 ratio bears a constant ratio, giving allowance to determine I +2 from the knowledge of single-ionization (I +1 ) and vice versa. Our observations are in good agreement with the established literature findings, confirming the reliability of our estimates. The measured single- and double-ionization energies further demonstrate that the sequential formation and fragmentation of a PAH dication in the H I regions of the ISM for systems such as benzene and conjugated polyenes such as ethylene and butadiene are quite unlikely because I +2 –I +1 for such system(s) is higher than the available photon energy in the H I regions of the ISM. Present findings may be useful to understand the formation and underlying decay mechanisms of multiply charged ions from PAHs and related compounds that may accentuate the exploration of the phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity.},

  abstract = {In the near future, material and drug design may be aided by quantum computer assisted simulations. These have the potential to target chemical systems intractable by the most powerful classical computers. However, the resources offered by contemporary quantum computers are still limited, restricting the simulations to very simple molecules. In order to rapidly scale up to more interesting molecular systems, we propose the embedding of the quantum electronic structure calculation into a classically computed environment obtained at the Hartree–Fock (HF) or density functional theory (DFT) level of theory. This result is achieved by constructing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates a mean field potential describing the action of the inactive electrons on a selected Active Space (AS). The ground state of the AS Hamiltonian is then determined by means of the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. We show that with the proposed HF and DFT embedding schemes, we can obtain significant energy corrections to the reference HF and DFT calculations for a number of simple molecules in their strongly correlated limit (the dissociation regime) as well as for systems of the size of the oxirane molecule.},

To alleviate this problem, we present here an ECD implementation within the projector augmented-wave method in a real-time-propagation TDDFT framework in the open-source GPAW code. Our implementation supports both local atomic basis sets and real-space finite-difference representations of wave functions. We benchmark our implementation against an existing LR-TDDFT implementation in GPAW for small chiral molecules. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our local atomic basis set implementation for a large hybrid nanocluster and discuss the chiroptical properties of the cluster.},

In this paper, we propose a different approach to this problem that has the potential to consistently achieve orders of magnitude higher time resolutions than what is possible with laser technology or electron beam compression methods. Our proposed approach relies on accelerating the sample to a high speed to achieve relativistic time dilation. Probing the time-dilated sample would open up previously inaccessible time resolution domains.},

Exact treatment of non-adiabatic vibronic coupling is necessary to fully capture its role in driving energy transfer. However, the exact treatment of vibrations in extended systems is expensive, sometimes requiring oversimplifying approximations to reduce vibrational dimensionality, and do not provide physical insights into which specific vibrational motions promote energy transfer. In this communication, we derive effective normal modes for understanding vibronically enhanced energy transfer in excitonically coupled aggregates. We show that the dynamics of the overall high-dimensional vibronic Hamiltonian can be better understood through one-dimensional Hamiltonians separable along these effective modes. We demonstrate this approach on a trimer toy model to analyze the role of an intermediate “trap” site in mediating energy transfer between electronically uncoupled sites. Bringing uncoupled sites into vibronic resonance converts the “trap” into a “shuttle” for energy transfer. By deconvolving the dynamics along the aggregate normal modes, our approach identifies the specific vibrational motions, which maximally promote energy transfer, against spectator modes, which do not participate in vibronic mixing.},

Pulse spacings are optimized based on a derived ruleset. The remaining effects of pulse inaccuracy are examined and found to be consistent across pure liquids of different diffusivities: water, decane, and octanol-1. A pulse accuracy correction is developed. Instantaneous diffusivity, D inst ( t ), curves (i.e., half of the time derivative of the mean-squared displacement in the gradient direction) are recovered from pulse accuracy-corrected SG-TIETA decays using a model-free log-linear least squares inversion method validated by Monte Carlo simulations. A signal-averaged 1-min experiment is described. A flat D inst ( t ) is measured on pure dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, whereas decreasing D inst ( t ) is measured on yeast suspensions, consistent with the expected short-time D inst ( t ) behavior for confining microstructural barriers on the order of micrometers.},

  abstract = {In the one-dimensional description, the interaction of a solute molecule with the channel wall is characterized by the potential of mean force U ( x ), where the x -coordinate is measured along the channel axis. When the molecule can reversibly bind to certain amino acid(s) of the protein forming the channel, this results in a localized well in the potential U ( x ). Alternatively, this binding can be modeled by introducing a discrete localized site, in addition to the continuum of states along x . Although both models may predict identical equilibrium distributions of the coordinate x , there is a fundamental difference between the two: in the first model, the molecule passing through the channel unavoidably visits the potential well, while in the latter, it may traverse the channel without being trapped at the discrete site. Here, we show that when the two models are parameterized to have the same thermodynamic properties, they automatically yield identical translocation probabilities and mean translocation times, yet they predict qualitatively different shapes of the translocation time distribution. Specifically, the potential well model yields a narrower distribution than the model with a discrete site, a difference that can be quantified by the distribution’s coefficient of variation. This coefficient turns out to be always smaller than unity in the potential well model, whereas it may exceed unity when a discrete trapping site is present. Analysis of the translocation time distribution beyond its mean thus offers a way to differentiate between distinct translocation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We examine the many open questions that arise for nonadiabatic dynamics in the presence of degenerate electronic states, e.g., for singlet-to-triplet intersystem crossing where a minimal Hamiltonian must include four states (two of which are always degenerate). In such circumstances, the standard surface hopping approach is not sufficient as the algorithm does not include Berry force. Yet, we hypothesize that such a Berry force may be crucial as far as creating chiral induced spin separation, which is now a burgeoning field of study. Thus, this Perspective highlights the fact that if one can generate a robust and accurate semiclassical approach for the case of degenerate states, one will take a big step forward toward merging chemical physics with spintronics.},

  abstract = {We report ionic current and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) translocation measurements through solid-state membranes with two TEM-drilled ∼3-nm diameter silicon nitride nanopores in parallel. Nanopores are fabricated with similar diameters but varying in effective thicknesses (from 2.6 to 10 nm) ranging from a thickness ratio of 1:1 to 1:3.75, producing distinct conductance levels. This was made possible by locally thinning the silicon nitride membrane to shape the desired topography with nanoscale precision using electron beam lithography (EBL). Two nanopores are engineered and subsequently drilled in either the EBL-thinned or the surrounding membrane region. By designing the interpore separation a few orders of magnitude larger than the pore diameter (e.g., ∼900 vs 3 nm), we show analytically, numerically, and experimentally that the total conductance of the two pores is the sum of the individual pore conductances. For a two-pore device with similar diameters yet thicknesses in the ratio of 1:3, a ratio of ∼1:2.2 in open-pore conductances and translocation current signals is expected, as if they were measured independently. Introducing dsDNA as analytes to both pores simultaneously, we detect more than 12 000 events within 2 min and trace them back with a high likelihood to which pore the dsDNA translocated through. Moreover, we monitor translocations through one active pore only when the other pore is clogged. This work demonstrates how two-pore devices can fundamentally open up a parallel translocation reading system for solid-state nanopores. This approach could be creatively generalized to more pores with desired parameters given a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {The protein folding process often proceeds through partially folded transient states. Therefore, a structural understanding of these disordered states is crucial for developing mechanistic models of the folding process. Characterization of unfolded states remains challenging due to their disordered nature, and incorporating multiple methods is necessary. Combining the time-resolved x-ray solution scattering (TRXSS) signal with molecular dynamics (MD), we are able to characterize transient partially folded states of bovine α -lactalbumin, a model system widely used for investigation of molten globule states, during its unfolding triggered by a temperature jump. We track the unfolding process between 20 µ s and 70 ms and demonstrate that it passes through three distinct kinetic states. The scattering signals associated with these transient species are then analyzed with TRXSS constrained MD simulations to produce protein structures that are compatible with the input signals. Without utilizing any experimentally extracted kinetic information, the constrained MD simulation successfully drove the protein to an intermediate molten globule state; signals for two later disordered states are refined to terminal unfolded states. From our examination of the structural characteristics of these disordered states, we discuss the implications disordered states have on the folding process, especially on the folding pathway. Finally, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of this method.},

  abstract = {When a polymer solution undergoes viscoelastic phase separation, the polymer-rich phase forms a network-like structure even if it is a minor phase. This unique feature is induced by polymer dynamics, which are constrained by the temporal entanglement of polymer chains. The fundamental mechanisms of viscoelastic phase separation have already been elucidated by theory and experiments over the past few decades; however, it is not yet well understood how viscoelastic phase separation occurs in multicomponent polymer solutions. Here, we construct a new viscoelastic phase separation model for ternary polymer solutions that consist of a polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent. Our simulation results reveal that a network-like structure is formed in the ternary bulk system through a phase separation mechanism similar to that observed in binary polymer solutions. A difference in dynamics is also found in that the solvent, whose affinity to the polymer is similar to that of the nonsolvent, moves freely between the polymer-rich and water-rich phases during phase separation. These findings are considered important for understanding the phase separation mechanism of ternary mixtures often used in the manufacture of polymeric separation membranes.},

Here, we investigate by molecular dynamic simulation the PEG conformation inside a nanopore in the case of hydrophobic and hydrophilic nanopores. Our results reveal that the nanopore inner surface plays a role in the PEG organization and, thus, in the speed of the salt constituent.

A recent time-resolved vibrational sum frequency generation (TR-VSFG) spectroscopy experiment revealed that the relaxation time scales of free OH at the surface of pure water and isotopically diluted water are very similar to each other. In the present study, the dynamics of free OH excited at the surface of pure water and deuterated water are examined with an NE-AIMD simulation, which reproduces the experimentally observed features. The relaxation paths are examined by introducing constraints for the bonds and angles of water molecules relevant to specific vibrational modes in NE-AIMD simulations. In the case of free OH relaxation at the pure water surface, stretching vibrational coupling with the conjugate bond makes a significant contribution to the relaxation path. In the case of the isotopically diluted water surface, the bend (HOD)-stretching (OD) combination band couples with the free OH vibration, generating a relaxation rate similar to that in the pure water case. It is also found that the reorientation of the free OH bond contributes substantially to the relaxation of the free OH vibrational frequency component measured by TR-VSFG spectroscopy.},

A series of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals are examined toward accurate estimation of the bandgap. Furthermore, while 13 orbitals are active in constructing the valence and conduction band spectra, here, we establish that a 4 orbital based minimal basis set is sufficient to build the Slater–Koster tight-binding (SK-TB) model, which is capable of reproducing the bulk and surface electronic structures in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Therefore, like the Wannier based TB model, the presented SK-TB model can also be considered an efficient tool to examine the bulk and surface electronic structures of the halide family of compounds. As estimated by comparing the model study and DFT band structure, the dominant electron coupling strengths are found to be nearly independent of XC functionals, which further establishes the utility of the SK-TB model.},

  abstract = {Several oil–water separation techniques have been proposed to improve the capacity of cleaning water. With the technological possibility of producing materials with antagonist wetting behavior, for example, a substrate that repels water and absorbs oil, the understanding of the properties that control this selective capacity has increased with the goal of being used as the mechanism to separate mixed liquids. Besides the experimental advance in this field, less is known from the theoretical side. In this work, we propose a theoretical model to predict the wetting properties of a given substrate and introduce simulations with a four-spin cellular Potts model to study its efficiency in separating water from oil. Our results show that the efficiency of the substrates depends both on the interaction between the liquids and on the wetting behavior of the substrates itself. The water behavior of the droplet composed of both liquids is roughly controlled by the hydrophobicity of the substrate. Predicting the oil behavior, however, is more complex because the substrate being oleophilic does not guarantee that the total amount of oil present on the droplet will be absorbed by the substrate. For both types of substrates considered in this work, pillared and porous with a reservoir, there is always an amount of reminiscent oil on the droplet, which is not absorbed by the substrate due to the interaction with the water and the gas. Both theoretical and numerical models can be easily modified to analyze other types of substrates and liquids.},

The local solvation environment has little effect on the subsequent TFEO reaction, which typically requires 6 |e| to decompose into F − , HCOO − , CH 2 CF − , and − OCH 2 CF 3 . Besides, the TFEO dehydrogenation reaction mechanism under an attack of anions is also identified. Unlike salt and diluent, DME shows good stability with any excess of electrons. The energetics of most relevant reactions are characterized. Most reactions are thermodynamically favorable with low activation barriers.},

A clear difference in the adsorption mode was identified between the two surfaces, highlighted by the prevalence of RAIRS peaks for the C=C bond on Cu vs for C=O on Pt. Adsorption was also determined to be much weaker on Cu vs Pt, with an adsorption energy on the former ranging from −50 kJ/mol to −65 kJ/mol depending on the surface coverage. The experimental data were complemented by extensive quantum mechanics calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to determine the most stable adsorption configurations on both metals. It was established that crotonaldehyde adsorption on Cu occurs via the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group, in a mono-coordinated fashion, whereas on Pt multi-coordination is preferred, centered around the C=C bond. The contrasting surface adsorption modes seen on these two metals are discussed in terms of the possible relevance to selectivity in single-atom alloy hydrogenation catalysis.},

  abstract = {We study packings of hard spheres on lattices. The partition function, and therefore the pressure, may be written solely in terms of the accessible free volume, i.e., the volume of space that a sphere can explore without touching another sphere. We compute these free volumes using a leaky cell model, in which the accessible space accounts for the possibility that spheres may escape from the local cage of lattice neighbors. We describe how elementary geometry may be used to calculate the free volume exactly for this leaky cell model in two- and three-dimensional lattice packings and compare the results to the well-known Carnahan–Starling and Percus–Yevick liquid models. We provide formulas for the free volumes of various lattices and use the common tangent construction to identify several phase transitions between them in the leaky cell regime, indicating the possibility of coexistence in crystalline materials.},

  abstract = {Water in nano-scale confining environments is a key element in many biological, material, and geological systems. The structure and dynamics of the liquid can be dramatically modified under these conditions. Probing these changes can be challenging, but vibrational spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating their behavior. A critical, evolving component of this approach is a detailed understanding of the connection between spectroscopic features and molecular-level details. In this paper, this issue is addressed by using molecular dynamics simulations to simulate the linear infrared (IR) and Raman spectra for isotopically dilute HOD in D 2 O confined in hydroxylated amorphous silica slit pores. The effect of slit-pore width and hydroxyl density on the silica surface on the vibrational spectra is also investigated. The primary effect of confinement is a blueshift in the frequency of OH groups donating a hydrogen bond to the silica surface. This appears as a slight shift in the total (measurable) spectra but is clearly seen in the distance-based IR and Raman spectra. Analysis indicates that these changes upon confinement are associated with the weaker hydrogen-bond accepting properties of silica oxygens compared to water molecules.},

  abstract = {The enhancement of surface diffusion ( D S ) over the bulk ( D V ) in metallic glasses (MGs) is well documented and likely to strongly influence the properties of glasses grown by vapor deposition. Here, we use classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify different factors influencing the enhancement of surface diffusion in MGs. MGs have a simple atomic structure and belong to the category of moderately fragile glasses that undergo pronounced slowdown of bulk dynamics with cooling close to the glass transition temperature ( T g ). We observe that D S exhibits a much more moderate slowdown compared to D V when approaching T g , and D S / D V at T g varies by two orders of magnitude among the MGs investigated. We demonstrate that both the surface energy and the fraction of missing bonds for surface atoms show good correlation to D S / D V , implying that the loss of nearest neighbors at the surface directly translates into higher mobility, unlike the behavior of network-bonded and hydrogen-bonded organic glasses. Fragility, a measure of the slowdown of bulk dynamics close to T g , also correlates to D S / D V , with more fragile systems having larger surface enhancement of mobility. The deviations observed in the fragility– D S / D V relationship are shown to be correlated to the extent of segregation or depletion of the mobile element at the surface. Finally, we explore the relationship between the diffusion pre-exponential factor ( D 0 ) and the activation energy ( Q ) and compare it to a ln( D 0 )– Q correlation previously established for bulk glasses, demonstrating similar correlations from MD as in the experiments and that the surface and bulk have very similar ln( D 0 )– Q correlations.},

High-pressure and high-temperature water is of interest for Earth’s mantle and exoplanetary investigations. It is in this region of the phase diagram of water that new plastic crystal phases of water have been revealed via computer simulations by both classical forcefields and ab initio calculations. However, these plastic phases still remain elusive in experiments. Here, we present a complete characterization of the structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics of the computational plastic crystal phases of water using molecular dynamics and the two-phase thermodynamic method and uncover the interplay between them. The relaxation times of different reorientational correlation functions are obtained for the hypothetical body-centered-cubic and face-centered-cubic plastic crystal phases of water at T = 440 K and P = 8 GPa. Results are compared to a high pressure liquid and ice VII phases to improve the understanding of the plastic crystal phases.

  abstract = {Recent experiments and theory suggest that ground state properties and reactivity of molecules can be modified when placed inside a nanoscale cavity, giving rise to strong coupling between vibrational modes and the quantized cavity field. This is commonly thought to be caused either by a cavity-distorted Born–Oppenheimer ground state potential or by the formation of light–matter hybrid states, vibrational polaritons. Here, we systematically study the effect of a cavity on ground state properties and infrared spectra of single molecules, considering vibration-cavity coupling strengths from zero up to the vibrational ultrastrong coupling regime. Using single-mode models for Li–H and O–H stretch modes and for the NH 3 inversion mode, respectively, a single cavity mode in resonance with vibrational transitions is coupled to position-dependent molecular dipole functions. We address the influence of the cavity mode on polariton ground state energies, equilibrium bond lengths, dissociation energies, activation energies for isomerization, and on vibro-polaritonic infrared spectra. In agreement with earlier work, we observe all mentioned properties being strongly affected by the cavity, but only if the dipole self-energy contribution in the interaction Hamiltonian is neglected. When this term is included, these properties do not depend significantly on the coupling anymore. Vibro-polaritonic infrared spectra, in contrast, are always affected by the cavity mode due to the formation of excited vibrational polaritons. It is argued that the quantized nature of vibrational polaritons is key to not only interpreting molecular spectra in cavities but also understanding the experimentally observed modification of molecular reactivity in cavities.},

Three possible structures of this complex were found at the coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)/L3a_3] level of theory. The comparison between the experiment and theory reveals that the most stable structure with the binding energy of 6.48 kcal/mol is formed upon x-ray irradiation of isolated CH 2 F 2 molecules in noble gas matrices (Ne, Ar, Xe). This species appears to be the first known intermolecular complex of monofluorocarbene, and its identification was unambiguously proved by IR absorptions corresponding to HF deformation (libration), CF stretching, H–C–F bending, and CH and HF stretching modes. It is worth noting that the corresponding spectral features in an argon matrix were previously tentatively ascribed to CH 2 F 2 +· and HF⋯CHF −· [L. Andrews and F. T. Prochaska, J. Chem.

The observed CHF⋯HF complex can be converted to the parent CH 2 F 2 under the action of light with λ &lt; 525 nm. The plausible mechanism of this conversion using the conical intersection concept is discussed.},

In this reaction, hydroxyl groups of active sites are replaced by fluorine anions. Alumina structures were represented by three aluminum aqua hydroxo clusters (labeled AlOOH), in which the Al atom had different coordination spheres, particularly four, five, or six. The F-bearing molecules HF, CH 3 F, and CF 4 were taken as reactants for the fluorination reactions. The overall reaction was represented by four reaction steps as follows: (i) formation of the reaction complex, (ii) activation of the transition state (TS), (iii) deactivation of the TS with a formation of the product complex, and (iv) its decomplexation to individual products. The active reaction center of the TS structure is four-membered, in which two bonds break heterolytically and two form. The lowest reaction barriers were observed for the HF molecule, while the two other molecules had significantly higher reaction barriers. Similarly, the largest overall reaction energies (in absolute value) were found for HF, especially for the five- and six-coordinated Al centers. While the positive charge on the Al center remained almost constant throughout the reaction steps, large charge changes were observed for carbon bearing molecules with a formation of the carbenium cations in the TS step. Realizing the important role of HF in promoting exothermic reactions will enable new molecular design strategies for transforming energy release properties of aluminum powder fuels.},

  abstract = {Oxygen in its elemental form shows a variety of magnetic properties in its condensed phases; in particular, the epsilon solid phase loses its magnetism. These phenomena reflect the nature of the intermolecular forces present in the solid and the changes that arise with variations in pressure and temperature. In this study, we use intermolecular potentials obtained with unrestricted ab initio methods to model the singlet state of the oxygen tetramer [(O 2 ) 4 ], which is the unit cell, consistent with the non-magnetic character of this phase. To do this, we perform an analysis of the coupled–uncoupled representations of the spin operator together with a pairwise approximation and the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We start from unrestricted potentials for the dimer calculated at a high level as well as different density functional theory (DFT) functionals and then apply a finite model to predict the properties of the epsilon phase. The results obtained in this way reproduce well the experimental data in the entire pressure range below 60 GPa. Additionally, we show the importance of calculating the singlet state of the tetramer as opposed to previous DFT periodic calculations, where the unrestricted description leads to a mixture of spin states and a poor comparison with the experiment. This point is crucial in the recent discussion about the coexistence of two epsilon phases: one where the identity of each O 2 with spin S = 1 is retained within the tetramer unit vs another at higher pressures where the tetramer behaves as a single unit with a closed-shell character.},

The two-step binary collision approach is employed to model recombination reactions. Two available cross section databases by Andrienko/Boyd and Esposito/Capitelli are employed for the rovibrationally resolved model (rv-STS) and vibrationally resolved model (v-STS), respectively. The difference between rv-STS and v-STS comes from two contributions: the multisurface factor of dissociation ( f MS ) and the rotational averaging process. The dissociation cross section with the constant f MS is typically larger than with the variable f MS , especially for the low vibrational energy states. On the other hand, the cross sections resulting from the rotationally averaged database are found to underpredict the dissociation rate coefficient at low temperatures. In the rovibrational heating case, the rv-STS predicts faster relaxation than the v-STS, which also shows a lower quasi-steady-state temperature than v-STS. In the rovibrational cooling case, the rv-STS shows a faster relaxation than v-STS, which also presents a thermal non-equilibrium between rovibrational and translational mode during the cooling process.},

  abstract = {Vibrational strong coupling of molecules to optical cavities based on plasmonic resonances has been explored recently because plasmonic near-fields can provide strong coupling in sub-diffraction limited volumes. Such field localization maximizes coupling strength, which is crucial for modifying the vibrational response of molecules and, thereby, manipulating chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate an angle-independent plasmonic nanodisk substrate that overcomes limitations of traditional Fabry–Pérot optical cavities because the design can strongly couple with all molecules on the surface of the substrate regardless of molecular orientation. We demonstrate that the plasmonic substrate provides strong coupling with the C=O vibrational stretch of deposited films of PMMA. We also show that the large linewidths of the plasmon resonance allow for simultaneous strong coupling to two, orthogonal water symmetric and asymmetric vibrational modes in a thin film of copper sulfate monohydrate deposited on the substrate surface. A three-coupled-oscillator model is developed to analyze the coupling strength of the plasmon resonance with these two water modes. With precise control over the nanodisk diameter, the plasmon resonance is tuned systematically through the modes, with the Rabi splitting from both modes varying as a function of the plasmon frequency and with strong coupling to both modes achieved simultaneously for a range of diameters. This work may aid further studies into manipulation of the ground-state chemical landscape of molecules by perturbing multiple vibrational modes simultaneously and increasing the coupling strength in sub-diffraction limited volumes.},

We show the coexistence of distinct dynamical regimes for the HCl rotational transition driven by the short-range repulsive and long-range attractive forces whose relative importance depends on the collision energy and final rotational state, suggesting that the classification of rainbow scattering into rotational and l -type rainbows is effective for H 2 + HCl collisions.

  abstract = {Using ab initio electronic structure methods with flexible atomic orbital basis sets, we investigated the electronic structure and stability of reduction products of selected representative cations (C + ) constituting ionic liquids. We found that an electron attachment to such cations leads to the neutral radicals, whereas a subsequent attachment of another (i.e., excess) electron leads to adiabatically stable anions only in two cases {[P(CH 3 ) 4 ] − and [MeMePyr] − }. The possibility of the formation of various dimers (such as CC + , CC, and CC − ) was also considered, and the resulting systems were characterized by predicting their lowest energy structures, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and susceptibilities to the fragmentation process. Among the cations studied, only the [MeMePyr] + was found to form a typical Rydberg radical (MeMePyr) and double-Rydberg anion ([MeMePyr] − ), whereas the remaining cations were predicted to form neutral radicals of a primarily valence (MeMeIm and MePy) or mixed Rydberg-valence [P(CH 3 ) 4 ] character. Our calculations confirmed the stability of all CC + and CC dimers against fragmentation yielding the corresponding monomers (the binding energies of 12.2–20.5 kcal/mol and 11.3–72.3 kcal/mol were estimated for CC + and CC dimers, respectively). [(MeMePyr) 2 ] − was identified as the only adiabatically stable CC − dimeric anion having its vertical electron detachment energy of 0.417 eV. We also found that in the [(MeMePyr) 2 ] − anionic state, three outermost electrons are described by Rydberg orbitals, which results in the (σ) 2 (σ * ) 1 configuration.},

  abstract = {Intramolecular energy flow (also known as intramolecular vibrational redistribution or IVR) is often assumed in Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus, transition state, collisional energy transfer, and other rate calculations not to be an impediment to reaction. In contrast, experimental spectroscopy, computational results, and models based on Anderson localization have shown that ergodicity is achieved rather slowly during molecular energy flow. The statistical assumption in rate theories might easily fail due to quantum localization. Here, we develop a simple model for the interplay of IVR and energy transfer and simulate the model with near-exact quantum dynamics for a 10-degree of freedom system composed of two five-mode molecular fragments. The calculations are facilitated by applying the van Vleck transformation to local random matrix models of the vibrational Hamiltonian. We find that there is a rather sharp “phase transition” as a function of molecular anharmonicity “ a ” between a region of facile energy transfer and a region limited by IVR and incomplete accessibility of the state space (classically, the phase space). The very narrow transition range of the order parameter a happens to lie right in the middle of the range expected for molecular torsion, bending, and stretching vibrations, thus demonstrating that reactive energy transfer dynamics several k B T above the thermal energy occurs not far from the localization boundary, with implications for controllability of reactions.},

  abstract = {A new method called QM-VM2 is presented that efficiently combines statistical mechanics with quantum mechanical (QM) energy potentials in order to calculate noncovalent binding free energies of host–guest systems. QM-VM2 efficiently couples the use of semi-empirical QM (SEQM) energies and geometry optimizations with an underlying molecular mechanics (MM) based conformational search, to find low SEQM energy minima, and allows for processing of these minima at higher levels of ab initio QM theory. A progressive geometry optimization scheme is introduced as a means to increase conformational sampling efficiency. The newly implemented QM-VM2 is used to compute the binding free energies of the host molecule cucurbit[7]uril and a set of 15 guest molecules. The results are presented along with comparisons to experimentally determined binding affinities. For the full set of 15 host–guest complexes, which have a range of formal charges from +1 to +3, SEQM-VM2 based binding free energies show poor correlation with experiment, whereas for the ten +1 complexes only, a significant correlation (R 2 = 0.8) is achieved. SEQM-VM2 generation of conformers followed by single-point ab initio QM calculations at the dispersion corrected restricted Hartree–Fock-D3(BJ) and TPSS-D3(BJ) levels of theory, as post-processing corrections, yields a reasonable correlation with experiment for the full set of host–guest complexes (R 2 = 0.6 and R 2 = 0.7, respectively) and an excellent correlation for the +1 formal charge set (R 2 = 1.0 and R 2 = 0.9, respectively), as long as a sufficiently large basis set (triple-zeta quality) is employed. The importance of the inclusion of configurational entropy, even at the MM level, for the achievement of good correlation with experiment was demonstrated by comparing the calculated Δ E values with experiment and finding a considerably poorer correlation with experiment than for the calculated free energy Δ E − T Δ S . For the complete set of host–guest systems with the range of formal charges, it was observed that the deviation of the predicted binding free energy from experiment correlates somewhat with the net charge of the systems. This observation leads to a simple empirical interpolation scheme to improve the linear regression of the full set.},

The solvent is modeled as conventional DPD particles, while individual rods are represented by a rigid linear chain consisting of overlapping solid spheres, which interact with solvent particles through a hard repulsive potential. The boundary condition on the rod surface is controlled using a surface friction between the solid spheres and the solvent particles. In this work, this model is employed to study the diffusion of a single colloid in the DPD solvent and compared with theoretical predictions. Both the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients obtained at a proper surface friction show good agreement with calculations based on the rod size defined by the hard repulsive potential. In addition, the system-size dependence of the diffusion coefficients shows that the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamic interactions are correctly included in this DPD model. Comparing our results with experimental measurements of the diffusion coefficients of gold nanorods, we discuss the ability of the model to correctly describe dynamics in real nanorod suspensions. Our results provide a clear reference point from which the model could be extended to enable the study of colloid dynamics in more complex situations or for other types of particles.},

  abstract = {Simulating and predicting multiscale problems that couple multiple physics and dynamics across many orders of spatiotemporal scales is a great challenge that has not been investigated systematically by deep neural networks (DNNs). Herein, we develop a framework based on operator regression, the so-called deep operator network (DeepONet), with the long-term objective to simplify multiscale modeling by avoiding the fragile and time-consuming “hand-shaking” interface algorithms for stitching together heterogeneous descriptions of multiscale phenomena. To this end, as a first step, we investigate if a DeepONet can learn the dynamics of different scale regimes, one at the deterministic macroscale and the other at the stochastic microscale regime with inherent thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we test the effectiveness and accuracy of the DeepONet in predicting multirate bubble growth dynamics, which is described by a Rayleigh–Plesset (R–P) equation at the macroscale and modeled as a stochastic nucleation and cavitation process at the microscale by dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). First, we generate data using the R–P equation for multirate bubble growth dynamics caused by randomly time-varying liquid pressures drawn from Gaussian random fields (GRFs). Our results show that properly trained DeepONets can accurately predict the macroscale bubble growth dynamics and can outperform long short-term memory networks. We also demonstrate that the DeepONet can extrapolate accurately outside the input distribution using only very few new measurements. Subsequently, we train the DeepONet with DPD data corresponding to stochastic bubble growth dynamics. Although the DPD data are noisy and we only collect sparse data points on the trajectories, the trained DeepONet model is able to predict accurately the mean bubble dynamics for time-varying GRF pressures. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that DeepONets can be employed to unify the macroscale and microscale models of the multirate bubble growth problem, hence providing new insight into the role of operator regression via DNNs in tackling realistic multiscale problems and in simplifying modeling with heterogeneous descriptions.},

Employing the correlation discrete variable representation, sets of direct product type grids are employed in the calculation of the required potential energy matrix elements. This direct product structure can be a problem if the coordinate system includes polar and azimuthal angles that result in singularities in the kinetic energy operator. In the present work, a new direct product-type discrete variable representation (DVR) for arbitrary sets of polar and azimuthal angles is introduced. It employs an extended coordinate space where the range of the polar angles is taken to be [− π , π ]. The resulting extended space DVR resolves problems caused by the singularities in the kinetic energy operator without generating a very large spectral width. MCTDH calculations studying the F·CH 4 complex are used to investigate important properties of the new scheme. The scheme is found to allow for more efficient integration of the equations of motion compared to the previously employed cot-DVR approach [G. Schiffel and U. Manthe, Chem.

In this periodic orbital-uncoupled FDE ansatz, no wavefunction overlap is taken into account, and only the electron density of the active subsystem is computed explicitly. This density is relaxed in the presence of the environment potential, which is obtained by translating the updated active subsystem density, yielding a fully self-consistent solution at convergence. Treating only one subsystem explicitly, the method allows for the calculation of local properties in condensed molecular systems, while no orbital band structure is obtained preventing the application, e.g., to systems with metallic bonding. In order to illustrate possible applications of the new implementation, selected case studies are presented, ranging from ground-state dipole moments using configuration interaction methods via excitation energies using time-dependent density-functional theory to ionization potentials obtained from equation-of-motion correlation methods. Different levels of approximations are assessed, revealing that an active subsystem consisting of two or three molecules leads to results that are converged with respect to the environment contributions.},

Further investigation suggests that LMP2 may not be sufficiently accurate for computing HFEs for alcohols with AFM. Other properties, such as enthalpy of hydration, diffusion constants, and vibrational spectra, are also computed with the force field developed.

  abstract = {Coupling molecules to the confined light modes of an optical cavity is showing great promise for manipulating chemical reactions. However, to fully exploit this principle and use cavities as a new tool for controlling chemistry, a complete understanding of the effects of strong light–matter coupling on molecular dynamics and reactivity is required. While quantum chemistry can provide atomistic insight into the reactivity of uncoupled molecules, the possibilities to also explore strongly coupled systems are still rather limited due to the challenges associated with an accurate description of the cavity in such calculations. Despite recent progress in introducing strong coupling effects into quantum chemistry calculations, applications are mostly restricted to single or simplified molecules in ideal lossless cavities that support a single light mode only. However, even if commonly used planar mirror micro-cavities are characterized by a fundamental mode with a frequency determined by the distance between the mirrors, the cavity energy also depends on the wave vector of the incident light rays. To account for this dependency, called cavity dispersion, in atomistic simulations of molecules in optical cavities, we have extended our multi-scale molecular dynamics model for strongly coupled molecular ensembles to include multiple confined light modes. To validate the new model, we have performed simulations of up to 512 Rhodamine molecules in red-detuned Fabry–Pérot cavities. The results of our simulations suggest that after resonant excitation into the upper polariton at a fixed wave vector, or incidence angle, the coupled cavity-molecule system rapidly decays into dark states that lack dispersion. Slower relaxation from the dark state manifold into both the upper and lower bright polaritons causes observable photo-luminescence from the molecule–cavity system along the two polariton dispersion branches that ultimately evolves toward the bottom of the lower polariton branch, in line with experimental observations. We anticipate that the more realistic cavity description in our approach will help to better understand and predict how cavities can modify molecular properties.},

  abstract = {We formulate Wannier orbital overlap population and Wannier orbital Hamilton population to describe the contribution of different orbitals to electron distribution and their interactions. These methods, which are analogous to the well-known crystal orbital overlap population and crystal orbital Hamilton population, provide insight into the distribution of electrons at various atom centers and their contributions to bonding. We apply this formalism in the context of a plane-wave density functional theory calculation. This method provides a means to connect the non-local plane-wave basis to a localized basis by projecting the wave functions from a plane-wave density functional theory calculation to a localized Wannier orbital basis. The main advantage of this formulation is that the spilling factor is strictly zero for insulators and can systematically be made small for metals. We use our proposed method to study and obtain bonding and electron localization insights in five different materials.},

  abstract = {Ab Initio Multiple Spawning (AIMS) simulates the excited-state dynamics of molecular systems by representing nuclear wavepackets in a basis of coupled traveling Gaussian functions, called trajectory basis functions (TBFs). New TBFs are spawned when nuclear wavepackets enter regions of strong nonadiabaticity, permitting the description of non-Born–Oppenheimer processes. The spawning algorithm is simultaneously the blessing and the curse of the AIMS method: it allows for an accurate description of the transfer of nuclear amplitude between different electronic states, but it also dramatically increases the computational cost of the AIMS dynamics as all TBFs are coupled. Recently, a strategy coined stochastic-selection AIMS (SSAIMS) was devised to limit the ever-growing number of TBFs and tested on simple molecules. In this work, we use the photodynamics of three different molecules—cyclopropanone, fulvene, and 1,2-dithiane—to investigate (i) the potential of SSAIMS to reproduce reference AIMS results for challenging nonadiabatic dynamics, (ii) the compromise achieved by SSAIMS in obtaining accurate results while using the smallest average number of TBFs as possible, and (iii) the performance of SSAIMS in comparison to the mixed quantum/classical method trajectory surface hopping (TSH)—both in terms of its accuracy and computational cost. We show that SSAIMS can accurately reproduce the AIMS results for the three molecules considered at a much cheaper computational cost, often close to that of TSH. We deduce from these tests that an overlap-based criterion for the stochastic-selection process leads to the best agreement with the reference AIMS dynamics for the smallest average number of TBFs.},

Ab initio theoretical predictions of these systems need to combine non-perturbative, many-body electronic structure theory-based methods with cavity quantum electrodynamics and theories of open-quantum systems. Here, we generalize quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory to account for dissipative dynamics of the cavity and describe coupled cavity–single molecule interactions in the weak-to-strong-coupling regimes. Specifically, to establish this generalized technique, we study excited-state dynamics and spectral responses of benzene and toluene under weak-to-strong light–matter coupling. By tuning the coupling, we achieve cavity-mediated energy transfer between electronically excited states. This generalized ab initio quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory treatment can be naturally extended to describe cavity-mediated interactions in arbitrary electromagnetic environments, accessing correlated light–matter observables and thereby closing the gap between electronic structure theory, quantum optics, and nanophotonics.},

  abstract = {Conical intersections control excited state reactivity, and thus, elucidating and predicting their geometric and energetic characteristics are crucial for understanding photochemistry. Locating these intersections requires accurate and efficient electronic structure methods. Unfortunately, the most accurate methods (e.g., multireference perturbation theories such as XMS-CASPT2) are computationally challenging for large molecules. The state-interaction state-averaged restricted ensemble referenced Kohn–Sham (SI-SA-REKS) method is a computationally efficient alternative. The application of SI-SA-REKS to photochemistry was previously hampered by a lack of analytical nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. We have recently derived analytical energy derivatives for the SI-SA-REKS method and implemented the method effectively on graphical processing units. We demonstrate that our implementation gives the correct conical intersection topography and energetics for several examples. Furthermore, our implementation of SI-SA-REKS is computationally efficient, with observed sub-quadratic scaling as a function of molecular size. This demonstrates the promise of SI-SA-REKS for excited state dynamics of large molecular systems.},

We derive expressions for the contributions of exchange effects due to the bosonic or fermionic nature of the helium isotope; these effects have been omitted from previous calculations. The exchange effects are relatively insignificant for 4 He at the temperatures considered, but for 3 He, they are necessary for quantitative accuracy below about 4 K. Our results are consistent with previous theoretical work (also with some of the limited and scattered experimental data) for 4 He; for 3 He, there are no experimental values, and this work provides the first values of D ( T ) calculated at this level. The uncertainty of the results depends on the statistical uncertainty of the PIMC calculation, the estimated effect of omitting four-body terms in the potential energy, and the uncertainty contribution propagated from the uncertainty of the potentials. At low temperatures, the uncertainty is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the PIMC calculations, while at high temperatures, the uncertainties related to the three-body potential and omitted higher-order contributions become dominant.},

Our approach is fully portable and can be applied to many medium-size rigid molecules whose excited state dynamics requires a quantum description. We present our model and discuss the details of the electronic structure calculations needed for the parameterization, analyzing critical situations that could arise in the case of strongly interacting excited states. The protocol was applied to the simulation of the excited state dynamics of the pyrene molecule, starting from either the first or the second bright state (S 2 or S 5 ). The LVC model was benchmarked against state-of-the-art quantum mechanical calculations with optimizations and energy scans and turned out to be very accurate. The dynamics simulations, performed including all active normal coordinates with the multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, show good agreement with the available experimental data, endorsing prediction of the excited state mechanism, especially for S 5 , whose ultrafast deactivation mechanism was not yet clearly understood.},

A recently developed 3 × 3 diabatic potential model is used, which is based on very accurate ab initio calculations and includes the long-range interactions for ground and excited states. It is found that for initial H 2 + (v = 0), the quasi-degenerate H 2 (v′ = 4) non-reactive charge transfer product is enhanced, producing an increase in the reaction probability and cross section. It becomes the dominant channel from collision energies above 0.2 eV, producing a ratio between v′ = 4 and the rest of v’s, which that increase up to 1 eV. The H + H 2 + → H 2 + + H exchange reaction channel is nearly negligible, while the reactive and non-reactive charge transfer reaction channels are of the same order, except that corresponding to H 2 (v′ = 4), and the two charge transfer processes compete below 0.2 eV. This enhancement is expected to play an important vibrational and isotopic effect that needs to be evaluated.

Plasmalogen lipids, Forssman glycosphingolipids, and hydroxylated Forssman glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin were systematically added to determine their structural effects. Plasmalogen lipids have a minimal effect on the overall biophysical properties of the epithelial plasma membrane. In line with the hypothesized role of Forssman lipids in the epithelial apical membrane, the introduction of Forssman lipids initiates the formation of glycosphingolipid-rich nanoscale lipid domains, which also include phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol (CHOL). This decreases the lateral diffusion in the extracellular leaflet, as well as the area per lipid of domain forming lipids, most notably PE. Finally, hydroxylation of the Forssman glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin further modulates the lateral organization of the membrane. Through comparison to the previously studied average and neuronal plasma membranes, the impact of membrane lipid composition on membrane properties was characterized. Overall, this study furthers our understanding of the biophysical properties of complex membranes and the impact of lipid diversity in modulating membrane properties.},

  abstract = {The Al K alpha, 1486.6 eV, based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Fe 2p and Fe 3p for Fe(III) in Fe 2 O 3 and Fe(II) in FeO is compared with theoretical predictions based on ab initio wavefunctions that accurately treat the final, core-hole, multiplets. The principal objectives of this comparison are to understand the multiplet structure and to evaluate the use of both the 2p and 3p spectra in determining oxidation states. In order to properly interpret the features of these spectra and to use the XPS to provide atomistic insights as well as atomic composition, it is necessary to understand the origin of the multiplet energies and intensities. The theoretical treatment takes into account the ligand field and spin–orbit splittings, the covalent mixing of ligand and Fe 3d orbitals, and the angular momentum coupling of the open shell electrons. These effects lead to the distribution of XPS intensity into a large number of final, ionic, states that are only partly resolved with energies spread over a wide range of binding energies. For this reason, it is necessary to record the Fe 2p and 3p XPS spectra over a wide energy range, which includes all the multiplets in the theoretical treatment as well as additional shake satellites. We also evaluate the effects of differing assumptions concerning the extrinsic background subtraction, to make sure our experimental spectrum may be fairly compared to the theory. We conclude that the Fe 3p XPS provides an additional means for distinguishing Fe(III) and Fe(II) oxidation states beyond just using the Fe 2p spectrum. In particular, with the use of the Fe 3p XPS, the depth of the material probed is about 1.5 times greater than for the Fe 2p XPS. In addition, a new type of atomic many-body effect that involves excitations into orbitals that have Fe f, ℓ = 3, symmetry has been shown to be important for the Fe 3p XPS.},

This kind of rotation–translation decoupling has so far only been observed in the supercooled liquids approaching glass transition, and its observation in water at a normal liquid temperature is of conceptual interest. This finding is also of interest for the application-significant studies of the water interaction with fully hydrated nanoparticles.

An observed enhancement in the up-conversion photoluminescence results from the co-dopant occupancy at Ba 2+ sites via substitution through the hot injection method, whereas for samples prepared using co-precipitation, photoluminescence quenching was observed, which can be correlated with the Li + occupancy at the interstitial site near Er 3+ and also due to the incorporation of OH − .

  abstract = {Interactions of trapped reservoir gases within organic-rich and brine-bearing sedimentary rocks have direct relevance to many geoenergy applications. Extracting generalizable information from experimental campaigns is hindered by the fact that geological systems are extremely complex. However, modern computational tools offer the opportunity of studying systems with controlled complexity, in an effort to better understand the mechanisms at play. Employing molecular dynamics, we examine here adsorption and transport of gases containing CH 4 and either CO 2 or H 2 S within amorphous silica nanopores filled with benzene. We explicitly quantify the effect of small amounts of water/brines at geological temperature and pressure conditions. Because of wetting, the presence of brines lessens the adsorption capacity of the aromatic-filled pore. The simulation results show salt-specific effects on the transport properties of the gases when either KCl or CaCl 2 brines are considered, although adsorption was not affected. The acid gases considered either facilitate or hinder CH 4 transport depending on whether they are more or less preferentially adsorbed within the pore as compared to benzene, and this effect is mediated by the presence of water/brines. Our simulation results could be used to extract thermodynamic quantities that in the future will help to optimize transport of various gases through organic-rich and brine-bearing sedimentary rocks, which is likely to have a positive impact on both hydrocarbon production and carbon sequestration applications. As a first step, a phenomenological model is presented here, which allows one to predict permeability based on interatomic energies.},

In cases of Al x Ga 1-x N and Ba x Sr x-1 TiO 3 (BST), whose most important properties are governed by point defects, explicit simulation can be a computationally demanding task due to the random occupation of Al and Ga on cation sites in AlGaN and Ba and Sr on A-sites in BST. In this work, interpolation between end member compounds is used as a first approximation to defect properties and concentrations in intermediate alloy compositions in lieu of explicit simulation. In AlGaN, the efficacy of Si and Ge as dopants for n -type Al-rich AlGaN is explored by considering self-compensating defects such as multi-donor vacancy complexes and Si and Ge DX configurations. In BST, variation of the high temperature defect chemistry of Mg and Fe is examined. The approach presented here is expected to be generally appropriate for first approximation of defect properties in semiconductors and dielectrics where the alloy is a random solid solution of the end members.},

  abstract = {In contrast to the wetting phenomenon of pure substance phase, we here concentrate on the wetting behavior of immiscible fluids with two components via numerical simulations. We investigate the energetic contribution, the wall energy and the surface excess energy, to the wetting behavior of liquid solutions varying with temperature. This investigation is in accordance with Cahn’s wetting transition theory, where the surface composition plays a vital role. By analyzing the energetic contributions, we reveal two different physical mechanisms of complete wetting: (i) surface tension driven complete wetting, where the wetting microstructure is achieved via the outward spreading of the triple junction, and (ii) diffusion induced complete wetting, where the wetting film is achieved through a direct deposition of the solute on the substrate. The former one is consistent with the classic theory of Young’s law, and the latter one is an alternative mechanism. To indicate the broad multiplicity of the microstructural arrangements, we take porous structures to exemplarily elucidate the formation of alternative perfect wetting structures. Differing from the wetting on a flat substrate, we show that the surface composition varying with temperature leads to a distinct wetting phenomenon in porous structures. The present findings provide an alternative interpretation for complete wetting and are expected to be exploited for designing more effectively and efficiently superhydrophilic structures.},

The reliability and accuracy of the fast interatomic potentials are validated. With the potentials, we extend the simulation of the diffusion process to a wide temperature range (300 K–1000 K) and systems with large size (∼1000 atoms). Important technical aspects such as the statistical error and size effect are carefully investigated, and benchmark tests including the effect of density functional, thermal expansion, and configurational disorder are performed. The computed data that consider these factors agree well with the experimental results, and we find that the three structures show different behaviors with respect to configurational disorder. Our work paves the way for further research on computation screening of solid-state electrolyte materials.},

Both the stoichiometric and the reduced (111) surfaces are considered, where the electronic structure of the latter is obtained by introducing oxygen vacancies on the topmost or the subsurface oxygen layer. Both the potential energy surfaces of the reduced ceria surface and the adsorbate–surface complex are characterized by numerous local minima, of which the relative stability depends strongly on the electronic structure method of choice. Bent CO 2 configurations in close vicinity to the surface oxygen vacancy that partially re-oxidize the reduced ceria surface have been identified as the most probable stable minima. However, the oxygen vacancy concentration on the surface turns out to have a direct impact on the relative stability of possible adsorption configurations. Finally, the vibrational analyses of selected adsorbed species on both the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces show promising agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results.},

  abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are uniquely suitable for providing molecular-level insights into the Electric Double Layer (EDL) that forms when a charged surface is in contact with an aqueous solution. However, simulations are only as accurate in predicting EDL properties as permitted by the atomic interaction models. Experimental ζ -potential values and surface charges could provide a potentially suitable reference to validate and tune the interaction models, if not for the fact that they themselves are a product of imperfect models used to interpret the raw measurement data. Here, we present an approach to tune an interaction model by comparing Electro-Osmotic Flow (EOF) MD simulations against experimental Streaming Current (SC) measurements while minimizing potential modeling errors arising from both approaches. The point that is least susceptible to interpretation and modeling errors is argued to be at the concentration for which zero flow velocity is observed in EOF simulations and a net zero electric current is measured in SC experiments. At this concentration, the ζ -potential is also zero. We were able to match the experimental concentration at which ζ = 0 in MD simulations for a CaCl 2 solution at pH 7.5 in contact with fused silica by tuning the ion-surface Lennard-Jones cross interactions. These interactions were found to greatly affect the ion distribution within the EDL and particularly the formation of inner-sphere surface-complexes, which, in turn, affects the electrokinetic flow. With the ion distribution determined explicitly, a series of properties can be calculated unambiguously, such as the capacitance needed for surface complexation models.},

These results are in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of the existing models of shear relaxation and shear thinning based on the nonlinear Langevin equation theory, random first order transition theory, and the free volume model.

This is achieved by introducing k additional particle–particle interactions, which thus augments the effective number of neighbors of each particle. Our computer simulations of this system show that the structure of the liquid does not change with the introduction of these pseudo-neighbors and by means of analytical calculations, and we determine the structural properties related to these additional neighbors. We show that the relaxation dynamics of the system slows down very quickly with the increase in k and that the onset and the mode-coupling temperatures increase. The systems with high values of k follow the mode-coupling theory power law behavior for a larger temperature range compared to the ones with lower values of k . The dynamic susceptibility indicates that the dynamic heterogeneity decreases with the increase in k , whereas the non-Gaussian parameter is independent of it. Thus, we conclude that with the increase in the number of pseudo-neighbors, the system becomes more mean-field-like. By comparing our results with previous studies on mean-field-like systems, we come to the conclusion that the details of how the mean-field limit is approached are important since they can lead to different dynamical behavior in this limit.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the dynamics of liquid water confined in mesostructured porous silica (MCM-41) and periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) by incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering experiments. The effect of tuning the water/surface interaction from hydrophilic to more hydrophobic on the water mobility, while keeping the pore size in the range 3.5 nm–4.1 nm, was assessed from the comparative study of three PMOs comprising different organic bridging units and the purely siliceous MCM-41 case. An extended dynamical range was achieved by combining time-of-flight (IN5B) and backscattering (IN16B) quasielastic neutron spectrometers providing complementary energy resolutions. Liquid water was studied at regularly spaced temperatures ranging from 300 K to 243 K. In all systems, the molecular dynamics could be described consistently by the combination of two independent motions resulting from fast local motion around the average molecule position and the confined translational jump diffusion of its center of mass. All the molecules performed local relaxations, whereas the translational motion of a fraction of molecules was frozen on the experimental timescale. This study provides a comprehensive microscopic view on the dynamics of liquid water confined in mesopores, with distinct surface chemistries, in terms of non-mobile/mobile fraction, self-diffusion coefficient, residence time, confining radius, local relaxation time, and their temperature dependence. Importantly, it demonstrates that the strength of the water/surface interaction determines the long-time tail of the dynamics, which we attributed to the translational diffusion of interfacial molecules, while the water dynamics in the pore center is barely affected by the interface hydrophilicity.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents show great potential as CO 2 absorbents, which is highly desirable for the sustainable development of CO 2 reduction and prevention of global climate changes. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble at pressures of 1 MPa and 5 MPa and at the corresponding experimental density are carried out to investigate the CO 2 absorption in choline chloride: ethylene glycol deep eutectic solvent. Based on the structural analysis, there is a strong anion and hydrogen bond donor effect and a minor cation effect on CO 2 solvation in the solvent. Instead of cooperation, a competition between the anion and the hydrogen bond donor (ethylene glycol) for the interaction with CO 2 is indicated. While at a lower pressure, the ethylene glycol–CO 2 interaction dominates, at a higher pressure, it is the chloride–CO 2 interaction. Thus, it is possible to use the same advantages within the deep eutectic solvent as the CO 2 absorbent as in ionic liquids, but in the hydrogen bond, a donor can be exploited.},

  abstract = {Stable crystalline structures of confined water can be different from bulk ice. In Paper I [T. Yagasaki et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 064702 (2019)] of this study, it was shown, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, that a zeolite-like ice structure forms in nanobrushes consisting of (6,6) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) when the CNTs are located in a triangle arrangement. The melting temperature of the zeolite-like ice structure is much higher than the melting temperature of ice I h when the distance between the surfaces of CNTs is ∼0.94 nm, which is the best spacing for the bilayer structure of water. In this paper, we perform MD simulations of nanobrushes of CNTs that are different from (6,6) CNTs in radius. Several new porous ice structures form spontaneously in the MD simulations. A stable porous ice forms when the radius of its cavities matches the radius of the CNTs well. All cylindrical porous ice structures found in this study can be decomposed into a small number of structural blocks. We provide a new protocol to classify cylindrical porous ice crystals on the basis of this decomposition.},

  abstract = {The first electronic hyperpolarizability (β) of phenol blue (PB) in several solvents in a wide range of dielectric constants is investigated using the density functional theory (DFT). The reliability of various exchange-correlation functionals is assessed by a comparison to reference Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2) calculations. The equilibrium geometry of PB in each solvent is obtained by using the average solvent electrostatic configuration/free energy gradient method, which performs optimizations on the free energy hyper-surface by employing iteratively the sequential quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methodology. The dependence of β on the bond length alternation (BLA) coordinate is rationalized by means of the two-level model. Within the employed exchange-correlation functionals, the LC-BLYP functional shows the best performance for describing the static and dynamic MP2 results of β, which increases as the BLA diminishes, reaching a maximum in an intermediate value of BLA. The results also illustrate the role played by the difference between the ground- and excited-state dipole moments (Δμ) in determining the hyperpolarizability behavior in solution. Particularly, in the aqueous solution case, Δμ goes to around zero when BLA is near zero, leading to an abrupt decline in the β value. The DFT results of this study, therefore, indicate a clear relationship between the first hyperpolarizability and the BLA coordinate for the PB in solution, in agreement with experiment.},

First, we show that the state-averaged complete-active-space self-consistent field electronic structure calculations with a properly chosen active space of 12 active electrons in 10 active orbitals can predict the potential energy surfaces and the singlet–triplet spin–orbit couplings quite well for CH 2 S, and we use this method for direct dynamics by coherent switching with decay of mixing (CSDM). We obtain similar dynamical results with CSDM or by adding energy-based decoherence to trajectory surface hopping, with the population of triplet states tending to a small steady-state value over 500 fs. Without decoherence, the state populations calculated by the conventional trajectory surface hopping method or the semiclassical Ehrenfest method gradually increase. This difference shows that decoherence changes the nature of the results not just quantitatively but qualitatively.},

  abstract = {The photochemical ring-opening reaction of 7-dehydrocholesterol (DHC, provitamin D 3 ) is responsible for the light-initiated formation of vitamin D 3 in mammalian skin membranes. Visible transient absorption spectroscopy was used to explore the excited state dynamics of DHC and two analogs: ergosterol (provitamin D 2 ) and DHC acetate free in solution and confined to lipid bilayers chosen to model the biological cell membrane. In solution, the excited state dynamics of the three compounds are nearly identical. However, when confined to lipid bilayers, the heterogeneity of the lipid membrane and packing forces imposed on the molecule by the lipid alter the excited state dynamics of these compounds. When confined to lipid bilayers in liposomes formed using DPPC, two solvation environments are identified. The excited state dynamics for DHC and analogs in fluid-like regions of the liposome membrane undergo internal conversion and ring-opening on 1 ps–2 ps time scales, similar to those observed in isotropic solution. In contrast, the excited state lifetime of a subpopulation in regions of lower fluidity is 7 ps–12 ps. The long decay component is unique to these liposomes and results from the structural properties of the lipid bilayer. Additional measurements in liposomes prepared with lipids having slightly longer or shorter alkane tails support this conclusion. In the lipid environments studied, the longest lifetimes are observed for DHC. The unsaturated sterol tail of ergosterol and the acetate group of DHC acetate disrupt the packing around the molecule and permit faster internal conversion and relaxation back to the ground state.},

The electron affinity of PyO is measured to be 2.4772(4) eV (19 980 ± 3 cm −1 ) from high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy. Photodetachment spectroscopy reveals a dipole-bound state (DBS) for PyO − 280 cm −1 below the detachment threshold as well as a broad and intense valence excited state (shape resonance) 1077 cm −1 above the detachment threshold. The shape resonance with an excitation energy of 21 055 cm −1 is due to excitation of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital of PyO − to its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in the continuum. Twenty-nine vibrational levels of the DBS are observed, including 27 above-threshold vibrational levels (vibrational Feshbach resonances). Twenty-seven resonant photoelectron spectra are obtained by tuning the detachment laser to the vibrational Feshbach resonances, resulting in highly non-Franck–Condon photoelectron spectra and rich vibrational information. In total, the frequencies of 21 vibrational modes are obtained for the PyO radical by the combination of the photodetachment and resonant photoelectron spectroscopy, including 13 out-of-plane bending modes.},

Different levels of theory are compared with each other and with available photoelectron spectra. We show that one-shot GW with a PBE0 starting point ( G 0 W 0 @PBE0) consistently provides very good agreement for all experimentally measured binding energies (within 0.1 eV–0.2 eV or less). We attribute this to the success of PBE0 in mitigating self-interaction error and providing good quasiparticle wave functions, which renders a first-order perturbative GW correction effective. One-shot GW calculations with a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) starting point do poorly in predicting electron removal energies by underbinding orbitals with typical errors near 1.5 eV. A higher exact exchange amount of 50\% in the DFT starting point of one-shot GW does not provide very good agreement with experiment by overbinding orbitals with typical errors near 0.5 eV. While not as accurate as G 0 W 0 @PBE0, the G -only eigenvalue self-consistent GW scheme with W fixed to the PBE level provides a reasonably predictive level of theory (typical errors near 0.3 eV) to describe photoelectron spectra of these 3 d -transition metal dioxide anions. Adding eigenvalue self-consistency also in W , on the other hand, worsens the agreement with experiment overall. Our findings on the performance of various GW methods are discussed in the context of our previous studies on other transition metal oxide molecular systems.},

Ab initio adiabatic PESs and nonadiabatic coupling terms are computed over a series of pairwise normal modes, which exhibit rich nonadiabatic interactions starting from Jahn–Teller interactions and accidental conical intersections/seams to pseudo Jahn–Teller couplings. Once the electronic structure calculation is completed on the low-lying five doublet electronic states ( ⁠ X ̃ 2 E 1 g ⁠ , B ̃ 2 E 2 g ⁠ , and C ̃ 2 A 2 u ⁠ ) of the cationic species, diabatization is carried out employing the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation (ADT) equations for the five-state sub-Hilbert space to compute highly accurate ADT angles, and thereby, single-valued, smooth, symmetric, and continuous diabatic PESs and couplings are constructed. Subsequently, such surface matrices are used to perform multi-state multi-mode nuclear dynamics for simulating PE spectra of benzene. Our theoretical findings clearly depict that the spectra for X ̃ 2 E 1 g and B ̃ 2 E 2 g − C ̃ 2 A 2 u states obtained from BBO treatment and TDDVR dynamics exhibit reasonably good agreement with the experimental results as well as with the findings of other theoretical approaches.},

For this reason, a partition of the PES into a diabatic matrix plus a NN many-body term has been used, fitted with a novel artificial neural network scheme that prevents spurious asymptotic interactions. Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) studies have been carried on this PES to evaluate the rate constant temperature dependence for the different reactive processes, showing good agreement with the available experimental data. Of special interest is the analysis of the previously identified trapping mechanism in the RPMD study, which can be attributed to spurious resonances associated with excitations of the normal modes of the ring polymer.},

Electronic structure calculations are performed using the explicitly correlated coupled clusters with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations approach in conjunction with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. Then, an analytical expansion of this 3D-PES is derived. This PES shows three minimal structures for collinear C–Cl–He arrangements and for He located in between two H atoms, in the plane parallel to the three H atoms, which is near the center of mass of CH 3 Cl. The latter form corresponds to the global minimum. Two maxima are also found, which connect the minimal structures. We then evaluated the pressure broadening coefficients of the spectral lines of CH 3 Cl in a helium bath based on our ab initio potential. Satisfactory agreement with experiments was observed, confirming the good accuracy of our 3D-PES. We also derived the bound rovibronic levels for ortho- and para- CH 3 Cl–He dimers after quantum treatment of the nuclear motions. For both clusters, computations show that although the ground vibrational state is located well above the intramolecular isomerization barriers, the rovibronic levels may be associated with a specific minimal structure. This can be explained by vibrational localization and vibrational memory effects.},

Calculations of photoelectron anisotropy parameters, β , and harmonic vibrational modes help provide initial insight into the molecular structure. The photon energy range encompasses the expected position of the atomic Cl 3p Cooper minimum. A corresponding dip observed here in the anisotropy of certain photoelectron bands permits the identification and characterization of those molecular orbitals that retain a localized atomic Cl character. The adiabatic approximation holds for the X 2 A u state photoelectron band, but vibronic coupling was inferred within the A – B – C and the D – E states by noting various failures of the Franck–Condon model, including vibrationally dependent β -parameters. This is further explored using the linear vibronic coupling model with interaction parameters obtained from ab initio calculations. The A / B photoelectron band is appreciably affected by vibronic coupling, owing to the low-lying conical intersection of the A 2 A g and B 2 B u states. The C 2 B g band is also affected, but to a lesser extent. The adiabatic minima of the D 2 A u and E 2 A g states are almost degenerate, and the vibronic interaction between these states is considerable. The potential energy surface of the D 2 A u state is predicted to have a double-minimum shape with respect to the a u deformations of the molecular structure. The irregular vibrational structure of the resulting single photoelectron band reflects the non-adiabatic nuclear dynamics occurring on the two coupled potential energy surfaces above the energy of their conical intersection.},

We have employed the Fermi–Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLOSIC) method in conjunction with the local spin-density approximation, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA to describe binding energies of hydrogen-bonded water–ion clusters, i.e., water–hydronium, water–hydroxide, water–halide, and non-hydrogen-bonded water–alkali clusters. In the hydrogen-bonded water–ion clusters, the building blocks are linked by hydrogen atoms, although the links are much stronger and longer-ranged than the normal hydrogen bonds between water molecules because the monopole on the ion interacts with both permanent and induced dipoles on the water molecules. We find that self-interaction errors overbind the hydrogen-bonded water–ion clusters and that FLOSIC reduces the error and brings the binding energies into closer agreement with higher-level calculations. The non-hydrogen-bonded water–alkali clusters are not significantly affected by self-interaction errors. Self-interaction corrected PBE predicts the lowest mean unsigned error in binding energies (≤50 meV/H 2 O) for hydrogen-bonded water–ion clusters. Self-interaction errors are also largely dependent on the cluster size, and FLOSIC does not accurately capture the subtle variation in all clusters, indicating the need for further refinement.},

  abstract = {The ultrafast optical Kerr effect (OKE) is widely used to investigate the structural dynamics and interactions of liquids, solutions, and solids by observing their intrinsic nonlinear temporal responses through nearly collinear four-wave mixing. Non-degenerate mixing schemes allow for background free detection and can provide information on the interplay between a material’s internal degrees of freedom. Here, we show a source of temporal dynamics in the OKE signal that is not reflective of the internal degrees of freedom but arises from a group index and momentum mismatch. It is observed in two-color experiments on condensed media with sizable spectral dispersion, a common property near an optical resonance. In particular, birefringence in crystalline solids is able to entirely change the character of the OKE signal via the off-diagonal tensor elements of the nonlinear susceptibility. We develop a detailed description of the phase-mismatched ultrafast OKE and show how to extract quantitative information on the spectrally resolved birefringence and group index from time-resolved experiments in one and two dimensions.},

Here, we present a chirped excitation sequence, CHirped ORdered pulses for Ultra-broadband Spectroscopy (CHORUS), for ultra-broadband ESR spectroscopy. It will be demonstrated that the application of this sequence can address the problems of excitation non-uniformity and sensitivity to instrumental instabilities to a greater extent compared to the current state of the art. This sequence is highly promising for finding applications beyond single excitation in many ESR experiments.

The former allows for non-multiplicative potential operators and greatly facilitates practical calculations with advanced, orbital-dependent functionals. The latter allows for quantum ensembles and enables the treatment of open systems and excited states. Here, we combine the two extensions, both formally and practically, first via an exact yet complicated formalism and then via a computationally tractable variant that involves a controlled approximation of ensemble “ghost interactions” by means of an iterative algorithm. The resulting formalism is illustrated using selected examples. This opens the door to the application of generalized KS theory in more challenging quantum scenarios and to the improvement of ensemble theories for the purpose of practical and accurate calculations.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have observed that the chemical and photophysical properties of molecules can be modified inside an optical Fabry–Pérot microcavity under collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) conditions, and such modification is currently not well understood by theory. In an effort to understand the origin of such cavity-induced phenomena, some recent studies have focused on the effect of the cavity environment on the nonlinear optical response of the molecular subsystem. Here, we use a recently proposed protocol for classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations to numerically investigate the linear and the nonlinear response of liquid carbon dioxide under such VSC conditions following an optical pulse excitation. We find that applying a strong pulse of excitation to the lower hybrid light–matter state, i.e., the lower polariton (LP), can lead to an overall molecular nonlinear absorption that is enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the excitation outside the cavity. This polariton-enhanced multiphoton absorption also causes an ultrashort LP lifetime (0.2 ps) under strong illumination. Unlike usual polariton relaxation processes—whereby polaritonic energy transfers directly to the manifold of singly excited vibrational dark states—under the present mechanism, the LP transfers energy directly to the manifold of higher vibrationally excited dark states; these highly excited dark states subsequently relax to the manifold of singly excited states with a lifetime of tens of ps. Because the present mechanism is generic in nature, we expect these numerical predictions to be experimentally observed in different molecular systems and in cavities with different volumes.},

  abstract = {An anisotropic atom–atom distributed intermolecular force-field (DIFF) for rigid trinitrobenzene (TNB) is developed using distributed multipole moments, dipolar polarizabilities, and dispersion coefficients derived from the charge density of the isolated molecule. The short-range parameters of the force-field are fitted to first- and second-order symmetry-adapted perturbation theory dimer interaction energy calculations using the distributed density-overlap model to guide the parameterization of the short-range anisotropy. The second-order calculations are used for fitting the damping coefficients of the long-range dispersion and polarization and also for relaxing the isotropic short-range coefficients in the final model, DIFF-srL2(rel). We assess the accuracy of the unrelaxed model, DIFF-srL2(norel), and its equivalent without short-range anisotropy, DIFF-srL0(norel), as these models are easier to derive. The model potentials are contrasted with empirical models for the repulsion–dispersion fitted to organic crystal structures with multipoles of iterated stockholder atoms (ISAs), FIT(ISA,L4), and with Gaussian Distributed Analysis (GDMA) multipoles, FIT(GDMA,L4), commonly used in modeling organic crystals. The potentials are tested for their ability to model the solid state of TNB. The non-empirical models provide more reasonable relative lattice energies of the three polymorphs of TNB and propose more sensible hypothetical structures than the empirical force-field (FIT). The DIFF-srL2(rel) model successfully has the most stable structure as one of the many structures that match the coordination sphere of form III. The neglect of the conformational flexibility of the nitro-groups is a significant approximation. This methodology provides a step toward force-fields capable of representing all phases of a molecule in molecular dynamics simulations.},

Understanding the collective motion of a large number of bath modes is essential for revealing their key roles in the overall dynamics. Here, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the bath motion in the basis of a large dataset generated from the symmetrical quasi-classical dynamics method based on the Meyer–Miller mapping Hamiltonian nonadiabatic dynamics for the excited-state energy transfer in the Frenkel-exciton model. The PCA method clearly elucidated that two types of bath modes, which either display strong vibronic coupling or have frequencies close to that of the electronic transition, are important to the nonadiabatic dynamics. These observations were fully consistent with the physical insights. The conclusions were based on the PCA of the trajectory data and did not involve significant pre-defined physical knowledge. The results show that the PCA approach, which is one of the simplest unsupervised machine learning dimensionality reduction methods, is a powerful one for analyzing complicated nonadiabatic dynamics in the condensed phase with many degrees of freedom.},

The permutational invariant polynomial-neural network approach is used to simultaneously fit and diabatize the electronic Hamiltonian by fitting the energies, energy gradients, and derivative couplings of the two coupled lowest-lying singlet states as well as fitting the energy and energy gradients of the lowest-lying triplet state. The key issue in fitting property matrix elements in the diabatic basis is that the diabatic surfaces must be smooth, that is, the diabatization must remove spikes in the original adiabatic property surfaces attributable to the switch of electronic wavefunctions at the conical intersection seam. Here, we employ the fit potential energy matrix to transform properties in the adiabatic representation to a quasi-diabatic representation and remove the discontinuity near the conical intersection seam. The property matrix elements can then be fit with smooth neural network functions. The coupled potential energy surfaces along with the dipole and spin–orbit coupling surfaces will enable more accurate and complete treatment of optical transitions, as well as nonadiabatic internal conversion and intersystem crossing.},

  abstract = {We address topics related to molecules coupled to quantum radiation. The formalism of light–matter interaction is different for classical and quantum fields, but some analogies remain, such as the formation of light induced crossings. We show that under particular circumstances, the molecular dynamics under quantum or classical fields produce similar results, as long as the radiation is prepared as a Fock state and far from ultra-strong coupling regimes. At this point, the choice of specific initial Fock states is irrelevant since the dynamics scales. However, in realistic multistate molecular systems, radiative scaling may fail due to the presence of simultaneous efficient non-radiative couplings in the dynamics. Polar molecules have permanent dipoles, and within the context of the full quantum Rabi model with a Pauli–Fierz Hamiltonian, they play a crucial role in the polaritonic dynamics since both permanent dipole moments and self-energy terms produce drastic changes on the undressed potential energy surfaces at high coupling strengths. We also gauge the effect of including rotational degrees of freedom in cavity molecular photodynamics. For diatomic molecules, the addition of rotation amounts to transform (both with classical or quantum fields) a light induced crossing into a light induced conical intersection. However, we show that conical intersections due to molecular rotation do not represent the standard properties of well-known efficient intrinsic conical intersections inasmuch they do not enhance the quantum transition rates.},

  abstract = {Dynamics of flexible molecules are often determined by an interplay between local chemical bond fluctuations and conformational changes driven by long-range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. This interplay between interactions yields complex potential-energy surfaces (PESs) with multiple minima and transition paths between them. In this work, we assess the performance of the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models, namely, sGDML, SchNet, Gaussian Approximation Potentials/Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (GAPs/SOAPs), and Behler–Parrinello neural networks, for reproducing such PESs, while using limited amounts of reference data. As a benchmark, we use the cis to trans thermal relaxation in an azobenzene molecule, where at least three different transition mechanisms should be considered. Although GAP/SOAP, SchNet, and sGDML models can globally achieve a chemical accuracy of 1 kcal mol −1 with fewer than 1000 training points, predictions greatly depend on the ML method used and on the local region of the PES being sampled. Within a given ML method, large differences can be found between predictions of close-to-equilibrium and transition regions, as well as for different transition mechanisms. We identify key challenges that the ML models face mainly due to the intrinsic limitations of commonly used atom-based descriptors. All in all, our results suggest switching from learning the entire PES within a single model to using multiple local models with optimized descriptors, training sets, and architectures for different parts of the complex PES.},

The Tkatchenko–Scheffler model is based upon correcting free-atom C 6 coefficients according to the square of the ratio of the atom-in-molecule volume to the free-atom volume.

Therefore, these methods can be improved significantly from a computational standpoint if the relative importance of each configuration in the ground and excited states of molecular/model systems can be learned using machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). We have used neural networks to train the configuration interaction coefficients obtained from full configuration interaction and Monte Carlo configuration interaction methods and have tested different input descriptors and outputs to find the more efficient training techniques. These ANNs have been used to calculate the ground states of one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg spin chains along with Heisenberg ladder systems, which are good approximations of polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

We formulate a method with O ( N ⁡ log ⁡ N ) scaling for electrolytes between charged planar interfaces with asymmetric dielectric contrasts. Our approach, which builds on earlier work, is based on combining image charges with the particle–particle particle–mesh algorithm and representing uniform surface charges via an electric field. This enables simulations of complex dielectric interactions that outperform most alternative methods in speed and accuracy. To make the method practically useful, we provide guidelines—based upon careful tests—for choosing optimal simulation parameters. Explicit expressions for the electrostatic forces are given to facilitate the implementation of our algorithm in standard molecular dynamics packages.},

  abstract = {A precise understanding of mechanisms governing the dynamics of electrons in atoms and molecules subjected to intense laser fields has a key importance for the description of attosecond processes such as the high-harmonic generation and ionization. From the theoretical point of view, this is still a challenging task, as new approaches to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with both good accuracy and efficiency are still emerging. Until recently, the purely numerical methods of real-time propagation of the wavefunction using finite grids have been frequently and successfully used to capture the electron dynamics in small one- or two-electron systems. However, as the main focus of attoscience shifts toward many-electron systems, such techniques are no longer effective and need to be replaced by more approximate but computationally efficient ones. In this paper, we explore the increasingly popular method of expanding the wavefunction of the examined system into a linear combination of atomic orbitals and present a novel systematic scheme for constructing an optimal Gaussian basis set suitable for the description of excited and continuum atomic or molecular states. We analyze the performance of the proposed basis sets by carrying out a series of time-dependent configuration interaction calculations for the hydrogen atom in fields of intensity varying from 5 × 10 13 W/cm 2 to 5 × 10 14 W/cm 2 . We also compare the results with the data obtained using Gaussian basis sets proposed previously by other authors.},

Despite several experimental and theoretical efforts performed in order to clarify the complex dynamics characterizing this stage, a complete understanding of this mechanism is still far to be reached. In this study, non-adiabatic excited-state molecular dynamic simulations have been performed to model the non-radiative process within the Q-bands for a model system of chlorophylls. This system has been considered in the gas phase and then, to have a more representative picture of the environment, with implicit and mixed implicit–explicit solvation models. In the first part of this analysis, absorption spectra have been simulated for each model in order to guide the setup for the non-adiabatic excited-state molecular dynamic simulations. Then, non-adiabatic excited-state molecular dynamic simulations have been performed on a large set of independent trajectories and the population of the Q x and Q y states has been computed as the average of all the trajectories, estimating the rate constant for the process. Finally, with the aim of investigating the possible role played by the solvent in the Q x –Q y crossing mechanism, an essential dynamic analysis has been performed on the generated data, allowing one to find the most important motions during the simulated dynamics.},

In particular, the latter possibility has spurred the development of advanced theoretical techniques that can accurately capture both quantum optical and quantum chemical degrees of freedom. These methods are, however, computationally very demanding, which limits their application range. Here, we demonstrate that the optical spectra of nanoparticle-molecule assemblies, including strong coupling effects, can be predicted with good accuracy using a subsystem approach, in which the response functions of different units are coupled only at the dipolar level. We demonstrate this approach by comparison with previous time-dependent density functional theory calculations for fully coupled systems of Al nanoparticles and benzene molecules. While the present study only considers few-particle systems, the approach can be readily extended to much larger systems and to include explicit optical-cavity modes.},

  abstract = {Quantum–classical dynamics simulations enable the study of nonequilibrium heat transport in realistic models of molecules coupled to thermal baths. In these simulations, the initial conditions of the bath degrees of freedom are typically sampled from classical distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects of sampling the initial conditions of the thermal baths from quantum and classical distributions on the steady-state heat current in the nonequilibrium spin-boson model—a prototypical model of a single-molecule junction—in different parameter regimes. For a broad range of parameter regimes considered, we find that the steady-state heat currents are ∼1.3–4.5 times larger with the classical bath sampling than with the quantum bath sampling. Using both types of sampling, the steady-state heat currents exhibit turnovers as a function of the bath reorganization energy, with sharper turnovers in the classical case than in the quantum case and different temperature dependencies of the turnover maxima. As the temperature gap between the hot and cold baths increases, we observe an increasing difference in the steady-state heat currents obtained with the classical and quantum bath sampling. In general, as the bath temperatures are increased, the differences between the results of the classical and quantum bath sampling decrease but remain non-negligible at the high bath temperatures. The differences are attributed to the more pronounced temperature dependence of the classical distribution compared to the quantum one. Moreover, we find that the steady-state fluctuation theorem only holds for this model in the Markovian regime when quantum bath sampling is used. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of quantum bath sampling in quantum–classical dynamics simulations of quantum heat transport.},

The proposed method adopts thermodynamic integration with respect to a coupling parameter specifying a path from well-defined non-interacting species to the fully interacting ones. The atomistic interactions are described by a machine-learned inter-atomic potential trained on first-principles data. The free energy calculated by the machine-learned potential is further corrected by using thermodynamic perturbation theory to provide the first-principles free energy. The calculated hydration free energies indicate that only the hydroxyl group adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface attains a hydration stabilization. The observed trend is attributed to differences in the adsorption site and surface morphology.},

One is entirely based on the adoption of an accurate ab initio potential to describe water clusters of increasing dimensionality. The other one consists of a model made of a central water molecule coupled to a high-dimensional Caldeira–Leggett harmonic bath. We demonstrate the role of quantum effects in the detection of water solvation and show that the computationally cheap approach based on the Caldeira–Leggett bath is only partially effective. The main conclusion of the study is that quantum methods associated with high-level potential energy surfaces are necessary to correctly study solvation features, while simplified models, even if attractive owing to their reduced computational cost, can provide some useful insights but are not able to come up with a comprehensive description of the solvation phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (PZ-SIC) improves the performance of density functional approximations for the properties that involve significant self-interaction error (SIE), as in stretched bond situations, but overcorrects for equilibrium properties where SIE is insignificant. This overcorrection is often reduced by local scaling self-interaction correction (LSIC) of the PZ-SIC to the local spin density approximation (LSDA). Here, we propose a new scaling factor to use in an LSIC-like approach that satisfies an additional important constraint: the correct coefficient of the atomic number Z in the asymptotic expansion of the exchange–correlation (xc) energy for atoms. LSIC and LSIC+ are scaled by functions of the iso-orbital indicator z σ , which distinguishes one-electron regions from many-electron regions. LSIC+ applied to the LSDA works better for many equilibrium properties than LSDA-LSIC and the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and almost close to the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta -GGA. LSDA-LSIC and LSDA-LSIC+, however, fail to predict interaction energies involving weaker bonds, in sharp contrast to their earlier successes. It is found that more than one set of localized SIC orbitals can yield a nearly degenerate energetic description of the same multiple covalent bond, suggesting that a consistent chemical interpretation of the localized orbitals requires a new way to choose their Fermi orbital descriptors. To make a locally scaled down SIC to functionals beyond the LSDA requires a gauge transformation of the functional’s energy density. The resulting SCAN-sdSIC, evaluated on SCAN-SIC total and localized orbital densities, leads to an acceptable description of many equilibrium properties including the dissociation energies of weak bonds.},

  abstract = {The generalized Kadanoff–Baym ansatz (GKBA) offers a computationally inexpensive approach to simulate out-of-equilibrium quantum systems within the framework of nonequilibrium Green’s functions. For finite systems, the limitation of neglecting initial correlations in the conventional GKBA approach has recently been overcome [Karlsson et al. , Phys. Rev. B 98 , 115148 (2018)]. However, in the context of quantum transport, the contacted nature of the initial state, i.e., a junction connected to bulk leads, requires a further extension of the GKBA approach. In this work, we lay down a GKBA scheme that includes initial correlations in a partition-free setting. In practice, this means that the equilibration of the initially correlated and contacted molecular junction can be separated from the real-time evolution. The information about the contacted initial state is included in the out-of-equilibrium calculation via explicit evaluation of the memory integral for the embedding self-energy, which can be performed without affecting the computational scaling with the simulation time and system size. We demonstrate the developed method in carbon-based molecular junctions, where we study the role of electron correlations in transient current signatures.},

As the name suggests, ENOs are members of the broad family of natural orbitals defined by Löwdin, in that they are eigenfunctions of the energy density operator. One of the major characteristics is that the (orbital) energies of all the ENOs are summed up exactly equal to the total electronic energy of a wavefunction under study. Another outstanding feature is that the population of each ENO varies as the chemical reaction proceeds, keeping the total population constant though. The study of ENOs has been driven by the need for new methods to analyze extremely complicated nonadiabatic electron wavepackets such as those embedded in highly quasi-degenerate excited-state manifolds. Yet, ENOs can be applied to scrutinize many other chemical reactions, ranging from the ordinary concerted reactions, nonadiabatic reactions, and Woodward–Hoffman forbidden reactions, to excited-state reactions. We here present the properties of ENOs and a couple of case studies of numerical realization, one of which is about the mechanism of nonadiabatic electron transfer.},

Since molecular dynamics simulations use Langevin dynamics rather than overdamped Langevin dynamics, this severely impedes the application of path reweighting methods. Here, we derive the path probability ratio M L for Langevin dynamics propagated by a variant of the Langevin Leapfrog integrator. This new path probability ratio allows for exact reweighting of Langevin dynamics propagated by this integrator. We also show that a previously derived approximate path probability ratio M approx differs from the exact M L only by O ( ξ 4 Δ t 4 ) and thus yields highly accurate dynamic reweighting results. (Δ t is the integration time step, and ξ is the collision rate.) The results are tested, and the efficiency of path reweighting is explored using butane as an example.},

We show, by considering regular configurations and slightly distorted geometries, that the breaking of geometric symmetry can lead to an enhancement of the magnetosensitivity of these structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of effects at low-field that are abolished in the highly symmetric case. This could be important to the understanding of the behavior of radicals in biological environments in the presence of weak magnetic fields comparable to the Earth’s, as well as the construction of high-precision quantum sensing devices.},

However, it also has a reputation for being unwieldy, computationally costly, and un-black-box. Here, we discuss a class of alternatives, complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) methods, paying particular attention to their application to electronic excited states. The goal of this Perspective is fourfold. First, we argue that CASCI is not merely an approximation to CASSCF, in that it can be designed to have important qualitative advantages over CASSCF. Second, we present several insights drawn from our experience experimenting with different schemes for computing orbitals to be employed in CASCI. Third, we argue that CASCI is well suited for application to nanomaterials. Finally, we reason that, with the rise in new low-scaling approaches for describing multireference systems, there is a greater need than ever to develop new methods for defining orbitals that provide an efficient and accurate description of both static correlation and electronic excitations in a limited active space.},

  abstract = {To provide more insight into the excitonic structure and exciton lifetimes of the wild type (WT) CP29 complex of photosystem II, we measured high-resolution (low temperature) absorption, emission, and hole burned spectra for the A2 and B3 mutants, which lack chlorophylls a 612 and b 614 (Chls), respectively. Experimental and modeling results obtained for the WT CP29 and A2/B3 mutants provide new insight on the mutation-induced changes at the molecular level and shed more light on energy transfer dynamics. Simulations of the A2 and B3 optical spectra, using the second-order non-Markovian theory, and comparison with improved fits of WT CP29 optical spectra provide more insight into their excitonic structure, mutation induced changes, and frequency-dependent distributions of exciton lifetimes (T 1 ). A new Hamiltonian obtained for WT CP29 reveals that deletion of Chls a 612 or b 614 induces changes in the site energies of all remaining Chls. Hamiltonians obtained for A2 and B3 mutants are discussed in the context of the energy landscape of chlorophylls, excitonic structure, and transfer kinetics. Our data suggest that the lowest exciton states in A2 and B3 mutants are contributed by a 611(57\%), a 610(17\%), a 615(15\%) and a 615(58\%), a 611(20\%), a 612(15\%) Chls, respectively, although other compositions of lowest energy states are also discussed. Finally, we argue that the calculated exciton decay times are consistent with both the hole-burning and recent transient absorption measurements. Wavelength-dependent T 1 distributions offer more insight into the interpretation of kinetic traces commonly described by discrete exponentials in global analysis/global fitting of transient absorption experiments.},

We uncover the folding process in all cases; all models undergo, at least, the two major structural transitions observed in nature—the coil–globule collapse and the folding transition. As the complexity of the model increases, these two major transitions begin to split into multi-step processes, wherein the lattice coarse-graining has a significant impact on the details of these processes.

  abstract = {Amino acids having basic side chains, as additives, are known to increase the stability of native-folded state of proteins, but their relative efficiency and the molecular mechanism are still controversial and obscure as well. In the present work, extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the hydration properties of aqueous solutions of concentrated arginine, histidine, and lysine and their comparative efficiency on regulating the conformational stability of the insulin monomer. We identified that in the aqueous solutions of the free amino acids, the nonuniform relaxation of amino acid–water hydrogen bonds was due to the entrapment of water molecules within the amino acid clusters formed in solutions. Insulin, when tested with these solutions, was found to show rigid conformations, relative to that in pure water. We observed that while the salt bridges formed by the lysine as an additive contributed more toward the direct interactions with insulin, the cation–π was more prominent for the insulin–arginine interactions. Importantly, it was observed that the preferentially more excluded arginine, compared to histidine and lysine from the insulin surface, enriches the hydration layer of the protein. Our study reveals that the loss of configurational entropy of insulin in arginine solution, as compared to that in pure water, is more as compared to the entropy loss in the other two amino acid solutions, which, moreover, was found to be due to the presence of motionally bound less entropic hydration water of insulin in arginine solution than in histidine or lysine solution.},

The transient signals observed with resonant pumping are dominated by vibrational relaxation of the CO internal stretch vibration with a lifetime of T 1 ∼ 3 ps in all cases. Off-resonant pumping suppresses that contribution to the signal and singles out a signal, which is attributed to heating of the metal layer as well as transient desorption of the CO molecules. Due to the small photon energy (0.2 eV) used as pump pulses, the mechanism of desorption must be thermal, in which case the desorption yield depends exclusively on the fluence of absorbed light and not its wavelength. The thin Pt layers facilitate CO desorption, despite a relatively low pump pulse fluence, as they concentrate the absorbed energy in a small volume.},

  abstract = {Investigation of ion transport through nanopores with highly overlapping electric double layers is extremely challenging. This can be attributed to the non-linear Poisson–Boltzmann equation that governs the behavior of the electrical potential distribution as well as other characteristics of ion transport. In this work, we leverage the approach of Schnitzer and Yariv [Phys. Rev. E 87 , 054301 (2013)] to reduce the complexity of the governing equation. An asymptotic solution is derived, which shows remarkable correspondence to simulations of the non-approximated equations. This new solution is leveraged to address a number of highly debated issues. We derive the equivalent of the Gouy–Chapman equation for systems with highly overlapping electric double layers. This new relationship between the surface charge density and the surface potential is then utilized to determine the power-law scaling of nanopore conductances as a function of the bulk concentrations. We derive the coefficients of transport for the case of overlapping electric double layers and compare it to the renowned uniform potential model. We show that the uniform potential model is only an approximation for the exact solution for small surface charges. The findings of this work can be leveraged to uncover additional hidden attributes of ion transport through nanopores.},

  abstract = {Binary mixtures of fully flexible linear tangent chains composed of bonded Lennard-Jones interaction sites (monomers) were studied using the molecular dynamics simulation in the NVT ensemble. Their interfacial properties were investigated in planar interfaces by direct simulation of an explicit liquid film in equilibrium with its vapor. A method for the calculation of long-range interactions in inhomogeneous fluids was implemented to take into account the potential truncation effects. Surface tension and the pressure tensor were calculated via the classical Irving–Kirkwood method; vapor pressure, orthobaric densities, density profiles, and Gibbs relative adsorption of the volatile component with respect to the heavy component were also obtained. The properties were studied as a function of the temperature, molar concentration of the heavy component, and the asymmetry of the mixture. According to the results of this work, the temperature loses influence on the surface tension, vapor pressure, and Gibbs relative adsorption curves as the molecular length of the heavy component increases. This suggests that the universal behavior observed in pure fluids of Lennard-Jones chains also holds for binary mixtures. The contribution of the long-range interactions turned out to account for about 60\%, 20\%, and 10\% of the surface tension, vapor pressure, and orthobaric density final values, respectively. This contribution was even larger at high temperatures and for large molecules. Strong enrichment of the volatile component at the interface was observed in the asymmetric mixtures. One of these mixtures even showed a barotropic effect at elevated pressures and a class III phase behavior.},

Our calculations of the SHG efficiency for strong QE-SPP coupling demonstrate orders of magnitude enhancement facilitated by the polariton gain. We further discuss time-domain numerical simulations of SHG in a square lattice comprising Ag nanopillars coupled to QEs utilizing a fully vectorial nonperturbative nonlinear hydrodynamic model for conduction electrons coupled to Maxwell–Bloch equations for QEs. The simulations support the idea of gain enhanced SHG and show orders of magnitude increase in the SHG efficiency as the QEs are tuned in resonance with the lattice plasmon mode and brought above the population inversion threshold by incoherent pumping. By varying pump frequency and tuning QEs to a localized plasmon mode, we demonstrate further enhancement of the SHG efficiency facilitated by strong local electric fields. The incident light polarization dependence of the SHG is examined and related to the symmetries of participating plasmon modes.},

  abstract = {To accelerate the conversion to more sustainable lubricants, there is a need for an improved understanding of the adsorption at the solid/liquid interface. As a first step, the density functional theory computed adsorption energies can be used to screen the ability of additives to cover a surface. Analogously to what has been found in catalysis with the universal scaling relations, we investigate here if a general universal ranking of additives can be found, independently of the surface considered. We divided our set of 25 diverse representative molecules into aprotic and protic molecules. We compared their adsorption over alumina and hematite, which are models of surface oxidized aluminum and steel, respectively. The adsorption energy ranking of our set is not strongly affected by alumina hydration. In contrast, adsorption on hematite is more strongly affected by hydration since all exposed Fe Lewis acid sites are converted into hydroxylated Brønsted basic sites. However, the ranking obtained on hydrated hematite is close to the one obtained on dry alumina, paving the road to a fast screening of additives. In our library, protic molecules are more strongly adsorbed than non-protic molecules. In particular, methyl and dimethyl phosphates are the most strongly adsorbed ones, followed by N -methyldiethanolamine, succinimide, and ethanoic acid. Additives combining these functional groups are expected to strongly adsorb at the solid/liquid interface and, therefore, likely to be relevant components of lubricant formulations.},

  abstract = {Thermophoresis or thermodiffusion has become an important tool to monitor protein–ligand binding as it is very sensitive to the nature of solute–water interactions. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying thermodiffusion in protein systems are poorly understood at this time. One reason is the difficulty to separate the effects of the protein system of interest from the effects of buffers that are added to stabilize the proteins. Due to the buffers, typical protein solutions form multicomponent mixtures with several kinds of salt. To achieve a more fundamental understanding of thermodiffusion of proteins, it is therefore necessary to investigate solutions of buffer salts. For this work, the thermodiffusion of aqueous potassium salt solutions has been studied systematically. We use thermal diffusion forced Rayleigh scattering experiments in a temperature range from 15 °C to 45 °C to investigate the thermodiffusive properties of aqueous solutions of five potassium salts: potassium chloride, potassium bromide, potassium thiocyanate, potassium acetate, and potassium carbonate in a molality range between 1 mol/kg and 5 mol/kg. We compare the thermophoretic results with those obtained for non-ionic solutes and discuss the thermophoresis of the salts in the context of ion-specific solvation according to the Hofmeister series.},

  abstract = {We investigate the fast β- and Johari–Goldstein (JG) β- relaxation processes, along with the elastic scattering response of glass-forming (GF) liquids and the boson peak, in a simulated Al–Sm GF material exhibiting a fragile–strong (FS) transition. These dynamical processes are universal in “ordinary” GF fluids and collectively describe their “fast dynamics,” and we find these relaxation processes also arise in a GF liquid exhibiting a FS transition. String-like particle motion, having both an irreversible and a reversible nature (stringlets) component, occurs in the fast-dynamics regime, corresponding to a ps timescale. String-like collective motion associated with localized unstable modes facilitates irreversible and intermittent particle “jumping” events at long times associated with the JG β -relaxation process, while stringlets associated with localized stable modes and corresponding perfectly reversible atomic motion give rise to the boson peak. To further clarify the origin of the boson peak, we calculate the density of states for both the stringlet particles and the “normal” particles and find that the stringlet particles give rise to a boson peak, while the normal atoms do not. The growth of stringlets upon heating ultimately also leads to the “softening” of these excitations, and the boson peak frequency and shear modulus drop in concert with this softening. The growth of string-like collective motion upon heating in the fast-dynamics regime is further shown to be responsible for the growth in the intensity of the fast relaxation process. Relaxation in cooled liquids clearly involves a hierarchy of relaxation processes acting on rather different timescales and spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of how the molecular structures of ionic liquids (ILs) affect their properties at electrified interfaces is key to the rational design of ILs for electric applications. Polarizable molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the structural, electrical, and dynamic properties of electric double layers (EDLs) formed by imidazolium dicyanamide ([ImX1][DCA]) at the interface with the molybdenum disulfide electrode. The effect of side chain of imidazolium on the properties of EDLs was analyzed by using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([Im21]), 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium ([Im81]), 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium ([ImB1]), and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium ([ImO1]) as cations. Using [Im21] as reference, we find that the introduction of octyl or benzyl groups significantly alters the interfacial structures near the cathode because of the reorientation of cations. For [Im81], the positive charge on the cathode induces pronounced polar and non-polar domain separation. In contrast, the hydroxyl group has a minor effect on the interfacial structures. [ImB1] is shown to deliver slightly larger capacitance than other ILs even though it has larger molecular volume than [Im21]. This is attributed to the limiting factor for capacitance being the strong association between counter-ions, instead of the free space available to ions at the interface. For [Im81], the charging mechanism is mainly the exchange between anions and octyl tails, while for the other ILs, the mechanism is mainly the exchange of counter-ions. Analysis on the charging process shows that the charging speed does not correlate strongly with macroscopic bulk dynamics like viscosity. Instead, it is dominated by local displacement and reorientation of ions.},

  abstract = {We performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to benchmark bulk liquid structures and to evaluate results from all-atom force field molecular dynamics (FFMD) simulations with the generalized Amber force field (GAFF) for organophosphorus (OP) and organochlorine (OC) compounds. Our work also addresses the current and important topic of force field validation, applied here to a set of nonaqueous organic liquids. Our approach differs from standard treatments, which validate force fields based on thermodynamic data. Utilizing radial distribution functions (RDFs), our results show that GAFF reproduces the AIMD-predicted asymmetric liquid structures moderately well for OP compounds that contain bulky alkyl groups. Among the OCs, RDFs obtained from FFMD overlap well with AIMD results, with some offsets in position and peak structuring. However, re-parameterization of GAFF for some OCs is needed to reproduce fully the liquid structures predicted by AIMD. The offsets between AIMD and FFMD peak positions suggest inconsistencies in the developed force fields, but, in general, GAFF is able to capture short-ranged and long-ranged interactions of OPs and OCs observed in AIMD. Along with the local coordination structure, we also compared enthalpies of vaporization. Overall, calculated bulk properties from FFMD compared reasonably well with experimental values, suggesting that small improvements within the FF should focus on parameters that adjust the bulk liquid structures of these compounds.},

While the normal pressure is well-defined for a planar surface, the tangential pressure at a point is not uniquely defined at the nanoscale. We report a new method that allows us to calculate the local pressure tensor and its spatial integral using an arbitrary contour definition of the “virial-route” local pressure tensor. We show that by integrating the local tangential pressure over a small region of space, roughly the range of the intermolecular forces, it is possible to define a coarse-grained tangential pressure that appears to be unique and free from ambiguities in the definition of the local pressure tensor. We support our argument by presenting the results for more than ten types of contour definitions of the local pressure tensor. By defining the coarse-grained tangential pressure, we can also find the effective thickness of the adsorbed layer and, in the case of a porous material, the statistical pore width. The coarse-grained in-layer and in-pore tangential pressures are determined for Lennard-Jones argon adsorbed in realistic carbon slit pores, providing a better understanding of the pressure enhancement for strongly wetting systems.},

  abstract = {We investigate the dependence of the diffusion coefficient of a large solute particle on the solvation structure around a solute. The diffusion coefficient of a hard-sphere system is calculated by using a perturbation theory of large-particle diffusion with radial distribution functions around the solute. To obtain the radial distribution function, some integral equation theories are examined, such as the Percus–Yevick (PY), hypernetted-chain (HNC), and modified HNC theories using a bridge function proposed by Kinoshita (MHNC) closures. In one-component solvent systems, the diffusion coefficient depends on the first-minimum value of the radial distribution function. The results of the MHNC closure are in good agreement with those of calculation using the radial distribution functions of Monte Carlo simulations since the MHNC closure very closely reproduces the radial distribution function of Monte Carlo simulations. In binary-solvent mixtures, the diffusion coefficient is affected by the larger solvent density distribution in the short-range part, particularly the height and sharpness of the first peak and the depth of the first minimum. Since the HNC closure gives the first peak that is higher and sharper than that of the MHNC closure, the calculated diffusion coefficient is smaller than the MHNC closure result. In contrast, the results of the PY closure are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of the MHNC and HNC closures.},

The results appear to scale with the number of available sites for deuteration. We have performed extensive theoretical calculations to characterize the zero-point energy corrected reaction path. Vibrationally adiabatic minimum energy paths were obtained using a combination of unrestricted quadratic configuration interaction of single and double excitations and internally contracted multireference configuration interaction calculations. The resulting barrier height, ranging from 68 meV to 89 meV, together with the various asymptotes that may be reached in the collision, was used in a classical over-the-barrier model. All competing endoergic reaction channels were taken into account using a flux reduction factor. This model reproduces all three experimental sets quite satisfactorily. In order to generate thermal rate coefficients down to 10 K, the internal excitation energy distribution of each H 3 + isotopologue is evaluated level by level using available line lists and accurate spectroscopic parameters. Tunneling is accounted for by a direct inclusion of the exact quantum tunneling probability in the evaluation of the cross section.

These measurements are then compared to simulated values derived from our proposed set using a multi-term solution of Boltzmann’s equation. We observe discrepancies between the simulation and experiment, which we attempt to address by employing a neural network model that is trained to solve the inverse swarm problem of unfolding the cross sections underpinning our experimental swarm measurements. What results from our neural network-based analysis is a refined set of electron-THFA cross sections, which we confirm is of higher consistency with our swarm measurements than that which we initially proposed. We also use our database to calculate electron transport coefficients in pure THFA across a range of reduced electric fields from 0.001 to 10 000 Td.},

Two sets of surfaces are developed, one using neural networks (NNs) with permutationally invariant polynomials (PIPs) and one with the least-squares many-body (MB) method, where a two-body part is an accurate diatomic potential and the three-body part is expressed with connected PIPs in mixed-exponential-Gaussian bond order variables (MEGs). We find, using the same dataset for both fits, that the fitting performance of the PIP-NN method is significantly better than that of the MB-PIP-MEG method, even though the MB-PIP-MEG fit uses a higher-order PIP than those used in previous MB-PIP-MEG fits of related systems (such as N 4 and N 2 O 2 ). However, the evaluation of the PIP-NN fit in trajectory calculations requires about 5 times more computer time than is required for the MB-PIP-MEG fit.},

  abstract = {The influence of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) in the structure, dynamics, and functionality of biological and artificial complex systems is the subject of intense investigation. In this broad context, particular attention has recently been focused on the ultrafast H-bond dependent dynamical properties in the electronic excited state because of their potentially dramatic consequences on the mechanism, dynamics, and efficiency of photochemical reactions and photophysical processes of crucial importance for life and technology. Excited-state H-bond dynamics generally occur on ultrafast time scales of hundreds of femtoseconds or less, making the characterization of associated mechanisms particularly challenging with conventional time-resolved techniques. Here, 2D electronic spectroscopy is exploited to shed light on this still largely unexplored dynamic mechanism. An H-bonded molecular dimer prepared by self-assembly of two boron-dipyrromethene dyes has been specifically designed and synthesized for this aim. The obtained results confirm that upon formation of H-bonds and the dimer, a new ultrafast relaxation channel is activated in the ultrafast dynamics, mediated by the vibrational motions of the hydrogen donor and acceptor groups. This relaxation channel also involves, beyond intra-molecular relaxations, an inter-molecular transfer process. This is particularly significant considering the long distance between the centers of mass of the two molecules. These findings suggest that the design of H-bonded structures is a particularly powerful tool to drive the ultrafast dynamics in complex materials.},

Here, we use the developed methodology to calculate Auger transition rates in core-ionized and core-excited benchmark systems (Ne, H 2 O, CH 4 , and CO 2 ). Comparison with the available experimental spectra shows that the proposed computational scheme provides reliable ab initio predictions of the Auger spectra. The reliability, cost efficiency, and robust computational setup of this methodology offer advantages in applications to a large variety of systems.},

  abstract = {X-ray absorption creates electron vacancies in the core shell. These highly excited states often relax by Auger decay—an autoionization process in which one valence electron fills the core hole and another valence electron is ejected into the ionization continuum. Despite the important role of Auger processes in many experimental settings, their first-principles modeling is challenging, even for small systems. The difficulty stems from the need to describe many-electron continuum (unbound) states, which cannot be tackled with standard quantum-chemistry methods. We present a novel approach to calculate Auger decay rates by combining Feshbach–Fano resonance theory with the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster single double (EOM-CCSD) framework. We use the core–valence separation scheme to define projectors into the bound (square-integrable) and unbound (continuum) subspaces of the full function space. The continuum many-body decay states are represented by products of an appropriate EOM-CCSD state and a free-electron state, described by a continuum orbital. The Auger rates are expressed in terms of reduced quantities, two-body Dyson amplitudes (objects analogous to the two-particle transition density matrix), contracted with two-electron bound-continuum integrals. Here, we consider two approximate treatments of the free electron: a plane wave and a Coulomb wave with an effective charge, which allow us to evaluate all requisite integrals analytically; however, the theory can be extended to incorporate a more sophisticated description of the continuum orbital.},

  abstract = {Charge transfer plasmons (CTPs) that occur in different topology and dimensionality arrays of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) linked by narrow molecular bridges are studied. The occurrence of CTPs in such arrays is related to the ballistic motion of electrons in thin linkers with the conductivity that is purely imaginary, in contrast to the case of conventional CTPs, where metallic NPs are linked by thick bridges with the real optical conductivity caused by carrier scattering. An original hybrid model for describing the CTPs with such linkers has been further developed. For different NP arrays, either a general analytical expression or a numerical solution has been obtained for the CTP frequencies. It has been shown that the CTP frequencies lie in the IR spectral range and depend on both the linker conductivity and the system geometry. It is found that the electron currents of plasmon oscillations correspond to minor charge displacements of only few electrons. It has been established that the interaction of the CTPs with an external electromagnetic field strongly depends on the symmetry of the electron currents in the linkers, which, in turn, are fully governed by the symmetry of the investigated system. The extended model and the analytical expressions for the CTPs frequencies have been compared with the conventional finite difference time domain simulations. It is argued that applications of this novel type of plasmon may have wide ramifications in the area of chemical sensing.},

  abstract = {Since their emergence in the 1990s, mesoscopic models of fluids have been widely used to study complex organization and transport phenomena beyond the molecular scale. Even though these models are designed based on results from physics at the meso- and macroscale, such as fluid mechanics and statistical field theory, the underlying microscopic foundation of these models is not as well defined. This paper aims to build such a systematic connection using bottom-up coarse-graining methods. From the recently developed dynamic coarse-graining scheme, we introduce a statistical inference framework of explicit many-body conservative interaction that quantitatively recapitulates the mesoscopic structure of the underlying fluid. To further consider the dissipative and fluctuation forces, we design a novel algorithm that parameterizes these forces. By utilizing this algorithm, we derive pairwise decomposable friction kernels under both non-Markovian and Markovian limits where both short- and long-time features of the coarse-grained dynamics are reproduced. Finally, through these new developments, the many-body dissipative particle dynamics type of equations of motion are successfully derived. The methodologies developed in this work thus open a new avenue for the construction of direct bottom-up mesoscopic models that naturally bridge the meso- and macroscopic physics.},

Electron spin relaxation effects arising from fluctuations in the spin Hamiltonian are straightforward to include in this approach, and their treatment can be combined with a highly efficient stochastic evaluation of the trace over nuclear spin states that is required to compute experimental observables. These features are illustrated in example applications to a flavin–tryptophan radical pair of interest in avian magnetoreception and to a problem involving spin-selective radical pair recombination along a molecular wire. In the first of these examples, the SSE is shown to be both more efficient and more widely applicable than a recent stochastic implementation of the Lindblad equation, which only provides a valid treatment of relaxation in the extreme-narrowing limit. In the second, the exact SSE results are used to assess the accuracy of a recently proposed combination of Nakajima–Zwanzig theory for the spin relaxation and Schulten–Wolynes theory for the spin dynamics, which is applicable to radical pairs with many more nuclear spins. We also analyze the efficiency of trace sampling in some detail, highlighting the particular advantages of sampling with SU ( N ) coherent states.},

The resulting correlation factor exactly imposes the cusp and is tuned by a unique parameter μ , which controls both the depth of the coulomb hole and its typical range in r 12 . The transcorrelated Hamiltonian obtained with such a new correlation factor has a straightforward analytical expression depending on the same parameter μ , and its physical contents continuously change by varying μ : One can change from a non-divergent repulsive Hamiltonian at large μ to a purely attractive one at small μ . We investigate the convergence of the ground state eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of such a new transcorrelated Hamiltonian as a function of the basis set and as a function of μ on a series of two-electron systems. We found that the convergence toward the complete basis set is much faster for quite a wide range of values of μ . We also propose a specific value of μ , which essentially reproduces the results obtained with the frozen Gaussian geminal introduced by Ten-no [Chem. Phys. Lett. 330 , 169 (2000)].},

This works well for the coarse-graining of molecules to single beads, which we demonstrate for water. We also extend the methods to systems that include coarse-grained bonded interactions and examine their convergence behavior. Finally, using the Gauss–Newton method with constraints, we derive a model for single bead methanol in implicit water, which matches the osmotic pressure of the atomistic reference.

We compared simulations using a fully explicit solvent model with a classical polarizable force field, density functional tight binding, and ab initio density functional theory, which correspond to empirical, semiempirical, and ab initio PIMD simulations, respectively. The centroid variable with respect to the proton coordination number of a water molecule was restrained to compute the gradient of the free energy, which measures the reversible work of the proton abstraction for the quantum mechanical system. The free energy curve obtained by thermodynamic integration was used to compute the p K A value based on probabilistic determination. This technique not only reproduces the p K A value of liquid D 2 O experimentally measured (14.86) but also allows for a theoretical prediction of the p K A values of liquid T 2 O and aqueous HDO and HTO, which are unknown due to their scarcity. It is also shown that the NQEs on the free energy curve can result in a downshift of 4.5 ± 0.9 p K A units in the case of liquid water, which indicates that the NQEs plays an indispensable role in the absolute determination of p K A . The results of this study can help inform further extensions into the calculation of the acidity constants of isotope substituted species with high accuracy.},

Vibronic transitions can be captured through a harmonic model generated from the normal modes of a chromophore, but it is challenging to also include the effects of specific chromophore–environment interactions within such a model. We work to overcome this limitation by combining approaches to account for both explicit environment interactions and vibronic couplings for simulating both linear and nonlinear optical spectra. We present and show results for three approaches of varying computational cost for combining ensemble sampling of chromophore–environment configurations with Franck–Condon line shapes for simulating linear spectra. We present two analogous approaches for nonlinear spectra. Simulated absorption spectra and two-dimensional electronic spectra (2DES) are presented for the Nile red chromophore in different solvent environments. Employing an average Franck–Condon or 2DES line shape appears to be a promising method for simulating linear and nonlinear spectroscopy for a chromophore in the condensed phase.},

Recent developments permitting experiments at higher frequencies (95 GHz) provide molecular orientational resolution, enabling a clearer description of the nature of the motions. In previous work, we provided simulations for the case of domain motions within proteins that are themselves slowly tumbling in a solution. In order to perform these simulations, it was found that the standard approach of solving the relevant stochastic Liouville equation using the efficient Lanczos algorithm for this case breaks down, so algorithms were employed that rely on the Arnoldi iteration. While they lead to accurate simulations, they are very time-consuming. In this work, we focus on a variant known as the rational Arnoldi algorithm. We show that this can achieve a significant reduction in computation time. The stochastic Liouville matrix, which is of very large dimension, N , is first reduced to a much smaller dimension, m , e.g., from N ∼ O (10 4 ) to m ∼ 60, that spans the relevant Krylov subspace from which the spectrum is predicted. This requires the selection of the m frequency shifts to be utilized. A method of adaptive shift choice is introduced to optimize this selection. We also find that these procedures help in optimizing the pruning procedure that greatly reduces the dimension of the initial N dimensional stochastic Liouville matrix in such subsequent computations.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models of polymers involve grouping many atoms in an all-atom (AA) representation into single sites to reduce computational effort yet retain the hierarchy of length and time scales inherent to macromolecules. Parameterization of such models is often via “bottom-up” methods, which preserve chemical specificity but suffer from artificially accelerated dynamics with respect to the AA model from which they were derived. Here, we study the combination of a bottom-up CG model with a dissipative potential as a means to obtain a chemically specific and dynamically correct model. We generate the conservative part of the force-field using the iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) method, which seeks to recover the AA structure. This is augmented with the dissipative Langevin thermostat, which introduces a single parameterizable friction factor to correct the unphysically fast dynamics of the IBI-generated force-field. We study this approach for linear polystyrene oligomer melts for three separate systems with 11, 21, and 41 monomers per chain and a mapping of one monomer per CG site. To parameterize the friction factor, target values are extracted from the AA dynamics using translational monomer diffusion, translational chain diffusion, and rotational chain motion to test the consistency of the parameterization across different modes of motion. We find that the value of the friction parameter needed to bring the CG dynamics in line with AA target values varies based on the mode of parameterization with short-time monomer translational dynamics requiring the highest values, long-time chain translational dynamics requiring the lowest values, and rotational dynamics falling in between. The friction ranges most widely for the shortest chains, and the span narrows with increasing chain length. For longer chains, a practical working value of the friction parameter may be derived from the rotational dynamics, owing to the contribution of multiple relaxation modes to chain rotation and a lack of sensitivity of the translational dynamics at these intermediate levels of friction. A study of equilibrium chain structure reveals that all chains studied are non-Gaussian. However, longer chains better approximate ideal chain dimensions than more rod-like shorter chains and thus are most closely described by a single friction parameter. We also find that the separability of the conservative and dissipative potentials is preserved.},

We verify the new formulation within the generalized Slater scheme by computing atomization energies and ionization potentials of selected molecules and comparing to those obtained by existing FLOSIC implementations in Gaussian based codes. The results show good agreement between the two formulations, with new real-space results somewhat closer to experiment on average for the systems considered. We also obtain the ionization potentials and atomization energies by scaling down the Slater statistical average of SIC potentials. The results show that scaling down the average SIC potential improves both atomization energies and ionization potentials, bringing them closer to experiment. Finally, we verify the present formulation by calculating the barrier heights of chemical reactions in the BH6 dataset, where significant improvements are obtained relative to Gaussian based FLOSIC results.},

We focus on the (orbital-optimized) pair-coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) ansatz with a linearized coupled-cluster (LCC) correction. Specifically, we scrutinize how orbital-based entanglement and correlation measures can be determined from a pCCD-tailored CC wave function. Furthermore, we employ the single-orbital entropy, the orbital-pair mutual information, and the eigenvalue spectra of the two-orbital reduced density matrices to benchmark the performance of the LCC correction for the one-dimensional Hubbard model with the periodic boundary condition as well as the N 2 and F 2 molecules against density matrix renormalization group reference calculations. Our study indicates that pCCD-LCC accurately reproduces the orbital-pair correlation patterns in the weak correlation limit and for molecules close to their equilibrium structure. Hence, we can conclude that pCCD-LCC predicts reliable wave functions in this regime.},

  abstract = {Strain in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide has led to localized states with exciting optical properties, in particular, in view of designing one photon sources. The naturally formed nanobubbles when the MoS 2 monolayer is deposited on an hBN substrate lead to a local reduction in the band gap due to strain developing in the nanobubble. The photogenerated particles are thus confined in the strain-induced potential. Using numerical diagonalization, we simulate the spectra of the confined exciton states, their oscillator strengths, and their radiative lifetimes. We show that a single state of the confined exciton is optically active, which suggests that the MoS 2 /hBN nanobubbles are a good candidate for the realization of single-photon sources. Furthermore, our calculations show that the localized exciton gains in activation energy and radiative lifetime inside the nanobubble, the latter decreasing toward the one of free excitons when the nanobubble size increases.},

  abstract = {We introduce a simple and effective method to decompose the energy dissipation in the dynamics of open quantum systems into contributions due to individual bath components. The method is based on a vibronic extension of the Förster resonance energy transfer theory that enables quantifying the energy dissipated by specific bath degrees of freedom. Its accuracy is determined by benchmarking against mixed quantum–classical simulations that reveal that the method provides a semi-quantitative frequency-dependent decomposition of the overall dissipation. The utility of the method is illustrated by using a model donor–acceptor pair interacting to a thermal harmonic bath with different coupling strengths. The method can be used to identify the key features of a bath that leads to energy dissipation as required to develop a deep understanding of the dynamics of open quantum systems and to engineer environments with desired dissipative features.},

  abstract = {In vibrational strong coupling (VSC), molecular vibrations strongly interact with the modes of an optical cavity to form hybrid light–matter states known as vibrational polaritons. Experiments show that the kinetics of thermally activated chemical reactions can be modified by VSC. Transition-state theory, which assumes that internal thermalization is fast compared to reactive transitions, has been unable to explain the observed findings. Here, we carry out kinetic simulations to understand how dissipative processes, namely, those introduced by VSC to the chemical system, affect reactions where internal thermalization and reactive transitions occur on similar timescales. Using the Marcus–Levich–Jortner type of electron transfer as a model reaction, we show that such dissipation can change reactivity by accelerating internal thermalization, thereby suppressing nonequilibrium effects that occur in the reaction outside the cavity. This phenomenon is attributed mainly to cavity decay (i.e., photon leakage), but a supporting role is played by the relaxation between polaritons and dark states. When nonequilibrium effects are already suppressed in the bare reaction (the reactive species are essentially at internal thermal equilibrium throughout the reaction), we find that reactivity does not change significantly under VSC. Connections are made between our results and experimental observations.},

The resulting functional leads to a reasonable description of the kinetic energies of atoms and molecules when it is used in combination with Hartree–Fock densities.

While the algorithms for intermediate steps in the MSM workflow such as featurization and dimensionality reduction have been specifically adapted to MD datasets, conventional clustering methods are generally applied to the discretization step. This work adds to recent efforts to develop specialized density-based clustering algorithms for the Boltzmann-weighted data from MD simulations. We introduce the volume-scaled common nearest neighbor (vs-CNN) clustering that is an adapted version of the common nearest neighbor (CNN) algorithm. A major advantage of the proposed algorithm is that the introduced density-based criterion directly links to a free-energy notion via Boltzmann inversion. Such a free-energy perspective allows a straightforward hierarchical scheme to identify conformational clusters at different levels of a generally rugged free-energy landscape of complex molecular systems.},

  abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy is a widely used technique to characterize protein structures and protein mediated processes. While the amide I band provides information on proteins’ secondary structure, amino acid side chains are used as infrared probes for the investigation of protein reactions and local properties. In this paper, we use a hybrid quantum mechanical/classical molecular dynamical approach based on the perturbed matrix method to compute the infrared band due to the C=O stretching mode of amide-containing side chains. We calculate, at first, the infrared band of zwitterionic glutamine in water and obtain results in very good agreement with the experimental data. Then, we compute the signal arising from glutamine side chains in a microcrystal of the yeast prion Sup35-derived peptide, GNNQQNY, with a fibrillar structure. The infrared bands obtained by selective isotopic labeling of the two glutamine residues, Q4 and Q5, of each peptide were experimentally used to investigate the local hydration in the fibrillar microcrystal. The experimental spectra of the two glutamine residues, which experience different hydration environments, feature different spectral signals that are well reproduced by the corresponding calculated spectra. In addition, the analysis of the simulated spectra clarifies the molecular origin of the experimentally observed spectroscopic differences that arise from the different local electric field experienced by the two glutamine residues, which is, in turn, determined by a different hydrogen bonding pattern.},

Unlike in one dimension, there is no general, exact formula for the MFPT. However, Langer’s formula, a multi-dimensional generalization of Kramers’s one-dimensional formula, provides an approximate result when the barrier to escape is large. Kramers’s and Langer’s formulas are related to one another by the potential of mean force (PMF): when calculated along a particular direction (the unstable mode at the saddle point) and substituted into Kramers’s formula, the result is Langer’s formula. We build on this result by using the PMF in the exact, one-dimensional expression for the MFPT. Our model offers better agreement with Brownian dynamics simulations than Langer’s formula, although discrepancies arise when the potential becomes less confining along the direction of escape. When the energy barrier is small our model offers significant improvements upon Langer’s theory. Finally, the optimal direction along which to evaluate the PMF no longer corresponds to the unstable mode at the saddle point.},

Configuration spaces are found in several areas of physics, particularly wherever there are energy levels that possess variable occupations. In bosonic systems, where there are no upper limits on the occupation of each level, enumeration of all possible configurations is an exceptionally hard problem. We look at the case where the levels need to be filled to satisfy an energy criterion, for example, a target excitation energy, which is a type of knapsack problem as found in combinatorics. We present analyses of the density of configuration spaces in arbitrary dimensions and how particular forms of kernel can be used to envelope the important regions. In this way, we arrive at three new algorithms for enumeration of such spaces that are several orders of magnitude more efficient than the naive brute force approach. Finally, we show how these can be applied to the particular case of internal conversion rates in a selection of molecules and discuss how a stochastic approach can, in principle, reduce the computational complexity to polynomial time.},

Of particular interest is a characterization of the time-dependent kinetic aspects of protein–protein association and dissociation. A powerful framework to characterize the dynamics of complex molecular systems is provided by Markov State Models (MSMs). The central idea is to construct a reduced stochastic model of the full system by defining a set of conformational featured microstates and determining the matrix of transition probabilities between them. While a MSM framework can sometimes be very effective, different combinations of input featurization and simulation methods can significantly affect the robustness and the quality of the information generated from MSMs in the context of protein association. Here, a systematic examination of a variety of MSMs methodologies is undertaken to clarify these issues. To circumvent the uncertainties caused by sampling issues, we use a simplified coarse-grained model of the barnase–barstar protein complex. A sensitivity analysis is proposed to identify the microstates of an MSM that contribute most to the error in conjunction with the transition-based reweighting analysis method for a more efficient and accurate MSM construction.},

A theoretical framework—termed Fluctuating Elasticity Theory (FET)—predicts low-frequency Rayleigh scattering scaling in đ spatial dimensions, Γ ( ω ) ∼ γ ω đ + 1 ⁠ , where γ = γ ( V c ) quantifies the coarse-grained spatial fluctuations of elastic moduli, involving a correlation volume V c that remains debated. Here, using extensive computer simulations, we show that Γ( ω ) ∼ γω 3 is asymptotically satisfied in two dimensions ( đ = 2 ⁠ ) once γ is interpreted in terms of ensemble—rather than spatial—averages, where V c is replaced by the system size. In doing so, we also establish that the finite-size ensemble-statistics of elastic moduli is anomalous and related to the universal ω 4 density of states of soft quasilocalized modes. These results not only strongly support FET but also constitute a strict benchmark for the statistics produced by coarse-graining approaches to the spatial distribution of elastic moduli.},

In this study, the excited state dynamics of 7-deazaguanosine and guanosine 5′-monophosphate are investigated in aqueous solution and in a mixture of methanol and water using femtosecond broadband transient absorption spectroscopy following excitation at 267 nm. The transient spectra are collected using photon densities that ensure no parasitic multiphoton-induced signal from solvated electrons. The data can be fit satisfactorily using a two- or three-component kinetic model. By analyzing the results from steady-state, time-resolved, computational calculations, and the methanol–water mixture, the following general relaxation mechanism is proposed for both molecules, L b → L a → 1 πσ * (ICT) → S 0 , where the 1 πσ * (ICT) stands for an intramolecular charge transfer excited singlet state with significant πσ * character. In general, longer lifetimes for internal conversion are obtained for 7-deazaguanosine compared to guanosine 5′-monophosphate. Internal conversion of the 1 πσ * (ICT) state to the ground state occurs on a similar time scale of a few picoseconds in both molecules. Collectively, the results demonstrate that substitution of a single nitrogen atom for a methine (C–H) group at position seven of the guanine moiety stabilizes the 1 ππ * L b and L a states and alters the topology of their potential energy surfaces in such a way that the relaxation dynamics in 7-deazaguanosine are slowed down compared to those in guanosine 5′-monophosphate but not for the internal conversion of 1 πσ * (ICT) state to the ground state.},

  abstract = {PEGylated and surface-tethered proteins are used in a variety of biotechnological applications, but traditional methods offer little control over the placement of the functionalization sites on the protein. Fortunately, recent experimental methods functionalize the protein at any location on the amino acid sequence, so the question becomes one of selecting the site that will result in the best protein function. This work shows how molecular simulation can be used to screen potential attachment sites for surface tethering or PEGylation. Previous simulation work has shown promise in this regard for a model protein, but these studies are limited to screening only a few of the surface-accessible sites or only considered surface tethering or PEGylation separately rather than their combined effects. This work is done to overcome these limitations by screening all surface-accessible functionalization sites on a protein of industrial and therapeutic importance (TEM-1) and to evaluate the effects of tethering and PEGylation simultaneously in an effort to create a more accurate screen. The results show that functionalization site effectiveness appears to be a function of super-secondary and tertiary structures rather than the primary structure, as is often currently assumed. Moreover, sites in the middle of secondary structure elements, and not only those in loops regions, are shown to be good options for functionalization—a fact not appreciated in current practice. Taken as a whole, the results show how rigorous molecular simulation can be done to identify candidate amino acids for functionalization on a protein to facilitate the rational design of protein devices.},

  abstract = {Macromolecules such as proteins conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been employed in therapeutic drug applications, and recent research has emphasized the potential of varying polymer architectures and conjugation strategies to achieve improved efficacy. In this study, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to 5 kDa PEG polymers in an array of schemes, including varied numbers of attached chains, grafting density, and nonlinear architectures. Nonlinear architectures included U-shaped PEG, Y-shaped PEG, and poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA). Buried surface area calculations and polymer volume map analyses revealed that volume exclusion behaviors of the high grafting density conjugate promoted additional protein–polymer interactions when compared to simply increasing numbers of conjugated chains uniformly across the protein surface. Investigation of nonlinear polymer architectures showed that stable polymer-lysine loop-like conformations seen in previous conjugate designs were more variable in prevalence, especially in POEGMA, which contained short oligomer PEG chains. The findings of this comprehensive study of alternate PEGylation schemes of BSA provide critical insight into molecular patterns of interaction within bioconjugates and highlight their importance in the future of controlled modification of conjugate system parameters.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel class of responsive polymer brushes, where the effective grafting density can be controlled by external stimuli. This is achieved by using end-grafted polymer chains that have an affinity to the substrate. For sufficiently strong surface interactions, a fraction of chains condenses into a near-surface layer, while the remaining ones form the outer brush. The dense layer and the more tenuous outer brush can be seen as coexisting microphases. The effective grafting density of the outer brush is controlled by the adsorption strength and can be changed reversibly and in a controlled way as a response to changes in environmental parameters. The effect is demonstrated by numerical self-consistent field calculations and analyzed by scaling arguments. Since the thickness of the denser layer is about a few monomer sizes, its capacity to form a microphase is limited by the product of the brush chain length and the grafting density. We explore the range of chain lengths and grafting densities where the effect is most pronounced. In this range, the SCF studies suggest that individual chains inside the brush show large rapid fluctuations between two states that are separated by only a small free energy barrier. The behavior of the brush as a whole, however, does not reflect these large fluctuations, and the effective grafting density varies smoothly as a function of the control parameters.},

  abstract = {A small number of associating groups incorporated onto a polymer backbone have dramatic effects on the mobility and viscoelastic response of the macromolecules in melts. These associating groups assemble, driving the formation of clusters, whose lifetime affects the properties of the polymers. Here, we probe the effects of the interaction strength on the structure and dynamics of two topologies, linear and star polymer melts, and further investigate blends of associative and non-associating polymers using molecular dynamics simulations. Polymer chains of approximately one entanglement length are described by a bead–spring model, and the associating groups are incorporated in the form of interacting beads with an interaction strength between them that is varied from 1 to 20 k B T . We find that, for all melts and blends, interaction of a few k B T between the associating groups drives cluster formation, where the size of the clusters increases with increasing interaction strength. These clusters act as physical crosslinkers, which slow the chain mobility. Blends of chains with and without associating groups macroscopically phase separate for interaction strength between the associating groups of a few k B T and above. For weakly interacting associating groups, the static structure function S ( q ) is well fit by functional form predicted by the random phase approximation where a clear deviation occurs as phase segregation takes place, providing a quantitative assessment of phase segregation.},

To this end, the free volume theory (FVT) of Lekkerkerker et al. [Europhys. Lett. 20 , 559 (1992)] is used as a basis and is extended to explicitly include the hard-sphere character of colloidal depletants into the expression for the free volume fraction. Taking the excluded volume of the depletants into account in both the system and the reservoir provides a relation between the depletant concentration in the reservoir and that in the system that accurately matches with computer simulation results of Dijkstra et al. [Phys. Rev. E 59 , 5744 (1999)]. Moreover, the phase diagrams for highly asymmetric mixtures with size ratios q ≲ 0.2 obtained by using this new approach corroborate simulation results significantly better than earlier FVT applications to binary hard-sphere mixtures. The phase diagram of a binary hard-sphere mixture with a size ratio of q = 0.4, where a binary interstitial solid solution is formed at high densities, is investigated using a numerical free volume approach. At this size ratio, the obtained phase diagram is qualitatively different from previous FVT approaches for hard-sphere and penetrable depletants but again compares well with simulation predictions.},

  abstract = {Colloidal nanocrystal gels can be assembled using a difunctional “linker” molecule to mediate bonding between nanocrystals. The conditions for gelation and the structure of the gel are controlled macroscopically by the linker concentration and microscopically by the linker’s molecular characteristics. Here, we demonstrate using a toy model for a colloid–linker mixture that linker flexibility plays a key role in determining both phase behavior and the structure of the mixture. We fix the linker length and systematically vary its bending stiffness to span the flexible, semiflexible, and rigid regimes. At fixed linker concentration, flexible-linker and rigid-linker mixtures phase separate at low colloid volume fractions, in agreement with predictions of first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory, but the semiflexible-linker mixtures do not. We correlate and attribute this qualitatively different behavior to undesirable “loop” linking motifs that are predicted to be more prevalent for linkers with end-to-end distances commensurate with the locations of chemical bonding sites on the colloids. Linker flexibility also influences the spacing between linked colloids, suggesting strategies to design gels with desired phase behavior, structure, and, by extension, structure-dependent properties.},

While proton conduction pathways with larger Y Zr ′ and smaller Al Zr ′ defects have been explored, proton pathways with Sc Zr ′ ⁠ , a defect of comparable size to the replaced ion, have not been investigated using centrality measures, periodic pathway searches, and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). Centrality measures in BaSc 0.125 Zr 0.875 O 3 highlight a trapping region by Sc Zr ′ and scattered high centrality regions on undoped planes. Connected long-range high centrality regions are found mainly in undoped planes for BaAl 0.125 Zr 0.875 O 3 and in the dopant planes for BaY 0.125 Zr 0.875 O 3 . The best long-range proton conduction periodic pathways in Al Zr ′ and Sc Zr ′ systems travel between dopant planes, while those for yttrium-doped BaZrO 3 remained on dopant planes. KMC trajectories at 1000 K show long-range proton conduction barriers of 0.86 eV, 0.52 eV, and 0.25 eV for Al Zr ′ ⁠ , Sc Zr ′ ⁠ , and Y Zr ′ systems, respectively. Long-range periodic conduction highway limiting barrier averages correlate well with the connectivity of the most central regions in each system but ignore diffusion around the dopant and through other high centrality regions. BaSc 0.125 Zr 0.875 O 3 shows an intermediate overall conduction barrier limited by trapping, which earlier experiments and simulations suggest that it can be mitigated with increased oxygen vacancy concentration.},

With this EAM potential, we also treat the Cu(111) surface of our system fully dynamically and shine a further light on not only the quality of the SCM sudden approach but also the limited effect of energy exchange with the surface. Reaction and (in)elastic scattering probability curves, as well as simulated time-of-flight spectra, show good agreement with both earlier works and experimental results, with surface reactions showing a preference for surface atoms displaced away from the incoming molecule. The good agreement with the non-static surface model also further establishes the limited effect of energy exchange on not only the reaction but also on the elastic and inelastic scattering probabilities, even though some molecular translational energy is deposited into the surface.},

  abstract = {The accurate determination of fluid viscosity based on the microscopic information of molecules is very crucial for the prediction of nanoscale flow. Despite the challenge of this problem, researchers have done a lot of meaningful work and developed several distinctive methods. However, one of the common approaches to calculate the fluid viscosity is using the Green–Kubo formula by considering all the fluid molecules in nanospace, inevitably causing the involvement of the frictional interaction between fluid and the wall into the fluid viscosity. This practice is certainly not appropriate because viscosity is essentially related only to the interactions among fluid molecules. Here, we clarify that the wall friction should be decoupled from fluid viscosity by distinguishing the frictional region and the viscous region for the accurate prediction of nanoscale flow. By comparing the fluid viscosities calculated from the Green–Kubo formula in the whole region and viscous region and the viscosity obtained from the velocity profile through the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, it is found that only the calculated viscosity in the viscous region agrees well with the viscosity from the velocity profile. To demonstrate the applicability of this clarification, the Lennard-Jones fluid and water confined between Lennard-Jones, graphene, and silica walls, even with different fluid–wall interactions, are extensively tested. This work clearly defines the viscosity of fluids at nanoscales from the inherent nature of physics, aiming at the accurate prediction of nanoscale flow from the classical continuum hydrodynamic theory.},

The atomic nitrogen is found to bind with pristine graphite at a bridge site, with a barrier of 0.88 eV for diffusing to an adjacent bridge site. Its adsorption energy at defect sites is significantly higher, while that between graphene layers is lower. The formation of N 2 via Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) and Eley–Rideal (ER) mechanisms was also investigated. In the LH pathway, the recombinative desorption of N 2 proceeds via a transition state with a relatively low barrier (0.53 eV). In addition, there is a metastable surface species, which is capable of trapping the nascent N 2 at low surface temperatures as a result of the large energy disposal into the N–N vibration. The desorbed N 2 is highly excited in both of its translational and vibrational degrees of freedom. The ER reaction is direct and fast, and it also leads to translationally and internally excited N 2 . Finally, the formation of CN from a defect site is calculated to be endoergic by 2.75 eV. These results are used to rationalize the results of recent molecular beam experiments.},

In particular, we examined the peculiar composition-dependent electronic structure of copper doped CdZnSe quantum dots. It is shown that the nature and density of electronic states involved with the emission process is a function of copper inclusion level, providing a very direct handle for controlling the spontaneous lifetimes. The spontaneous emission lifetimes are estimated by examining the ratios of emission lifetimes to absolute quantum yields and also measured directly by ultrafast luminescence upconversion experiments. We find excellent agreement between these classes of experiments. This scheme enables us to tune spontaneous emission lifetimes by three orders of magnitude from ∼15 ns to over ∼7 µ s, which is unprecedented in existing lumophores.},

Binary mixtures, when one of the components follows the random sequential adsorption (RSA) without surface diffusion and the other follows the RSAD model, display competitive adsorption in addition to cooperative phenomena. Specifically, (i) species replacement occurs over a long period of time, while the total coverage remains unchanged after a short time, (ii) the presence of the RSAD component shifts the jamming coverage to the higher values, and (iii) the maximum jamming coverage is obtained when the effective adsorption of the RSA type components is lower than the other adsorbing particles.},

  abstract = {Ni-based bimetallic materials are promising for a series of important heterogeneous catalytic reactions because of their low cost and potential high activity. In order to understand their catalytic performances in catalytic processes, it is important to know the structural properties of these bimetallic surfaces, including, in particular, how the guest metal is distributed in the nickle host at finite temperature. By using the cluster expansion model built on density-functional theory calculations, combined with Monte Carlo simulation, we study the segregation and ordering behaviors in several frequently studied Ni-based bimetallic catalysts NiX (X = Fe, Co, and Cu). We found that Ni tends to segregate to the top most layer of the surface in NiFe and NiCo, while Cu tends to segregate to the topmost layer of NiCu surfaces. NiCo and NiCu lose short-range order quickly as the temperature increases. Under low temperature, NiFe forms an ordered Ni 3 Fe structure, which, however, disappears above 550 K because of the order–disorder transition. These findings can provide important information for the understanding of the stability and activity of Ni-based bimetallic catalysts at high temperatures.},

  abstract = {Avalanche multiphoton photoluminescence (AMPL) is observed from coupled Au–Al nanoantennas under intense laser pumping, which shows more than one order of magnitude emission intensity enhancement and distinct spectral features compared with ordinary metallic photoluminescence. The experiments are conducted by altering the incident laser intensity and polarization using a home-built scanning confocal optical microscope. The results show that AMPL originates from the recombination of avalanche hot carriers that are seeded by multiphoton ionization. Notably, at the excitation stage, multiphoton ionization is shown to be assisted by the local electromagnetic field enhancement produced by coupled plasmonic modes. At the emission step, the giant AMPL intensity can be evaluated as a function of the local field environment and the thermal factor for hot carriers, in accordance with a linear relationship between the power law exponent coefficient and the emitted photon energy. The dramatic change in the spectral profile is explained by spectral linewidth broadening mechanisms. This study offers nanospectroscopic evidence of both the potential optical damages for plasmonic nanostructures and the underlying physical nature of light–matter interactions under a strong laser field; it illustrates the significance of the emerging topics of plasmonic-enhanced spectroscopy and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy.},

Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to generate mass density profiles of confined n -decane molecules. The root mean square fluctuation and mean squared displacement analyses show that the confinement suppresses n -decane molecules’ fluctuations. A self-diffusion coefficient of n -decane molecules in a 13.6 Å-diameter DWNT is the largest. However, the vibration enhancement of the n -decane molecules’ diffusion in a 27.1 Å-diameter DWNT is 207\%, more extensive than that in 13.6 Å-diameter and 10.8 Å-diameter DWNTs. The n -decane–CNT attractive interactions, extreme confinement, and surface friction affect the n -decane molecules’ diffusion in CNTs with vibration.},

We find that the clustering behavior of this system is controlled by the cross-interaction between the two types of particles. For a weak cross-attraction, the system displays a behavior that is a composite of the behavior of individual components, i.e., the two components can both form giant clusters independently and the clusters distribute evenly in the system. For a strong cross-attraction, we instead find that the resulting clusters are mixtures of both components. Between these limits, both components can form relatively pure clusters, but unlike clusters can join at their surfaces to form composite clusters. These insights should help to understand the mechanisms for clustering in experimental binary mixture systems and help tailor the properties of novel nanomaterials.},

The viscosity can be obtained in equilibrium MD simulation from the first moment of the viscuit PDF, which is shown for finite simulation lengths to give a less noisy plateau region than the Green–Kubo method. Two other formulas for the shear viscosity in terms of the viscuit and PDF analysis are also derived. A separation of the time-dependent average negative and positive viscuits extrapolated from the noise dominated region to zero time provides another route to η . The third method involves the relative number of positive and negative viscuits and their PDF standard deviations on the two sides for an equilibrium system. For the FT and finite shear rates, accurate analytic expressions for the relative number of positive to negative block average shear stresses is derived assuming a shifted Gaussian PDF, which is shown to agree well with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. A similar treatment of the positive and negative block average contributions to the viscosity is also shown to match the simulation data very well.},

  abstract = {Viscosity of organic liquids is an important physical property in applications of printing, pharmaceuticals, oil extracting, engineering, and chemical processes. Experimental measurement is a direct but time-consuming process. Accurately predicting the viscosity with a broad range of chemical diversity is still a great challenge. In this work, a protocol named Variable Force Field (VaFF) was implemented to efficiently vary the force field parameters, especially λ vdW , for the van der Waals term for the shear viscosity prediction of 75 organic liquid molecules with viscosity ranging from −9 to 0 in their nature logarithm and containing diverse chemical functional groups, such as alcoholic hydroxyl, carbonyl, and halogenated groups. Feature learning was applied for the viscosity prediction, and the selected features indicated that the hydrogen bonding interactions and the number of atoms and rings play important roles in the property of viscosity. The shear viscosity prediction of alcohols is very difficult owing to the existence of relative strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction as reflected by density functional theory binding energies. From radial and spatial distribution functions of methanol, we found that the van der Waals related parameters λ vdW are more crucial to the viscosity prediction than the rotation related parameters, λ tor . With the variable λ vdW -based all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations force field, a great improvement was observed in the viscosity prediction for alcohols. The simplicity and uniformity of VaFF make it an efficient tool for the prediction of viscosity and other related properties in the rational design of materials with the specific properties.},

  abstract = {The Soret effect in silicate melts has attracted attention in earth and material sciences, particularly in glass science and engineering, because a compositional change caused by the Soret effect modifies the material properties of silicate melts. We investigated the Soret effect in an Na 2 O–SiO 2 system, which is the most common representative of silicate melts. Our theoretical approach based on the modified Kempers model and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation was validated for 30Na 2 O–70SiO 2 (mol.\%). The sign and order of the absolute values of the calculated Soret coefficients were consistent with the experimental values. The positive Soret coefficient of SiO 2 in the SiO 2 -poor composition range was accurately predicted. Previous experimental studies have focused on SiO 2 -rich compositions, and only the negative sign, indicating SiO 2 migration to the hot side, has been observed. In the SiO 2 -poor composition range, the Q 0 structure was dominant and had four Si–O–Na bonds around an SiO 4 unit. The Si–O–Na bond had high enthalpic stability and contributed to the large negative enthalpy of SiO 2 mixing. According to our model, components with a large negative partial molar enthalpy of mixing will concentrate in the cold region. The microscopic and thermodynamic origins of the sign change in the Soret effect were determined.},

Regarding negative ion formation, we discuss the formation of fifteen fragment anions in the electron energy range of 0 eV–10 eV, where the most intense signal is assigned to the nitrogen dioxide anion NO 2 − . The other fragment anions have been assigned to form predominantly from a common temporary negative ion state close to 3 eV of the nitroimidazole moiety, while the morpholine moiety seems to act only as a spectator in the dissociative electron attachment event to nimorazole. Quantum chemical calculations have been performed to help interpreting the experimental data with thermochemical thresholds, electron affinities, and geometries of some of the neutral molecules. As far as positive ion formation is concerned, the mass spectrum at the electron energy of 70 eV shows a weakly abundant parent ion and C 5 H 10 NO + as the most abundant fragment cation. We report appearance energy (AE) measurements for six cations. For the intact nimorazole molecular cation, the AE of 8.16 ± 0.05 eV was obtained, which is near the presently calculated adiabatic ionization energy.},

Both of the reactant species are relevant in observations and models of chemistry in the interstellar medium.

This work represents one of the first studied reactions of a halogenated carbocation with a nitrile and the first exploration of CCl + with a nitrile. Reactant isotopologues are used to unambiguously assign ionic primary products from this reaction: HNCCl + and C 2 H 3 + . Branching ratios are measured, and both primary products are determined to be equally probable. Quantum chemical and statistical reaction rate theory calculations illuminate pertinent information for interpreting the reaction data, including reaction thermodynamics and a potential energy surface for the reaction, as well as rate constants and branching ratios for the observed products. In particular, the reaction products and potential energy surface stimulate questions regarding the strength and role of the nitrile functional group, which can be further explored with more reactions of this class.},

Moreover, we address the issue of controlling the total energy and the energy partition among the vibrational modes. In fact, Wigner’s energy distributions are very broad, quite at variance with quantum eigenenergies. Many molecular processes depend sharply on the available energy, so a better energy definition is important. Two approaches are introduced and tested: the first consists in constraining the total energy of each trajectory to equal the quantum eigenenergy. The second approach modifies the phase space distribution so as to reduce the deviation of the single mode energies from the correct quantum values.

  abstract = {Computational protein design has emerged as a powerful tool capable of identifying sequences compatible with pre-defined protein structures. The sequence design protocols, implemented in the Rosetta suite, have become widely used in the protein engineering community. To understand the strengths and limitations of the Rosetta design framework, we tested several design protocols on two distinct folds (SH3-1 and Ubiquitin). The sequence optimization, when started from native structures and natural sequences or polyvaline sequences, converges to sequences that are not recognized as belonging to the fold family of the target protein by standard bioinformatic tools, such as BLAST and Hmmer. The sequences generated from both starting conditions (native and polyvaline) are instead very similar to each other and recognized by Hmmer as belonging to the same “family.” This demonstrates the capability of Rosetta to converge to similar sequences, even when sampling from distinct starting conditions, but, on the other hand, shows intrinsic inaccuracy of the scoring function that drifts toward sequences that lack identifiable natural sequence signatures. To address this problem, we developed a protocol embedding Rosetta Design simulations in a genetic algorithm, in which the sequence search is biased to converge to sequences that exist in nature. This protocol allows us to obtain sequences that have recognizable natural sequence signatures and, experimentally, the designed proteins are biochemically well behaved and thermodynamically stable.},

For strongly correlated systems, more sophisticated methods are needed. Recent studies have revealed the potential of the antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) as an excellent initial reference for the strong correlation problem. While these studies improved on AGP by linear correlators, we explore some non-linear exponential Ansätze in this paper. We investigate two approaches in particular. Similar to Wahlen-Strothman et al. [Phys. Rev. B 91 , 041114(R) (2015)], we show that the similarity transformed Hamiltonian with a Hilbert-space Jastrow operator is summable to all orders and can be solved over AGP by projecting the Schrödinger equation. The second approach is based on approximating the unitary pair-hopper Ansatz recently proposed for application on a quantum computer. We report benchmark numerical calculations against the ground state of the pairing Hamiltonian for both of these approaches.},

  abstract = {The problem of resonant energy transfer (RET) between an electric dipole donor, D, and an electric dipole acceptor, A, mediated by a passive, chiral third-body, T, is considered within the framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics theory. To account for the optical activity of the mediator, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole coupling terms are included in addition to the leading electric dipole interaction term. Fourth-order diagrammatic time-dependent perturbation theory is used to obtain the matrix element. It is found that the Fermi golden rule rate depends on pure multipole moment polarizabilities and susceptibilities of T, as well as on various mixed electric and magnetic multipole moment response functions. The handedness of T manifests through mixed electric–magnetic dipole and mixed electric dipole–quadrupole polarizabilities, which affect the rate and, respectively, require the use of fourth-rank and sixth-rank Cartesian tensor averages over T, yielding non-vanishing isotropic rate formulae applicable to a chiral fluid medium. Terms of a similar order of magnitude proportional to the product of electric dipole polarizability and either magnetic dipole susceptibility or electric quadrupole polarizability of T are also computed for oriented and freely tumbling molecules. Migration rates dependent upon the product of the pure electric dipole or magnetic dipole polarizability with the mixed electric–magnetic or electric dipole–quadrupole analogs, which require fourth- and fifth-rank Cartesian tensor averaging, vanish for randomly oriented systems. Asymptotically limiting rate expressions are also evaluated. Insight is gained into RET occurring in complex media.},

The equimomentum is the probability that two electrons have the exact same momentum, whereas the antimomentum is the probability that their momenta are the exact opposite. Momentum-balance (MB) is the difference between the equimomentum and antimomentum and, therefore, indicates if equal or opposite momentum is more probable in a system of electrons. The equimomentum, antimomentum, and MB densities are also introduced, which are the local contribution to each quantity. The MB and MB density of the extrapolated-full configuration interaction wave functions of atoms of the first three rows of the periodic table are analyzed, with a particular focus on contrasting the correlated motion of electrons with opposite-spin and parallel-spin. Coulomb correlation between opposite-spin electrons leads to a higher probability of equimomentum, whereas Fermi correlation between parallel-spin electrons leads to a higher probability of antimomentum. The local contribution to MB, given an electron is present, is a minimum at the nucleus and generally increases as the distance from the nucleus increases. There are also interesting similarities between the effects of Fermi correlation and Coulomb correlation (of opposite-spin electrons) on MB.},

The quality of density functional theory prediction of molecular multipole moments thus characterizes errors in modeling the electron density itself, as well as the performance in describing molecules interacting with external electric fields. However, only the lowest non-zero moment is translationally invariant, making the higher-order moments origin-dependent. Therefore, instead of using the 3 × 3 quadrupole moment matrix, we utilize the translationally invariant 3 × 3 matrix of second cumulants (or spatial variances) of the electron density as the quantity of interest (denoted by K ⁠ ). The principal components of K are the square of the spatial extent of the electron density along each axis. A benchmark dataset of the principal components of K for 100 small molecules at the coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples at the complete basis set limit is developed, resulting in 213 independent K components. The performance of 47 popular and recent density functionals is assessed against this Var213 dataset. Several functionals, especially double hybrids, and also SCAN and SCAN0 predict reliable second cumulants, although some modern, empirically parameterized functionals yield more disappointing performance. The H, Li, and Be atoms, in particular, are challenging for nearly all methods, indicating that future functional development could benefit from the inclusion of their density information in training or testing protocols.},

Six systems are studied, and the results are compared to those obtained with no approximation to the electron repulsion integrals and to the results obtained by complete active space second-order perturbation theory.

  abstract = {Exchange–correlation (XC) functionals from Density Functional Theory (DFT) developed under the rigorous arguments of Correlated Orbital Theory (COT) address the Devil’s Triangle of prominent errors in Kohn–Sham (KS) DFT. At the foundation of this triangle lie the incorrect one-particle spectrum, the lack of integer discontinuity, and the self-interaction error. At the top level, these failures manifest themselves in incorrect charge transfer and Rydberg excitation energies, along with poor activation barriers. Accordingly, the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) XC functionals have been created to address several of the long-term issues encountered in KS theory and its Time Dependent DFT (TDDFT) variant for electronic excitations. Recognizing that COT starts with a correct one-particle spectrum, a condition imposed on the QTP functionals by means of minimum parameterization, the question that arises is how does this affect the electronically excited states? Among up to 28 XC functionals considered, the QTP family provides one of the smallest mean absolute deviations for charge-transfer excitations while also showing excellent results for Rydberg states. However, there is some room for improvement in the case of excitation energies to valence states, which are systematically underestimated by all functionals investigated. An alternative path for better treatment of excitation energies, mainly for valence states, is offered by using orbital energies from QTP functionals, especially by CAM-QTP-02 and LC-QTP. In this case, the deviations from the reference data can be reduced approximately by half.},

Given the interpolative nature of these models, the reliability of predictions depends on the position in phase space, and it is crucial to obtain an estimate of the error that derives from the finite number of reference structures included during model training. When using a machine-learning potential to sample a finite-temperature ensemble, the uncertainty on individual configurations translates into an error on thermodynamic averages and leads to a loss of accuracy when the simulation enters a previously unexplored region. Here, we discuss how uncertainty quantification can be used, together with a baseline energy model, or a more robust but less accurate interatomic potential, to obtain more resilient simulations and to support active-learning strategies. Furthermore, we introduce an on-the-fly reweighing scheme that makes it possible to estimate the uncertainty in thermodynamic averages extracted from long trajectories. We present examples covering different types of structural and thermodynamic properties and systems as diverse as water and liquid gallium.},

The resulting velocity-map-image asymmetry is directly connected to the enantiomeric excess and to the absolute handedness of molecules. We demonstrated our scheme computationally for camphor (C 10 H 16 O), with its methyl groups as marker fragments, using quantum-mechanical simulations geared toward experimentally feasible conditions. Computed sensitivity to enantiomeric excess is comparable to other modern chiroptical approaches. The present method can be readily optimized for any chiral molecule with an anisotropic polarizability tensor by adjusting the polarization state and intensity profile of the laser field.},

  abstract = {Several modern technologies for energy storage and conversion are based on the screening of electric charge on the surface of porous electrodes by ions in an adjacent electrolyte. This so-called electric double layer (EDL) exhibits an intricate interplay with the electrolyte’s temperature that was the focus of several recent studies. In one of them, Janssen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119 , 166002 (2017)] experimentally determined the ratio Q rev / W el of reversible heat flowing into a supercapacitor during an isothermal charging process and the electric work applied therein. To rationalize that data, here, we determine Q rev / W el within different models of the EDL using theoretical approaches such as density functional theory (DFT) as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Applying mainly the restricted primitive model, we find quantitative support for a speculation of Janssen et al. that steric ion interactions are key to the ratio Q rev / W el ⁠ . Here, we identified the entropic contribution of certain DFT functionals, which grants direct access to the reversible heat. We further demonstrate how Q rev / W el changes when calculated in different thermodynamic ensembles and processes. We show that the experiments of Janssen et al. are explained best by a charging process at fixed bulk density or in a “semi-canonical” system. Finally, we find that Q rev / W el significantly depends on parameters such as pore and ion size, salt concentration, and valencies of the cations and anions of the electrolyte. Our findings can guide further heat production measurements and can be applied in studies on, for instance, nervous conduction, where reversible heat is a key element.},

We also inspect the structural distortions in both bulk and surfaces of γ -MoN by using the partial radial distribution function, g ( r ), of Mo–N bond lengths. Large atomic displacements are found in both cases, leading to a broad spread of Mo–N bond length values when compared to their idealized bulk values.

  abstract = {Perovskite oxides degrade at elevated temperatures while precipitating dopant-rich particles on the surface. A knowledge-based improvement of surface stability requires a fundamental and quantitative understanding of the dopant precipitation mechanism on these materials. We propose that dopant precipitation is a consequence of the variation of dopant solubility between calcination and operating conditions in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and electrolyzer cells (SOECs). To study dopant precipitation, we use 20\% (D = Ca, Sr, Ba)-doped LaMnO 3+ δ (LDM20) as a model system. We employ a defect model taking input from density functional theory calculations. The defect model considers the equilibration of LDM20 with a reservoir consisting of dopant oxide (DO), peroxide (DO 2 ), and O 2 in the gas phase. The equilibrated non-stoichiometry of the A-site and B-site as a function of temperature, T , and oxygen partial pressure, p (O 2 ), reveals three regimes for LDM20: A-site deficient (oxidizing conditions), A-site rich (atmospheric conditions), and near-stoichiometric (reducing conditions). Assuming an initial A/B non-stoichiometry, we compute the dopant precipitation boundaries in a p–T phase diagram. Our model predicts precipitation both under reducing (DO) and under highly oxidizing conditions (DO 2 ). We found precipitation under anodic, SOEC conditions to be promoted by large dopant size, while under cathodic, SOFC conditions precipitation is promoted by initial A-site excess. The main driving forces for precipitation are oxygen uptake by the condensed phase under oxidizing conditions and oxygen release assisted by B-site vacancies under reducing conditions. Possible strategies for mitigating dopant precipitation under in electrolytic and fuel cell conditions are discussed.},

It was demonstrated that only subtle changes in the molecular organization and short-range order of confined s-methoxy-PC molecules were detected. Yet, a significant deviation of the structural dynamics and depression of the glass transition temperatures, T g , was found for all confined samples with respect to the bulk material. Interestingly, these changes correlate with neither the finite size effects nor the interfacial energy but seem to vary with wettability, generally. Nevertheless, for s-methoxy-PC infiltrated into native (more hydrophilic) and modified (more hydrophobic) silica templates of the same nanochannel size ( d = 4 nm), a change in the dynamics and T g was negligible despite a significant variation in wettability. These results indicated that although wettability might be a suitable variable to predict alteration of the structural dynamics and depression of the glass transition temperature, other factors, i.e., surface roughness and the density packing, might also have a strong contribution to the observed confinement effects.},

  abstract = {The properties of water vary dramatically with temperature and density. This can be exploited to control its effectiveness as a solvent. Thus, supercritical water is of keen interest as solvent in many extraction processes. The low solubility of salts in lower density supercritical water has even been suggested as a means of desalination. The high temperatures and pressures required to reach supercritical conditions can present experimental challenges during collection of required physical property and phase equilibria data, especially in salt-containing systems. Molecular simulations have the potential to be a valuable tool for examining the behavior of solvated ions at these high temperatures and pressures. However, the accuracy of classical force fields under these conditions is unclear. We have, therefore, undertaken a parametric study of NaCl in water, comparing several salt and water models at 200 bar–600 bar and 450 K–750 K for a range of salt concentrations. We report a comparison of structural properties including ion aggregation, hydrogen bonding, density, and static dielectric constants. All of the force fields qualitatively reproduce the trends in the liquid phase density. An increase in ion aggregation with decreasing density holds true for all of the force fields. The propensity to aggregate is primarily determined by the salt force field rather than the water force field. This coincides with a decrease in the water static dielectric constant and reduced charge screening. While a decrease in the static dielectric constant with increasing NaCl concentration is consistent across all model combinations, the salt force fields that exhibit more ionic aggregation yield a slightly smaller dielectric decrement.},

  abstract = {In this work, the automated fragmentation quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (AF-QM/MM) approach was applied to calculate the 13 C and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts in molecular crystals. Two benchmark sets of molecular crystals were selected to calculate the NMR chemical shifts. Systematic investigation was conducted to examine the convergence of AF-QM/MM calculations and the impact of various density functionals with different basis sets on the NMR chemical shift prediction. The result demonstrates that the calculated NMR chemical shifts are close to convergence when the distance threshold for the QM region is larger than 3.5 Å. For 13 C chemical shift calculations, the mPW1PW91 functional is the best density functional among the functionals chosen in this study (namely, B3LYP, B3PW91, M06-2X, M06-L, mPW1PW91, OB98, and OPBE), while the OB98 functional is more suitable for the 1 H NMR chemical shift prediction of molecular crystals. Moreover, with the B3LYP functional, at least a triple-ζ basis set should be utilized to accurately reproduce the experimental 13 C and 1 H chemical shifts. The employment of diffuse basis functions will further improve the accuracy for 13 C chemical shift calculations, but not for the 1 H chemical shift prediction. We further proposed a fragmentation scheme of dividing the central molecule into smaller fragments. By comparing with the results of the fragmentation scheme using the entire central molecule as the core region, the AF-QM/MM calculations with the fragmented central molecule can not only achieve accurate results but also reduce the computational cost. Therefore, the AF-QM/MM approach is capable of predicting the 13 C and 1 H NMR chemical shifts for molecular crystals accurately and effectively, and could be utilized for dealing with more complex periodic systems such as macromolecular polymers and biomacromolecules. The AF-QM/MM program for molecular crystals is available at https://github.com/shiman1995/NMR .},

  abstract = {The dynamics of a vibrational frequency in a condensed phase environment, i.e., the spectral diffusion, has attracted considerable interest over the last two decades. A significant impetus has been the development of two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) photon-echo spectroscopy that represents a direct experimental probe of spectral diffusion, as measured by the frequency–frequency time correlation function (FFCF). In isotopically dilute water, which is perhaps the most thoroughly studied system, the standard interpretation of the longest timescale observed in the FFCF is that it is associated with hydrogen-bond exchange dynamics. Here, we investigate this connection by detailed analysis of both the spectral diffusion timescales and their associated activation energies. The latter are obtained from the recently developed fluctuation theory for the dynamics approach. The results show that the longest timescale of spectral diffusion obtained by the typical analysis used cannot be directly associated with hydrogen-bond exchanges. The hydrogen-bond exchange time does appear in the decay of the water FFCF, but only as an additional, small-amplitude (&lt;3\%) timescale. The dominant contribution to the long-time spectral diffusion dynamics is considerably shorter than the hydrogen-bond exchange time and exhibits a significantly smaller activation energy. It thus arises from hydrogen-bond rearrangements, which occur in between successful hydrogen-bond partner exchanges, and particularly from hydrogen bonds that transiently break before returning to the same acceptor.},

The quantum flux density j ̲ is related to the probability density ρ via the continuity equation, and j ̃ ̲ may as well be used to define a density ρ ̃ that fulfills a continuity equation. Employing a model for the coupled dynamics of an electron and a proton, we document the properties of the densities and flux densities. It is shown that although the mean momentum derived from the two quantities is identical, the various functions exhibit a very different coordinate and time-dependence.

Complexes are mass-selected using a time-of-flight spectrometer and studied with infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy, measuring the respective mass channels corresponding to the elimination of the rare gas “tag” atom. Spectral patterns and theory indicate that the structures of the ions with a single rare gas atom have this bound to the cobalt cation opposite the water moiety in a near-C 2v arrangement. The O–H stretch vibrations of the complex are shifted compared to those of water because of the metal cation charge-transfer interaction; these frequencies also vary systematically with the rare gas atom attached. The efficiencies of photodissociation also vary with the rare gas atoms because of their widely different binding energies to the cobalt cation. The spectrum of the argon complex could only be measured when at least three argon atoms were attached. In the case of the helium complex, the low binding energy allows the spectra to be measured for the low-frequency H–O–H scissors bending mode and for the O–D stretches of the deuterated analog. The partially resolved rotational structure for the antisymmetric O–H and O–D stretches reveals the temperature of these complexes (6 K) and establishes the electronic ground state. The helium complex has the same 3 B 1 ground state as the tag-free complex studied previously by Metz and co-workers [“Dissociation energy and electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of Co + (H 2 O) and its isotopomers,” J.

  abstract = {Nonadiabatic phenomena are investigated in the rovibrational motion of molecules confined in an infrared cavity. Conical intersections (CIs) between vibrational polaritons, similar to CIs between electronic polaritonic surfaces, are found. The spectral, topological, and dynamic properties of the vibrational polaritons show clear fingerprints of nonadiabatic couplings between molecular vibration, rotation, and the cavity photonic mode. Furthermore, it is found that for the investigated system, composed of two rovibrating HCl molecules and the cavity mode, breaking the molecular permutational symmetry, by changing 35 Cl to 37 Cl in one of the HCl molecules, the polaritonic surfaces, nonadiabatic couplings, and related spectral, topological, and dynamic properties can deviate substantially. This implies that the natural occurrence of different molecular isotopologues needs to be considered when modeling realistic polaritonic systems.},

  abstract = {A new spin-averaged potential energy surface (PES) for non-reactive O 2 ( ⁠ Σ g − 3 ⁠ ) + O 2 ( ⁠ Σ g − 3 ⁠ ) collisions is presented. The potential is formulated analytically according to the nature of the principal interaction components, with the main van der Waals contribution described through the improved Lennard-Jones model. All the parameters involved in the formulation, having a physical meaning, have been modulated in restricted variation ranges, exploiting a combined analysis of experimental and ab initio reference data. The new PES is shown to be able to reproduce a wealth of different physical properties, ranging from the second virial coefficients to transport properties (shear viscosity and thermal conductivity) and rate coefficients for inelastic scattering collisions. Rate coefficients for the vibrational inelastic processes of O 2 , including both vibration-to-vibration (V–V) and vibration-to-translation/rotation (V–T/R) energy exchanges, were then calculated on this PES using a mixed quantum–classical method. The effective formulation of the potential and its combination with an efficient, yet accurate, nuclear dynamics treatment allowed for the determination of a large database of V–V and V–T/R energy transfer rate coefficients in a wide temperature range.},

  abstract = {Polyaluminum cations, such as the M Al 12 Keggin, undergo atomic substitutions at the heteroatom site ( M ), where nanoclusters with M = Al 3+ , Ga 3+ , and Ge 4+ have been experimentally studied. The identity of the heteroatom M has been shown to influence the structural and electronic properties of the nanocluster and the kinetics of ligand exchange reactions. To date, only three ε-analogs have been identified, and there is a need for a predictive model to guide experiment to the discovery of new M Al 12 species. Here, we present a density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamics approach to predicting favorable heteroatom substitution reactions, alongside structural analyses on hypothetical ε- M Al 12 nanocluster models. We delineate trends in energetics and geometry based on heteroatom cation properties, finding that Al 3+ –O bond lengths are related to heteroatom cation size, charge, and speciation. Our analyses also enable us to identify potentially isolable new ε- M Al 12 species, such as FeAl 12 7+ . Based upon these results, we evaluated the Al 3+ /Zn 2+ /Cr 3+ system and determined that substitution of Cr 3+ is unfavorable in the heteroatom site but is preferred for Zn 2+ , in agreement with the experimental structures. Complimentary experimental studies resulted in the isolation of Cr 3+ -substituted δ-Keggin species where Cr 3+ substitution occurs only in the octahedral positions. The isolated structures Na[AlO 4 Al 9.6 Cr 2.4 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12 ](2,6 -NDS ) 4 (H 2 O) 22 ( δ-Cr n Al 13-n -1 ) and Na[AlO 4 Al 9.5 Cr 2.5 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12 ](2,7 -NDS ) 4 (H 2 O) 18.5 ( δ-Cr n Al 13-n -2 ) are the first pieces of evidence of mixed Al 3+ /Cr 3+ Keggin-type nanoclusters that prefer substitution at the octahedral sites. The δ-Cr n Al 13-n -2 structure also exhibits a unique placement of the bound Na + cation, which may indicate that Cr 3+ substitution can alter the surface reactivity of Keggin-type species.},

Profiting from the synergy between accurate calculations and symmetry information from depolarized Raman spectra, we reassign eight literature IR bands up to 4000 cm −1 . Experimental detection of highly excited torsional states ( ν 9 ) of trans -HCOOH, such as 4 ν 9 and ν 6 + 2 ν 9 , reveals substantial involvement of the C–O stretch ν 6 into the O–H bend/torsion resonance ν 5 /2 ν 9 , which is part of a larger resonance polyad. Depolarization and isotopic C-D substitution experiments further elucidate the nature of Raman peaks in the vicinity of the O–H stretching fundamental ( ν 1 ), which seem to be members of a large set of interacting states that can be identified and described with a polyad quantum number and that gain intensity via resonance mixing with ν 1 .},

In particular, this linker was reported to have promising photophysical properties under physiological conditions, which motivated our work at the quantum mechanical level. Cis – trans isomerization is triggered by photon absorption at wavelengths ranging 300 nm–400 nm, promoting the rotor to the first excited state, and it is mediated by an energy-accessible conical intersection from which the ground state is reached back. The interconversion between the resulting unstable isomer and its stable form occurs at physiological conditions in the ground state and is thermally activated. Here, we compare three theoretical frameworks, generally used in the quantum description of medium-size chemical systems: Linear-Response Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (LR-TDDFT), Spin-Flip TDDFT (SF-TDDFT), and multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory on state-averaged complete active space self consistent field wavefunctions (MS-CASPT2//SA-CASSCF). In particular, we show the importance of resorting to a multireference approach to study the rotational cycle of light-driven molecular motors due to the occurrence of geometries described by several configurations. We also assess the accuracy and computational cost of the SF-TDDFT method when compared to MS-CASPT2 and LR-TDDFT.},

We show, both analytically and numerically, that the phaseless constraint at FT is fundamentally different from its zero-temperature counterpart (i.e., ph-ZT-AFQMC), and generally, one should not expect ph-FT-AFQMC to agree with ph-ZT-AFQMC in the low-temperature limit. With an efficient implementation, we are able to compare exchange-correlation energies to the existing results in the thermodynamic limit and find that the existing parameterizations are highly accurate. In particular, we found that ph-FT-AFQMC exchange-correlation energies are in better agreement with a known parameterization than is restricted path-integral MC in the regime of Θ ≤ 0.5 and r s ≤ 2, which highlights the strength of ph-FT-AFQMC.},

  abstract = {Molecular-orbital-based machine learning (MOB-ML) provides a general framework for the prediction of accurate correlation energies at the cost of obtaining molecular orbitals. The application of Nesbet’s theorem makes it possible to recast a typical extrapolation task, training on correlation energies for small molecules and predicting correlation energies for large molecules, into an interpolation task based on the properties of orbital pairs. We demonstrate the importance of preserving physical constraints, including invariance conditions and size consistency, when generating the input for the machine learning model. Numerical improvements are demonstrated for different datasets covering total and relative energies for thermally accessible organic and transition-metal containing molecules, non-covalent interactions, and transition-state energies. MOB-ML requires training data from only 1\% of the QM7b-T dataset (i.e., only 70 organic molecules with seven and fewer heavy atoms) to predict the total energy of the remaining 99\% of this dataset with sub-kcal/mol accuracy. This MOB-ML model is significantly more accurate than other methods when transferred to a dataset comprising of 13 heavy atom molecules, exhibiting no loss of accuracy on a size intensive (i.e., per-electron) basis. It is shown that MOB-ML also works well for extrapolating to transition-state structures, predicting the barrier region for malonaldehyde intramolecular proton-transfer to within 0.35 kcal/mol when only trained on reactant/product-like structures. Finally, the use of the Gaussian process variance enables an active learning strategy for extending the MOB-ML model to new regions of chemical space with minimal effort. We demonstrate this active learning strategy by extending a QM7b-T model to describe non-covalent interactions in the protein backbone–backbone interaction dataset to an accuracy of 0.28 kcal/mol.},

In this study, we use various implicit and explicit solvation models, such as molecular dynamics coupled with non-polarizable and polarizable force fields, as well as Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics, to model the absorption and fluorescence spectra of indole in aqueous solution. The excited states are computed using the equation of motion coupled cluster with single and double excitations combined with the effective fragment potential to represent water molecules, which we found to be a computationally efficient approach for modeling large solute–solvent clusters at a high level of quantum theory. We find that modeling mutual polarization, compared to other solvation effects, is a dominating factor for accurately reproducing the position of the peaks and spectral line shape of the absorption spectrum of indole in solution. We present an in-depth analysis of the influence that different solvation models have on the electronic excited states responsible for the features of the absorption spectra. Modeling fluorescence is more challenging since it is hard to reproduce even the correct emitting state, and force field parameters need to be re-evaluated.},

To this end, the unaltered r 2 SCAN functional is combined with a tailor-made triple- ζ Gaussian atomic orbital basis set as well as with refitted D4 and geometrical counter-poise corrections for London-dispersion and basis set superposition error. The performance of the new method is evaluated for the GMTKN55 database covering large parts of chemical space with about 1500 data points, as well as additional benchmarks for non-covalent interactions, organometallic reactions, and lattice energies of organic molecules and ices, as well as for the adsorption on polar salt and non-polar coinage-metal surfaces. These comprehensive tests reveal a spectacular performance and robustness of r 2 SCAN-3c: It by far surpasses its predecessor B97-3c at only twice the cost and provides one of the best results of all semi-local density-functional theory (DFT)/QZ methods ever tested for the GMTKN55 database at one-tenth of the cost. Specifically, for reaction and conformational energies as well as non-covalent interactions, it outperforms prominent hybrid-DFT/QZ approaches at two to three orders of magnitude lower cost. Perhaps, the most relevant remaining issue of r 2 SCAN-3c is self-interaction error (SIE), owing to its mGGA nature. However, SIE is slightly reduced compared to other (m)GGAs, as is demonstrated in two examples. After all, this remarkably efficient and robust method is chosen as our new group default, replacing previous composite DFT and partially even expensive high-level methods in most standard applications for systems with up to several hundreds of atoms.},

The proposed approach has been tested on cycloalkanes and other molecules of general interest to study the numerical results, as well as the speed-ups achieved by PNOF7-RI when compared with PNOF7.},

  abstract = {We present a two-level iterative solver for linear response time-dependent density functional theory by combining two forms of the Casida equation in the Kohn–Sham orbital representation and in Hutter’s formulation. This two-level iterative solver has been implemented with the plane wave pseudopotential method for excited-state simulations of molecular and low-dimensional solid materials. Numerical studies with the Davidson algorithm demonstrate that this two-level iterative solver yields excited-state properties for molecules (benzene C 6 H 6 and fullerene C 60 ) and low-dimensional semiconductors [two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide MoS 2 monolayer and rutile titanium dioxide TiO 2 (110) surface] with significantly reduced computational cost and storage requirement compared with standard iterative algorithms. We apply our approach to investigate the photoinduced charge separation of methanol molecules adsorption on the rutile TiO 2 (110) surface from the exciton perspective and validate that the photogenerated hole can be captured by methanol molecules.},

  abstract = {Significant improvements of the density functional theory (DFT) methodology during the past few decades have made DFT calculations a powerful tool in studies of enzymatic reaction mechanisms. For metalloenzymes, however, there are still concerns about the reliability in the DFT-results. Therefore, a systematic study is performed where the fraction of exact exchange in a hybrid DFT functional is used as a parameter. By varying this parameter, a set of different but related functionals are obtained. The various functionals are applied to one of the reactions occurring in the enzyme family heme–copper oxidases, the reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and water. The results show that, even though certain parts of the calculated energetics exhibit large variations, the qualitative pictures of the reaction mechanisms are quite stable. Furthermore, it is found that the functional with 15\% exact exchange (B3LYP * ) gives the best agreement with experimental data for the particular reactions studied. An important aspect of the procedure used is that the computational results are carefully combined with a few more general experimental data to obtain a complete description of the entire catalytic cycle of the reactions studied.},

We report here values of mode Grüneisen parameters computed for two hydrated proteins, cytochrome c and myoglobin, which exhibit trends with mode frequency resembling those of glassy systems. We use the mode Grüneisen parameters to relate volumetric thermal expansion to previously computed values of the isothermal compressibility for several proteins. We also estimate changes in vibrational entropy resulting from the change in volume upon ligand bonding of myoglobin and the homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis (HbI). We compare estimates of the change in entropy upon ligation obtained in terms of mode Grüneisen parameters with the results of normal mode analysis for myoglobin and earlier molecular dynamics simulations of HbI. The results illustrate how small changes in average volume can yield changes in entropy that contribute to ligand binding and allostery.},

  abstract = {Binding of cell surface receptors with their extracellular ligands initiates various intracellular signaling pathways. However, our understanding of the cellular functions of these receptors is very limited due to the fact that in vivo binding between ligands and receptors has only been successfully measured in a very small number of cases. In living cells, receptors are anchored on surfaces of the plasma membrane, which undergoes thermal undulations. Moreover, it has been observed in various systems that receptors can be organized into oligomers prior to ligand binding. It is not well understood how these cellular factors play roles in regulating the dynamics of ligand–receptor interactions. Here, we tackled these problems by using a coarse-grained kinetic Monte Carlo simulation method. Using this method, we demonstrated that the membrane undulations cause a negative effect on ligand–receptor interactions. We further found that the preassembly of membrane receptors on the cell surface can not only accelerate the kinetics of ligand binding but also reduce the noises during the process. In general, our study highlights the importance of membrane environments in regulating the function of membrane receptors in cells. The simulation method can be potentially applied to specific receptor systems involved in cell signaling.},

  abstract = {The external voltage-driven polymer translocation through a conical pore (with a large opening at the entry and a small tip at the exit) is studied by using the Langevin dynamics simulation in this paper. The entire translocation process is divided into an approaching stage and a threading stage. First, the approaching stage starts from the polymer entering the large opening and ends up at a terminal monomer reaching the pore tip. In this stage, the polymer will undergo the conformation adjustment to fit the narrowed cross-sectional area of the pore, leading to three approaching modes: the non-stuck mode with a terminal monomer arriving at the pore tip smoothly, the weak-stuck mode for the polymer stuck inside the pore for a short duration with minor conformational adjustments, and the strong-stuck mode with major conformational changes and a long duration. The approaching times (the duration of the approaching stage) of the three approaching modes show different behavior as a function of the pore apex angle. Second, the threading stage describes that the polymer threads through the pore tip with a linear fashion. In this stage, an increase in the apex angle causes the reduction of the threading time (the duration of the threading stage) due to the increase in the driving force with the apex angle at the tip. Moreover, we also find that with the increase in the apex angle or the polymer length, the polymer threading dynamics will change from the quasi-equilibrium state to the non-equilibrium state.},

  abstract = {Ionic liquid (IL)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) with stable thermal properties and low electrical resistivity have been evaluated. Two candidates for the polymer component of the SPE, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and Nafion, were considered. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis and electrical resistivity tests revealed that PEGDA, in comparison to Nafion, enables the formation of uniform SPEs with lower electrical resistivity and better thermal stability within a range of 25 °C–170 °C. Therefore, PEDGA was selected for further evaluation of the IL component effect on the resulting SPE. Six IL candidates, including 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ± methanesulfonic acid (BMIM.MS ± MSA), diethylmethylammonium triflate ±bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imine (Dema.OTF±HTFSI), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ± bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imine (BMIM.TFSI ± HTFSI), were selected to test the effect of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the IL on the resulting SPE. Fourier transformation infrared spectrometer analysis revealed that the BMIM.MSA-based electrolytes have the highest tendency to absorb from the environment and keep the moisture, while Dema.OTF has the fastest curing time. The SPE candidates were further evaluated for absorption characteristics of different gasses and vapors, such as N 2 , O 2 , ethanol vapor, and diluted CO/N 2 , that were tested with the in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique. Among all six candidates, BMIM.MS showed the largest N 2 and O 2 absorption capacity from the environment. Dema.OTF + HTFSI, meanwhile, demonstrated a higher level of interactions with the ethanol vapor. In the case of CO/N 2 , QCM analysis revealed that BMIM.MS+MSA has the largest, ∼13 µ g/cm 2 , absorption capacity that is reached within 400 s of being exposed to the gas mixture.},

  abstract = {A lack of comprehensive studies of the C–C bond cleavage in organic molecules hampers the rational design of catalysts for many applications, such as in fuel cells and steam reforming technologies. Employing ethanol on Ir(100) as an example, we studied 14 C–C bond cleavages of various species involved in the ethanol oxidation reaction using density functional theory calculations and used the degree of dehydrogenation (DoDH) of the reactant species as a variable to correlate the C–C bond cleavage barrier and reaction energy. This correlation method was also applied to the dehydrogenation reactions of ethanol on various catalysts, and great insight was obtained. The results show that the C–C cleavage barrier generally decreases with DoDH, with a local minimum around 33.3\% DoDH. For reactants having more than 50\% DoDH, the C–C cleavage is more ready to take place than the dehydrogenation and can occur at room temperature. Furthermore, the O atom in the reactive species plays a critical role in lowering the C–C bond cleavage barrier. The results provide necessary inputs for kinetic studies of ethanol reactions under operando conditions, where a reaction network beyond the minimum energy pathway is needed. The results will also serve as a benchmark for future studies of the ethanol C–C cleavage on other facets of Ir catalysts or on different catalysts. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that the proposed method opens up a new and effective way of correlating catalytic activities for the C–C bond cleavage involving long-chain alkanes and alcohols.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer measurements are widely used to measure the distance between donors and acceptors in heterogeneous environments. In nanocrystal (NC)-molecule donor–acceptor systems, NC defects can participate in electronic energy transfer (EnT) in a defect-mediated EnT process. Here, we explore whether ensemble-level spectroscopy measurements can quantify the distance between the donor defect sites in the NC and acceptor molecules. We studied defect-mediated EnT between ZnO NCs and Alexa Fluor 555 (A555) because EnT occurs via emissive NC defect sites, such as oxygen vacancies. We synthesized a size series of ZnO NCs and characterized their radii, concentration, photoluminescence (PL) lifetime, and defect PL quantum yield using a combination of transmission electron microscopy, elemental analysis, and time-resolved PL spectroscopy. The ZnO defect PL decay kinetics were analyzed using the stochastic binding (SB) and restricted geometry (RG) models. Both models assume the Förster point dipole approximation, but the RG model considers the geometry of the NC donor in the presence of multiple acceptors. The RG model revealed that the emissive defect sites are separated, on average, 0.5 nm from the A555 acceptor molecules. That is, the emissive defect sites are predominantly located at or near the surface of large NCs. The SB model revealed the average number of A555 molecules per NC and the equilibrium binding constant but did not provide meaningful information regarding the defect–acceptor distance. We conclude that ensemble-level EnT measurements can reveal the spatial distribution of defect sites in NCs without the need for interrogating the sample with a microscope.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory calculations have been performed to study the reaction mechanism of N 2 thermal reduction (N 2 TR) over a single metal atom incorporated nitrogen-doped graphene. Our results reveal that the type of metal atoms and their coordination environments have a significant effect on the catalytic activity of N 2 TR. Regarding CoN 4 - and FeN 4 -embedded graphene sheets that the metal atom is fourfold coordinated, they are inactive for N 2 TR owing to the poor stability of the adsorbed H 2 and N 2 molecules. In contrast, if the monodisperse metal atom is surrounded by three N atoms, namely, CoN 3 /G and FeN 3 /G show activity toward N 2 TR, and catalytic conversion of N 2 into ammonia is achieved through the associative mechanism rather than the dissociative mechanism. Further investigations show that the synthesis of NH 3 over the two surfaces is mainly through the formation of an NHNH * intermediate; however, the detailed reaction mechanisms are sensitive to the type of metal atom introduced into N-doped graphene. Based on the calculated kinetic barriers, FeN 3 /G exhibits a better catalytic activity for N 2 TR. The superior performance of FeN 3 /G can be attributed to the fact that this surface prefers a high spin-polarized state during the whole process of N 2 TR, while the non-spin polarized state is predicted as the ground state for most of the elementary steps of N 2 -fixation over CoN 3 /G. The present study provides theoretical insights into developing graphene-based single atom catalysts with a high activity toward ammonia synthesis through N 2 TR.},

  abstract = {The thermal conductivity of model argon nanowires over a wide range of temperatures from 20 K to 70 K has been calculated using the formula obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation and independently by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The theoretical predictions for thermal conductivity take into account the effect of phonon confinement and boundary scattering. Two known theoretical approaches were used. The first approach is based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation with given boundary conditions and uses bulk acoustic phonon dispersion and neglects the phonon confinement effect. The second approach includes also the modification of acoustic phonon dispersion due to spatial confinement. In simulations, the square and circular shapes of wire with the transverse size of nanowires from 4.3 nm to 42.9 nm have been considered. It was found that MD simulation results match the theoretical predictions reasonably well. The obtained results showed that the phonon confinement effect influences the thermal conductivity of nanowires, but the dominant factor decreasing the thermal conductivity with the thickness of nanowires is boundary scattering. Moreover, the values of the interface specular parameter indicate that the specular phonon-boundary scattering prevails over diffuse phonon-boundary scattering.},

  abstract = {Despite advances of lanthanide-doped upconversion (UC) materials, the applications such as light-emitting diode and biological imaging are limited by low quantum efficiency. For this context, the understanding of unique interactions between the doped-lanthanides and the host crystals has attracted a huge amount of the researcher’s interest. In particular, it was revealed that doping lanthanide ions in a non-centrosymmetric site of host lattice is the cause of relaxation of the Laporte selection rule in the 4f–4f transition of lanthanide ions. One of the layered perovskites CsBiNb 2 O 7 is known to have non-centrosymmetric sites, which would lead to highly bright UC emission. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there has been no research on the UC comparison between host materials of CsBiNb 2 O 7 with other hosts. In this article, we present the UC intensity comparison of Yb 3+ –Er 3+ ion doped CsBiNb 2 O 7 , NaYF 4 , BaTiO 3 , and SrTiO 3 hosts (the UC in CsBiNb 2 O 7 :Er 3+ ,Yb 3+ was 2.4 times that of NaYF 4 :Er 3+ ,Yb 3+ and ∼70 times that of SrTiO 3 :Er 3+ ,Yb 3+ ). After that, we dig into UC, downshifting, and double beam system UC properties. The activator concentration was optimized by varying the doping ratio of Yb 3+ and Er 3+ , and we found out the main reason for the concentration quenching behavior in Er 3+ ion doped CsBiNb 2 O 7 is dipole–dipole interaction. In addition, the double excitation experiment indicates that the absorption ( 4 I 15/2 → 4 I 13/2 ) factor is stronger than the stimulated emission ( 4 I 13/2 → 4 I 15/2 ) factor in CsBiNb 2 O 7 under 1540 nm laser irradiation.},

Observing a crossing of isochores in the P–T diagram, we show that these water-like models have a readily accessible liquid–liquid critical point (LLCP) associated with a transition between high-density liquid (HDL) and low-density liquid (LDL) forms and determine the dependence of the critical temperature T c , pressure P c , and density ρ c on the charge-scaling factor from fits to a two-structure equation of states. The results indicate that the water-like models exhibit liquid polyamorphism in a wide range of interaction parameters. Considering elongated systems, we observe a decomposition into extended and stable HDL-like and LDL-like regions at appropriate pressures and low temperatures and analyze the respective structural and dynamical properties. We show that the diverse local order results in very different correlation times of local dynamics, while the fragility is hardly changed. The results yield insights into the origin of a dynamical crossover, which is observed when lowering the temperature along isobars and was previously interpreted in terms of a fragile-to-strong transition. Our findings imply that the effect does not involve two liquid phases with an exceptionally large difference of the fragility but rather a high temperature dependence near the LLCP results from a rapid conversion from HDL-like environments with faster dynamics to LDL-like ones with slower dynamics.},

  abstract = {The process of water evaporation, although deeply studied, does not enjoy a kinetic description that captures known physics and can be integrated with other detailed processes such as drying of catalytic membranes embedded in vapor-fed devices and chemical reactions in aerosol whose volumes are changing dynamically. In this work, we present a simple, three-step kinetic model for water evaporation that is based on theory and validated by using well-established thermodynamic models of droplet size as a function of time, temperature, and relative humidity as well as data from time-resolved measurements of evaporating droplet size. The kinetic mechanism for evaporation is a combination of two limiting processes occurring in the highly dynamic liquid–vapor interfacial region: direct first order desorption of a single water molecule and desorption resulting from a local fluctuation, described using third order kinetics. The model reproduces data over a range of relative humidities and temperatures only if the interface that separates bulk water from gas phase water has a finite width, consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies. The influence of droplet cooling during rapid evaporation on the kinetics is discussed; discrepancies between the various models point to the need for additional experimental data to identify their origin.},

Density functional theory calculations on selected sizes are used to understand the argon affinity of the clusters, which differ depending on the transition metal dopant. The analysis is focused on two pairs of consecutive sizes: Al 6,7 V 2 + and Al 4,5 Rh 2 + , the largest of each pair showing a low affinity toward Ar. Another remarkable observation is a pronounced drop in reactivity at n = 14, independent of the dopant element. Analysis of the cluster orbitals shows that this feature is not a consequence of cage formation but is electronic in nature. The mass spectra demonstrate a high similarity between the size-dependent reactivity of the clusters with Ar and H 2 . Orbital interactions provide an intuitive link between the two and further establish the importance of precursor states in the reactions of the clusters with hydrogen.},

In current modeling studies, this cation is considered to be one of the possible cooling sources under early universe conditions after the recombination era and has recently been found to exist in the interstellar medium. The results from the present calculations are able to show the large efficiency of the state-changing channels involving rotational states of this cation.

Therefore, a theoretical study was carried out to elucidate the properties of the unknown DPP homopolymer. Calculations were done with density functional theory and with the complete active space self-consistent field method plus n-electron valence state perturbation theory for the dynamic correlation. Poly-DPP is predicted to have radical character and an extremely wide low-lying conduction band. If it were possible to produce this material, it should have unprecedented n -type conductivity and might be a synthetic metal.

  abstract = {The conformational structures of heterocyclic compounds are of considerable interest to chemists and biochemists as they are often the constituents of natural products. Among saturated four-membered heterocycles, the conformational structure of oxetane is known to be slightly puckered in equilibrium because of a low interconversion barrier in its ring-puckering potential, unlike cyclobutane and thietane. We measured the one-photon vacuum ultraviolet mass-analyzed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) and two-photon IR+VUV-MATI spectra of oxetane for the first time to determine the ring-puckering potential of the oxetane cation and hence its conformational structure in the D 0 (ground) state. Remarkably, negative anharmonicity and large amplitudes were observed for the ring-puckering vibrational mode progression in the low-frequency region of the observed MATI spectra. We were able to successfully analyze the progression in the MATI spectra through the Franck–Condon simulations, using modeled potential energy functions for the ring-puckering modes in the S 0 and D 0 states. Considering that the interconversion barrier and puckered angle for the ring-puckering potential on the S 0 state were found to be 15.5 cm −1 and 14°, respectively, the cationic structure is expected to be planar with C 2v symmetry. Our results revealed that the removal of an electron from the nonbonding orbitals on the oxygen atom in oxetane induced the straightening of the puckered ring in the cation owing to an increase in ring strain. Consequently, we conclude that this change in the conformational structure upon ionization generated the ring-puckering vibrational mode progression in the MATI spectra.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus is of particular interest in astrochemistry because it is a biogenic element together with hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. However, the chemical evolution of such element in the interstellar medium (ISM) is still far from an accurate characterization, with the chemistry of P-bearing molecules being poorly understood. To provide a contribution in this direction, we have carried out an accurate investigation of the potential energy surface for the reaction between the CP radical and methanimine (CH 2 NH), two species already detected in the ISM. In analogy to similar systems, i.e., CH 2 NH + X, with X = OH, CN, and CCH, this reaction can occur—from an energetic point of view—under the harsh conditions of the ISM. Furthermore, since the major products of the aforementioned reaction, namely, E - and Z -2-phosphanylidyneethan-1-imine (HN=CHCP) and N-(phosphaneylidynemethyl)methanimine (H 2 C=NCP), have not been spectroscopically characterized yet, some effort has been made for filling this gap by means of accurate computational approaches.},

The analysis of the data found no evidence for a previously reported [Iwakuni et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 117 (14), 143902 (2016)] systematic alternation in self pressure-broadened line widths with the nuclear spin state of the molecule. The present work brought out the need for the use of an accurate line profile model and careful accounting for weak background absorptions due to hot band and lower abundance isotopomer lines. The data were adequately fit using the quadratic speed-dependent Voigt profile model, neglecting the small speed-dependent shift. Parameters describing the most probable and speed-dependent pressure-broadening, most probable shift, and the line strength were determined for each line. Detailed modeling of the results of Iwakuni et al. showed that their neglect of collisional narrowing due to the speed-dependent broadening term combined with the strongly absorbing data recorded and analyzed in transmission mode were the reasons for their results.},

  abstract = {Photoionization dynamics of N , N -dimethylaniline (DMA) from highly electronically excited states in ethanol solution was investigated by means of femtosecond two-pulse two-photon excitation transient absorption (2PE-TA) spectroscopy. The first pump pulse prepares the lowest singlet excited state (S 1 state) of DMA, and the second one excites the S 1 state into higher excited states. In the case with the second pulse at 500 nm, the ionization took place via a rapid channel (&lt;100 fs) and a slow one with the time constant of ∼10 ps. The excitation wavelength effect of the second pulse indicated that a specific electronic state produced directly from higher excited states was responsible for the slow ionization. By integrating these results with the time evolution of the transient absorption spectra of the solvated electron in neat ethanol detected by the simultaneous two-photon excitation, it was revealed that the slow ionization of DMA in ethanol was regulated by the formation of the anionic species just before the completion of the solvation of the electron, leading to the solvated electron in the relaxed state. From these results, it was strongly suggested that the capture of the electron of the Rydberg-like state by the solvent or solvent cluster regulates the appearance of the cation radical.},

  abstract = {Polarizability reflects the response of the molecular charge distribution to an applied external electric field and thus closely relates to the molecular electron density. For the calculation of polarizability within density functional theory (DFT), it is well known that conventional density functional approximations (DFAs) greatly overestimate the results for polymers with long chains and the π -conjugated system. This is a manifestation of the delocalization error of the commonly used DFAs—they normally produce too delocalized electron density and underestimate the total energy for systems with fractional charge character, which occurs for long molecules in a longitudinal electric field. Thus, to achieve an accurate description of polarizabilities for polymeric molecular systems from DFT, applying DFAs with minimal delocalization error is very important. In this work, we use the recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) to the conventional DFAs, which has been shown to largely eliminate the delocalization error, to calculate and study the polarizabilities of three classic polymers, polyyne, polyacetylene, and hydrogen chain. The results from this work demonstrate that applying LOSC to conventional DFAs with self-consistent field calculations can largely improve the description of polarizability from DFT calculations and the improved quality of electron density in LOSC leads to the improved results of polarizability of the polymers. However, the improvement is not complete and adjustment of the parameters in the LOSC method can further improve the accuracy to reach the level similar to the MP2 method. This work also points to the direction for the further development of LOSC in self-consistent calculations.},

  abstract = {Structure rearrangement processes, such as isomerization, are attracting extensive interest as a potential carrier in molecular scale electronics design. UV-light-triggered isomerization of Rydberg-excited propanal with two UV photons has been investigated with time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. By following the photoionization from 3 s Rydberg states in the time domain, the ultrafast structural evolution and the corresponding photoisomerization dynamics are observed and tracked in real-time. The conversion barrier for isomerization from cis -propanal to gauche isomer is estimated to be about 1500 ± 100 cm −1 experimentally. Both the photoisomerization yield and the conversion rate have shown strong dependence on the excitation energy. It is observed that whether vibration modes are selectively excited or not, cis -to- gauche photoisomerization of propanal in 3 s Rydberg state occurs once the excitation energy is higher than the conversion barrier without any vibrational excitation specificity. This yields a powerful approach to studying structural evolution dynamics in large molecules, which may have applications in molecular devices.},

Visible (VIS) and mid-infrared (MIR) transient absorption spectroscopies were simultaneously performed to probe for electronic and vibrational changes during shock compression of TNT. Three shock pressures (16 GPa, 33 GPa, and 45 GPa) were selected to observe no reaction, incipient reaction, and strongly developed reactions for TNT within the experimental time scale of &lt;250 ps. Negligible absorption changes in MIR or VIS absorptions were observed at 16 GPa. At 33 GPa, MIR absorptions in the 3000 cm −1 –4000 cm −1 range were observed to increase during the shock and continue to increase during the rarefaction, in contrast to the VIS absorption measurements, which increased during the shock and almost fully recovered during rarefaction. At 45 GPa, both VIS and MIR absorptions were strong and irreversible. The intense and spectrally broad MIR absorptions were attributed to short lived intermediates with strong, spectrally broad absorptions that dominate the spectral response. The MIR and VIS absorption changes observed at 33 GPa and 45 GPa were credited to shock induced chemistry, most likely including the formation of a very broad hydrogenic stretch feature. The results from these experiments are consistent with the chemical mechanisms that include O–H or N–H formation such as CH 3 oxidation or C–N homolysis.},

The CP-VCC algorithm, which has previously been applied to solving the vibrational coupled cluster (VCC) ground-state equations without explicitly constructing any tensors of order three or higher, has been generalized to allow transformations with the Jacobian matrix necessary for computation of response excitation energies by iterative algorithms. A new eigenvalue solver for computing CP-VCC excitation energies is introduced, and the different numerical thresholds used for controlling the accuracy of the obtained eigenvalues are discussed. Numerical results are presented for calculations of the 20 lowest eigenvalues on a set of 10 four-atomic molecules, as well as for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of increasing size, up to PAH8 with 120 modes. It is shown that the errors introduced by the tensor decomposition can be controlled by the choice of numerical thresholds. Furthermore, all thresholds can be defined relative to the requested convergence threshold of the equation solver, which allows black-box calculations with minimal user input to be performed. Eigenstates of PAHs were efficiently computed without any explicitly constructed tensors, showing improvements in both memory and central processing unit time compared to the existing full-tensor versions.},

  abstract = {Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) has become a standard method for treating long-range electrostatics in molecular simulations. Although the method has inferior asymptotic computational complexity to its linear scaling competitors, it remains enormously popular due to its high efficiency, which stems from the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). This use of FFTs provides great challenges for scaling the method up to massively parallel systems, in large part because of the need to transfer large amounts of data. In this work, we demonstrate that this data transfer volume can be greatly reduced as a natural consequence of the structure of the PME equations. We also suggest an alternative algorithm that supplants the FFT with a linear algebra approach, which further decreases communication costs at the expense of increased asymptotic computational complexity. This linear algebra based approach is demonstrated to have great potential for latency hiding by interleaving communication and computation steps of the short- and long-range electrostatic terms.},

Additionally, adsorbing electrochromic molecular assemblies onto mesoporous metal-oxide surfaces facilitates commercial and manufacturing potential (i.e., screen-printing and/or roll-to-roll processing). These systems also demonstrate synthetic versatility, thus making a wide array of colors accessible. In this work, using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT), we investigated ten different bi-aryl type molecules of 3,4-ethylendioxythiophene (EDOT) conjugated to various phenyl derivatives as potential anodically coloring electrochromes (ACEs). The non-substituted phenylene, hexylthiol-EDOT-phenyl-phosphonic acid, PA1 , was synthesized and characterized as a means of model validity. PA1 absorbs in the UV region in its neutral state and upon oxidation absorbs within the visible, hence showcasing its potential as an ACE chromophore. The properties of PA1 inspired the designs of the other nine structural derivatives where the number and position of methoxy groups on the phenylene were varied. Using our DFT treatment, we assessed the impact of these modifications on the electronic structures, geometries, and excited-state properties. In particular, we examined stabilization intermolecular interactions (S–O and O–H) as they aid in molecule planarization, thus facilitating charge transport properties in devices. Additionally, destabilizing O–O forces were observed, thereby making some chromophores less desirable. A detailed excited state analysis was performed, which linked the simulated UV-Vis spectra to the dominant excited state transitions and their corresponding molecular orbitals. Based on these results, the nine chromophores were ranked ergo providing an ordered list of synthetic targets.},

The latter sector provides the description of states obtained by attachment of two electrons to the reference system. This makes it possible to adopt the doubly ionized NaLi +2 molecule as a Fermi vacuum. The latter has a very concrete advantage in calculations of the PECs since it dissociates into closed shell fragments (NaLi +2 → Na + + Li + ); hence, the restricted Hartree–Fock method can be used within the whole range of interatomic distances. Computed PECs and spectroscopic constants stay very close to the experimental values (if the latter are available) with the accuracy exceeding the other theoretical approaches including those based on the effective core polarization potentials. Relativistic corrections included at the infinite-order two-component level have a non-negligible effect on the accuracy of computed excitation and dissociation energies with contributions up to 50 cm −1 .},

  abstract = {The nuclear–electronic orbital (NEO) method is a multicomponent quantum chemistry theory that describes electronic and nuclear quantum effects simultaneously while avoiding the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for certain nuclei. Typically specified hydrogen nuclei are treated quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, and the NEO potential energy surface depends on the classical nuclear coordinates. This approach includes nuclear quantum effects such as zero-point energy and nuclear delocalization directly into the potential energy surface. An extended NEO potential energy surface depending on the expectation values of the quantum nuclei incorporates coupling between the quantum and classical nuclei. Herein, theoretical methodology is developed to optimize and characterize stationary points on the standard or extended NEO potential energy surface, to generate the NEO minimum energy path from a transition state down to the corresponding reactant and product, and to compute thermochemical properties. For this purpose, the analytic coordinate Hessian is developed and implemented at the NEO Hartree–Fock level of theory. These NEO Hessians are used to study the S N 2 reaction of ClCH 3 Cl − and the hydride transfer of C 4 H 9 + . For each system, analysis of the single imaginary mode at the transition state and the intrinsic reaction coordinate along the minimum energy path identifies the dominant nuclear motions driving the chemical reaction. Visualization of the electronic and protonic orbitals along the minimum energy path illustrates the coupled electronic and protonic motions beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. This work provides the foundation for applying the NEO approach at various correlated levels of theory to a wide range of chemical reactions.},

In this work, we exploit this gauge freedom and expand the concept of natural transition orbitals, which is widely used in linear-response TDDFT, for obtaining a particle–hole description in RT-TDDFT simulation. While linear-response TDDFT is widely used to study electronic excitation, RT-TDDFT can be employed more generally to simulate non-equilibrium electron dynamics. Studying electron dynamics in terms of dynamic transitions of particle–hole pairs is, however, not straightforward in the RT-TDDFT simulation. By constructing natural transition orbitals through projecting time-dependent Kohn–Sham wave functions onto occupied/unoccupied eigenstate subspaces, we show that linear combinations of a pair of the resulting hole/particle orbitals form a new gauge, which we refer to as dynamical transition orbitals. We demonstrate the utility of this framework to analyze RT-TDDFT simulations of optical excitation and electronic stopping dynamics in the particle–hole description.},

  abstract = {Permeability is a key property in various fields such as membrane technology for chemical separation and transport of substances through cell membranes. At the molecular scale, the counting method uses the number of membrane crossings in a conventional unbiased molecular dynamics simulation to predict the permeability. This contribution investigates under which conditions the counting method has insufficient statistics. An equation is derived for a compartmental model based on the inhomogeneous solubility–diffusion (Smoluchowski) model, giving insight into how the flux correlates with the solubility of permeants. This equation shows that a membrane crossing is a rare event not only when the membrane forms a large free energy barrier but also when the membrane forms a deep free energy well that traps permeants. Such a permeant trap has a high permeability; yet, the counting method suffers from poor statistics. To illustrate this, coarse-grained MD was run for 16 systems of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes with different permeant types. The composition rule for permeability is shown to also hold for fluxes, and it is highlighted that the considered thickness of the membrane causes uncertainty in the permeability calculation of highly permeable membranes. In conclusion, a high permeability in itself is not an effective indicator of the sampling efficiency of the counting method, and caution should be taken for permeants whose solubility varies greatly over the simulation box. A practical consequence relevant in, e.g., drug design is that a drug with high membrane permeability might get trapped by membranes thus reducing its efficacy.},

It has been shown that all these three spectroscopic signals characterize fast population transfer from the higher excited electronic state to the lower excited electronic state. While the time- and frequency-resolved spectrum maps the wave packet propagation exclusively on the electronically excited states, the transient absorption and 2D electronic spectra reflect the wave packet dynamics on both electronically excited states and the electronic ground state. Combining trajectory-guided Gaussian basis functions and the nonlinear response function formalism, the present approach provides a promising general technique for the applications of various Gaussian basis methods to the calculations of four-wave-mixing spectra of polyatomic molecules.},

We describe both coherent and dissipative collective effects resulting from this coupling within the framework of a quantum optics Lindblad master equation. We introduce a method to derive an effective rate equation for electron transfer by adiabatically eliminating donor and acceptor states and the cavity mode. The resulting rate equation is valid for both weak and strong coupling to the cavity mode and describes electronic transfer through both the cavity-coupled bright states and the uncoupled dark states. We derive an analytic expression for the instantaneous electron transfer rate that depends non-trivially on the time-varying number of pairs in the ground state. We find that under proper resonance conditions, and in the presence of an incoherent drive, reaction rates can be enhanced by the cavity. This enhancement persists, and can even be largest, in the weak light–matter coupling regime. We discuss how the cavity effect is relevant for realistic experiments.},

The perturbation potentials we employ are non-linear functions of the solute–solvent interaction energy designed to focus sampling near entropic bottlenecks along the alchemical pathway. We present a general framework to optimize the parameters of alchemical perturbation potentials of this kind. The optimization procedure is based on the λ -function formalism and the maximum-likelihood parameter estimation procedure we developed earlier to avoid the occurrence of multi-modal distributions of the coupling energy along the alchemical path. A novel soft-core function applied to the overall solute–solvent interaction energy rather than individual interatomic pair potentials critical for this result is also presented. Because it does not require modifications of core force and energy routines, the soft-core formulation can be easily deployed in molecular dynamics simulation codes. We illustrate the method by applying it to the estimation of the hydration free energy in water droplets of compounds of varying size and complexity. In each case, we show that convergence of the hydration free energy is achieved rapidly. This work paves the way for the ongoing development of more streamlined algorithms to estimate free energies of molecular binding with explicit solvation.},

  abstract = {Atomistic modeling of energy and charge transfer at the heterojunction of organic solar cells is an active field with many remaining outstanding questions owing, in part, to the difficulties in performing reliable photodynamics calculations on very large systems. One approach to being able to overcome these difficulties is to design and apply an appropriate simplified method. Density-functional tight binding (DFTB) has become a popular form of approximate density-functional theory based on a minimal valence basis set and neglect of all but two center integrals. We report the results of our tests of a recent long-range correction (lc) [A. Humeniuk and R. Mitrić, J. Chem. Phys. 143 , 134120 (2015)] for time-dependent (TD) lc-DFTB by carrying out TD-lc-DFTB fewest switches surface hopping calculations of energy and charge transfer times using the relatively new DFTBABY [A. Humeniuk and R. Mitrić, Comput. Phys. Commun. 221 , 174 (2017)] program. An advantage of this method is the ability to run enough trajectories to get meaningful ensemble averages. Our interest in the present work is less in determining exact energy and charge transfer rates than in understanding how the results of these calculations vary with the value of the range-separation parameter ( R lc = 1/ μ ) for a model organic solar cell heterojunction consisting of a gas-phase van der Waals complex P / F made up of a single pentacene ( P ) molecule together with a single buckminsterfullerene ( F ) molecule. The default value of R lc = 3.03 a 0 is found to be much too small as neither energy nor charge transfer is observed until R lc ≈ 10 a 0 . Tests at a single geometry show that the best agreement with high-quality ab initio spectra is obtained in the limit of no lc (i.e., very large R lc ). A plot of energy and charge transfer rates as a function of R lc is provided, which suggests that a value of R lc ≈ 15 a 0 yields the typical literature (condensed-phase) charge transfer time of about 100 fs. However, energy and charge transfer times become as high as ∼300 fs for R lc ≈ 25 a 0 . A closer examination of the charge transfer process P * / F → P + / F − shows that the initial electron transfer is accompanied by a partial delocalization of the P hole onto F , which then relocalizes back onto P , consistent with a polaron-like picture in which the nuclei relax to stabilize the resultant redistribution of charges.},

The purpose is to introduce the most recent features of orbital-based XL-BOMD to molecular dynamics simulations based on charge equilibration and polarizable force-field models. These features include a metric tensor generalization of the extended harmonic potential, preconditioners, and the ability to use only a single Coulomb summation to determine the fully equilibrated charges and the interatomic forces in each time step for the shadow Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface. The orbital-free formulation has a charge-dependent, short-range energy term that is separate from long-range Coulomb interactions. This enables local parameterizations of the short-range energy term, while the long-range electrostatic interactions can be treated separately. The theory is illustrated for molecular dynamics simulations of an atomistic system described by a charge equilibration model with periodic boundary conditions. The system of linear equations that determines the equilibrated charges and the forces is diagonal, and only a single Ewald summation is needed in each time step. The simulations exhibit the same features in accuracy, convergence, and stability as are expected from orbital-based XL-BOMD.},

Here, we present such an approach that uses the permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) method to fit high-dimensional PESs. The approach is represented by a simple equation, in obvious notation V LL → CC = V LL + Δ V CC – LL , and demonstrated for CH 4 , H 3 O + , and trans and cis - N -methyl acetamide (NMA), CH 3 CONHCH 3 . For these molecules, the LL PES, V LL , is a PIP fit to DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G(d) energies and gradients and Δ V CC – LL is a precise PIP fit obtained using a low-order PIP basis set and based on a relatively small number of CCSD(T) energies. For CH 4 , these are new calculations adopting an aug-cc-pVDZ basis, for H 3 O + , previous CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVQZ energies are used, while for NMA, new CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations are performed. With as few as 200 CCSD(T) energies, the new PESs are in excellent agreement with benchmark CCSD(T) results for the small molecules, and for 12-atom NMA, training is done with 4696 CCSD(T) energies.},

Although being in the extrapolation regime, it is shown that the potential not only allows for quantum simulations from ultra-low temperatures ∼1 K up to 300 K but is also able to describe the new system very accurately compared to explicit coupled cluster calculations. This transferability of the model is rationalized by the similarity of the atomic environments encountered for the larger cluster compared to the environments in the training set of the model. Compared to the interpolation regime, the quality of the model is reduced by roughly one order of magnitude, but most of the difference to the coupled cluster reference comes from global shifts of the potential energy surface, while local energy fluctuations are well recovered. These results suggest that the application of neural network potentials in extrapolation regimes can provide useful results and might be more general than usually thought.},

Here, we address the low-temperature electronic structure and excitation dynamics in the light-harvesting complex 2 of Rhodopseudomonas acidophila by two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. We find that, although at cryogenic temperature energy relaxation is very rapid, exciton mobility is limited over a significant range of excitation energies. This points to the presence of a sub-200 fs, spatially local energy-relaxation mechanism and suggests that local trapping might contribute substantially more in cryogenic experiments than under physiological conditions where the thermal energy is comparable to or larger than the static disorder.},

The model is an extension of a thermodynamic lattice model for DNA hybridization utilizing the formalism of the nucleation-zipper mechanism. Association and dissociation trajectories were generated utilizing the Gillespie algorithm and parameters determined via fitting the association and dissociation timescales to previously published experimental data. Terminal end fraying, experimentally observed following a rapid T-jump, in the sequence 5′-ATATGCATAT-3′ was replicated by the model that also demonstrated that experimentally observed fast dynamics in the sequences 5′-C(AT) n G-3′, where n = 2–6, were also due to terminal end fraying. The dominant association pathways, isolated by transition pathway theory, showed two primary motifs: initiating at or next to a G:C base pair, which is enthalpically favorable and related to the increased strength of G:C base pairs, and initiating in the center of the sequence, which is entropically favorable and related to minimizing the penalty associated with the decrease in configurational entropy due to hybridization.},

  abstract = {Despite lots of attempts on the bridging between full-atomistic and coarse-grained models for polymers, a practical methodology has not been established yet. One of the problems is computation costs for the determination of spatial and temporal conversion parameters, which are ideally obtained for the long chain limit. In this study, we propose a practical, yet quantitative, bridging method utilizing the simulation results for rather short chains. We performed full-atomistic simulations for polybutadiene and some poly(butadiene–styrene) copolymers in the melt state by varying the number of repeating units as 20, 30, and 40. We attempted to construct corresponding coarse-grained models for such systems. We employed the Kremer–Grest type bead-spring chains with bending rigidity. The stiffness parameter of coarse-grained models and the spatial conversion factor between the full-atomistic and coarse-grained models were obtained according to the conformational statistics of polymer chains. Although such a bridging strategy is similar to the earlier studies, we incorporated the molecular weight dependence of the conformational statistics for the first time. By introducing several empirical functions of the conformational statistics for the molecular weight dependence, we attained a rigorous bridging for the conformational statistics. We confirmed that the structural distribution functions of the coarse-grained systems are entirely consistent with the target full-atomistic ones. Owing to the structural conversion parameters thus obtained, we constructed the coarse-grained models that corresponded to the polymers consisting of 200 repeating units and traced the segmental diffusion. The full-atomistic simulations were also performed from the initial configurations created from the equilibrated coarse-grained models via the back-mapping scheme. From the comparison of the mean-square-displacement of the segments positioned at the middle of the chain, we obtained the temporal conversion factors.},

  abstract = {While subjected to radiation, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been shown to enhance the production of radicals when added to aqueous solutions. It has been proposed that the arrangement of water solvation layers near the water–gold interface plays a significant role. As such, the structural and electronic properties of the first water solvation layer surrounding GNPs of varying sizes were compared to bulk water using classical molecular dynamics and quantum and semi-empirical methods. Classical molecular dynamics was used to understand the change in macroscopic properties of bulk water in the presence of different sizes of GNP, as well as by including salt ions. The analysis of these macroscopic properties has led to the conclusion that larger GNPs induce the rearrangement of water molecules to form a 2D hydrogen-bond network at the interface. Quantum methods were employed to understand the electronic nature of the interaction between water molecules and GNPs along with the change in the water orientation and the vibrational density of states. The stretching region of vibrational density of states was found to extend into the higher wavenumber region, as the size of the GNP increases. This extension represents the dangling water molecules at the interface, as a result of reorientation of the water molecules in the first solvation shell. This multi-level study suggests that in the presence of GNP of increasing sizes, the first water solvation shell undergoes a rearrangement to maximize the water–water interactions as well as the water–GNP interactions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, room-temperature ferroelectricity has been experimentally confirmed in a series of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Theoretically, for isolated ferroelectricity in even lower dimensions such as 1D or 0D, the switching barriers may still ensure the room-temperature robustness for ultrahigh-density non-volatile memories, which has yet been scarcely explored. Here, we show ab initio designs of 0D/1D ferroelectrics/multiferroics based on functionalized transition-metal molecular sandwich nanowires (SNWs) with intriguing properties. Some functional groups such as —COOH will spontaneously form into robust threefold helical hydrogen-bonded chains around SNWs with considerable polarizations. Two modes of ferroelectric switching are revealed: when the ends of SNWs are not hydrogen-bonded, the polarizations can be reversed via ligand reorientation that will reform the hydrogen-bonded chains and alter their helicity; when both ends are hydrogen-bonded, the polarizations can be reversed via proton transfer without changing the helicity of chains. The combination of those two modes makes the system the smallest proton conductor with a moderate migration barrier, which is lower compared with many prevalent proton-conductors for higher mobility while still ensuring the robustness at ambient conditions. This desirable feature can be utilized for constructing nanoscale artificial ionic synapses that may enable neuromorphic computing. In such a design of synaptic transistors, the migration of protons through those chains can be controlled and continuously change the conductance of MXene-based post-neuron for nonvolatile multilevel resistance. The success of mimicking synaptic functions will make such designs promising in future high-density artificial neutral systems.},

Charge transfer from Co to ceria occurs upon deposition of Co on CeO 1.96 and partially reduced CeO 1.83 at 300 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies show that Co is oxidized to Co 2+ species at the cost of the reduction of Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ , at a lesser extent on reduced ceria. Co 2+ is the predominant species on CeO 1.96 at low Co coverages (e.g., ≤0.20 ML). The ratio of metallic Co/Co 2+ increases with the increase in the Co coverage. However, both metallic Co and Co 2+ species are present on CeO 1.83 even at low Co coverages with metallic Co as the major species. Scanning tunneling microscopy results demonstrate that Co tends to wet the CeO 1.96 surface at very low Co coverages at room temperature forming one-atomic layer high structures of Co–O–Ce. The increase in the Co coverage can cause the particle growth into three-dimensional structures. The formation of slightly flatter Co particles was observed on reduced CeO 1.83 . In comparison with other transition metals including Ni, Rh, Pt, and Au, our studies demonstrate that Co on ceria exhibits a smaller particle size and higher thermal stability, likely arising from strong metal–support interactions. The formed particles upon Co deposition at 300 K are present on the ceria surface after heating to 1000 K. The Co–ceria interface can be tuned by varying the Co metal coverage, the annealing temperature, and the nature of the ceria surface.},

Specifically, carbonyl groups open up new avenues for on-surface coordination chemistry.

Low-temperature ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy revealed the room temperature formation of self-assemblies defined by hydrogen and halogen bonds on Ag(100). Following a thermal anneal to 300 °C, DBPQ on Ag(100) was found to form metal–organic coordination networks composed of a combination of organometallic species characteristics of Ullmann-like coupling reactions and carbonyl complexes.

  abstract = {Quantifying the optical extinction cross section of a plasmonic nanoparticle has recently emerged as a powerful means to characterize the nanoparticle morphologically, i.e., to determine its size and shape with a precision comparable to electron microscopy while using a simple optical microscope. In this context, a critical piece of information to solve the inverse problem, namely, calculating the particle geometry from the measured cross section, is the material permittivity. For bulk gold, many datasets have been reported in the literature, raising the question of which one is more adequate to describe specific systems at the nanoscale. Another question is how the nanoparticle interface, not present in the bulk material, affects its permittivity. In this work, we have investigated the role of the material permittivities on the morphometric characterization of defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres with diameters of 10 nm and 30 nm, following a quantitative analysis of the polarization- and spectrally-resolved extinction cross section on hundreds of individual nanoparticles. The measured cross sections were fitted using an ellipsoid model. By minimizing the fit error or the variation of the fitted dimensions with color channel selection, the material permittivity dataset and the surface damping parameter g best describing the nanoparticles are found to be the single crystal dataset by Olmon et al. [Phys. Rev. B 86 , 235147 (2012)] and g ≈ 1, respectively. The resulting nanoparticle geometries are in good agreement with transmission electron microscopy of the same sample batches, including both 2D projection and tomography.},

Large-scale density functional theory calculations predict a low energy phase in which the same-diameter “dog-bone” collapsed CNTs form a graphite-like phase with complex, anomalous grain boundaries (GBs). The excess GB volume does not prevent the strong van der Waals coupling of the flattened CNT sides into AB stacking. The associated GB energetics is dominated by the van der Waals energy penalty and high curvature bending of the loop CNT edges, which exhibit reactivity and flexoelectricity. The large density and superior mechanical rigidity of the proposed microstructural organization as well as the GB flexoelectricity are desirable properties for developing ultra-strong composites based on large-radius CNTs.},

Test calculations are performed on model charge-transfer systems in water, and the effects of electronic polarizability on solvation dynamics are examined. The electronic polarizability slightly retards the solvation dynamics. This is ascribed to the decrease in the curvature of the nonequilibrium free energy profile along the solvation coordinate. The solvent relaxation is bimodal, and the faster and the slower modes are assigned to the reorientational and the translational modes, respectively, as was already reported by the surrogate theory combined with the site–site Smoluchowski–Vlasov equation. The relaxation path along the solvation coordinate is a little higher than the minimum free energy path because the translational mode is fixed in the time scale of the reorientational relaxation.},

We show that the AG relation, −log 10 σ dc ∝ ( TS c ) −1 (where σ dc , T , and S c denote the dc-conductivity, absolute temperature, and configurational entropy, respectively), does not work when the whole supercooled liquid state is considered. Meanwhile, a linear relationship between −log 10 σ dc and ( TS e ) −1 (where S e denotes the excess entropy) was observed in the entire supercooled range. On the other hand, the generalized AG model log 10 σ dc ∝ ( TS c α ) −1 with an additional free parameter α successfully describes the relation between σ dc and S c . The determined α values being less than unity indicate that the configurational entropy is insufficient to govern the ion dynamics.

We evaluate the dielectric constant and study the scaling of ε with size by using linear response theory and computer simulations. We find that the perpendicular component remains anomalously low at smaller inter-plate separations ( d ) over a relatively wide range of d . For NCW–Sph, we could evaluate the dielectric constant exactly and again find a low value and a slow convergence to the bulk. To obtain a measure of surface influence into the bulk, we introduce and calculate correlation lengths to find values of ∼9 nm for NCW–GS and ∼5 nm for NCW–Sph, which are surprisingly large, especially for water. We discover that the dipole moment autocorrelations exhibit an unexpected ultrafast decay. We observe the presence of a ubiquitous frequency of ∼1000 cm −1 , associated only with the perpendicular component for NCW–GS. This (caging) frequency seems to play a pivotal role in controlling both static and dynamic dielectric responses in the perpendicular direction. It disappears with an increase in d in a manner that corroborates with the estimated correlation length. A similar observation is obtained for NCW–Sph. Interestingly, one- and two-dimensional Ising model systems that follow Glauber spin-flip dynamics reproduce the general characteristics.},

Different behaviors in switching between two inner-hydrogen configurations are observed with decreasing voltages, which helps to reveal the underlying tautomerization mechanism involving both the molecular electronic excited states and vibrational excited states in the ground state.},

It is found that there exists a triplet route for photodissociation of the molecule. The reaction mechanism consists of a complex cascade of nonadiabatic electronic transitions involving triple and double conical intersections as well as intersystem crossing. Several of the relevant states (S 2 , S 4 , and S 5 states) correspond to double excitations. It is worth noting that the last step of the photodissociation implies an internal conversion process.

  abstract = {Extended quantum chemical calculations were performed for the tetracene dimer to provide benchmark results, analyze the excimer survival process, and explore the possibility of using long-range-corrected (LC) time-dependent second-order density functional tight-biding (DFTB2) for this system. Ground- and first-excited-state optimized geometries, vertical excitations at relevant minima, and intermonomer displacement potential energy curves (PECs) were calculated for these purposes. Ground-state geometries were optimized with the scaled-opposite-spin (SOS) second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory and LC-DFT (density functional theory) and LC-DFTB2 levels. Excited-state geometries were optimized with SOS-ADC(2) (algebraic diagrammatic construction to second-order) and the time-dependent approaches for the latter two methods. Vertical excitations and PECs were compared to multireference configuration interaction DFT (DFT/MRCI). All methods predict the lowest-energy S 0 conformer to have monomers parallel and rotated relative to each other and the lowest S 1 conformer to be of a displaced-stacked type. LC-DFTB2, however, presents some relevant differences regarding other conformers for S 0 . Despite some state-order inversions, overall good agreement between methods was observed in the spectral shape, state character, and PECs. Nevertheless, DFT/MRCI predicts that the S 1 state should acquire a doubly excited-state character relevant to the excimer survival process and, therefore, cannot be completely described by the single reference methods used in this work. PECs also revealed an interesting relation between dissociation energies and the intermonomer charge-transfer interactions for some states.},

The model accounts for anisotropy of interaction between guest and host atoms, spin–orbit coupling, and lattice relaxation. Interstitial and substitutional accommodations are found to be the only thermodynamically stable sites for trapping atomic oxygen. Mixing of electronic states coupled to lattice distortions justifies that its long-range thermal migration follows the adiabatic ground-state potential energy surface. Search for the migration paths reveals a common direct mechanism for interstitial diffusion. Substitutional atoms are activated by the point lattice defects, whereas the direct guest–host exchange meets a higher activation barrier. These three low-energy migration mechanisms provide plausible interpretation for multiple migration activation thresholds observed in Kr and Xe free-standing crystals, confirmed by reasonable agreement between calculated and measured activation energies. An important effect of interaction anisotropy and a minor role of spin–orbit coupling are emphasized.},

Following simulations of the enhancement for different configuration parameters, the appropriately designed Bragg cavities together with out-coupling gratings composed of hydrogen silsesquioxane ridges are fabricated around the NDs containing nitrogen vacancy centers deposited on a silica-coated silver surface. We characterize the fabricated configurations and finely tune the cavity parameters to match the GeV emission. Finally, we fabricate the cavity containing a single GeV-ND and compare the total decay-rate before and after cavity fabrication, finding a decay-rate enhancement of ∼5.5 and thereby experimentally confirming the feasibility of emission enhancement with circular plasmonic cavities.},

The adducts formed reflect the high electrophilicity of the Mg 4 cluster through electron density holes in the neighborhood of each metallic center. After the adduct formation, the metallic bonding of the Mg 4 moiety is not significantly altered so that the hydrogen shifts from the Lewis base toward the Mg atoms lead to new local minima with enhanced stability. For the particular case of ammonia and water, the global minima obtained when all the hydrogens of the Lewis base are shifted to the Mg 4 moiety have in common a very stable scaffold with a N or an O center covalently tetracoordinated to the four Mg atoms, so the initial bonding arrangements of both reactants have completely disappeared.

Structural and energetic properties were first computed for the individual and first-neighbors clathrate-like sII cages, where highly accurate ab initio quantum chemical methods are available nowadays, allowing in this way the assessment of the density functional (DFT) theoretical approaches employed. The performance of exchange–correlation functionals together with recently developed dispersion-corrected schemes was evaluated in describing interactions in both short-range and long-range regions of the potential. On this basis, structural relaxations of the CO 2 -filled and empty sII unit cells yield lattice and compressibility parameters comparable to experimental and previous theoretical values available for sII hydrates. According to these data, the CO 2 enclathration in the sII clathrate cages is a stabilizing process, either by considering both guest–host and host–host interactions in the complete unit cell or only the guest–water energies for the individual clathrate-like sII cages. CO 2 @sII clathrates are predicted to be stable whatever the dispersion correction applied and in the case of single cage occupancy are found to be more stable than the CO 2 @sI structures. Our results reveal that DFT approaches could provide a good reasonable description of the underlying interactions, enabling the investigation of formation and transformation processes as a function of temperature and pressure.},

Unfortunately, the accuracies of popular range-separated hybrid, “rung-4” DFAs, and cWFTs that offer the best accuracy-vs-cost trade-off have until now been established only for datasets predominantly comprising small molecules; their transferability to larger systems remains vague. In this study, we present an extended benchmark dataset of Δ H f ° for structurally and electronically diverse molecules. We apply quartile-ranking based on boundary-corrected kernel density estimation to filter outliers and arrive at probabilistically pruned enthalpies of 1694 compounds (PPE1694). For this dataset, we rank the prediction accuracies of G4, G4(MP2), ccCA, CBS-QB3, and 23 popular DFAs using conventional and probabilistic error metrics. We discuss systematic prediction errors and highlight the role an empirical higher-level correction plays in the G4(MP2) model. Furthermore, we comment on uncertainties associated with the reference empirical data for atoms and the systematic errors stemming from these that grow with the molecular size. We believe that these findings will aid in identifying meaningful application domains for quantum thermochemical methods.},

In this work, we train machine learning models on experimental ionic blockade data from DNA nucleotide translocation through 2D pores of different diameters. The aim of the resulting classification is to enhance the read-out efficiency of the nucleotide identity providing pathways toward error-free sequencing. We propose a novel method that at the same time reduces the current traces to a few physical descriptors and trains low-complexity models, thus reducing the dimensionality of the data. We describe each translocation event by four features including the height of the ionic current blockade. Training on these lower dimensional data and utilizing deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, we can reach a high accuracy of up to 94\% in average. Compared to more complex baseline models trained on the full ionic current traces, our model outperforms. Our findings clearly reveal that the use of the ionic blockade height as a feature together with a proper combination of neural networks, feature extraction, and representation provides a strong enhancement in the detection. Our work points to a possible step toward guiding the experiments to the number of events necessary for sequencing an unknown biopolymer in view of improving the biosensitivity of novel nanopore sequencers.},

Using a charge transfer model coupled to an optical cavity, we demonstrate that the RP quantization of the photon field provides accurate rate constants of the polariton mediated electron transfer reaction compared to Fermi’s golden rule. Because RP quantization uses extended phase space to describe the photon field, it significantly reduces the computational costs compared to the commonly used Fock state description of the radiation field. Compared to the other quasi-classical descriptions of the photon field, such as the classical Wigner based mean-field Ehrenfest model, the RP representation provides a much more accurate description of the polaritonic quantum dynamics because it alleviates the potential quantum distribution leakage problem associated with the photonic degrees of freedom (DOF). This work demonstrates the possibility of using the ring polymer description to treat the quantized radiation field in polariton chemistry, offering an accurate and efficient approach for future investigations in cavity quantum electrodynamics.},

Signatures of this failure are the temperature dependent minimum point of the polariton peak splitting, the uneven polariton peak height at the minimum splitting, and the asymmetric shape of the polariton peaks even at the experimentally accessed “zero-detuning” point. Using a rather generic yet representative model of molecular vibrations, we predict the polariton response in various conditions, depending on the temperature, molecular Stokes shift and vibration frequencies, and the size of the Rabi splitting.

Solvent–molecule coupling and physical properties of the solvent can be used as the external stimulus to control the electric current through a molecule. In this paper, we propose a model that includes dynamical effects of solvent–molecule interaction in non-equilibrium Green’s function calculations of the electric current. The solvent is considered as a macroscopic dipole moment that reorients stochastically and interacts with the electrons tunneling through the molecular junction. The Keldysh–Kadanoff–Baym equations for electronic Green’s functions are solved in the time domain with subsequent averaging over random realizations of rotational variables using the Furutsu–Novikov method for the exact closure of infinite hierarchy of stochastic correlation functions. The developed theory requires the use of wideband approximation as well as classical treatment of solvent degrees of freedom. The theory is applied to a model molecular junction. It is demonstrated that not only electrostatic interaction between molecular junction and solvent but also solvent viscosity can be used to control electrical properties of the junction. Alignment of the rotating dipole moment breaks the particle–hole symmetry of the transmission favoring either hole or electron transport channels depending upon the aligning potential.},

  abstract = {Methylene blue [3,7-Bis(di-methylamino) phenothiazin-5-ium chloride] is a phenothiazine dye with applications as a sensitizer for photodynamic therapy, photoantimicrobials, and dye-sensitized solar cells. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), based on (semi)local and global hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, fails to correctly describe its spectral features due to known limitations for describing optical excitations of π -conjugated systems. Here, we use TDDFT with a non-empirical optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functional to explore the optical excitations of gas phase and solvated methylene blue. We compute solvated configurations using molecular dynamics and an iterative procedure to account for explicit solute polarization. We rationalize and validate that by extrapolating the optimized range separation parameter to an infinite amount of solvating molecules, the optical gap of methylene blue is well described. Moreover, this method allows us to resolve contributions from solvent–solute intermolecular interactions and dielectric screening. We validate our results by comparing them to first-principles calculations based on the GW+Bethe–Salpeter equation approach and experiment. Vibronic calculations using TDDFT and the generating function method account for the spectra’s subbands and bring the computed transition energies to within 0.15 eV of the experimental data. This methodology is expected to perform equivalently well for describing solvated spectra of π -conjugated systems.},

  abstract = {A number of studies have constructed coarse-grained (CG) models of water to understand its anomalous properties. Most of these properties emerge at low temperatures, and an accurate CG model needs to be applicable to these low-temperature ranges. However, direct use of CG models parameterized from other temperatures, e.g., room temperature, encounters a problem known as transferability, as the CG potential essentially follows the form of the many-body CG free energy function. Therefore, temperature-dependent changes to CG interactions must be accounted for. The collective behavior of water at low temperature is generally a many-body process, which often motivates the use of expensive many-body terms in the CG interactions. To surmount the aforementioned problems, we apply the Bottom-Up Many-Body Projected Water (BUMPer) CG model constructed from Paper I to study the low-temperature behavior of water. We report for the first time that the embedded three-body interaction enables BUMPer, despite its pairwise form, to capture the growth of ice at the ice/water interface with corroborating many-body correlations during the crystal growth. Furthermore, we propose temperature transferable BUMPer models that are indirectly constructed from the free energy decomposition scheme. Changes in CG interactions and corresponding structures are faithfully recapitulated by this framework. We further extend BUMPer to examine its ability to predict the structure, density, and diffusion anomalies by employing an alternative analysis based on structural correlations and pairwise potential forms to predict such anomalies. The presented analysis highlights the existence of these anomalies in the low-temperature regime and overcomes potential transferability problems.},

  abstract = {Water is undoubtedly one of the most important molecules for a variety of chemical and physical systems, and constructing precise yet effective coarse-grained (CG) water models has been a high priority for computer simulations. To recapitulate important local correlations in the CG water model, explicit higher-order interactions are often included. However, the advantages of coarse-graining may then be offset by the larger computational cost in the model parameterization and simulation execution. To leverage both the computational efficiency of the CG simulation and the inclusion of higher-order interactions, we propose a new statistical mechanical theory that effectively projects many-body interactions onto pairwise basis sets. The many-body projection theory presented in this work shares similar physics from liquid state theory, providing an efficient approach to account for higher-order interactions within the reduced model. We apply this theory to project the widely used Stillinger–Weber three-body interaction onto a pairwise (two-body) interaction for water. Based on the projected interaction with the correct long-range behavior, we denote the new CG water model as the Bottom-Up Many-Body Projected Water (BUMPer) model, where the resultant CG interaction corresponds to a prior model, the iteratively force-matched model. Unlike other pairwise CG models, BUMPer provides high-fidelity recapitulation of pair correlation functions and three-body distributions, as well as N -body correlation functions. BUMPer extensively improves upon the existing bottom-up CG water models by extending the accuracy and applicability of such models while maintaining a reduced computational cost.},

  abstract = {Electrostatic interaction is long ranged; thus, the accurate calculation is not an easy task in molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations. Though the rigorous Ewald method based on the reciprocal space has been established, real-space treatments have recently become an attractive alternative because of the efficient calculation. However, the construction is not yet completed and is now a challenging subject. In an earlier theoretical study, Neumann and Steinhauser employed the Onsager dielectric continuum model to explain how simple real-space cutoff produces artificial dipolar orientation. In the present study, we employ this continuum model to explore the fundamental properties of the recently developed real-space treatments of three shifting schemes. The result of the distance-dependent Kirkwood function G K ( R ) showed that the simple bare cutoff produces a well-known hole-shaped artifact, whereas the shift treatments do not. Two-dimensional mapping of electric field well explained how these shift treatments remove the hole-shaped artifact. Still, the shift treatments are not sufficient because they do not produce a flat G K ( R ) profile unlike ideal no-cutoff treatment. To test the continuum model results, we also performed Monte Carlo simulations of dipolar particles. The results found that the continuum model could predict the qualitative tendency as to whether each electrostatic treatment produces the hole-shaped artifact of G K ( R ) or not. We expect that the present study using the continuum model offers a stringent criterion to judge whether the primitive electrostatic behavior is correctly described or not, which will be useful for future construction of electrostatic treatments.},

  abstract = {We investigate multiple photon-assisted Landau–Zener (LZ) transitions in a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics device in which each of two interacting transmission-line resonators is coupled to a qubit, and the qubits are driven by periodic driving fields and also coupled to a common phonon mode. The quantum state of the entire composite system is modeled using the multi-D 2 Ansatz in combination with the time-dependent Dirac–Frenkel variational principle. Applying a sinusoidal driving field to one of the qubits, this device is an ideal platform to study the photon-assisted LZ transitions by comparing the dynamics of the two qubits. A series of interfering photon-assisted LZ transitions takes place if the photon frequency is much smaller than the driving amplitude. Once the two energy scales are comparable, independent LZ transitions arise and a transition pathway is revealed using an energy diagram. It is found that both adiabatic and nonadiabatic transitions are involved in the dynamics. Used to model environmental effects on the LZ transitions, the common phonon mode coupled to the qubits allows for more available states to facilitate the LZ transitions. An analytical formula is obtained to estimate the short time phonon population and produces results in reasonable agreement with numerical calculations. Equipped with the knowledge of the photon-assisted LZ transitions in the system, we can precisely manipulate the qubit state and successfully generate the qubit dynamics with a square-wave pattern by applying driving fields to both qubits, opening up new venues to manipulate the states of qubits and photons in quantum information devices and quantum computers.},

The scaling eliminates the need for many of the most costly terms of the F12 correction while reproducing the unscaled explicitly correlated F12 interaction energy correction to a high degree of accuracy. The method requires a single, basis set dependent scaling factor that is determined by fitting to a set of test molecules. We present factors for the cc-pVXZ-F12 (X = D, T, Q) basis set family obtained by minimizing interaction energies of the S66 set of small- to medium-sized molecular complexes and show that our new method can be applied to accurately describe a wide range of systems. Remarkably good explicitly correlated corrections to the interaction energy are obtained for the S22 and L7 test sets, with mean percentage errors for the double-zeta basis of 0.60\% for the F12 correction to the interaction energy, 0.05\% for the total electron correlation interaction energy, and 0.03\% for the total interaction energy, respectively. Additionally, mean interaction energy errors introduced by our new approach are below 0.01 kcal mol −1 for each test set and are thus negligible for second-order perturbation theory based methods. The efficiency of the new method compared to the unscaled F12 correction is shown for all considered systems, with distinct speedups for medium- to large-sized structures.},

The other fundamental frequencies reported herein have a mean absolute error of only 5 cm −1 from the seven available gas-phase experimental frequencies, making the anharmonic vibrational frequencies and rotational constants the most accurate computational data available for BH 3 NH 3 to date. The inclusion of Fermi, Coriolis, and Darling–Dennison resonances is a major source of this accuracy, with the non-resonance-corrected frequencies having a mean absolute error of 10 cm −1 . In particular, the inclusion of the 2 ν 6 = ν 5 type 1 Fermi resonance increases the B–N stretching frequency by 14 cm −1 compared to previous work. Ammonia borane also represents one of the largest molecules ever studied by quartic force fields, making this work an important step in extending the breadth of application for these theoretical rovibrational techniques.},

  abstract = {Biomolecular condensates, largely by virtue of their material properties, are revolutionizing biology, and yet, the physical understanding of these properties is lagging. Here, I show that the viscoelasticity of condensates can be captured by a simple model, comprising a component where shear relaxation is an exponential function (with time constant τ 1 ) and a component with nearly instantaneous shear relaxation (time constant τ 0 → 0). Modulation of intermolecular interactions, e.g., by adding salt, can disparately affect the two components such that the τ 1 component may dominate at low salt, whereas the τ 0 component may dominate at high salt. Condensates have a tendency to fuse, with the dynamics accelerated by interfacial tension and impeded by viscosity. For fast-fusion condensates, shear relaxation on the τ 1 timescale may become rate-limiting such that the fusion speed is no longer in direction proportion to the interfacial tension. These insights help narrow the gap in understanding between the biology and physics of biomolecular condensates.},

  abstract = {We propose a new first-order perturbation theory that provides a near-quantitative description of the thermodynamics of simple fluids. The theory is based on the ansatz that the Helmholtz free energy is bounded below by a first-order Mayer- f expansion. Together with the rigorous upper bound provided by a first-order u -expansion, this brackets the actual free energy between an upper and (effective) lower bound that can both be calculated based on first-order perturbation theory. This is of great practical use. Here, the two bounds are combined into an interpolation scheme for the free energy. The scheme exploits the fact that a first-order Mayer- f perturbation theory is exact in the low-density limit, whereas the accuracy of a first-order u -expansion grows when density increases. This allows an interpolation between the lower “ f ”-bound at low densities and the upper “ u ” bound at higher liquid-like densities. The resulting theory is particularly well behaved. Using a density-dependent interpolating function of only two adjustable parameters, we obtain a very accurate representation of the full fluid-phase behavior of a Lennard-Jones fluid. The interpolating function is transferable to other intermolecular potential types, which is here shown for the Mie m- 6 family of fluids. The extension to mixtures is simple and accurate without requiring any dependence of the interpolating function on the composition of the mixture.},

This new formulation (1) avoids the use of time or frequency grids, (2) naturally obviates the need for the common “diagonal” approximation, (3) enables common iterative eigensolvers that reduce the canonical scaling to O ( N 5 ), and (4) enables a density-fitted implementation that reduces the scaling to O ( N 4 ). We numerically verify these scaling behaviors and test a variety of approximations that are motivated by this new formulation. The new formulation is found to be competitive with conventional O ( N 4 ) methods based on analytic continuation or contour deformation. In this new formulation, the relation of the GW approximation to configuration interaction, coupled-cluster theory, and the algebraic diagrammatic construction is made especially apparent, providing a new direction for improvements to the GW approximation.},

  abstract = {Many important chemically reacting systems are inherently multi-dimensional with spatial and temporal variations in the thermochemical state, which can be strongly coupled to interactions with transport processes. Fundamental insights into these systems require multi-dimensional measurements of the thermochemical state as well as fluid dynamics quantities. Laser-based imaging diagnostics provide spatially and temporally resolved measurements that help address this need. The state of the art in imaging diagnostics is continually progressing with the goal of attaining simultaneous multi-parameter measurements that capture transient processes, particularly those that lead to stochastic events, such as localized extinction in turbulent combustion. Development efforts in imaging diagnostics benefit from advances in laser and detector technology. This article provides a perspective on the progression of increasing dimensionality of laser-based imaging diagnostics and highlights the evolution from single-point measurements to 1D and 2D multi-parameter imaging and 3D high-speed imaging. This evolution is demonstrated using highlights of laser-based imaging techniques in combustion science research as an exemplar of a complex multi-dimensional chemically reacting system with chemistry–transport coupling. Imaging diagnostics impact basic research in other chemically reacting systems as well, such as measurements of near-surface gases in heterogeneous catalysis. The expanding dimensionality of imaging diagnostics leads to larger and more complex datasets that require increasingly demanding approaches to data analysis and provide opportunities for increased collaboration between experimental and computational researchers in tackling these challenges.},

In the present work, we report spin dynamics simulations of models of cryptochrome-based radical pairs to assess whether accumulation of nuclear spin polarization in multiple photocycles could lead to significant enhancements in the sensitivity with which the proteins respond to the direction of the geomagnetic field. Although buildup of nuclear polarization appears to offer sensitivity advantages in the more idealized model systems studied, we find that these enhancements do not carry over to conditions that more closely resemble the situation thought to exist in vivo . On the basis of these simulations, we conclude that buildup of nuclear polarization seems unlikely to be a source of significant improvements in the performance of cryptochrome-based radical pair magnetoreceptors.},

The ubiquity of this relation in diverse chemical and biological contexts has recently been rationalized by a graph-theoretic analysis of deterministic reaction networks. Experiments, however, have revealed that “molecular noise”—intrinsic stochasticity at the molecular scale—leads to significant deviations from classical results and to unexpected effects like “molecular memory,” i.e., the breakdown of statistical independence between turnover events. Here, we show, through a new method of analysis, that memory and non-hyperbolicity have a common source in an initial, and observably long, transient peculiar to stochastic reaction networks of multiple enzymes. Networks of single enzymes do not admit such transients. The transient yields, asymptotically, to a steady-state in which memory vanishes and hyperbolicity is recovered. We propose new statistical measures, defined in terms of turnover times, to distinguish between the transient and steady-states and apply these to experimental data from a landmark experiment that first observed molecular memory in a single enzyme with multiple binding sites. Our study shows that catalysis at the molecular level with more than one enzyme always contains a non-classical regime and provides insight on how the classical limit is attained.},

  abstract = {Field Cycling (FC) 2 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry was applied to study dynamics in Nafion NR 212 in the temperature range from 300 K to 190 K and water content of λ = 8.2. The sensitive time window of FC was extended up to eight decades using the temperature–frequency superposition principle and master curve. The rotational correlation times obtained from 2 H FC NMR coincide with translational correlation times gained from static field 2 H NMR diffusometry in the temperature range applied. This fact means that a long-range mass transport in Nafion is coupled to molecular rotations. It is assumed that confined water in Nafion has more ordered oxygen sublattices as compared with bulk water, on a short range is similar to ice. We discuss the possible role of D and L defects, typical for the ordered ice structure and using this concept to describe the processes of self-diffusion of confined water in Nafion, as well as the similarity of temperature and humidity dependence of self-diffusion and proton conductivity.},

Specifically, we use a coarse-grained model to examine silica nanoparticles coated with alkane chains, where the poles of the grafted nanoparticle are bare, resulting in strongly attractive patches. Through a systematic screening process, the patchy nanoparticles are found to form dispersed, string-like, and aggregated phases, dependent on the combination of alkane chain length, coating chain density, and the fractional coated surface area. Correlation analysis is used to identify the ability of various particle descriptors to predict bulk phase behavior from more computationally efficient single grafted nanoparticle simulations and demonstrates that the solvent-accessible surface area of the nanoparticle core is a key predictor of bulk phase behavior. The results of this work enhance our knowledge of the phase space of patchy nanoparticles and provide a powerful approach for future screening of these materials.},

  abstract = {Transfer entropy in information theory was recently demonstrated [Basak et al. , Phys. Rev. E 102 , 012404 (2020)] to enable us to elucidate the interaction domain among interacting elements solely from an ensemble of trajectories. Therefore, only pairs of elements whose distances are shorter than some distance variable, termed cutoff distance, are taken into account in the computation of transfer entropies. The prediction performance in capturing the underlying interaction domain is subject to the noise level exerted on the elements and the sufficiency of statistics of the interaction events. In this paper, the dependence of the prediction performance is scrutinized systematically on noise level and the length of trajectories by using a modified Vicsek model. The larger the noise level and the shorter the time length of trajectories, the more the derivative of average transfer entropy fluctuates, which makes the identification of the interaction domain in terms of the position of global minimum of the derivative of average transfer entropy difficult. A measure to quantify the degree of strong convexity at the coarse-grained level is proposed. It is shown that the convexity score scheme can identify the interaction distance fairly well even while the position of the global minimum of the derivative of average transfer entropy does not. We also derive an analytical model to explain the relationship between the interaction domain and the change in transfer entropy that supports our cutoff distance technique to elucidate the underlying interaction domain from trajectories.},

Here, we report an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst that consists of atomically dispersed single copper sites confined by defective mixed-phased TiO 2− x . This synergistic catalyst was produced by introducing Cu 2+ to a metal organic framework (MOF) using the Mannich reaction, occurring between the carbonyl group in Cu(acac) 2 and the amino group on the skeleton of the MOF. The embedding of single copper atoms was confirmed by atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Electronic structure modulation of the single copper sites coupling with oxygen vacancies was further established by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. Significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability were achieved on this special Cu single site. The promising application of this novel electrocatalyst was demonstrated in a prototype Zn–air battery. This strategy of the stabilization of single-atom active sites by optimization of the atomic and electronic structure on a mixed matrix support sheds light on the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.},

We report here the use of an in situ probe that is minimally invasive to detect real-time damage induced in organic materials.

Two different routes have been employed: low-cost finite cluster-based calculations, where both the Fe complex and the surface are maintained fixed while the molecule approaches the surface; and periodic DFT plane-wave calculations, where the surface is represented by a four-layer slab and both the molecule and surface are relaxed. Our results show that the bridge adsorption site is preferred over the on-top and fourfold hollow ones for both spin states, although they are energetically close. The LS molecule is stabilized by the surface, and the HS–LS energy difference is enhanced by about 15\%–25\% once deposited. The different Fe ligand field for LS and HS molecules manifests on the composition and energy of the low-lying bands. Our simulated STM images indicate that it is possible to distinguish the spin state of the deposited molecules by tuning the bias voltage of the STM tip. Finally, it should be noted that the use of a reduced size cluster to simulate the Au(100) surface proves to be a low-cost and reliable strategy, providing results in good agreement with those resulting from state-of-the-art periodic calculations for this system.},

  abstract = {In a system of N particles, with continuous size polydispersity, there exists an N(N − 1) number of partial structure factors, making it analytically less tractable. A common practice is to treat the system as an effective one component system, which is known to exhibit an artificial softening of the structure. The aim of this study is to describe the system in terms of M pseudospecies such that we can avoid this artificial softening but, at the same time, have a value of M ≪ N . We use potential energy and pair excess entropy to estimate an optimum number of species, M 0 . We then define the maximum width of polydispersity, Δ σ 0 , that can be treated as a monodisperse system. We show that M 0 depends on the degree and type of polydispersity and also on the nature of the interaction potential, whereas Δ σ 0 weakly depends on the type of polydispersity but shows a stronger dependence on the type of interaction potential. Systems with a softer interaction potential have a higher tolerance with respect to polydispersity. Interestingly, M 0 is independent of system size, making this study more relevant for bigger systems. Our study reveals that even 1\% polydispersity cannot be treated as an effective monodisperse system. Thus, while studying the role of polydispersity by using the structure of an effective one component system, care must be taken in decoupling the role of polydispersity from that of the artificial softening of the structure.},

In particular, the three-body recombination rate at temperatures relevant for buffer gas cell experiments is calculated via a classical trajectory method in hyperspherical coordinates [Pérez-Ríos et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 140 , 044307 (2014)]. As a result, it is found that the formation of van der Waals molecules in buffer gas cells (1 K ≲ T ≲ 10 K) is dominated by the long-range tail (distances larger than the LeRoy radius) of the X–RG interaction. For higher temperatures, the short-range region of the potential becomes more significant. Moreover, we notice that the rate of formation of van der Walls molecules is of the same order of the magnitude independent of the chemical properties of X. As a consequence, almost any X–RG molecule may be created and observed in a buffer gas cell under proper conditions.},

The method of interpolating moving least squares was used to construct an analytical PES from these data. The equilibrium structure of the complex was found to be linear, with H 2 aligned at the N end of the PN molecule, at an intermolecular separation of 4.2 Å. The corresponding well-depth is 224.3 cm −1 . The dissociation energies were found to be 40.19 cm −1 and 75.05 cm −1 for complexes of PN with ortho -H 2 and para -H 2 , respectively. Integral cross sections for rotational excitation in PN–H 2 collisions were calculated using the new PES and were found to be strongly dependent on the rotational level of the H 2 molecule. These new collisional data will be crucial to improve the estimation of PN abundance in the interstellar medium from observational spectra.},

The new PES reproduces the fitted points with chemical accuracy (root mean square deviation up to 0.043 eV) and explicitly incorporates long range energy terms that can accurately describe the electrostatic and dispersion interactions. Thermal rate coefficients were computed for the C( 3 P) + NO( 2 Π) reaction for temperatures ranging from 15 K to 10 000 K, and the values are compared to previously reported results. The differences are rationalized, and the major importance of long range forces in predicting the rate coefficients for barrierless reactions is emphasized.},

The coupled states (CS) approximation is used to compute fine-structure resolved cross sections for rovibrational transitions between states with v = 0–2, where v is the vibrational quantum number of the SO molecule. The CS calculations for Δ v = 1 are benchmarked against close-coupling (CC) results for spin-free interactions. For Δ v = 0, the present fine-structure resolved CS results are benchmarked against existing CC results obtained with a rigid rotor approximation. In both cases, the agreement is found to be satisfactory, which suggests that the present results may provide reliable estimates for fine-structure resolved rovibrational transitions. These estimates are the first of their kind based on a full 6D PES. Rate coefficients are reported for temperatures between 10 K and 3000 K for both para- and ortho-H 2 colliders. A comparison of the para-H 2 rates with mass-scaled results for He shows substantial differences that may be important in astrophysical models.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurements of longitudinal relaxation time constants ( T 1 ) in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) experiments are important for the study of molecular-level structure and dynamics. Such measurements are often made under magic-angle spinning conditions; however, there are numerous instances where they must be made on stationary samples, which often give rise to broad powder patterns arising from large anisotropic NMR interactions. In this work, we explore the use of wideband uniform-rate smooth-truncation pulses for the measurement of T 1 constants. Two experiments are introduced: (i) BRAIN-CPT1, a modification of the BRAIN-CP (BRoadband Adiabatic-INversion-Cross Polarization) sequence, for broadband CP-based T 1 measurements and (ii) WCPMG-IR, a modification of the WURST-CPMG sequence, for direct-excitation (DE) inversion-recovery experiments. A series of T 1 constants are measured for spin-1/2 and quadrupolar nuclei with broad powder patterns, such as 119 Sn ( I = 1/2), 35 Cl ( I = 3/2), 2 H ( I = 1), and 195 Pt ( I = 1/2). High signal-to-noise spectra with uniform patterns can be obtained due to signal enhancements from T 2 eff -weighted echo trains, and in favorable cases, BRAIN-CPT1 allows for the rapid measurement of T 1 in comparison to DE experiments. Protocols for spectral acquisition, processing, and analysis of relaxation data are discussed. In most cases, relaxation behavior can be modeled with either monoexponential or biexponential functions based upon measurements of integrated powder pattern intensity; however, it is also demonstrated that one must interpret such T 1 values with caution, as demonstrated by measurements of T 1 anisotropy in 119 Sn, 2 H, and 195 Pt NMR spectra.},

  abstract = {Plasmon-enhanced coherent Raman scattering microscopy has reached single-molecule detection sensitivity. Due to the different driven fields, there are significant differences between a coherent Raman scattering process and its plasmon-enhanced derivative. The commonly accepted line shapes for coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and stimulated Raman scattering do not hold for the plasmon-enhanced condition. Here, we present a theoretical model that describes the spectral line shapes in plasmon-enhanced coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (PECARS). Experimentally, we measured PECARS and plasmon-enhanced stimulated Raman scattering (PESRS) spectra of 4-mercaptopyridine adsorbed on the self-assembled Au nanoparticle (NP) substrate and aggregated Au NP colloids. The PECARS spectra show a nondispersive line shape, while the PESRS spectra exhibit a dispersive line shape. PECARS shows a higher signal to noise ratio and a larger enhancement factor than PESRS from the same specimen. It is verified that the nonresonant background in PECARS originates from the photoluminescence of nanostructures. The decoupling of background and the vibrational resonance component results in the nondispersive line shape in PECARS. More local electric field enhancements are involved in the PECARS process than in PESRS, which results in a higher enhancement factor in PECARS. The current work provides new insight into the mechanism of plasmon-enhanced coherent Raman scattering and helps to optimize the experimental design for ultrasensitive chemical imaging.},

Such models have become increasingly popular in molecular simulations given their ability to learn highly complex and multi-dimensional interactions within a local environment; however, many of them fundamentally lack a description of explicit long-range interactions. In order to provide a well-defined benchmark system with precisely known pairwise interactions, we chose as the reference model a flexible version of the Extended Simple Point Charge (SPC/E) water model. Our analysis shows that while local representations are sufficient for predictions of the condensed liquid phase, the short-range nature of machine-learning models falls short in representing cluster and vapor phase properties. These findings provide an improved understanding of the role of long-range interactions in machine learning models and the regimes where they are necessary.},

In this context, the single-level variant of the Landauer approach is most commonly used, but methods based on Marcus theory are also gaining popularity. Recently, a generalized theory unifying these two approaches has also been developed. In the present work, we extend this theory so that it includes entropic effects (which can be important when polar solvents are involved but are likely minor for solid-state systems). We investigate the temperature-dependence of the electric current and compare it to the behavior predicted by the Landauer and the conventional Marcus theory. We argue that this generalized theory provides a simple yet effective framework for understanding charge transport through molecular junctions. Furthermore, we explore the role of the entropic effects in different transport regimes and suggest experimental criteria for detecting them in solvated molecular junctions. Finally, in order to account for nuclear tunneling effects, we also demonstrate how lifetime broadening can be introduced into the Marcus–Levich–Dogonadze–Jortner-type description of electron transport.},

  abstract = {Perturbative nonlinear optical spectroscopies are powerful methods to understand the dynamics of excitonic and other condensed phase systems. Feynman diagrams have long provided the essential tool to understand and interpret experimental spectra and to organize the calculation of spectra for model systems. When optical pulses are strictly time ordered, only a small number of diagrams contribute, but in many experiments, pulse-overlap effects are important for interpreting results. When pulses overlap, the number of contributing diagrams can increase rapidly, especially with higher order spectroscopies, and human error is especially likely when attempting to write down all the diagrams. We present an automated Diagram Generator (DG) that generates all the Feynman diagrams needed to calculate any n th-order spectroscopic signal. We characterize all perturbative nonlinear spectroscopies by their associated phase-discrimination condition as well as the time intervals where pulse amplitudes are nonzero. Although the DG can be used to automate impulsive calculations, its greatest strength lies in automating finite pulse calculations where pulse overlaps are important. We consider third-order transient absorption spectroscopy and fifth-order exciton–exciton interaction 2D (EEI2D) spectroscopy, which are described by six or seven diagrams in the impulsive limit, respectively, but 16 or 240 diagrams, respectively, when pulses overlap. The DG allows users to automatically include all relevant diagrams at a relatively low computational cost, since the extra diagrams are only generated for the inter-pulse delays where they are relevant. For EEI2D spectroscopy, we show the important effects of including the overlap diagrams.},

While intuition about ultrafast spectroscopies is often built by considering impulsive optical pulses, actual experiments have finite-duration pulses, which can be important for interpreting and predicting experimental results. We present a new freely available open source method for spectroscopic modeling, called Ultrafast Ultrafast (UF 2 ) spectroscopy, which enables computationally efficient and convenient prediction of nonlinear spectra, such as treatment of arbitrary finite duration pulse shapes. UF 2 is a Fourier-based method that requires diagonalization of the Liouvillian propagator of the system density matrix. We also present a Runge–Kutta–Euler (RKE) direct propagation method. We include open system dynamics in the secular Redfield, full Redfield, and Lindblad formalisms with Markovian baths. For non-Markovian systems, the degrees of freedom corresponding to memory effects are brought into the system and treated nonperturbatively. We analyze the computational complexity of the algorithms and demonstrate numerically that, including the cost of diagonalizing the propagator, UF 2 is 20–200 times faster than the direct propagation method for secular Redfield models with arbitrary Hilbert space dimension; it is similarly faster for full Redfield models at least up to system dimensions where the propagator requires more than 20 GB to store; and for Lindblad models, it is faster up to Hilbert space dimension near 100 with speedups for small systems by factors of over 500. UF 2 and RKE are part of a larger open source Ultrafast Software Suite, which includes tools for automatic generation and calculation of Feynman diagrams.},

We chose tetracene as a reference donor molecule, where the spectral distribution functions of the local and nonlocal modes are available. We then employ the reduced hierarchical equations of motion approach to simulate the dynamics of the system under the influence of the environment as a function of the electron–phonon coupling strength and temperature. We rigorously calculate the reduced density matrix elements to explain the time scale of dynamics under the influence of the dissipative local and nonlocal modes. The results indicate that the strong nonlocal electron–phonon interaction under high temperature conditions favors the exciton transfer process and enhances the efficiency of organic photovoltaic materials, while the lifetime of the exciton becomes shorter due to a low-frequency local mode.},

While the underlying mechanism is currently still under discussion, two main contributions are considered: The involved plasmonic particles are able to highly confine light to small spatial regions in the near-field, i.e., the electromagnetic effect and the chemical effect due to altered molecular properties of the sample in close proximity to the plasmonic tip. Significant theoretical effort is put into the modeling of the electromagnetic contribution by various groups. In contrast, we previously introduced a computational protocol that allows for the investigation of the local chemical effect—including non-resonant, resonant, and charge transfer contributions—on a plasmonic hybrid system by mapping the sample molecule with a metallic tip model at the (time-dependent) density functional level of theory. In the present contribution, we evaluate the impact of static charges localized on the tip’s frontmost atom, possibly induced by the tip geometry in the vicinity of the apex, on the TERS signal and the lateral resolution. To this aim, an immobilized molecule, i.e., tin(II) phthalocyanine ( SnPc ), is mapped by the plasmonic tip modeled by a single positively vs negatively charged silver atom. The performed quantum chemical simulations reveal a pronounced enhancement of the Raman intensity under non-resonant and resonant conditions with respect to the uncharged reference system, while the contribution of charge transfer phenomena and of locally excited states of SnPc is highly dependent on the tip’s charge.},

Such devices are currently commercially available and have been successfully applied to several combinatorial and discrete optimization problems. However, the application of quantum annealers to problems in chemistry remains a relatively sparse area of research due to the difficulty in mapping molecular systems to the Ising model Hamiltonian. In this paper, we review two different methods for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians using Ising model-based quantum annealers. In addition, we compare the relative effectiveness of each method by calculating the binding energies, bond lengths, and bond angles of the H 3 + and H 2 O molecules and mapping their potential energy curves. We also assess the resource requirements of each method by determining the number of qubits and computation time required to simulate each molecule using various parameter values. While each of these methods is capable of accurately predicting the ground state properties of small molecules, we find that they are still outperformed by modern classical algorithms and that the scaling of the resource requirements remains a challenge.},

  abstract = {Herewith, we propose two new exponents for the recently introduced XDW-CASPT2 method [S. Battaglia and R. Lindh, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16 , 1555–1567 (2020)], which fix one of the largest issues hindering this approach. By using the first-order effective Hamiltonian coupling elements, the weighting scheme implicitly takes into account the symmetry of the states, thereby averaging Fock operators only if the zeroth-order wave functions interact with each other. The use of Hamiltonian couplings also provides a physically sounder approach to quantitate the relative weights; however, it introduces new difficulties when these rapidly die off to zero. The improved XDW-CASPT2 method is critically tested on several systems of photochemical relevance, and it is shown that it succeeds in its original intent of maintaining MS-CASPT2 accuracy for the evaluation of transition energies and at the same time providing smooth potential energy surfaces around near-degenerate points akin to XMS-CASPT2.},

This Perspective will focus on the implementation of semiconductor NCs for photochemical fuel formation. Three general system designs for photocatalytic proton reduction using semiconductor NCs will be reviewed: metal–semiconductor heterostructures, NC photosensitizers with molecular catalysts, and hydrogenase-based systems. Other relevant reactions toward solar fuel targets, such as CO 2 and N 2 reductions with NCs, will also be highlighted. Illustrating the versatile roles that NCs can play in light-driven chemical reactions, advances made toward NC-catalyzed organic transformations will be discussed. Finally, we will share a few concluding thoughts and perspectives on the future of the field, with a focus on goals toward improving and implementing NC-based technologies for solar fuel development.},

  abstract = {The p53 transcription factor is a key mediator in cellular responses to various stress signals including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In this work, we employ landscape and flux theory to investigate underlying mechanisms of p53-regulated cell fate decisions. Based on a p53 regulatory network, we quantified the potential landscape and probabilistic flux for the p53 system. The landscape topography unifies and quantifies three cell fate states, including the limit cycle oscillations (representing cell cycle arrest), high p53 state (characterizing apoptosis), and low p53 state (characterizing the normal proliferative state). Landscape and flux results provide a quantitative explanation for the biphasic dynamics of the p53 system. In the oscillatory phase (first phase), the landscape attracts the system into the ring valley and flux drives the system cyclically moving, leading to cell cycle arrest. In the fate decision-making phase (second phase), the ring valley shape of the landscape provides an efficient way for cells to return to the normal proliferative state once DNA damage is repaired. If the damage is unrepairable with larger flux, the system may cross the barrier between two states and switch to the apoptotic state with a high p53 level. By landscape-flux decomposition, we revealed a trade-off between stability (guaranteed by landscape) and function (driven by flux) in cellular systems. Cells need to keep a balance between appropriate speed to repair DNA damage and appropriate stability to survive. This is further supported by flux landscape analysis showing that flux may provide the dynamical origin of phase transition in a non-equilibrium system by changing landscape topography.},

Lett. 120 , 267801 (2018)] have highlighted the possible role of the tube model’s two-step mechanism in the process of chain relaxation. In this paper, motivated by these findings, we use a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) to study the time evolution, under linear mixed flow, of the linear dimensions of a single finitely extensible Rouse polymer in a solution of other polymers. Approximating the memory function of the GLE, which contains the details of the interactions of the Rouse polymer with its surroundings, by a power law defined by two parameters, we show that the decay of the chain’s fractional extension in the steady state can be expressed in terms of a linear combination of Mittag-Leffler and generalized Mittag-Leffler functions. For the special cases of elongational flow and steady shear flow, and after adjustment of the parameters in the memory function, our calculated decay curves provide satisfactory fits to the experimental decay curves from the work of Zhou and Schroeder and earlier work of Teixeira et al. [Macromolecules 4 0 , 2461 (2007)]. The non-exponential character of the Mittag-Leffler functions and the consequent absence of characteristic decay constants suggest that melt relaxation may proceed by a sequence of steps with an essentially continuous, rather than discrete, spectrum of timescales.},

  abstract = {Despite the remarkable progress of machine learning (ML) techniques in chemistry, modeling the optoelectronic properties of long conjugated oligomers and polymers with ML remains challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient training data. Here, we use transfer learning to address the data scarcity issue by pre-training graph neural networks using data from short oligomers. With only a few hundred training data, we are able to achieve an average error of about 0.1 eV for the excited-state energy of oligothiophenes against time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. We show that the success of our transfer learning approach relies on the relative locality of low-lying electronic excitations in long conjugated oligomers. Finally, we demonstrate the transferability of our approach by modeling the lowest-lying excited-state energies of poly(3-hexylthiophene) in its single-crystal and solution phases using the transfer learning models trained with the data of gas-phase oligothiophenes. The transfer learning predicted excited-state energy distributions agree quantitatively with TDDFT calculations and capture some important qualitative features observed in experimental absorption spectra.},

This generalization reduces in limiting cases to prior theories that restrict double bonding to at most one pair of sites per molecule. We apply the new theory to an associating mixture of colloidal particles (“colloids”) and flexible chain molecules (“linkers”). The linkers have two functional end groups, each of which may bond to one of several sites on the colloids. Due to their flexibility, a significant fraction of linkers can “loop” with both ends bonding to sites on the same colloid instead of bridging sites on different colloids. We use the theory to show that the fraction of linkers in loops depends sensitively on the linker end-to-end distance relative to the colloid bonding-site distance, which suggests strategies for mitigating the loop formation that may otherwise hinder linker-mediated colloidal assembly.},

However, the roles of by-products and amorphous regions generated during the XLPE production are not clearly known at the atomistic scale. In this study, we present an eReaxFF-based molecular dynamics simulation framework with an explicit electron description verified against density functional theory data to investigate the roles of XLPE by-products and processing variables such as density and voids on the time to dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of polyethylene (PE). Our simulation results indicate that an increase in density of PE increases the TDDB; however, adding a by-product with positive electron affinity such as acetophenone can reduce the TDDB. Furthermore, during the electrical breakdown in PE, electrons tend to migrate through voids when transferring from the anode to cathode. In comparison with neutral acetophenone, we find that the acetophenone radical anion can significantly reduce the energy barrier and the reaction energy of secondary chemical reactions.},

The resulting expression for the asymptotic limit of infinite chain length is of similar quality to the numerical evaluation of Marko and Siggia’s variational theory and considerably more precise than their interpolation formula. A comparison to numerical data suggests that our analytical finite chain length corrections achieve a comparable accuracy. As an application of our results, we discuss the possibility of inferring the time-dependent number of nicks in single-molecule stretching experiments on double-stranded DNA from the accompanying changes in the effective chain length.},

In both cases, we obtain the matrix of correlations between the position, velocity, and self-propulsion and the explicit form of the steady-state probability distribution function. Our results reveal the existence of marked equal-time correlations between velocity and active force in the non-equilibrium steady state. Inertia also affects the time-dependent properties of the active particles and leads to non-monotonic decay of the two-time correlation functions of particle positions and velocities. We also study how the virial pressure of particles confined to harmonic traps changes as one goes from the overdamped to the underdamped regime. Finally, the study of the correlations in the underdamped regime is extended to the case of a chain of active particles interacting via harmonic springs.},

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in extending the Köhler theory of cloud droplet activation to include surface active (typically organic) as well as water-soluble (typically inorganic) aerosol components, but a systematic framework for doing this has yet to be developed. Here, we apply a droplet stability analysis to this end. Ideal and Szyszkowski–Langmuir surfactant models are analyzed to demonstrate the new approach, but the underlying theoretical framework is fundamental and model free. A key finding is that superficial densities at the cloud activation threshold (Köhler maximum) are significantly sub-monolayer, with fractional coverage ranging from 69\% to 85\% for the organic compounds and mixtures studied. The result, significant for model inventories of cloud condensation nuclei, is a weakening of the surfactant effect relative to expectations based on bulk sample measurements. Analytical results are obtained for the loci of Köhler maxima and applied to aerosol mixtures containing an arbitrary number of water-soluble and surfactant components.},

Gas molecules attach and accumulate to the interface with an electric field parallel to the interface, while the gas molecules depart and dissolve into the aqueous solutions with a vertical electric field. The above phenomena can be attributed to the redistribution of water molecules as a result of the change of hydrogen bonds of water molecules at the interface as affected by the electric field. This finding reveals a new mechanism of regulating gas accumulation and dissolution in aqueous solutions and can have tremendous applications in the synthesis of drugs, the design of microfluidic device, and the extraction of natural gas.},

  abstract = {Strong coupling between surface plasmons and molecular excitons may lead to the formation of new hybrid states—polaritons—that are part light and part matter in character. A key signature of this strong coupling is an anti-crossing of the exciton and surface plasmon modes on a dispersion diagram. In a recent report on strong coupling between the plasmon modes of a small silver nano-rod and a molecular dye, it was shown that when the oscillator strength of the exciton is large enough, an additional anti-crossing feature may arise in the spectral region where the real part of the permittivity of the excitonic material is zero. However, the physics behind this double anti-crossing feature is still unclear. Here, we make use of extensive transfer matrix simulations to explore this phenomenon. We show that for low oscillator strengths of the excitonic resonance, there is a single anti-crossing arising from strong coupling between the surface plasmon and the excitonic resonance, which is associated with the formation of upper and lower plasmon–exciton polaritons. As the oscillator strength is increased, we find that a new mode emerges between these upper and lower polariton states and show that this new mode is an excitonic surface mode. Our study also features an exploration of the role played by the orientation of the excitonic dipole moment and the relationship between the modes we observe and the transverse and longitudinal resonances associated with the excitonic response. We also investigate why this type of double splitting is rarely observed in experiments.},

However, there is a competition between formation of supported NCs on top of the surface and intercalated NCs under the surface, the latter only dominating at sufficiently high temperature. A stochastic model incorporating appropriate system thermodynamics and kinetics is developed to capture this complex and competitive nucleation and growth process. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation shows that the model captures experimental trends observed for Cu and other metals and reveals that higher temperatures are needed to facilitate detachment of atoms from supported NCs enabling them to reach the gallery.},

A precise understanding of the surface behavior of ferroelectrics is necessary for their use in surface science applications such as catalysis as well as for their incorporation in microelectronic devices. Using the (001) surface of bismuth ferrite as a model system, we show that the most energetically favored surface geometries are combinations of surface termination and polarization direction that lead to uncharged stable surfaces. On the unfavorable charged surfaces, we explore the compensation mechanisms of surface charges provided by the introduction of point defects and adsorbates, such as water.

  abstract = {Strong coupling between various kinds of material excitations and optical modes has recently shown potential to modify chemical reaction rates in both excited and ground states. The ground-state modification in chemical reaction rates has usually been reported by coupling a vibrational mode of an organic molecule to the vacuum field of an external optical cavity, such as a planar Fabry–Pérot microcavity made of two metallic mirrors. However, using an external cavity to form polaritonic states might (i) limit the scope of possible applications of such systems and (ii) might be unnecessary. Here, we highlight the possibility of using optical modes sustained by materials themselves to self-couple to their own electronic or vibrational resonances. By tracing the roots of the corresponding dispersion relations in the complex frequency plane, we show that electronic and vibrational polaritons are natural eigenstates of bulk and nanostructured resonant materials that require no external cavity. Several concrete examples such as a slab of the excitonic material and a spherical water droplet in vacuum are shown to reach the regime of such cavity-free self-strong coupling. The abundance of cavity-free polaritons in simple and natural structures points at their relevance and potential practical importance for the emerging field of polaritonic chemistry, exciton transport, and modified material properties.},

  abstract = {Density is the key quantity for nearly all the numerous theories of the (dynamic) glass transition of supercooled liquids and melts. As mean field quantity, it is used to describe correlations and heterogeneities between regions consisting of several molecules. In contrast, the question how density is created by the interactions (i.e., bonds) within a molecule and to its nearest neighbors is almost unexplored. To investigate this for the example of a homologous series of polyalcohols (glycerol, threitol, xylitol, and sorbitol), Fourier-Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy is carried out in a wide range of temperatures from far above to far below the calorimetric glass transition T g ⁠ . This enables us to determine the potentials and hence the bond lengths of specific intra molecular and inter molecular interactions. While the former has an expansion coefficient of ( ⁠ ∼ 0.1 pm / 100 K ⁠ ) with only smooth changes, the latter shows a 30–40 times stronger response with pronounced kinks at T g ⁠ . A comparison with the overall expansion based on mass density reveals that one has to separate between strong (OH ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ O) and weak (CH ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ O) intermolecular hydrogen (H)-bridges. Despite the fact that the latter dominates glassy dynamics, their expansivity is 5 times smaller than that of the weak H-bridges. It is to be expected that such heterogeneities on intra molecular and inter molecular scales are a general phenomenon in liquids and glassy systems demonstrating especially the necessity of atomistic simulations.},

  abstract = {Depositing a simple organic molecular glass-former 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) onto an interdigitated electrode device via physical vapor deposition gives rise to an unexpected variety of states, as revealed by dielectric spectroscopy. Different preparation parameters, such as deposition temperature, deposition rate, and annealing conditions, lead, on the one hand, to an ultrastable glass and, on the other hand, to a continuum of newfound further states. Deposition below the glass transition temperature of MTHF leads to loss profiles with shape parameters and peak frequencies that differ from those of the known bulk MTHF. These loss spectra also reveal an additional process with Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, which can be more than four decades slower than the main structural relaxation peak. At a given temperature, the time constants of MTHF deposited between 120 K and 127 K span a range of more than three decades and their temperature dependencies change from strong to fragile behavior. This polyamorphism involves at least three distinct states, each persisting for a duration many orders of magnitude above the dielectric relaxation time. These results represent a significant expansion of a previous dielectric study on vapor deposited MTHF [B. Riechers et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 214502 (2019)]. Plastic crystal states and the effects of weak hydrogen bonding are discussed as structural features that could explain these unusual states.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies of the glassy slowdown in molecular liquids indicate that the high-temperature activation energy E ∞ of glass-forming liquids is directly related to their glass transition temperature T g . To further investigate such a possible relation between high- and low-temperature dynamics in glass-forming liquids, we analyze the glassy dynamics of binary mixtures using molecular dynamics simulations. We consider a binary mixture of charged Lennard-Jones particles and vary the partial charges of the particles and, thus, the high-temperature activation energy and the glass transition temperature of the system. Based on previous results, we introduce a phenomenological model describing relaxation times over the whole temperature regime from high temperatures to temperatures well inside the supercooled regime. By investigating the dynamics of both particle species on molecular and diffusive length scales along isochoric and isobaric pathways, we find a quadratic charge dependence of both E ∞ and T g , resulting in an approximately constant ratio of both quantities independent of the underlying observable, the thermodynamic ensemble, and the particle species, and this result is robust against the actual definition of T g . This generic relation between the activation energy and the glass transition temperature indicates that high-temperature dynamics and the glassy slowdown are related phenomena, and the knowledge of E ∞ may allow us to approximately predict T g .},

Here, we theoretically investigate the properties of quantum emitters as a source of entangled photons with practical quantum properties including heralding of on-demand single photons. Through the theoretical analysis, we characterize the properties of a cascade (biexciton) emitter, including (1) studies of single-photon purity, (2) investigating the first- and second-order correlation functions, and (3) determining the Schmidt number of the entangled photons. The analytical expression derived for the Schmidt number of the cascade emitters reveals a strong dependence on the ratio of decay rates of the first and second photons. Looking into the joint spectral density of the generated biphotons, we show how the purity and degree of entanglement are connected to the production of heralded single photons. Our model is further developed to include polarization effects, fine structure splitting, and the emission delay between the exciton and biexciton emission. The extended model offers more details about the underlying mechanism of entangled photon production, and it provides additional degrees of freedom for manipulating the system and characterizing purity of the output photon. The theoretical investigations and the analysis provide a cornerstone for the experimental design and engineering of on-demand single photons.},

The structure of the proposed MOF, named Zinc Triazolate based Framework (ZTF), is obtained by replacing the amine-organic linker of MAF-66 by a triazole, and its structural parameters are deduced. We used grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on generic classical force fields to correctly predict the adsorption isotherms of CO 2 and H 2 O. For water adsorption in MAF-66 and ZTF, simulations revealed that the strong hydrogen bonding interactions of water with the N atoms of triazole rings of the frameworks are the main driving forces for the high adsorption uptake of water. We also show that the proposed ZTF porous material exhibits exceptional high CO 2 uptake capacity at low pressure, better than MAF-66. Moreover, the nature of the interactions between CO 2 and the MAF-66 and ZTF surface cavities was examined at the microscopic level. Computations show that the interactions occur at two different sites, consisting of Lewis acid–Lewis base interactions and hydrogen bonding, together with obvious electrostatic interactions. In addition, we investigated the influence of the presence of H 2 O molecules on the CO 2 adsorption on the ZTF MOF. GCMC simulations reveal that the addition of H 2 O molecules leads to an enhancement of the CO 2 adsorption at very low pressures but a reduction of this CO 2 adsorption at higher pressures.},

  abstract = {The collisions transferring large portions of energy are often called supercollisions. In the H + C 2 H 2 reactive system, the rovibrationally cold C 2 H 2 molecule can be activated with substantial internal excitations by its collision with a translationally hot H atom. It is interesting to investigate the mechanisms of collisional energy transfer in other important reactions of H with hydrocarbons. Here, an accurate, global, full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) of H + C 2 H 4 was constructed by the fundamental invariant neural network fitting based on roughly 100 000 UCCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ data points. Extensive quasi-classical trajectory calculations were carried out on the full-dimensional PES to investigate the energy transfer process in collisions of the translationally hot H atoms with C 2 H 4 in a wide range of collision energies. The computed function of the energy-transfer probability is not a simple exponential decay function but exhibits large magnitudes in the region of a large amount of energy transfer, indicating the signature of supercollisions. The supercollisions among non-complex-forming nonreactive (prompt) trajectories are frustrated complex-forming processes in which the incoming H atom penetrates into C 2 H 4 with a small C–H distance but promptly and directly leaves C 2 H 4 . The complex-forming supercollisions, in which either the attacking H atom leaves (complex-forming nonreactive collisions) or one of the original H atoms of C 2 H 4 leaves (complex-forming reactive trajectories), dominate large energy transfer from the translational energy to internal excitation of molecule. The current work sheds valuable light on the energy transfer of this important reaction in the combustion and may motivate related experimental investigations.},

All-electron FN-DMC calculations and those with the pseudopotential (PP) using SDJ and multi-determinant-Jastrow (MDJ) trial wavefunctions with B3LYP orbitals as well as CC calculations at different levels are carried out on B n Q (n = 1–5, Q = −1, 0, 1) clusters. The obtained FN-DMC energies indicate that the node error of the employed SDJ trial wavefunction in all-electron calculations is different from that with the PP for some clusters. The error of AEs and dissociation energies (DEs) from all-electron FN-DMC calculations is larger than that with the PP when the SDJ trial wavefunction is employed, while errors of CC methods do not depend on whether the PP is used. AEs and DEs of the boron clusters are improved significantly when MDJ trial wavefunctions are used in both all-electron calculations and those with the PP, and their error is similar to that of CCSD(T) compared with CCSDT(Q) results. On the other hand, reasonable adiabatic electron detachment energies (ADEs) and ionization potentials (AIPs) are achieved with FN-DMC using SDJ trial wavefunctions and MDJ is less effective on ADEs and AIPs. Furthermore, the relative energy between two structures of B 9 − is predicted reliably with FN-DMC using the SDJ trial wavefunction and the effect of MDJ is negligible, while density functional theory results using different exchange-correlation functionals differ significantly.},

This process has a low efficiency, typically producing only nJ/pulse of VUV light. Simple models of the tripling process predict that the power of 118 nm light produced should increase quadratically with increasing xenon pressure. However, experimental 118 nm production has been observed to reach a maximum and then decrease to zero with increasing xenon pressure.

  abstract = {The probability of transition to an excited state of a quantum system in a time-dependent electromagnetic field determines the energy uptake from the field. The standard expression for the transition probability has been given by Dirac. Landau and Lifshitz suggested, instead, that the adiabatic effects of a perturbation should be excluded from the transition probability, leaving an expression in terms of the nonadiabatic response. In our previous work, we have found that these two approaches yield different results while a perturbing field is acting on the system. Here, we prove, for the first time, that differences between the two approaches may persist after the perturbing fields have been completely turned off. We have designed a pair of overlapping pulses in order to establish the possibility of lasting differences, in a case with dephasing. Our work goes beyond the analysis presented by Landau and Lifshitz, since they considered only linear response and required that a constant perturbation must remain as t → ∞. First, a “plateau” pulse populates an excited rotational state and produces coherences between the ground and excited states. Then, an infrared pulse acts while the electric field of the first pulse is constant, but after dephasing has occurred. The nonadiabatic perturbation theory permits dephasing, but dephasing of the perturbed part of the wave function cannot occur within Dirac’s method. When the frequencies in both pulses are on resonance, the lasting differences in the calculated transition probabilities may exceed 35\%. The predicted differences are larger for off-resonant perturbations.},

  abstract = {In a previous work [Pan et al., Molecules 23 , 2500 (2018)], a charge projection scheme was reported, where outer molecular mechanical (MM) charges [&gt;10 Å from the quantum mechanical (QM) region] were projected onto the electrostatic potential (ESP) grid of the QM region to accurately and efficiently capture long-range electrostatics in ab initio QM/MM calculations. Here, a further simplification to the model is proposed, where the outer MM charges are projected onto inner MM atom positions (instead of ESP grid positions). This enables a representation of the long-range MM electrostatic potential via augmentary charges (AC) on inner MM atoms. Combined with the long-range electrostatic correction function from Cisneros et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 143 , 044103 (2015)] to smoothly switch between inner and outer MM regions, this new QM/MM-AC electrostatic model yields accurate and continuous ab initio QM/MM electrostatic energies with a 10 Å cutoff between inner and outer MM regions. This model enables efficient QM/MM cluster calculations with a large number of MM atoms as well as QM/MM calculations with periodic boundary conditions.},

The predicted bond-currents can then be used to generate Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values, the results of which validate previous observations of additivity with NICS-XY-Scans. The limitations of the method are probed, leading to clearly delineated and apparently constant error boundaries, which are independent of the molecular size. It is shown that there is a relationship between the accuracy of the predictions and the molecular structure and specific motifs that are especially challenging are identified. The results of the additivity method, combined with the transparent description of its strengths and weaknesses, ensure that this method can be used with well-defined reliability for characterization of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons.

  abstract = {Persistent motion of passive asymmetric bodies in non-equilibrium media has been experimentally observed in a variety of settings. However, fundamental constraints on the efficiency of such motion are not fully explored. Understanding such limits, and ways to circumvent them, is important for efficient utilization of energy stored in agitated surroundings for purposes of taxis and transport. Here, we examine such issues in the context of erratic movements of a passive asymmetric dumbbell driven by non-equilibrium noise. For uncorrelated (white) noise, we find a (non-Boltzmann) joint probability distribution for the velocity and orientation, which indicates that the dumbbell preferentially moves along its symmetry axis. The dumbbell thus behaves as an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck walker, a prototype of active matter. Exploring the efficiency of this active motion, we show that in the over-damped limit, the persistence length l of the dumbbell is bound from above by half its mean size, while the propulsion speed v ∥ is proportional to its inverse size. The persistence length can be increased by exploiting inertial effects beyond the over-damped regime, but this improvement always comes at the price of smaller propulsion speeds. This limitation is explained by noting that the diffusivity of a dumbbell, related to the product v ∥ l , is always less than that of its components, thus severely constraining the usefulness of passive dumbbells as active particles.},

  abstract = {Microkinetic modeling has drawn increasing attention for quantitatively analyzing catalytic networks in recent decades, in which the speed and stability of the solver play a crucial role. However, for the multi-step complex systems with a wide variation of rate constants, the often encountered stiff problem leads to the low success rate and high computational cost in the numerical solution. Here, we report a new efficient sensitivity-supervised interlock algorithm (SSIA), which enables us to solve the steady state of heterogeneous catalytic systems in the microkinetic modeling with a 100\% success rate. In SSIA, we introduce the coverage sensitivity of surface intermediates to monitor the low-precision time-integration of ordinary differential equations, through which a quasi-steady-state is located. Further optimized by the high-precision damped Newton’s method, this quasi-steady-state can converge with a low computational cost. Besides, to simulate the large differences (usually by orders of magnitude) among the practical coverages of different intermediates, we propose the initial coverages in SSIA to be generated in exponential space, which allows a larger and more realistic search scope. On examining three representative catalytic models, we demonstrate that SSIA is superior in both speed and robustness compared with its traditional counterparts. This efficient algorithm can be promisingly applied in existing microkinetic solvers to achieve large-scale modeling of stiff catalytic networks.},

Korol et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 124103 (2019) and R. Korol et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 104102 (2020)]. In particular, the BCOCB scheme, obtained via Cayley modification of the standard BAOAB scheme, features a simple reparametrization of the free ring-polymer sub-step that confers strong stability and dimensionality freedom and has been shown to yield excellent numerical accuracy in condensed-phase systems with large time steps. Here, we introduce a broader class of T-RPMD numerical integrators that exhibit strong stability and dimensionality freedom, irrespective of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck friction schedule. In addition to considering equilibrium accuracy and time step stability as in previous work, we evaluate the integrators on the basis of their rates of convergence to equilibrium and their efficiency at evaluating equilibrium expectation values. Within the generalized class, we find BCOCB to be superior with respect to accuracy and efficiency for various configuration-dependent observables, although other integrators within the generalized class perform better for velocity-dependent quantities. Extensive numerical evidence indicates that the stated performance guarantees hold for the strongly anharmonic case of liquid water. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that BCOCB excels over other known integrators in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and stability with respect to time step for practical applications.},

This is in contrast to conventional fluids, which are incompressible for velocities much below the speed of sound, and can cause inhomogeneities in density. We propose an algorithm for MPCD with a modified collision rule that results in a non-ideal equation of state and a significantly decreased compressibility. It allows simulations at less computational costs compared to conventional MPCD algorithms. We derive analytic expressions for the equation of state and the corresponding compressibility as well as shear viscosity. They show overall very good agreement with simulations, where we determine the pressure by simulating a quiet bulk fluid and the shear viscosity by simulating a linear shear flow and a Poiseuille flow.},

  abstract = {Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy could produce ultrahigh-resolution Raman spectra and images for single-molecule vibrations. Furthermore, a recent experimental study successfully decoupled the interaction between the molecule and the substrate/tip to investigate the intrinsic properties of molecules and their near-field interactions by Raman spectroscopy. In such a circumstance, more explicit treatments of the near field and molecular interactions beyond the dipole approximation would be desirable. Here, we propose a theoretical method based on the multipolar Hamiltonian that considers full spatial distribution of the electric field under the framework of real-time time-dependent density functional theory. This approach allows us to treat the on- and off-resonance Raman phenomena on the same footing. For demonstration, a model for the on- and off-resonance tip-enhanced Raman process in benzene was constructed. The obtained Raman spectra are well understood by considering both the spatial structure of the near field and the molecular vibration in the off-resonance condition. For the on-resonance condition, the Raman spectra are governed by the transition moment, in addition to the selection rule of off-resonance Raman. Interestingly, on-resonance Raman can be activated even when the near field forbids the π – π * transition at equilibrium geometry due to vibronic couplings originating from structural distortions.},

  abstract = {The exchange terms in symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) are normally calculated within the so-called S 2 or single exchange approximation , which approximates the all-electron antisymmetrizer by interchanges of at most one electron pair between the interacting molecules. This approximation is typically very accurate at the van der Waals minimum separation and at larger intermolecular distances but begins to deteriorate at short range. Nonapproximated expressions for the second-order SAPT exchange corrections have been derived some time ago by Schäffer and Jansen [Mol. Phys. 111 , 2570 (2013)]. In this work, we extend Schäffer and Jansen’s formalism to derive and implement a nonapproximated expression for the third-order exchange-induction correction. Numerical tests on several representative noncovalent databases show that the S 2 approximation underestimates the exchange-induction contributions in both second and third orders. This underestimation is very similar in relative terms, but the larger absolute values of the third-order exchange-induction effects, and their near complete cancellation with the corresponding induction energies, make the third-order errors more severe. In the worst-case scenario of interactions involving ions, the breakdown of the S 2 approximation can result in a qualitatively wrong, attractive character of SAPT total energies at short range {as first observed by Lao and Herbert [J. Phys. Chem. A 116 , 3042 (2012)]}. As expected, the inclusion of the full third-order exchange-induction energy in place of its S 2 -approximated counterpart restores the correct, repulsive short-range behavior of the SAPT potential energy curves computed through the third order.},

Doing so improves many computed properties, bringing them into better agreement with experimental observations or with results from high-level quantum chemistry calculations. However, while PZ-SIC generally corrects in the right direction relative to the corresponding reference values, in many cases, it over-corrects. For this reason, scaled-down versions of PZ-SIC have been proposed and investigated. These approaches have mostly employed exterior scaling in which SIC correction terms are scaled in the same way at every point in space. Recently, a new local, or interior, scaling SIC method was proposed on non-empirical grounds to restore a property of the exact, but unknown, density functional that is broken in PZ-SIC. In this approach, the scaling at each point depends on the character of the charge density at that point. However, the local scaling can be done in various ways while still restoring the behavior of the exact functional. In this work, we compare and contrast the performance of various interior scaling approaches for addressing over-corrections of calculated molecular dipole moments and atomic polarizabilities and properties that reflect the nature of the electronic charge density.},

  abstract = {Exchange and correlation holes are unique quantum concepts for understanding the nature of electron interactions based on quantum conditional probabilities. Among those, the exact exchange hole is of special interest since it is derived rigorously from first principles without approximations and is often modeled by approximate exchange expressions of density functional theory. In this work, the algorithm for the computation of the spherically averaged exact exchange hole for a given reference point is developed and implemented for molecular orbitals in Gaussian basis functions. The formulas include a novel recursive relation for the spherical average of the Bessel function of the first kind and the asymptotic expressions when the exponential factor of the Bessel function becomes large. This new capability is used to explore the extent to which current popular model exchange holes resemble or differ from the exact exchange hole. Point-wise accuracy of the exchange holes for isolated atoms is important in local hybrid schemes, real-space models of static correlation, and others. We find in this vein that among the models tested here, only the BR89 exchange hole seems more or less suitable for that purpose, while better approximations are still very much on demand. Analyzing the deviations of model exchange holes from the exact exchange hole in molecules such as H 2 and Cr 2 upon bond stretching reveals new aspects of the left-right static correlation.},

We plot mean-field phase diagrams in the plane of segregation strength and composition for an array of representative star copolymers. Three principal phase diagram topologies, dictated by different phase stabilities, are exposed, displaying a hierarchy in complexity by increasing the molecular asymmetry. Our investigation indicates that the phase diagram topology depends on the ratios of arm numbers and Kuhn segment lengths, which highlights the role of the coordination number ratio between different polymers at the domain interface. These findings reveal the simplicity of the general phase behavior and suggest a complete list of stable microphases for the entire class, which provide useful insight into studying copolymers with more complicated architectures and conformational properties.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that the mechanically defined “isothermal” compressibility behaves as a thermodynamic-like response function for suspensions of active Brownian particles. The compressibility computed from the active pressure—a combination of the collision and unique swim pressures—is capable of predicting the critical point for motility induced phase separation, as expected from the mechanical stability criterion. We relate this mechanical definition to the static structure factor via an active form of the thermodynamic compressibility equation and find the two to be equivalent, as would be the case for equilibrium systems. This equivalence indicates that compressibility behaves like a thermodynamic response function, even when activity is large. Finally, we discuss the importance of the phase interface when defining an active chemical potential. Previous definitions of the active chemical potential are shown to be accurate above the critical point but breakdown in the coexistence region. Inclusion of the swim pressure in the mechanical compressibility definition suggests that the interface is essential for determining phase behavior.},

In order to rule out the possibility that this wide smectic-A phase is merely an artifact caused by the one-species approximation, we investigate an extension that accounts explicitly for cations and anions in ILCs. Our present findings, obtained by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, show that the phase transitions between the isotropic and the smectic-A phases of the cation–anion system are in qualitative agreement with the effective one-species model used in the preceding studies. In particular, for ILCs with mesogens (i.e., liquid–crystal forming species) carrying charged sites at their tips, the wide smectic-A phase forms, at low temperatures and within an intermediate density range, in between the isotropic and hexagonal crystal phases. We find that in the ordinary smectic-A phase, the spatial distribution of the counterions of the mesogens is approximately uniform, whereas in the wide smectic-A phase, the small counterions accumulate in between the smectic layers. Due to this phenomenology, the wide smectic-A phase could be interesting for applications, which hinge on the presence of conductivity channels for mobile ions.},

One consequence of this asymmetry is thought to be the emergence of differential stress, i.e., a mismatch in the lateral tension of the two leaflets. This can affect a membrane’s mechanical properties; for instance, it can increase the bending rigidity once the differential stress exceeds a critical threshold. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations based on the MARTINI model, we show that this effect arises due to the formation of more highly ordered domains in the compressed leaflet. The threshold asymmetry increases with temperature, indicating that the transition to a stiffened regime might be restricted to a limited temperature range above the gel transition. We also show that stiffening occurs more readily for larger membranes with smaller typical curvatures, suggesting that the stiffening transition is easier to observe experimentally than in the small-scale systems accessible to simulation.},

In recent years, there has been much interest in studying such a strong coupling in the limit of single emitters. However, the lossy nature of PCs, reflected in their broad spectra, limits their quality factors and hence their performance as cavities. Here, we study the effect of the adhesion layer used in the fabrication of metal nanostructures on the spectral linewidths of bowtie-structured PCs. Using dark-field microspectroscopy, as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy, it is found that a reduction in the thickness of the chromium adhesion layer we use from 3 nm to 0.1 nm decreases the linewidths of both bright and dark plasmonic modes. We further show that it is possible to fabricate bowtie PCs without any adhesion layer, in which case the linewidth may be narrowed by as much as a factor of 2. Linewidth reduction increases the quality factor of these PCs accordingly, and it is shown to facilitate reaching the strong-coupling regime with semiconductor quantum dots.},

The results show that the promoted rWGS activity by Pt 3 Ni strongly depends on the ensemble effect (a particular arrangement of active sites introduced by alloying), while the contributions from ligand and strain effects, which are of great importance in electrocatalysis, are rather subtle. As a result, a unique Ni–Pt hybrid ensemble is observed at the 110/111 edge of the Pt 3 Ni NW, where the synergy between Ni and Pt sites is active enough to stabilize carbon dioxide on the surface readily for the rWGS reaction but moderate enough to allow for the facile removal of carbon monoxide and hydrogenation of hydroxyl species.

Yet, the mechanism and what controls energy barriers for this process remain poorly understood. It was shown that mixing phosphoric acid (PA) with lidocaine leads to an increase in proton conductivity at the same liquid viscosity. However, recent simulations of mixtures of PA with various bases, including lidocaine, suggested no decrease in the proton transfer energy barrier. To elucidate this surprising result, we have performed broadband dielectric spectroscopy to verify the predictions of the simulations for mixtures of PA with several bases. Our results reveal that adding bases to PA increases the energy barriers for proton transfer, and the observed increase in proton conductivity at a similar viscosity appears to be related to the increase in the glass transition temperature (T g ) of the mixture. Moreover, the energy barrier seems to increase with T g of the mixtures, emphasizing the importance of molecular mobility or interactions in the proton transfer mechanism.},

A perturbative approach is used to solve time dependent quantum mode-coupling equations to study in detail the dynamics of the supercooled liquid in the moderate quantum regime. Similar to the classical case, the relaxation time shows the power-law increase with the increase in the density in the supercooled regime. However, the power-law exponent is found to be dependent on the quantumness; it increases linearly as the quantumness is increased in the moderate quantum regime.},

We report on an experimental observation of phonon-polaritons in glasses, including a prominent boson peak (BP), i.e., excess of THz modes over the Debye law. A theoretical framework based on the concept of diffusons is developed to describe the broadening linewidth of the polariton due to disorder-induced scattering. It is shown here for the first time that the BP frequency and the Ioffe–Regel (IR) crossover frequency of the polariton collapse onto the same power-law decay with the diffusivity of the bosonic excitation. This analysis dismisses the hypothesis of the BP being caused by a relic of the van Hove singularity. The presented framework establishes a new methodology to analyze bosonic excitations in amorphous media, well beyond the traditional case of acoustic phonons, and establishes the IR crossover as the fundamental physical mechanism behind the BP.},

For clusters featuring only acid–base linkages, water adopts a bridging arrangement spanning an adjacent ammonium and bisulfate. For larger clusters, water can also insert into a bisulfate–bisulfate hydrogen bond, yielding hydration isomers with very similar binding energies. The population of these isomers shows a complex temperature evolution, as an apparent third isomer appears with a temperature dependence that is difficult to explain using simple thermodynamic arguments.

For plasmon mode frequencies below the vertical photoexcitation energy of the molecule, the difference between the excitation and emission energies is converted into vibrational energy on the molecular ground state in a Raman-like process. Under the correct conditions, this energy can be high enough to enable efficient photodissociation on the electronic ground state.

Hydrogen atoms are produced within solid parahydrogen as the by-products of the 193 nm in situ photolysis of N 2 O, which induces a two-step tunneling reaction, H + N 2 O → cis -HNNO → trans -HNNO. The second-order rate constant for the first step to form cis -HNNO is found to be inversely proportional to the N 2 O concentration after photolysis, indicating that the hydrogen atoms move through solid parahydrogen via quantum diffusion. This reaction only readily occurs at temperatures below 2.8 K, not due to an increased rate constant for the first reaction step at low temperatures but rather due to an increased selectivity to the reaction. The rate constant for the second step of the reaction mechanism involving unimolecular isomerization is shown to be independent of the N 2 O concentration as expected. The inverse concentration dependence of the rate constant for the reaction step that involves the hydrogen atom demonstrates clearly that quantum diffusion influences the reactivity of the hydrogen atoms in solid parahydrogen, which does not have an analogy in classical reaction kinetics.},

The dynamics of the electronic response of ensembles of CdSe QDs in the solution and of QD dimers in the solid state is probed by a sequence of 3 fs laser pulses as in two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy. The quantum dynamics is computed using an excitonic model Hamiltonian based on the effective mass approximation. The Hamiltonian includes the Coulomb, spin–orbit, and crystal field interactions that give rise to the fine structure splittings. In the dimers studied, the interdot distance is sufficiently small to allow for an efficient interdot coupling and delocalization of the excitons over the two QDs of the dimer. To account for the inherent few percent size dispersion of colloidal QDs, the optical response is modeled by averaging over an ensemble of 2000 dimers. The size dispersion is responsible for an inhomogeneous broadening that limits the lifetimes of the excitonic coherences that can be probed to about 150 fs–200 fs. Simulations and experimental measurements in the solid state and in the solution demonstrate that during that time scale, a very rich electronic coherent dynamics takes place that involves several types of intradot and interdot (in the case of dimers) coherences. These electronic coherences exhibit a wide range of beating periods and provide a versatile basis for a quantum information processing device on a fs time scale at room temperature.},

As a result, there has been a recent push for new experimental methodologies that can provide comprehensive information about a complex system, while significantly reducing the duration of the experiment. Here, we present a pan-sharpening approach to hyperspectral EELS analysis, where we acquire two datasets from the same region (one with high spatial resolution and one with high spectral fidelity) and combine them to achieve a single dataset with the beneficial properties of both. This work outlines a straightforward, reproducible pathway to reduced experiment times and higher signal-to-noise ratios, while retaining the relevant physical parameters of the plasmonic response, and is generally applicable to a wide range of spectroscopy modalities.},

  abstract = {Photon conversion embodies a range of promising possibilities in pushing the theoretical Shockley–Queisser efficiency model of classical solar cells. Luminescent down-conversion, despite its potential, is held back in practical applications due to the difficulty of proper characterization in no small part because of concurrent luminescent downshifting events. Recent advances have demonstrated the opportunity provided by photon correlation measurement for down-conversion characterization. In this methodological work, we present a general method based on Bayesian probabilities for deriving auto-correlation functions analytically. This method is then applied to the five down-conversion mechanisms reported in the literature and successfully tested against numerical simulations. We show that the zero delay auto-correlation function can be the most direct way to demonstrate down-conversion and assess its efficiency. Our analysis offers additional useful tools for the design of characterization experiments and emphasizes some universal behavior valid for all reported conversion mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Excited Costrained Density Functional Theory (XCDFT) [Ramos and Pavanello, J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 144103 (2018)] is a variational excited state method that extends ground state DFT to the computation of low-lying excited states. It borrows much of the machinery of Constrained DFT (CDFT) with a crucial difference: the constraint imposes a population of one electron in the Hilbert space spanned by the virtuals of a reference ground state. In this work, we present theory and implementation for evaluating nonadiabatic coupling vectors (NACVs) between the first excited state computed with XCDFT and the ground state. Our NACVs are computed analytically using density functional perturbation theory with a formalism that is general enough that could be applied to CDFT diabatic states. We showcase the new method with pilot NACV calculations for the conical intersection in H 3 , the avoided crossing in selenoacrolein, and the NACV magnitudes in azobenzene. Despite complications from the nonorthogonality of the wavefunctions, XCDFT’s energy surfaces and NACVs reproduce benchmark values and respect known sum rules within a reasonable degree. This shows that XCDFT is a viable method for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Computational studies of crystal nucleation can be impacted by finite size effects, primarily due to unphysical interactions between crystalline nuclei and their periodic images. It is, however, not always feasible to systematically investigate the sensitivity of nucleation kinetics and mechanism to system size due to large computational costs of nucleation studies. Here, we use jumpy forward flux sampling to accurately compute the rates of heterogeneous ice nucleation in the vicinity of square-shaped model structureless ice nucleating particles (INPs) of different sizes and identify three distinct regimes for the dependence of rate on the INP dimension, L . For small INPs, the rate is a strong function of L due to the artificial spanning of critical nuclei across the periodic boundary. Intermediate-sized INPs, however, give rise to the emergence of non-spanning “proximal” nuclei that are close enough to their periodic images to fully structure the intermediary liquid. While such proximity can facilitate nucleation, its effect is offset by the higher density of the intermediary liquid, leading to artificially small nucleation rates overall. The critical nuclei formed at large INPs are neither spanning nor proximal. Yet, the rate is a weak function of L , with its logarithm scaling linearly with 1/ L . The key heuristic emerging from these observations is that finite size effects will be minimal if critical nuclei are neither spanning nor proximal and if the intermediary liquid has a region that is structurally indistinguishable from the supercooled liquid under the same conditions.},

  abstract = {Using large deviation theory and principles of stochastic optimal control, we show that rare molecular dynamics trajectories conditioned on assembling a specific target structure encode a set of interactions and external forces that lead to enhanced stability of that structure. Such a relationship can be formulated into a variational principle, for which we have developed an associated optimization algorithm and have used it to determine optimal forces for targeted self-assembly within nonequilibrium steady-states. We illustrate this perspective on inverse design in a model of colloidal cluster assembly within linear shear flow. We find that colloidal clusters can be assembled with high yield using specific short-range interactions of tunable complexity. Shear decreases the yields of rigid clusters, while small values of shear increase the yields of nonrigid clusters. The enhancement or suppression of the yield due to shear is rationalized with a generalized linear response theory. By studying 21 unique clusters made of six, seven, or eight particles, we uncover basic design principles for targeted assembly out of equilibrium.},

Instead of addressing this problem by including additional electron correlation, we propose an explicit treatment of orbital relaxation via the use of “transition potential” reference orbitals, leading to a transition-potential coupled cluster (TP-CC) family of methods. One member of this family, in particular, TP-CCSD( ⁠ 1 2 ⁠ ), is found to essentially eliminate the orbital relaxation error and achieve the same level of accuracy for the core-hole spectra as is typically expected of EOM-CCSD in the valence region. These results show that very accurate x-ray absorption spectra for molecules with first-row atoms can be computed at a cost essentially the same as that for EOM-CCSD.},

  abstract = {The complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method is a canonical electronic structure theory that holds a central place in conceptualizing and practicing first principles simulations. For application to realistic molecules, however, the CASSCF must be approximated to circumvent its exponentially scaling computational costs. Applying the many-body expansion—also known as the method of increments—to CASSCF (iCASSCF) has been shown to produce a polynomially scaling method that retains much of the accuracy of the parent theory and is capable of treating full valence active spaces. Due to an approximation made in the orbital gradient, the orbital parameters of the original iCASSCF formulation could not be variationally optimized, which limited the accuracy of its nuclear gradient. Herein, a variational iCASSCF is introduced and implemented, where all parameters are fully optimized during energy minimization. This method is able to recover electronic correlations from the full valence space in large systems, produce accurate gradients, and optimize stable geometries as well as transition states. Demonstrations on challenging test cases, such as the oxoMn(salen)Cl complex with 84 electrons in 84 orbitals and the automerization of cyclobutadiene, show that the fully variational iCASSCF is a powerful tool for describing challenging molecular chemistries.},

  abstract = {We introduce new functionals for the Kohn–Sham correlation energy that are based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem and are named σ -functionals. Like in the well-established direct random phase approximation (dRPA), σ -functionals require as input exclusively eigenvalues σ of the frequency-dependent KS response function. In the new functionals, functions of σ replace the σ -dependent dRPA expression in the coupling-constant and frequency integrations contained in the ACFD theorem. We optimize σ -functionals with the help of reference sets for atomization, reaction, transition state, and non-covalent interaction energies. The optimized functionals are to be used in a post-self-consistent way using orbitals and eigenvalues from conventional Kohn–Sham calculations employing the exchange–correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof. The accuracy of the presented approach is much higher than that of dRPA methods and is comparable to that of high-level wave function methods. Reaction and transition state energies from σ -functionals exhibit accuracies close to 1 kcal/mol and thus approach chemical accuracy. For the 10 966 reactions of the W4-11RE reference set, the mean absolute deviation is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 3.21 kcal/mol in the dRPA case. Non-covalent binding energies are accurate to a few tenths of a kcal/mol. The presented approach is highly efficient, and the post-self-consistent calculation of the total energy requires less computational time than a density-functional calculation with a hybrid functional and thus can be easily carried out routinely. σ -Functionals can be implemented in any existing dRPA code with negligible programming effort.},

This work follows naturally from the supporting subspace formulation of the CASPT2 energy in terms of the MP2 energy using dressed orbitals and Fock builds. For a given active space configuration, the terms corresponding to the MP2-gradient can be evaluated with O(N 5 ) operations, while the rest of the calculations can be computed with O(N 3 ) operations using Fock builds, Fock gradients, and linear algebra. When tensor-hyper-contraction is applied simultaneously, the computational cost can be further reduced to O(N 4 ) for a fixed active space size. The new formulation enables efficient implementation of CASPT2 analytical gradients by leveraging the existing graphical processing unit (GPU)-based MP2 and Fock routines. We present benchmark results that demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the new method.

Here, we provide a detailed analysis of its structure for exactly solvable systems that model two phenomena: cavity-induced suppression of proton-coupled electron-transfer and its dependence on the initial state, and cavity-induced electronic excitation. We demonstrate the inadequacy of simply using a weighted average of polaritonic surfaces to determine the dynamics. Such a weighted average misses a crucial term that redistributes energy between the nuclear and the polaritonic systems, and this term can in fact become a predominant term in determining the nuclear dynamics when several polaritonic surfaces are involved. Evolving an ensemble of classical trajectories on the exact potential energy surface reproduces the nuclear wavepacket quite accurately, while evolving on the weighted polaritonic surface fails after a short period of time. The implications and prospects for application of mixed quantum-classical methods based on this surface are discussed.},

  abstract = {This study arises from the attempt to answer the following question: how different descriptions of electronic exchange and correlation affect the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy of H 2 , N 2 , and CO 2 molecules? We compare HHG spectra for H 2 , N 2 , and CO 2 with different ab initio electronic structure methods: real-time time-dependent configuration interaction and real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) using truncated basis sets composed of correlated wave functions expanded on Gaussian basis sets. In the framework of RT-TDDFT, we employ Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and long-range corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (LC- ω PBE) functionals. We study HHG spectroscopy by disentangling the effect of electronic exchange and correlation. We first analyze the electronic exchange alone, and in the case of RT-TDDFT with LC- ω PBE, we use ω = 0.3 and ω = 0.4 to tune the percentage of long-range Hartree–Fock exchange and short-range exchange PBE. Then, we added the correlation as described by the PBE functional. All the methods give very similar HHG spectra, and they seem not to be particularly sensitive to the different description of exchange and correlation or to the correct asymptotic behavior of the Coulomb potential. Despite this general trend, some differences are found in the region connecting the cutoff and the background. Here, the harmonics can be resolved with different accuracy depending on the theoretical schemes used. We believe that the investigation of the molecular continuum and its coupling with strong fields merits further theoretical investigations in the near future.},

In a single consistent framework, our plane wave based scheme embeds a local high-level correlation calculation [here, Coupled Cluster (CC) theory], employing localized orbitals, into a low-level correlation calculation [here, the direct Random Phase Approximation (RPA)]. This choice allows for an accurate and efficient treatment of long-range dispersion effects. Accelerated convergence with respect to the local fragment size can be observed if the low-level and high-level long-range dispersions are quantitatively similar, as is the case for CC in RPA. To demonstrate the capabilities of the introduced embedding approach, we calculate adsorption energies of molecules on a surface and in a chabazite crystal cage, as well as the formation energy of a lattice impurity in a solid at the level of highly accurate many-electron perturbation theories. The absorption energy of a methane molecule in a zeolite chabazite is converged with an error well below 20 meV at the CC level. As our largest periodic benchmark system, we apply our scheme to the adsorption of a water molecule on titania in a supercell containing more than 1000 electrons.},
