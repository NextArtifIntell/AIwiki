  abstract     = {Domain adaptation utilizes learned knowledge from an existing domain (source domain) to improve the classification performance of another related, but not identical, domain (target domain). Most existing domain adaptation methods first perform domain alignment, then apply standard classification algorithms. Transfer classifier induction is an emerging domain adaptation approach that incorporates the domain alignment into the process of building an adaptive classifier instead of using a standard classifier. Although transfer classifier induction approaches have achieved promising performance, they are mainly gradient-based approaches which can be trapped at local optima. In this article, we propose a transfer classifier induction algorithm based on evolutionary computation to address the above limitation. Specifically, a novel representation of the transfer classifier is proposed which has much lower dimensionality than the standard representation in existing transfer classifier induction approaches. We also propose a hybrid process to optimize two essential objectives in domain adaptation: 1) the manifold consistency and 2) the domain difference. Particularly, the manifold consistency is used in the main fitness function of the evolutionary search to preserve the intrinsic manifold structure of the data. The domain difference is reduced via a gradient-based local search applied to the top individuals generated by the evolutionary search. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than seven state-of-the-art traditional domain adaptation algorithms and four state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation algorithms.},

Performance measures are designed by following a long-term tracking definition to maximize the analysis probing strength. The new measures outperform existing ones in interpretation potential and in better distinguishing between different tracking behaviors. We show that these measures generalize the short-term performance measures, thus linking the two tracking problems. Furthermore, the new measures are highly robust to temporal annotation sparsity and allow annotation of sequences hundreds of times longer than in the current datasets without increasing manual annotation labor. A new challenging dataset of carefully selected sequences with many target disappearances is proposed. A new tracking taxonomy is proposed to position trackers on the short-term/long-term spectrum. The benchmark contains an extensive evaluation of the largest number of long-term trackers and comparison to state-of-the-art short-term trackers. We analyze the influence of tracking architecture implementations to long-term performance and explore various redetection strategies as well as the influence of visual model update strategies to long-term tracking drift.

Inspired by the cooperative learning behavior in human society, mass learning and elite learning are involved in TPLSO. In the mass learning phase, TPLSO randomly selects three particles to form a study group and then adopts a competitive mechanism to update the members of the study group. Then, we sort all of the particles in the swarm and pick out the elite particles that have better fitness values. In the elite learning phase, the elite particles learn from each other to further search for more promising areas. The theoretical analysis of TPLSO exploration and exploitation abilities is performed and compared with several popular particle swarm optimizers. Comparative experiments on two widely used large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed TPLSO achieves better performance on diverse large-scale problems than several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The objective is to minimize the vehicle’s total travel distance to visit all the targets while satisfying all the precedence constraints. We show that the optimization problem is NP-hard, and consequently, to measure the proximity of a suboptimal solution from the optimal, a lower bound on the optimal solution is constructed based on the graph theory. Then, inspired by the existing topological sorting techniques, a new topological sorting strategy is proposed; in addition, facilitated by the sorting, we propose several heuristic algorithms to solve the task planning problem.

Planning such suitable paths is often based on big data processing in cybernetics, while not many investigations have been done. We attempt to find the optimal path for vessels in the ocean by proposing an online learning dispatch approach on studying the mission–executing–feedback (MEF) model. The proposed approach explores the ocean subdomain (OS) to achieve the largest average traveling feedback for different vessels. It balances the ocean path by a deep and wide search, and considers adaptation for these vessels. Further, we propose a contextual multiarmed bandit-based algorithm, which provides accurate exploration results with sublinear regret and significantly improves the learning speed. The experimental results show that the proposed MEF approach possesses 90\% accuracy gain over random exploration and achieves about 25\% accuracy improvement over other contextual bandit models on supporting big data online learning pre-eminently.},

In the dimensionality reduction process, the numerical data are granulated using a collection of information granules forming a new sequence that can well describe the original time series. Then, when clustering the time series, dynamic time warping (DTW) is employed to measure the similarity between time series and DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) is generalized to weighted DBA to be involved in the fuzzy ${C}$ -means (FCMs) algorithm.

Most existing deep hashing approaches cannot fully consider the global semantic similarity and category-level semantic information, which result in the insufficient utilization of the global semantic similarity for hash codes learning and the semantic information loss of hash codes. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel deep hashing approach with triplet labels, namely, deep category-level and regularized hashing (DCRH), to leverage the global semantic similarity of deep feature and category-level semantic information to enhance the semantic similarity of hash codes. There are four contributions in this article. First, we design a novel global semantic similarity constraint about the deep feature to make the anchor deep feature more similar to the positive deep feature than to the negative deep feature. Second, we leverage label information to enhance category-level semantics of hash codes for hash codes learning. Third, we develop a new triplet construction module to select good image triplets for effective hash functions learning. Finally, we propose a new triplet regularized loss (Reg-L) term, which can force binary-like codes to approximate binary codes and eventually minimize the information loss between binary-like codes and binary codes. Extensive experimental results in three image retrieval benchmark datasets show that the proposed DCRH approach achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art hashing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Visual acuity (VA) measurement is utilized to test a subject’s acuteness of vision. Conventional VA measurement requires a physician’s assistance to ask a subject to speak out or wave a hand in response to the direction of an optotype. To avoid this repetitive testing procedure, different types of automatic VA tests have been developed in recent years by adopting contact-based responses, such as pushing buttons or keyboards on a device. However, contact-based testing is not as intuitive as speaking or waving hands, and it may distract the subjects from concentrating on the VA test. Moreover, problems related to hygiene may arise if all the subjects operate on the same testing device. To overcome these problems, we propose an intelligent VA estimation (iVAE) system for automatic VA measurements that assists the subject to respond in an intuitive, noncontact manner. VA estimation algorithms using maximum likelihood (VAML) are developed to automatically estimate the subject’s vision by compromising between a prespecified logistic function and a machine-learning technique. The neural-network model adapts human learning behavior to consider the accuracy of recognizing the optotype as well as the reaction time of the subject. Furthermore, a velocity-based hand motion recognition algorithm is adopted to classify hand motion data, collected by a sensing device, into one of the four optotype directions. Realistic experiments show that the proposed iVAE system outperforms the conventional line-by-line testing method as it is approximately ten times faster in testing trials while achieving a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution error of less than 0.2. We believe that our proposed system provides a method for accurate and fast noncontact automatic VA testing.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the noise contamination in spatial filtering of brain responses using a novel signaling game-based approach to the optimal selection of EEG electrodes. The proposed method takes the standard common spatial pattern (CSP) filter as an input and produces an optimal electrode set as output for effective classification of different cognitive tasks. The standard CSP algorithms are highly prone to the inclusion of noise in the EEG data and may select noisy electrodes/signal sources that are redundant for a specific cognitive task which, in turn, may lead to a lower classification accuracy. A lot of literature exists in this area of research, most of which deals with adding the regularization term in the standard CSP algorithm. However, all of these methods lack capturing the uncertainty present in the EEG responses due to intrasession and intersession variations of subjective brain response. The novelty of this article lies in designing the fuzzy signaling game-based approach for optimal electrode selection using an interval type-2 fuzzy set, which can capture both the intrasession and intersession variability of EEG responses acquired from a subject’s scalp. Experiments are undertaken over a wide variety of possible cognitive task classification problems which reveal that the proposed method yields superior results in electrode selection with respect to classification accuracy. Statistical tests undertaken using the Friedman test also confirm the superiority of the proposed method over its competitors.},

However, existing state-of-the-art methods require high-end GPUs to achieve real-time performance, which makes it hard to adapt to low cost or portable devices. Although generic network architectures have been proposed to speed up inference on mobile devices, they are tailored to the task of image classification or semantic segmentation, and struggle to capture intrachannel and interchannel correlations that are essential for contrast modeling in salient object detection. Motivated by the above observations, we design a new deep-learning algorithm for fast salient object detection. The proposed algorithm for the first time achieves competitive accuracy and high inference efficiency simultaneously with a single CPU thread. Specifically, we propose a novel depthwise nonlocal module (DNL), which implicitly models contrast via harvesting intrachannel and interchannel correlations in a self-attention manner. In addition, we introduce a depthwise nonlocal network architecture that incorporates both DNLs module and inverted residual blocks. The experimental results show that our proposed network attains very competitive accuracy on a wide range of salient object detection datasets while achieving state-of-the-art efficiency among all existing deep-learning-based algorithms.},

Besides, most of the existing algorithms belong to centralized processing, in which all of the training data must be stored and processed at a fusion center. But in many real applications, data are distributed over multiple nodes, and cannot be centralized to one node for processing due to various reasons. Considering this, in this article, we focus on the problem of distributed classification of missing data with a small proportion of labeled data samples, and develop a distributed semi-supervised missing-data classification (dS 2 MDC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is a distributed joint subspace/classifier learning, that is, a latent subspace representation for missing feature imputation is learned jointly with the training of nonlinear classifiers modeled by the $\chi ^{2}$ kernel using a semi-supervised learning strategy. Theoretical performance analysis and simulations on several datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed dS 2 MDC algorithm from different perspectives.},

Our approach is based on the computation of the dominance set , that is, for each solution, the set of solutions that dominate it, by taking advantage of the characteristics of the merge sort algorithm. We compare MNDS against six well-known techniques that can be considered as the state-of-the-art. The results indicate that the MNDS algorithm outperforms the other techniques in terms of the number of comparisons as well as the total running time.},

A key strategy is to transform the formation control problem into an output agreement problem for which a class of cooperative controllers with successive loops is developed to achieve output agreement. For practical implementation, velocities and accelerations of the controlled multirotors are restricted to within desired ranges by introducing appropriate saturations to the loops. It is proved that each controlled multirotor admits an invariant set property, and the formation control objective can be achieved if a mild joint connectivity condition is satisfied by the switching topology. Along the way, this article also proves a result of independent interest in the output agreement problem subject to both velocity and control input constraints with switching topology.

To empower the formation to make a variety of geometric transformations, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for affine maneuverability under a directed graph. Unlike most existing results using a diagonal stabilizing matrix to achieve the stabilizability of affine formation, this fully distributed approach is feasible without any global information. Next, we propose an adaptive control law for agents in each layer, where the closed-loop errors are driven to a neighborhood of the origin in finite time. Adaptive neural networks are integrated to tackle the model uncertainties in ELSs by updating the norm of the weight matrix, which can simplify the control design and alleviate the computational burden compared with traditional ones.

  abstract     = {The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) is a basic problem in project management. The net present value (NPV) of discounted cash flow is used as a criterion to evaluate the financial aspects of RCPSP in many studies. But while most existing studies focused on only the contractor’s NPV, this article addresses a practical extension of RCPSP, called the payment scheduling negotiation problem (PSNP), which considers both the interests of the contractor and the client. To maximize NPVs of both sides and achieve a win–win solution, these two participants negotiate together to determine an activity schedule and a payment plan for the project. The challenges arise in three aspects: 1) the client’s NPV and the contractor’s NPV are two conflicting objectives; 2) both participants have special preferences in decision making; and 3) the RCPSP is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-Hard). To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a new approach with the following features. First, the problem is reformulated as a biobjective optimization problem with preferences. Second, to address the different preferences of the client and the contractor, a strategy of multilevel region interest is presented. Third, this strategy is integrated in the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to solve the PSNP efficiently. In the experiment, the proposed algorithm is compared with both the double-level optimization approach and the multiobjective optimization approach. The experimental results validate that the proposed method can focus on searching in the region of interest (ROI) and provide more satisfactory solutions.},

  abstract     = {Minimum cost seed selection for competitive influence maximization, which selects a set of key users (called seed set) to spread its influence widely into the network at a minimum cost in a competitive social network, is a key algorithmic problem in social influence analysis. Due to its application potential in multiple fields, such as market expansion, election campaigns, and cultural competition, numerous studies have been emerging recently. Despite these efforts, this problem has not been satisfactorily solved since not only finding a (nearly) optimal solution for cost minimization but also evaluating a seed set is computationally complex. Existing works either trade approximation guarantees for practical efficiency using heuristics, or vice versa due to costly Monte Carlo simulations. In this article, a competitive reverse influence estimation-based greedy (CRIEG) algorithm, which provides bounded approximation guarantees, but offers significantly improved empirical efficiency under the competitive independent cascade model, is proposed. The core of the algorithm is a novel estimation method that improves the efficiency by constructing representative sketches to avoid heavy repeated simulations without compromising its performance guarantees. The experimental results on eight real-world networks with up to 1.13 million users show that compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm is the most efficient while keeping the best performance, and can be orders of magnitude faster.},

To address iteration-varying trial lengths, a new structure of ILC laws has been presented in this article, based on the newly proposed modified composite energy function (mCEF) analysis. The proposed approach is a feedback control scheme that utilizes tracking errors in the current iteration, so that it can deal with iteration-varying system uncertainties. It is also a unified framework such that the traditional ILC problems with identical trial lengths are shown to be a special case of the more general problem considered in this article. Multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems are considered, which can be subject to parametric system uncertainties and an unknown control input gain matrix function. We show that in the closed loop analysis, the proposed control scheme can guarantee asymptotic convergence on the full-state tracking error over the iteration domain, in the sense of the $L^{2}_{T_{k}}$ norm, with $T_{k}$ being the trial length of the $k$ th iteration. In the end, a simulation example is shown to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed ILC algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Discriminative correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers have been increasingly applied to visual tracking due to their high precision while running at high frame rates. However, most recent DCF-based methods solely concentrate on learning the correlation filter with spatial information and thus do not have sufficient descriptive power to discriminate the target from the background in the complex circumstances, such as full occlusion (OCC) and rapid target variation. In this article, we introduce a novel tracking framework that exploits the relationship between the target and its spatiotemporal context to improve tracking accuracy and robustness. Especially, we present our spatiotemporal context model in a hierarchical way, where each layer of the context pyramid is a spatial correlation filter learned from different temporal instances. For gaining an accurate spatiotemporal model, we propose an optimization fusion approach that can adaptively and efficiently learn the effect of each hierarchical layer and exploit these multiple temporal levels of correlation filters for visual tracking. Moreover, an adaptive model update strategy for correlation filters is introduced into the framework to dynamically select proper hierarchical layers, which boosts the temporal diversity of the target appearance, while radically reduces the number of model parameters and guarantees the real-time performance of the tracking method. The experimental results show that, with conventional handcrafted features, our tracker achieves the best success rates among available state-of-the-art trackers with handcrafted features, and provides state-of-the-art performance comparable to those of deep-learning-based trackers on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, VOT-2016, and UAV-20L benchmarks but runs significantly faster than deep trackers.},

  abstract     = {Generating action proposals in untrimmed videos is a challenging task, since video sequences usually contain lots of irrelevant contents and the duration of an action instance is arbitrary. The quality of action proposals is key to action detection performance. The previous methods mainly rely on sliding windows or anchor boxes to cover all ground-truth actions, but this is infeasible and computationally inefficient. To this end, this article proposes a RecapNet—a novel framework for generating action proposal, by mimicking the human cognitive process of understanding video content. Specifically, this RecapNet includes a residual causal convolution module to build a short memory of the past events, based on which the joint probability actionness density ranking mechanism is designed to retrieve the action proposals. The RecapNet can handle videos with arbitrary length and more important, a video sequence will need to be processed only in one single pass in order to generate all action proposals. The experiments show that the proposed RecapNet outperforms the state of the art under all metrics on the benchmark THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets.

  abstract     = {The widespread use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies, smartphones, and social media services generates huge amounts of data streaming at high velocity. Automatic interpretation of these rapidly arriving data streams is required for the timely detection of interesting events that usually emerge in the form of clusters. This article proposes a new relative of the visual assessment of the cluster tendency (VAT) model, which produces a record of structural evolution in the data stream by building a cluster heat map of the entire processing history in the stream. The existing VAT-based algorithms for streaming data, called inc-VAT/inc-iVAT and dec-VAT/dec-iVAT, are not suitable for high-velocity and high-volume streaming data because of high memory requirements and slower processing speed as the accumulated data increases. The scalable iVAT (siVAT) algorithm can handle big batch data, but for streaming data, it needs to be (re)applied everytime a new datapoint arrives, which is not feasible due to the associated computation complexities. To address this problem, we propose an incremental siVAT algorithm, called inc-siVAT, which deals with the streaming data in chunks. It first extracts a small size smart sample using an intelligent sampling scheme, called maximin random sampling (MMRS), then incrementally updates the smart sample points on the fly, using our novel incremental MMRS (inc-MMRS) algorithm, to reflect changes in the data stream after each chunk is processed, and finally, produces an incrementally built iVAT image of the updated smart sample, using the inc-VAT/inc-iVAT and dec-VAT/dec-iVAT algorithms. These images can be used to visualize the evolving cluster structure and for anomaly detection in streaming data. Our method is illustrated with one synthetic and four real datasets, two of which evolve significantly over time. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to successfully identify anomalies and visualize changing cluster structure in streaming data.},

  abstract     = {For social robots to effectively engage in human–robot interaction (HRI), they need to be able to interpret human affective cues and to respond appropriately via display of their own emotional behavior. In this article, we present a novel multimodal emotional HRI architecture to promote natural and engaging bidirectional emotional communications between a social robot and a human user. User affect is detected using a unique combination of body language and vocal intonation, and multimodal classification is performed using a Bayesian Network. The Emotionally Expressive Robot utilizes the user’s affect to determine its own emotional behavior via an innovative two-layer emotional model consisting of deliberative (hidden Markov model) and reactive (rule-based) layers. The proposed architecture has been implemented via a small humanoid robot to perform diet and fitness counseling during HRI. In order to evaluate the Emotionally Expressive Robot’s effectiveness, a Neutral Robot that can detect user affects but lacks an emotional display, was also developed. A between-subjects HRI experiment was conducted with both types of robots. Extensive results have shown that both robots can effectively detect user affect during the real-time HRI. However, the Emotionally Expressive Robot can appropriately determine its own emotional response based on the situation at hand and, therefore, induce more user positive valence and less negative arousal than the Neutral Robot.},

These communication constraints relax the assumptions of instantaneous communication and synchronous actions by agents (request and response actions). In this article, we propose a fully asynchronous communication aware solution to the multiagent deployment problem that uses an event-triggered broadcasting strategy. Unlike all existing triggered solutions, our event-triggered broadcasting algorithm relies on agents to decide when to broadcast (push) information to others in the network without the need for a response from other agents. In addition, the proposed strategy determines how best to move when up-to-date information is unavailable and cannot be requested. The algorithm is capable of achieving similar levels of performance to that of a continuous or periodic strategy. Our solution is proven to achieve asymptotic convergence, and simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed event-triggered broadcasting algorithm can achieve an adequate level of performance under the communication constraints.},

Second, a fault detection scheme is designed in which memories of the learned knowledge can be recalled to give a rapid response to a fault. Third, analytical results concerning the fault detection condition and detection time are derived. It is shown that the mismatch function plays an important role in the performance properties of the diagnosis scheme. To analyze the effect of mismatch function on the residual, the concept of duty ratio is developed. Moreover, by comparing the constant neural networks of the normal and fault patterns, an extraction operator is designed to capture the feature of the mismatch function.

Most DNN-based methods rely on either sparse or dense labeling, and thus they are subject to the inherent limitations of the chosen labeling schemes. DNN dense labeling captures salient objects mainly from global features, which are often hampered by other visually distinctive regions. On the other hand, DNN sparse labeling is usually impeded by inaccurate presegmentation of the images that it depends on. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework consisting of two pathways and an Aggregator to progressively integrate the DNN sparse and DNN dense labeling schemes to derive the final saliency map. In our “zipper” type aggregation, we propose a multiscale kernels approach to extract optimal criteria for saliency detection where we suppress nonsalient regions in the sparse labeling while guiding the dense labeling to recognize more complete extent of the saliency. We demonstrate that our method outperforms in saliency detection compared to other 11 state-of-the-art methods across six well-recognized benchmarking datasets.},

  abstract     = {Kinship verification in the wild is an interesting and challenging problem. The goal of kinship verification is to determine whether a pair of faces are blood relatives or not. Most previous methods for kinship verification can be divided as handcrafted features-based shallow learning methods and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep-learning methods. Nevertheless, these methods are still facing the challenging task of recognizing kinship cues from facial images. The reason is that the family ID information and the distribution difference of pairwise kin-faces are rarely considered in kinship verification tasks. To this end, a family ID-based adversarial convolutional network (AdvKin) method focused on discriminative Kin features is proposed for both small-scale and large-scale kinship verification in this article. The merits of this article are four-fold: 1) for kin-relation discovery, a simple yet effective self-adversarial mechanism based on a negative maximum mean discrepancy (NMMD) loss is formulated as attacks in the first fully connected layer; 2) a pairwise contrastive loss and family ID-based softmax loss are jointly formulated in the second and third fully connected layer, respectively, for supervised training; 3) a two-stream network architecture with residual connections is proposed in AdvKin; and 4) for more fine-grained deep kin-feature augmentation, an ensemble of patch-wise AdvKin networks is proposed (E-AdvKin). Extensive experiments on 4 small-scale benchmark KinFace datasets and 1 large-scale families in the wild (FIW) dataset from the first Large-Scale Kinship Recognition Data Challenge, show the superiority of our proposed AdvKin model over other state-of-the-art approaches.},

Furthermore, the thresholds of the additive consistency and the consensus are studied using the Monte Carlo simulation method. A GDM algorithm with HFPRs is offered.

  abstract     = {Automatic human activity recognition is an integral part of any interactive application involving humans (e.g., human–robot interaction systems). One of the main challenges for activity recognition is the diversity in the way individuals often perform activities. Furthermore, changes in any of the environment factors (i.e., illumination, complex background, human body shapes, viewpoint, etc.) intensify this challenge. In addition, there are different types of activities that robots need to interpret for seamless interaction with humans. Some activities are short, quick, and simple (e.g., sitting), while others may be detailed/complex, and spread throughout a long span of time (e.g., washing mouth). In this article, we recognize the activities within the context of graphical models in a sequence-labeling framework based on skeleton data. We propose a new structured prediction strategy based on probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to recognize both types of activities (i.e., complex and simple). These activity types are often spanned in very diverse subspaces in the space of all possible activities, which would require different model parameterizations. In order to deal with these parameterization and structural breaks across models, a category-switching scheme is proposed to switch over the models based on the activity types. For parameter optimization, we utilize a distributed structured prediction technique to implement our model in a distributed setting. The method is tested on three widely used datasets (CAD-60, UT-Kinect, and Florence 3-D) that cover both activity types. The results illustrate that our proposed method is able to recognize simple and complex activities while the previous work concentrated on only one of these two main types.},

Existing works usually assume that input delays are the same constants and the input of the leader is available for each follower. In this article, we propose a new distributed consensus algorithm to relax the conservative condition. A novel finite-time distributed observer is designed for each follower, which can accurately estimate the state information of the leader in a setting time. By means of the observer, the distributed controller is proposed for each follower, and it depends only on the state information of the follower and the estimated-state information of its neighbor agents. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is strictly proved that all agents can achieve a consensus. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by numerical simulation on a group of single-link manipulators.},

  abstract     = {Reflection caused by glass often degrades the quality of an image and further makes it difficult to estimate depth. In this article, we propose joint reflection removal and depth estimation from a single image. We perform reflection removal (transmission recovery) and depth estimation jointly using a collaborative neural network that consists of four blocks: 1) encoder for feature extraction; 2) reflection removal subnetwork (RRN); 3) depth estimation subnetwork (DEN); and 4) depth refinement guided by the transmission layer. We achieve collaboration between reflection removal and depth estimation by concatenating intermediate features of DEN with RRN. Since the recovered transmission layer contains accurate edges of objects behind glass, we refine the estimated depth with its guidance by guided image filtering. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves both reflection removal and depth estimation even for images with dominant reflections. Besides, this article offers a new way of treating reflections in images to introduce depth estimation into reflection removal and achieve reflection removal and depth estimation simultaneously.},

The local and global connectivity criteria, related to the network topologies, coupling strength, and control gains, are derived rigorously to achieve the global stochastic asymptotic phase agreement and frequency synchronization, respectively.

  abstract     = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are the master regulators of mRNA processing, which are vital players for the post-transcriptional control of gene expression. In recent years, crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies have enabled us to sequence massive amounts of genome-wide RNA-binding event data. Its increasing availability provides opportunities to identify protein–RNA interactions on a genome-wide scale. Genome-wide RNA-binding event detection methods have been developed to the understanding of the proteins’ functions within cellular processes. Unfortunately, those methods often suffer from realistic restrictions, such as high costs, intensive computation, high dimensionality, numerical instability, and data sparsity. We present a computational method [multiobjective forest algorithm (MFA)] to identify protein–RNA interactions from CLIP-seq data by synergizing multiobjective biogeography-based optimization (BBO) with random forest (RF). Since most of the tree-structured classifiers in RF are unnecessarily bulky with extra time costs and memory consumption, multiobjective BBO is designed to prune the unsuitable tree-structured classifiers dynamically. Moreover, to direct the evolution dynamics of the MFA, two objective functions are formulated to balance model generality and complexity for robust performance. To validate our MFA method, we compare its performance across 31 large-scale CLIP-seq datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MFA can obtain superior performance over the current state-of-the-art methods. Mechanistic insights are also revealed and discussed to explore the multifaceted aspects of MFA through data source importance analysis, matrix rank estimations, seeding component perturbations, and multiobjective optimization methodology comparisons.},

The framework encompasses a group of distributed decision makers in the subagents, where each of them possesses a local preference index. Novel distributed algorithms are proposed to solve such a problem in a distributed manner. The weighted $L_{p} $ preference index is utilized in each agent since it can provide a robust Pareto solution to the problem. By using distributed fixed-time optimization methods, the $L_{p} $ preference index is constructed online without specifying the unknown parameters. Then, it is proved that the problem admits a unique Pareto solution. By exploiting consensus and gradient descent techniques, asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution is established via Lyapunov theories. Distinct from most of the current works, the proposed framework does not require any prior information in the formulation process, and private data can be well protected using this distributed approach. Numerical examples are included to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

By taking the leader’s desired path and every UAV networked system into account, the leader–follower tracking error networked system is constructed by arranging the UAVs network systems into a leader–follower formation. To effectively reduce the effect of the external disturbance on the team tracking process, a robust $H_{\infty }$ controller is proposed. With the help of the Itô–Lévy formula, the robust team tracking control design of the multi-UAV system is transformed to a Hamilton–Jacobin inequality (HJI)-constrained optimization problem. Since the HJI constraint cannot be easily solved, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy interpolation method is employed to approximate the nonlinear networked system with a set of local linearized stochastic networked systems to simplify the design procedure. By the proposed T–S fuzzy control method, the $H_{\infty }$ robust leader–follower tracking control design of the stochastic multi-UAV networked system can be transformed to equivalent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)-constrained optimization problem which can be efficiently solved by using the convex optimization techniques. Finally, a design example is given with simulation to illustrate the design procedure of the robust team tracking control of desired attitude and path and validate the effectiveness of the proposed robust $H_{\infty }$ team tracking control method of the multi-UAV networked system.},

  abstract     = {Retrieving informative images from the large-scale aurora data is of great significance in the field of space physics. In this article, we propose a hierarchical deep embedding (HDE) model to assist scientists for their aurora image retrieval. Other than conventional bag-of-words (BoW) models employing local cues individually, HDE performs visual matching in a hierarchical way, that is, only keypoints which are similar on local, regional, and global simultaneously can be treated as a true match. The added contextual evidences can effectively alleviate the occurrence of false matches and improve the precision of visual matching. Specifically, to complement the local SIFT feature, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is refined with a polar region pooling (PRP) layer to extract features from regional patches and global image, forming a group of hierarchical deep features with strong discriminative power. Also, an improved polar meshing (IPM) scheme is presented to determine the positions of keypoints, which is more suitable for images captured by circular fisheye lens and capable of reflecting the physical information in aurora images. Extensive experiments are conducted on the big aurora data, which indicate that the proposed HDE model greatly promotes the retrieval accuracy with acceptable memory cost and efficiency. In addition, the effectiveness of the IPM scheme and the superiority of the hierarchical deep feature integration are separately demonstrated.},

Second, the external disturbance for each agent is taken into account. The associated $H_{\infty }$ cluster formation control, whose performance bound can be obtained by considering both formation information and cluster characteristics, is introduced to measure the disturbance attenuation ability. Third, by casting a stochastic sampled-data-based $H_{\infty }$ cluster formation problem into an $H_{\infty }$ control problem of a stochastic system, an $H_{\infty }$ cluster formation criterion is derived for the MAS with external disturbance.

To address these problems, we first develop a new adaptive parameter estimation strategy to deal with all uncertain parameters, especially, those of nonlinearly parameterized forms, in the output dynamics. Then, we construct a key implicit function equation using available signals and parameter estimates. By solving the equation, a unique adaptive control law is derived to ensure asymptotic output tracking and closed-loop stability. Alternatively, we design an iterative solution-based adaptive control law which is easy to implement and ensure output tracking and closed-loop stability. The simulation study is given to demonstrate the design procedure and verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control scheme.},

Recently, a new research direction has emerged dealing with sensor fusion without knowledge of the ground truth. In this article, we present a novel solution to the latter pertinent problem. In contrast to the first reported solutions to this problem, we present a solution that does not involve any assumption on the group average reliability which makes our results more general than previous works. We devise a strategic game where we show that a perfect partitioning of the sensors into reliable and unreliable groups corresponds to a Nash equilibrium of the game. Furthermore, we give sound theoretical results that prove that those equilibria are indeed the unique Nash equilibria of the game. We then propose a solution involving a team of learning automata (LA) to unveil the identity of each sensor, whether it is reliable or unreliable, using game-theoretic learning. The experimental results show the accuracy of our solution and its ability to deal with settings that are unsolvable by legacy works.},

  abstract     = {Reasoning is one of the central topics in artificial intelligence. As an important reasoning paradigm, entailment recognition has attracted much research interest, which judges if a hypothesis can be inferred from given premises. However, existing research mainly focuses on text-based analysis, that is, recognizing textual entailment (RTE), which limits its depth and width. Actually, the knowledge and inference process of human are across different sensory organs like language and vision, with unique perspectives to represent complementary reasoning cues. It is significant to extend existing entailment recognition research to cross-media scenarios, that is, recognizing cross-media entailment (RCE). Therefore, this article focuses on one representative RCE task: visual–textual reasoning, and proposes the visual–textual hybrid sequence matching (VHSM) approach. VHSM can reason from image-text premises to text hypotheses, whose contributions are: 1) visual–textual hybrid multicontext inference is proposed to address RCE via matching with hybrid context embeddings, along with adaptive gated aggregation to obtain the final prediction results. It can fully exploit complementary visual–textual cue interaction during joint reasoning; 2) memory attention-based context embedding is proposed to sequentially encode hybrid context embeddings, with the memory attention networks to compare neighboring time–steps. This can capture the important memory dimensions by coefficient assignment, which fully exploits the visual–textual context correlation; and 3) cross-task and visual–textual transfer strategy is further proposed to enrich correlation training information for boosting reasoning accuracy, which transfers knowledge not only from cross-media retrieval task to RCE but also between corresponding text and image premises. The experimental results of recognizing visual–textual entailment task on the SNLI dataset verify the effectiveness of VHSM.},

Through the complementary term, the effects of parameter estimation error as well as dynamical terms with time-varying delays are eliminated and thus less conservative condition on time delays is required.

  abstract     = {Effectively recognizing different sceneries with complex backgrounds and varied lighting conditions plays an important role in modern AI systems. Competitive performance has recently been achieved by the deep scene categorization models. However, these models implicitly hypothesize that the image-level labels are 100\% correct, which is too restrictive. Practically, the image-level labels for massive-scale scenery sets are usually calculated by external predictors such as ImageNet-CN. These labels can easily become contaminated because no predictors are completely accurate. This article proposes a new deep architecture that calculates scene categories by hierarchically deriving stable templates, which are discovered using a generative model. Specifically, we first construct a semantic space by incorporating image-level labels using subspace embedding. Afterward, it is noticeable that in the semantic space, the superpixel distributions from identically labeled images remain unchanged, regardless of the image-level label noises. On the basis of this observation, a probabilistic generative model learns the stable templates for each scene category. To deeply represent each scenery category, a novel aggregation network is developed to statistically concatenate the CNN features learned from scene annotations predicted by HSA. Finally, the learned deep representations are integrated into an image kernel, which is subsequently incorporated into a multiclass SVM for distinguishing scene categories. Thorough experiments have shown the performance of our method. As a byproduct, an empirical study of 33 SIFT-flow categories shows that the learned stable templates remain almost unchanged under a nearly 36\% image label contamination rate.},

The question asked in this article is: whether and how can the edge convergence be achieved when the strong connectivity is not satisfied? The answer for the case of spanning tree is given. It is shown that if a signed network is either structurally balanced or r-structurally unbalanced, then the edge state can be ensured to converge to a constant vector. In contrast, if a signed network is both structurally unbalanced and r-structurally balanced, then its edge state does not converge to a constant vector any longer, but to a time-varying vector trajectory with a constant speed. Further, the dynamic behavior results of edges can be derived to address the node convergence problems of signed networks. The simulation examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the established edge convergence results.},

  abstract     = {Model selection is one of the fundamental problems in kernel-based algorithms, which is commonly done by minimizing an estimation of generalization error. The notion of stability and cross-validation (CV) error of learning machines consists of two widely used tools for analyzing the generalization performance. However, there are some disadvantages to both tools when applied for model selection: 1) the stability of learning machines is not practical due to the difficulty of the estimation of its specific value and 2) the CV-based estimate of generalization error usually has a relatively high variance, so it is prone to overfitting. To overcome these two limitations, we present a novel notion of kernel stability (KS) for deriving the generalization error bounds and variance bounds of CV and provide an effective approach to the application of KS for practical model selection. Unlike the existing notions of stability of the learning machine, KS is defined on the kernel matrix; hence, it can avoid the difficulty of the estimation of its value. We manifest the relationship between the KS and the popular uniform stability of the learning algorithm, and further propose several KS-based generalization error bounds and variance bounds of CV. By minimizing the proposed bounds, we present two novel KS-based criteria that can ensure good performance. Finally, we empirically analyze the performance of the proposed criteria on many benchmark data, which demonstrates that our KS-based criteria are sound and effective.},

The target network introduces the soft update mechanism into policy evaluation to stabilize the learning process. By using the proposed architecture, the constrained-input control problem can be solved without adding the nonquadratic functionals into the reward function. In this article, the theoretical analysis of the convergence property is presented. Besides, the effects of both different initial $Q$ -functions and different discount factors are investigated.

By taking into consideration the structures of directed cycles and multiple paths, the judgment of structural balance is simplified significantly. A novel cluster consensus protocol is also proposed for structurally unbalanced digraphs. Moreover, two necessary and sufficient conditions are derived, by which cluster consensus can be achieved in an MAS if and only if its communication topology contains a directed spanning tree. Then, by employing an algebra theorem, a sufficient criterion for the unstable system under a directed cycle is obtained, whether the number of agents on this cycle is odd or even.

How to properly arrange the service replicas (or service instances) among the nodes remains a critical problem. To be specific, in this article, we investigate a generalized service replicas placement problem that has the potential to be applied to various industrial scenarios. We formulate the problem into a multiobjective model with two scheduling objectives, involving deployment cost and service latency. For problem solving, we propose an ant colony optimization-based solution, called multireplicas Pareto ant colony optimization (MRPACO). We have conducted extensive experiments on MRPACO.

  abstract     = {It is known that the Pareto-based approach is not well suited for optimization problems with a large number of objectives, even though it is a class of mainstream methods in multiobjective optimization. Typically, a Pareto-based algorithm comprises two parts: 1) a Pareto dominance-based criterion and 2) a diversity estimator. The former guides the selection toward the optimal front, while the latter promotes the diversity of the population. However, the Pareto dominance-based criterion becomes ineffective in solving optimization problems with many objectives (e.g., more than 3) and, thus, the diversity estimator will determine the performance of the algorithm. Unfortunately, the diversity estimator usually has a strong bias toward dominance resistance solutions (DRSs), thereby failing to push the population forward. DRSs are solutions that are far away from the Pareto-optimal front but cannot be easily dominated. In this article, we propose a new Pareto-based algorithm to resolve the above issue. First, to eliminate the DRSs, we design an interquartile range method to preprocess the solution set. Second, to balance convergence and diversity, we present a penalty mechanism of alternating operations between selection and penalty. The proposed algorithm is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on a number of well-known benchmarks with 3–15 objectives. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can perform well on most of the test functions and generally outperforms its competitors.},

Each conditional (nonterminal) node of the tree represents a nonlinear mathematical rule (split-rule) involving features in order to partition the dataset in the given conditional node into two nonoverlapping subsets. This partitioning is intended to minimize the impurity of the resulting child nodes. By restricting the structure of the split-rule at each conditional node and depth of the decision tree, the interpretability of the classifier is ensured. The nonlinear split-rule at a given conditional node is obtained using an evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithm, in which while the upper level focuses on arriving at an interpretable structure of the split-rule, the lower level achieves the most appropriate weights (coefficients) of individual constituents of the rule to minimize the net impurity of two resulting child nodes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a number of controlled test problems, existing benchmark problems, and industrial problems. Results on 2–500 feature problems are encouraging and open up further scopes of applying the proposed approach to more challenging and complex classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Evacuation path optimization (EPO) is a crucial problem in crowd and disaster management. With the consideration of dynamic evacuee velocity, the EPO problem becomes nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-Hard). Furthermore, since not only one single evacuation path but multiple mutually restricted paths should be found, the crowd evacuation problem becomes even challenging in both solution spatial encoding and optimal solution searching. To address the above challenges, this article puts forward an ant colony evacuation planner (ACEP) with a novel solution construction strategy and an incremental flow assignment (IFA) method. First, different from the traditional ant algorithms, where each ant builds a complete solution independently, ACEP uses the entire colony of ants to simulate the behavior of the crowd during evacuation. In this way, the colony of ants works cooperatively to find a set of evacuation paths simultaneously and thus multiple evacuation paths can be found effectively. Second, in order to reduce the execution time of ACEP, an IFA method is introduced, in which fractions of evacuees are assigned step by step, to imitate the group-based evacuation process in the real world so that the efficiency of ACEP can be further improved. Numerical experiments are conducted on a set of networks with different sizes. The experimental results demonstrate that ACEP is promising.},

  abstract     = {When solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), the most commonly used way of measuring constraint violation is to calculate the sum of all constraint violations of a solution as its distance to feasibility. However, this kind of constraint violation measure may not reflect the distance of an infeasible solution from feasibility for some problems, for example, when an infeasible solution closer to a feasible region does not have a smaller constraint violation than the one farther away from a feasible region. Unfortunately, no set of artificial benchmark problems focusing on this area exists. To remedy this issue, a set of CMOPs with deceptive constraints is introduced in this article. It is the first attempt to consider CMOPs with deceptive constraints (DCMOPs). Based on our previous work, which designed a set of directed weight vectors to solve CMOPs, this article proposes a cooperative framework with an improved version of directed weight vectors to solve DCMOPs. Specifically, the cooperative framework consists of two switchable phases. The first phase uses two subpopulations—one to explore feasible regions and the other to explore the entire space. The two subpopulations provide useful information about the optimal direction of objective improvement to each other. The second phase aims mainly at finding Pareto-optimal solutions. Then an infeasibility utilization strategy is used to improve the objective function values. The two phases are switchable based on the information found to date at any time in the evolutionary process. The experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms the algorithms with which it is compared on most of the DCMOPs, in terms of reliability and stability in finding a set of well-distributed optimal solutions.},

A novel projected gradient-based regularized penalized dynamical system is proposed to solve this issue. The idea is to use a differentiable penalty function with a time-varying penalty parameter to deal with the inequality constraints. A time-varying regularization term is used to deal with the ill-poseness caused by the monotonicity assumption and the time-varying penalty term. The proposed dynamical system extends the regularized dynamical system in the literature to the projected gradient-based regularized penalized dynamical system, which can be used to solve generalized noncooperative games with set constraints and coupled constraints. Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm by using leader-following consensus, where the players have access to neighboring information only. For both cases, the asymptotic convergence to the least-norm variational equilibrium of the game is proven. Numerical examples show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence indicates that circular RNA (circRNA) has been an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of human complex diseases and many critical biological processes. Using circRNA as a molecular marker or therapeutic target opens up a new avenue for our treatment and detection of human complex diseases. The traditional biological experiments, however, are usually limited to small scale and are time consuming, so the development of an effective and feasible computational-based approach for predicting circRNA-disease associations is increasingly favored. In this study, we propose a new computational-based method, called IMS-CDA, to predict potential circRNA-disease associations based on multisource biological information. More specifically, IMS-CDA combines the information from the disease semantic similarity, the Jaccard and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity of disease and circRNA, and extracts the hidden features using the stacked autoencoder (SAE) algorithm of deep learning. After training in the rotation forest (RF) classifier, IMS-CDA achieves 88.08\% area under the ROC curve with 88.36\% accuracy at the sensitivity of 91.38\% on the CIRCR2Disease dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art support vector machine and $K$ -nearest neighbor models and different descriptor models, IMS-CDA achieves the best overall performance. In the case studies, eight of the top 15 circRNA-disease associations with the highest prediction score were confirmed by recent literature. These results indicated that IMS-CDA has an outstanding ability to predict new circRNA-disease associations and can provide reliable candidates for biological experiments.},

  abstract     = {As a nonlinear similarity measure defined in the kernel space, the correntropic loss (C-Loss) can address the stability issues of second-order similarity measures thanks to its ability to extract high-order statistics of data. However, the kernel adaptive filter (KAF) based on the C-Loss uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method to update its weights and, thus, suffers from poor performance and a slow convergence rate. To address these issues, the conjugate gradient (CG)-based correntropy algorithm is developed by solving the combination of half-quadratic (HQ) optimization and weighted least-squares (LS) problems, generating a novel robust kernel correntropy CG (KCCG) algorithm. The proposed KCCG with less computational complexity achieves comparable performance to the kernel recursive maximum correntropy (KRMC) algorithm. To further curb the growth of the network in KCCG, the random Fourier features KCCG (RFFKCCG) algorithm is proposed by transforming the original input data into a fixed-dimensional random Fourier features space (RFFS). Since only one current error information is used in the loss function of RFFKCCG, it can provide a more efficient filter structure than the other KAFs with sparsification. The Monte Carlo simulations conducted in the prediction of synthetic and real-world chaotic time series and the regression for large-scale datasets validate the superiorities of the proposed algorithms in terms of robustness, filtering accuracy, and complexity.},

Many domains require an understanding of the data in terms of the original features; there is hence a need for powerful visualization methods which use understandable models. In this article, we propose a genetic programming (GP) approach called GP-tSNE for evolving interpretable mappings from the dataset to high-quality visualizations. A multiobjective approach is designed that produces a variety of visualizations in a single run which gives different tradeoffs between visual quality and model complexity. Testing against baseline methods on a variety of datasets shows the clear potential of GP-tSNE to allow deeper insight into data than that provided by existing visualization methods. We further highlight the benefits of a multiobjective approach through an in-depth analysis of a candidate front, which shows how multiple models can be analyzed jointly to give increased insight into the dataset.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, numerous many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been developed to search for well-diversified and well-converged Pareto optimal solutions for high-dimensional many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). However, existing MaOEAs have to tackle some daunting challenges, including the emergence of dominance resistance solutions, effective diversity preservation scheme, management of a large population size, extremely high computational complexity, sensitivity to the shape of Pareto front (PF), and overly relying on high-quality reference points. In this article, we present an evolution strategy (ES) for solving MaOPs, called MaOES , which can solve these challenges efficiently and effectively. Inspired by the Vector Equilibrium phenomenon in magnetic fields, isotropic magnetic particles would automatically repel from each other, keep the uniform distance from the nearest neighbors, and extend the entire magnetic fields as far as possible, all at the same time. In the proposed algorithm, an efficient self-adaptive Precision-Controllable Mutation operator is designed for individuals to explore and exploit the decision space. In addition, the Maximum Extension Distance strategy, which emulates the isotropic magnetic particle behavior in a magnetic field, is developed to guide individuals to keep uniform distance and extension to approximate the entire PF. As a result, the MaOES can obtain a well-converged and well-diversified PF with much less population size and far lower computational complexity. The larger the number of individuals, the sharper the contour the resulting approximate PF will be. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated by the scalable MaOPs test suites on DTLZ and WFG. The experimental results have been demonstrated to provide a competitive and oftentimes better performance when compared against some chosen state-of-the-art MaOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Sensor activity scheduling is critical for prolonging the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, most existing methods assume sensors to have one fixed sensing range. Prevalence of sensors with adjustable sensing ranges posts two new challenges to the topic: 1) expanded search space, due to the rise in the number of possible activation modes and 2) more complex energy allocation, as the sensors differ in the energy consumption rate when using different sensing ranges. These two challenges make it hard to directly solve the lifetime maximization problem of WSNs with range-adjustable sensors (LM-RASs). This article proposes a neighborhood-based estimation of distribution algorithm (NEDA) to address it in a recursive manner. In NEDA, each individual represents a coverage scheme in which the sensors are selectively activated to monitor all the targets. A linear programming (LP) model is built to assign activation time to the schemes in the population so that their sum, the network lifetime, can be maximized conditioned on the current population. Using the activation time derived from LP as individual fitness, the NEDA is driven to seek coverage schemes promising for prolonging the network lifetime. The network lifetime is thus optimized by repeating the steps of the coverage scheme evolution and LP model solving. To encourage the search for diverse coverage schemes, a neighborhood sampling strategy is introduced. Besides, a heuristic repair strategy is designed to fine-tune the existing schemes for further improving the search efficiency. Experimental results on WSNs of different scales show that NEDA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It is also expected that NEDA can serve as a potential framework for solving other flexible LP problems that share the same structure with LM-RAS.},

The task of crowd counting has many challenges, such as severe occlusions in extremely dense crowd scenes, perspective distortion, and high visual similarity between the pedestrians and background elements. To address these problems, the proposed MS-GAN combines a multiscale convolutional neural network (generator) and an adversarial network (discriminator) to generate a high-quality density map and accurately estimate the crowd count in complex crowd scenes. The multiscale generator utilizes the fusion features from multiple hierarchical layers to detect people with large-scale variation. The resulting density map produced by the multiscale generator is processed by a discriminator network trained to solve a binary classification task between a poor quality density map and real ground-truth ones. The additional adversarial loss can improve the quality of the density map, which is critical to accurately estimate the crowd counts. The experiments were conducted on multiple datasets with different crowd scenes and densities.

  abstract     = {Time-series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time-series objects of the dataset. In this article, we propose a novel technique of time-series clustering consisting of two clustering stages. In a first step, a least-squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all of the segments are projected into the same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time-series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmentation. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against three state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising, especially on larger datasets.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of colorectal cancerous regions from 3-D magnetic resonance (MR) images is a crucial procedure for radiotherapy. Automatic delineation from 3-D whole volumes is in urgent demand yet very challenging. Drawbacks of existing deep-learning-based methods for this task are two-fold: 1) extensive graphics processing unit (GPU) memory footprint of 3-D tensor limits the trainable volume size, shrinks effective receptive field, and therefore, degrades speed and segmentation performance and 2) in-region segmentation methods supported by region-of-interest (RoI) detection are either blind to global contexts, detail richness compromising, or too expensive for 3-D tasks. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a novel encoder–decoder-based framework for 3-D whole volume segmentation, referred to as 3-D RoI-aware U-Net (3-D RU-Net). 3-D RU-Net fully utilizes the global contexts covering large effective receptive fields. Specifically, the proposed model consists of a global image encoder for global understanding-based RoI localization, and a local region decoder that operates on pyramid-shaped in-region global features, which is GPU memory efficient and thereby enables training and prediction with large 3-D whole volumes. To facilitate the global-to-local learning procedure and enhance contour detail richness, we designed a dice-based multitask hybrid loss function. The efficiency of the proposed framework enables an extensive model ensemble for further performance gain at acceptable extra computational costs. Over a dataset of 64 T2-weighted MR images, the experimental results of four-fold cross-validation show that our method achieved 75.5\% dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in 0.61 s per volume on a GPU, which significantly outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The code is publicly available.},

These objectives are achieved by controlling the charge and discharge rate of the ESS based on the state of charge of ESS, the power difference between load and RES, and electricity market price. The effectiveness of the fuzzy logic greatly depends on the membership functions (MFs). The fuzzy MFs of the FEMS are optimized offline using a Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The best compromise solution is selected as the final solution and implemented in the fuzzy-logic controller.

Due to the time delay and multiplicative noise in such models, the conventional methods for consensus analysis are not applicable. In this article, therefore, a degenerated Lyapunov functional is used to derive the conditions for mean-square consensus and almost-sure consensus, related to the Lipschitz constants of the nonlinear term, time delay, and noise intensity. In particular, for the double-integrator setting, it is shown that the mean-square consensus and the almost-sure consensus can be achieved by choosing appropriate control gains for any given time delay and noise intensity.

Nonetheless, the state-of-the-art techniques mostly stress on the novelty from the system identification point of view but pay less attention to the optimality of the learned parameters. Using the recently introduced autonomous learning multiple model (ALMMo) system as the implementation basis, this article introduces a particle swarm-based approach for the EIS optimization. The proposed approach is able to simultaneously optimize the antecedent and consequent parameters of ALMMo and effectively enhance the system performance by iteratively searching for optimal solutions in the problem spaces. In addition, the proposed optimization approach does not adversely influence the “one pass” learning ability of ALMMo. Once the optimization process is complete, ALMMo can continue to learn from new data to incorporate unseen data patterns recursively without full retraining. The experimental studies with a number of real-world benchmark problems validate the proposed concept and general principles. It is also verified that the proposed optimization approach can be applied to other types of EISs with similar operating mechanisms.},

For saving communication resources, a dynamic event-triggered (ET) mechanism is utilized to decide the data transmission from sensors to the controller. A time-varying random process is employed to characterize the fading phenomenon in the unpredictable communication network. By considering the effect of channel fading, a nonparallel distribution compensation (non-PDC) IT2 fuzzy controller is synthesized and its number of rules and membership functions (MFs) can be freely selected. As a consequence, the closed-loop fuzzy system possesses imperfectly matched MFs. By taking the global membership boundary information into stability analysis, the membership-function-dependent analysis method is employed to handle these imperfectly matched MFs and to obtain relaxed criteria. Besides, sufficient criteria are obtained so that the resulting closed-loop IT2 fuzzy system can achieve stochastic stability despite fading measurements. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by a mass–spring–damper system and a numerical example.},

To stabilize such heterogeneous networked systems in a distributed way, the switched system approach is developed and utilized in this article, where it is revealed that distributed stabilization can be achieved provided that the ratio on the activating periods of strong and weak competition is chosen appropriately. As an extension, a periodical switching law is taken into account to simplify the design process, where the periodical competition function is introduced correspondingly and several effective sufficient conditions are attained.

  abstract     = {In building-microgrid communities, renewable generation and time-varying load usually cause power fluctuations, which influence the ancillary support to the main grid. Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can be utilized to compensate such power variations due to their aggregated and controllable power consumptions. Meanwhile, one basic requirement for the users’ side of TCLs is to realize the fair sharing of power states and comfort states. This article proposes a distributed event-based control strategy, where information of neighboring TCLs is exchanged only when a dynamic event-triggered condition is satisfied, and thus it intelligently determines the necessary transmission frequency to save communication resources. From a cybersecurity perspective, the communication network of TCLs may be subject to hybrid attacks, for example, denial-of-service (DoS) and false data-injection (FDI) attacks. During DoS attack intervals, no information can be communicated even through the event-triggered condition is satisfied. Furthermore, the control inputs may also be tampered by FDI attacks. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability and hybrid control theories, sufficient conditions regarding the attack parameters are derived such that fair sharing of power states and comfort states of all involved TCLs can be achieved exponentially. The exclusion of Zeno behaviors is proved and a corollary for ideal communication situations is also deduced. Finally, simulation examples with various attack parameters are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the main results.},

As a typical scheduling problem, the no-wait flow-shop scheduling has been extensively studied due to its wide industrial applications. However, energy consumption is usually ignored in the study of typical scheduling problems. In this article, a two-stage cooperative evolutionary algorithm with problem-specific knowledge called TS-CEA is proposed to address energy-efficient scheduling of the no-wait flow-shop problem (EENWFSP) with the criteria of minimizing both makespan and total energy consumption. In TS-CEA, two constructive heuristics are designed to generate a desirable initial solution after analyzing the properties of the problem. In the first stage of TS-CEA, an iterative local search strategy (ILS) is employed to explore potential extreme solutions. Moreover, a hybrid neighborhood structure is designed to improve the quality of the solution. In the second stage of TS-CEA, a mutation strategy based on critical path knowledge is proposed to extend the extreme solutions to the Pareto front. Moreover, a co-evolutionary closed-loop system is generated with ILS and mutation strategies in the iteration process. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TS-CEA in solving the EENWFSP.},

Among them, the event-triggering instants are generated whenever the ETDIC strategy is violated and delayed impulsive control is implemented only at event-triggering instants, which allows the existence of some network problems, such as packet loss, misordering, and retransmission. By employing the Lyapunov–Razumikhin (L–R) technique and impulsive control theory, some sufficient conditions with less conservatism are proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which indicates that the ETDIC strategy can guarantee the achievement of the exponential synchronization and eliminate the Zeno phenomenon.

First, the network channel delays are modeled as a distributed delay with its kernel. To make full use of kernels of the distributed delay, a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is established with the kernel of the distributed delay. It is noted that the novel LKF and delay-dependent reciprocally convex inequality plays an important role in dealing with global asymptotical stability and strict $(\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{S},\mathcal{R})$ - $\alpha $ -dissipativity of the T–S fuzzy delayed model. Through the constructed LKF, a new set of less conservative linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions is presented to obtain an observer-based controller for the T–S fuzzy delayed model. This proposed observer-based controller ensures that the state of the closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable and strictly $(\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{S},\mathcal{R})$ - $\alpha $ -dissipative. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed results is shown in numerical simulations.},

The characteristic of radial basis function NNs is utilized to construct a state observer and address the algebraic loop problem. To reduce the communication burden and the signal transmission frequency, the event-triggered mechanism and the encoding–decoding strategy are proposed with the help of a backstepping control technique. To encode and decode the event-triggering control signal, a one-bit signal transmission strategy is adopted to consume less communication bandwidth. Then, by estimating the unknown constants in the differential equation of unknown hysteresis, the effect caused by unknown backlash-like hysteresis is compensated for nonlinear LSSs. Moreover, the violation of full-state constraints is prevented based on the barrier Lyapunov functions and all signals of the closed-loop system are proven to be semiglobally ultimately uniformly bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy.},

Because of the structural characteristics of the followers’ dynamics, a technique called adding a power integrator is used, which effectively overcomes the difficulties of states and dead zone with power-exponential functions. Furthermore, radial basis function neural networks are employed to estimate unknown nonlinear functions and solve the problem of algebraic loop caused by the pure-feedback structure of MASs. Meanwhile, the problems of “explosion of complexity” caused by repeated differentiations of the virtual controller are solved by using the tracking differentiators. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, and the tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin.

  abstract     = {Rare classes are usually hidden in an imbalanced dataset with the majority of the data examples from major classes. Rare-class mining (RCM) aims at extracting all the data examples belonging to rare classes. Most of the existing approaches for RCM require a certain amount of labeled data examples as input. However, they are ineffective in practice since requesting label information from domain experts is time consuming and human-labor extensive. Thus, we investigate the unsupervised RCM problem, which to the best of our knowledge is the first such attempt. To this end, we propose an efficient algorithm called Fast-RCM for unsupervised RCM, which has an approximately linear time complexity with respect to data size and data dimensionality. Given an unlabeled dataset, Fast-RCM mines out the rare class by first building a rare tree for the input dataset and then extracting data examples of the rare classes based on this rare tree. Compared with the existing approaches which have quadric or even cubic time complexity, Fast-RCM is much faster and can be extended to large-scale datasets. The experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively and efficiently extract the rare classes from an unlabeled dataset under the unsupervised settings, and is approximately five times faster than that of the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Current hashing-based image retrieval methods mostly assume that the database of images is static. However, this assumption is not true in cases where the databases are constantly updated (e.g., on the Internet) and there exists the problem of concept drift. The online (also known as incremental) hashing methods have been proposed recently for image retrieval where the database is not static. However, they have not considered the concept drift problem. Moreover, they update hash functions dynamically by generating new hash codes for all accumulated data over time which is clearly uneconomical. In order to solve these two problems, concept preserving hashing (CPH) is proposed. In contrast to the existing methods, CPH preserves the original concept, that is, the set of hash codes representing a concept is preserved over time, by learning a new set of hash functions to yield the same set of hash codes for images (old and new) of a concept. The objective function of CPH learning consists of three components: 1) isomorphic similarity; 2) hash codes partition balancing; and 3) heterogeneous similarity fitness. The experimental results on 11 concept drift scenarios show that CPH yields better retrieval precisions than the existing methods and does not need to update hash codes of previously stored images.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of decentralized composite optimization over a connected and symmetric graph, in which each node holds its own agent-specific private convex functions, and communications are only allowed between nodes with direct links. A variety of algorithms has been proposed to solve such a problem in an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) framework. Many of these algorithms, however, need to include some extra proximal term in the augmented Lagrangian function such that the resulting algorithm can be implemented in a decentralized manner. The use of the extra proximal term slows down the convergence speed because it forces the current solution to stay close to the solution obtained in the previous iteration. To address this issue, in this article, we first introduce the notion of simplest bipartite graph, which is defined as a bipartite graph that has a minimum number of edges to keep the graph connected. A simple two-step message passing-based procedure is proposed to find a simplest bipartite graph associated with the original graph. We show that the simplest bipartite graph has some interesting properties. By utilizing these properties, an ADMM without involving extra proximal terms can be developed to perform decentralized composite optimization over the simplest bipartite graph. The simulation results show that our proposed method achieves a much faster convergence speed than the existing state-of-the-art decentralized algorithms.},

In this article, we present probably the first study on multi-instance classification with fragmentary data. In our proposed framework, called fragmentary multi-instance classification (FIC), the fragmentary data are completed and the multi-instance classifier is learned jointly. To facilitate the integration between the completion and classifier learning, FIC establishes the weighting mechanism to measure the importance levels of different instances. To validate the compatibility of our framework, four typical MIL methods, including multi-instance support vector machine (MI-SVM), expectation maximization diverse density (EM-DD), citation- $K$ nearest neighbors (Citation-KNNs), and MIL with discriminative bag mapping (MILDM), are embedded into the framework to obtain the corresponding FIC versions. As an illustration, an efficient solving algorithm is developed to address the problem for MI-SVM, together with the proof of convergence behavior.

Notably, without real-time monitoring of system behavior as in the scenario with continuous event evaluation, it is critical to delicately estimate and govern the execution/sampling error to achieve the desired system performance. This, under stochastic effects, would be substantially challenging, since the behavior of the stochastic system is hard to predict and is disparate between trials even with the same initial conditions. In this article, a framework of global stabilization via periodic event-triggered output-feedback is established: 1) a criterion condition based on the ISS-Lyapunov function is presented for the feasibility of the desired event-triggered stabilization; 2) both the asymptotic stabilization and exponential stabilization are achieved for the systems, with delicately specifying the periodic event-triggering mechanism; and 3) the involved analysis, without applying the well-known Lyapunov theorems, can serve as a pattern from estimating sampling and execution errors to assess the closed-loop stability for stochastic periodic event-triggered control. Moreover, based on the established framework, we contribute the stabilizing controller design via periodic event-triggered output-feedback for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are a class of popular methods for solving the multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), and have been widely studied in numerical experiments and successfully applied in practice. However, we know little about these algorithms from the theoretical aspect. In this paper, we present running time analysis of a simple MOEA with mutation and crossover based on the MOEA/D framework (MOEA/D-C) on five pseudo-Boolean functions. Our rigorous theoretical analysis shows that by properly setting the number of subproblems, the upper bounds of expected running time of MOEA/D-C obtaining a set of solutions to cover the Pareto fronts (PFs) of these problems are apparently lower than those of the one with mutation-only (MOEA/D-M). Moreover, to effectively obtain a set of solutions to cover the PFs of these problem, MOEA/D-C only needs to decompose these MOPs into several subproblems with a set of simple weight vectors while MOEA/D-M needs to find $\Omega (n)$ optimally decomposed weight vectors. This result suggests that the use of crossover in decomposition-based MOEA can simplify the setting of weight vectors for different problems and make the algorithm more efficient. This paper provides some insights into the working principles of MOEA/D and explains why some existing decomposition-based MOEAs work well in computational experiments.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional dictionary learning (CDL) aims to learn a structured and shift-invariant dictionary to decompose signals into sparse representations. While yielding superior results compared to traditional sparse coding methods on various signal and image processing tasks, most CDL methods have difficulties handling large data, because they have to process all images in the dataset in a single pass. Therefore, recent research has focused on online CDL (OCDL) which updates the dictionary with sequentially incoming signals. In this article, a novel OCDL algorithm is proposed based on a local, slice-based representation of sparse codes. Such representation has been found useful in batch CDL problems, where the convolutional sparse coding and dictionary learning problem could be handled in a local way similar to traditional sparse coding problems, but it has never been explored under online scenarios before. We show, in this article, that the proposed algorithm is a natural extension of the traditional patch-based online dictionary learning algorithm, and the dictionary is updated in a similar memory efficient way too. On the other hand, it can be viewed as an improvement of existing second-order OCDL algorithms. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges and has lower time complexity than existing counterpart that yields exactly the same output. Extensive experiments are performed on various benchmarking datasets, which show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art batch and OCDL algorithms in terms of reconstruction objectives.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the correlation filter (CF) has been catching significant attention in visual tracking for its high efficiency in most state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the tracker easily fails when facing the distractions caused by background clutter, occlusion, and other challenging situations. These distractions commonly exist in the visual object tracking of real applications. Keep tracking under these circumstances is the bottleneck in the field. To improve tracking performance under complex interference, a combination of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and contextual information is introduced to the CF framework through the learning stage in this article to ignore these distractions. Moreover, an elastic net regression is proposed to regroup the features, and an adaptive scale method is implemented to deal with the scale changes during tracking. Theoretical analysis and exhaustive experimental analysis show that the proposed peak strength context-aware (PSCA) CF significantly improves the kernelized CF (KCF) and achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art trackers.},

To achieve this, we describe an efficient person search network and a set of deep and well-engineered expert networks, to build a tiny and compact model that can approximate the representations of the expert networks in a multitask learning manner. We present extensive experiments on three customized student networks with different scales of networks and show strong performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods on both mean average precision and top-1 accuracies.

To tackle this problem, at first, we partition the scene into several primitive actions (PAs)-based upon motion attention mechanism. Then, the PAs are described by the trajectory vectors of the corresponding joints. After that, motivated by text classification based on word embedding, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize activity scenes by considering motion of joints as “word” of activity.

By introducing a new optimality measure, a powerful canonical primal–dual interior (CPDI) point algorithm is developed which can solve efficiently huge-sized problems with hundreds of thousands of sensors. The new method is compared with the popular methods in the literature.

Compared with the standard C/GMRES method, the inequality constraint is relaxed by imposing the penalty term on the cost function.

  abstract     = {Suppression of excessively synchronous beta frequency (12–35 Hz) oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia is believed to correlate with the alleviation of hypokinetic motor symptoms of the Parkinson’s disease. Delayed feedback is an effective strategy to interrupt the synchronization and has been used in the design of closed-loop neuromodulation methods computationally. Although tremendous efforts in this are being made by optimizing delayed feedback algorithm and stimulation waveforms, there are still remaining problems in the selection of effective parameters in the delayed feedback control schemes. In most delayed feedback neuromodulation strategies, the stimulation signal is obtained from the local field potential (LFP) of the excitatory subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons and then is administered back to STN itself only. The inhibitory external globus pallidus (GPe) nucleus in the excitatory–inhibitory STN–GPe reciprocal network has not been involved in the design of the delayed feedback control strategies. Thus, considering the role of GPe, this paper proposes three schemes involving GPe in the design of the delayed feedback strategies and compared their effectiveness to the traditional paradigm using STN only. Based on a neural mass model of STN–GPe network having capability of simulating the LFP directly, the proposed stimulation strategies are tested and compared. Our simulation results show that the four types of delayed feedback control schemes are all effective, even if with a simple linear delayed feedback algorithm. But the three new control strategies we propose here further improve the control performance by enlarging the oscillatory suppression space and reducing the energy expenditure, suggesting that they may be more effective in applications. This paper may guide a new approach to optimize the closed-loop deep brain stimulation treatment to alleviate the Parkinsonian state by retargeting the measurement and stimulation nucleus.},

With the proposed control scheme, no piecewise continuous functions are required any more in the controller design to avoid the singularity, and the fixed-time stability of the entire closed-loop system in the reaching phase and sliding phase is analyzed with a rigorous theoretical proof.

In the proposed hybrid strategies, continuous-time players adopt continuous-time algorithms for action updating, while discrete-time players update their actions at each sampling time instant and 2) based on the idea of consensus tracking, the Nash equilibrium learning problem for continuous-time games is reformulated and two new computation strategies are subsequently established.

It aims to find spatial filters that maximize the projected variance ratio between the covariance matrices of the multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) signals corresponding to two mental tasks, which can be formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP). However, it is challenging in principle to impose additional regularization onto the CSP to obtain structural solutions (e.g., sparse CSP) due to the intrinsic nonconvexity and invariance property of GEPs. This article reformulates the CSP as a constrained minimization problem and establishes the equivalence of the reformulated and the original CSPs. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve this optimization problem by alternately performing singular value decomposition (SVD) and least squares. Under this new formulation, various regularization techniques for linear regression can then be easily implemented to regularize the CSPs for different learning paradigms, such as the sparse CSP, the transfer CSP, and the multisubject CSP. Evaluations on three BCI competition datasets show that the regularized CSP algorithms outperform other baselines, especially for the high-dimensional small training set. The extensive results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed CSP formulation in different learning contexts.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently attracted considerable attention from both academics and practitioners. Core issues, e.g., the curse of dimensionality due to the exponential growth of agent interactions and nonstationary environments due to simultaneous learning, hinder the large-scale proliferation of MARL. These problems deteriorate with an increased number of agents. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial collaborative learning method in a mixed cooperative–competitive environment, exploiting friend-or-foe Q-learning and mean-field theory. We first treat neighbors of agent $i$ as two coalitions ( $i$ ’s friend and opponent coalition, respectively), and convert the Markov game into a two-player zero-sum game with an extended action set. By exploiting mean-field theory, this new game simplifies the interactions as those between a single agent and the mean effects of friends and opponents. A neural network is employed to learn the optimal mean effects of these two coalitions, which are trained via adversarial max and min steps. In the max step, with fixed policies of opponents, we optimize the friends’ mean action to maximize their rewards. In the min step, the mean action of opponents is trained to minimize the friends’ rewards when the policies of friends are frozen. These two steps are proved to converge to a Nash equilibrium. Then, another neural network is applied to learn the best response of each agent toward the mean effects. Finally, the adversarial max and min steps can jointly optimize the two networks. Experiments on two platforms demonstrate the learning effectiveness and strength of our approach, especially with many agents.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the low storage cost and high query speed, cross-view hashing (CVH) has been successfully used for similarity search in multimedia retrieval. However, most existing CVH methods use all views to learn a common Hamming space, thus making it difficult to handle the data with increasing views or a large number of views. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a decoupled CVH network (DCHN) approach which consists of a semantic hashing autoencoder module (SHAM) and multiple multiview hashing networks (MHNs). To be specific, SHAM adopts a hashing encoder and decoder to learn a discriminative Hamming space using either a few labels or the number of classes, that is, the so-called flexible inputs. After that, MHN independently projects all samples into the discriminative Hamming space that is treated as an alternative ground truth. In brief, the Hamming space is learned from the semantic space induced from the flexible inputs, which is further used to guide view-specific hashing in an independent fashion. Thanks to such an independent/decoupled paradigm, our method could enjoy high computational efficiency and the capacity of handling the increasing number of views by only using a few labels or the number of classes. For a newly coming view, we only need to add a view-specific network into our model and avoid retraining the entire model using the new and previous views. Extensive experiments are carried out on five widely used multiview databases compared with 15 state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that the proposed independent hashing paradigm is superior to the common joint ones while enjoying high efficiency and the capacity of handling newly coming views.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) are characterized by optimization functions that change over time in varying environments. The DMOP is challenging because it requires the varying Pareto-optimal sets (POSs) to be tracked quickly and accurately during the optimization process. In recent years, transfer learning has been proven to be one of the effective means to solve dynamic multiobjective optimization. However, the negative transfer will lead the search of finding the POS to a wrong direction, which greatly reduces the efficiency of solving optimization problems. Minimizing the occurrence of negative transfer is thus critical for the use of transfer learning in solving DMOPs. In this article, we propose a new individual-based transfer learning method, called an individual transfer-based dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (IT-DMOEA), for solving DMOPs. Unlike existing approaches, it uses a presearch strategy to filter out some high-quality individuals with better diversity so that it can avoid negative transfer caused by individual aggregation. On this basis, an individual-based transfer learning technique is applied to accelerate the construction of an initial population. The merit of the IT-DMOEA method is that it combines different strategies in maintaining the advantages of transfer learning methods as well as avoiding the occurrence of negative transfer; thereby greatly improving the quality of solutions and convergence speed. The experimental results show that the proposed IT-DMOEA approach can considerably improve the quality of solutions and convergence speed compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms based on different benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle accidents are the primary cause of fatalities worldwide. Most often, experiencing fatigue on the road leads to operator errors and behavioral lapses. Thus, there is a need to predict the cognitive state of drivers, particularly their fatigue level. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been demonstrated to be effective for monitoring changes in the human brain state and behavior. Thirty-seven subjects participated in this driving experiment and performed a perform lane-keeping task in a visual-reality environment. Three domains, namely, frequency, temporal, and 2-D spatial information, of the EEG channel location were comprehensively considered. A 4-D convolutional neural-network (4-D CNN) algorithm was then proposed to associate all information from the EEG signals and the changes in the human state and behavioral performance. A 4-D CNN achieves superior forecasting performance over 2-D CNN, 3-D CNN, and shallow networks. The results showed a 3.82\% improvement in the root mean-square error, a 3.45\% improvement in the error rate, and a 11.98\% improvement in the correlation coefficient with 4-D CNN compared with 3-D CNN. The 4-D CNN algorithm extracts the significant theta and alpha activations in the frontal and posterior cingulate cortices under distinct fatigue levels. This work contributes to enhancing our understanding of deep learning methods in the analysis of EEG signals. We even envision that deep learning might serve as a bridge between translation neuroscience and further real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Cardiomyopathy is a disease category that describes the diseases of the heart muscle. It can infect all ages with different serious complications, such as heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest. Usually, signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy include abnormal heart rhythms, dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting. Smart devices have blown up a nonclinical revolution to heart patients’ monitoring. In particular, motion sensors can concurrently monitor patients’ abnormal movements. Smart wearables can efficiently track abnormal heart rhythms. These intelligent wearables emitted data must be adequately processed to make the right decisions for heart patients. In this article, a comprehensive, optimized model is introduced for smart monitoring of cardiomyopathy patients via sensors and wearable devices. The proposed model includes two new proposed algorithms. First, a fuzzy Harris hawks optimizer (FHHO) is introduced to increase the coverage of monitored patients by redistributing sensors in the observed area via the hybridization of artificial intelligence (AI) and fuzzy logic (FL). Second, we introduced wearable sensing data optimization (WSDO), which is a novel algorithm for the accurate and reliable handling of cardiomyopathy sensing data. After testing and verification, FHHO proves to enhance patient coverage and reduce the number of needed sensors. Meanwhile, WSDO is employed for the detection of heart rate and failure in large simulations. These experimental results indicate that WSDO can efficiently refine the sensing data with high accuracy rates and low time cost.},

The aim of this article is to reduce the order of the original stochastic discrete-time IT2 fuzzy system into lower order system without ignoring the influence of IT2 membership functions. First, the Hankel-norm performance of the stochastic discrete-time IT2 fuzzy model is analyzed. Then, based on the projection theorem and cone complementary linearization approach, a convex Hankel-norm-based model reduction approach subject to conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is obtained. A membership-functions-dependent (MFD) technique is applied to capture the information of IT2 membership functions and further reduce the conservativeness.

Second, based on the topology-dependent Lyapunov function approach, the design conditions of secure control protocol are derived such that cooperative tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Interestingly, by exploiting the topology-allocation-dependent average dwell-time (TADADT) technique, the stability analysis of closed-loop error dynamics is presented, and the proposed coordination design conditions can relax time constraints on interaction topology switching.

  abstract     = {Feature extraction is an essential process in the intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Although existing feature extraction methods can obtain representative features from the original signal, domain knowledge and expert experience are often required. In this article, a novel diagnosis approach based on evolutionary learning, namely, automatic feature extraction and construction using genetic programming (AFECGP), is proposed to automatically generate informative and discriminative features from original vibration signals for identifying different fault types of rotating machinery. To achieve this, a new program structure, a new function set, and a new terminal set are developed in AFECGP to allow it to detect important subband signals and extract and construct informative features, automatically and simultaneously. More important, AFECGP can produce a flexible number of features for classification. Having the generated features, $k$ -Nearest Neighbors is employed to perform fault diagnosis. The performance of the AFECGP-based fault diagnosis approach is evaluated on four fault diagnosis datasets of varying difficulty and compared with 14 baseline methods. The results show that the proposed approach achieves better fault diagnosis accuracy on all the datasets than the competitive methods and can effectively identify different fault conditions of rolling bearing, gear, and rotor.},

The sensors are sampled with a period that is different from the state updating period of the system. In order to lighten the communication burden and alleviate the network congestions, the WTOD protocol is implemented in the sensor-to-filter channel to schedule the order of the data transmission of the sensors. In the case of the measurement outliers, a saturation function is employed in the filter structure to constrain the innovations contaminated by the measurement outliers, thereby maintaining satisfactory filtering performance. By resorting to the solution to a matrix difference equation, an upper bound is first obtained on the covariance of the filtering error, and the gain matrix of the filter is then characterized to minimize the derived upper bound. Furthermore, the exponential boundedness of the filtering error dynamics is analyzed in the mean square sense. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed outlier-resistant RF scheme is verified by simulation examples.},

The present event-triggering condition differs from the existing literature in that it can make the triggering threshold non-negative without the requirement of properly selecting the prescribed level of disturbance attenuation. After that, under the framework of adaptive critic learning, we use a single critic network to solve the event-driven HJIE and tune its weight parameters by using historical and instantaneous state data simultaneously. Based on the Lyapunov approach, we demonstrate that the uniform ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system is guaranteed.

  abstract     = {Due to the population-based and iterative-based characteristics of evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms, parallel techniques have been widely used to speed up the EC algorithms. However, the parallelism usually performs in the population level where multiple populations (or subpopulations) run in parallel or in the individual level where the individuals are distributed to multiple resources. That is, different populations or different individuals can be executed simultaneously to reduce running time. However, the research into generation-level parallelism for EC algorithms has seldom been reported. In this article, we propose a new paradigm of the parallel EC algorithm by making the first attempt to parallelize the algorithm in the generation level. This idea is inspired by the industrial pipeline technique. Specifically, a kind of EC algorithm called local version particle swarm optimization (PSO) is adopted to implement a pipeline-based parallel PSO (PPPSO, i.e., P 3 SO). Due to the generation-level parallelism in P 3 SO, when some particles still perform their evolutionary operations in the current generation, some other particles can simultaneously go to the next generation to carry out the new evolutionary operations, or even go to further next generation(s). The experimental results show that the problem-solving ability of P 3 SO is not affected while the evolutionary speed has been substantially accelerated in a significant fashion. Therefore, generation-level parallelism is possible in EC algorithms and may have significant potential applications in time-consumption optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Objectives optimization and constraints satisfaction are two equally important goals to solve constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs). However, most existing studies for CMaOPs can be classified as feasibility-driven-constrained many-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMaOEAs), and they always give priority to satisfy constraints, while ignoring the maintenance of the population diversity for dealing with conflicting objectives. Consequently, the population may be pushed toward some locally feasible optimal or locally infeasible areas in the high-dimensional objective space. To alleviate this issue, this article presents a problem transformation technique, which transforms a CMaOP into a dynamic CMaOP (DCMaOP) for handling constraints and optimizing objectives simultaneously, to help the population cross the large and discrete infeasible regions. The well-known reference-point-based NSGA-III is tailored under the problem transformation model to solve CMaOPs, namely, DCNSGA-III. In this article, $\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }$ -feasible solutions play an important role in the proposed algorithm. To this end, in DCNSGA-III, a mating selection mechanism and an environmental selection operator are designed to generate and choose high-quality $\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }$ -feasible offspring solutions, respectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a series of benchmark CMaOPs with three, five, eight, ten, and 15 objectives and compared against six state-of-the-art CMaOEAs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive for solving CMaOPs.},

  abstract     = {With the development of deep neural networks, the performance of crowd counting and pixel-wise density estimation is continually being refreshed. Despite this, there are still two challenging problems in this field: 1) current supervised learning needs a large amount of training data, but collecting and annotating them is difficult and 2) existing methods cannot generalize well to the unseen domain. A recently released synthetic crowd dataset alleviates these two problems. However, the domain gap between the real-world data and synthetic images decreases the models’ performance. To reduce the gap, in this article, we propose a domain-adaptation-style crowd counting method, which can effectively adapt the model from synthetic data to the specific real-world scenes. It consists of multilevel feature-aware adaptation (MFA) and structured density map alignment (SDA). To be specific, MFA boosts the model to extract domain-invariant features from multiple layers. SDA guarantees the network outputs fine density maps with a reasonable distribution on the real domain. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on four mainstream surveillance crowd datasets, Shanghai Tech Part B, WorldExpo’10, Mall, and UCSD. Extensive experiments are evidence that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the same cross-domain counting problem.},

First, a radial basis function NN method is utilized to tackle the unknown input saturations, dead zones, and model uncertainties. Then, based on the backstepping approach, two adaptive NN boundary controllers with update laws are employed to stabilize the like-position loop subsystem and like-posture loop subsystem, respectively. With the introduced control laws, the uniform ultimate boundedness of the deflection and angle tracking errors for the flexible manipulator are guaranteed. Finally, the control performance of the developed control technique is examined by a numerical example.},

Conflicts are imminent in groups and conflict management is complex and necessary especially in a large group. However, there are few studies that quantitatively research the conflict detection and resolution in the large-group context, especially in the multicriteria large-group decision making (GDM) context. This article proposes a dynamic adaptive subgroup-to-subgroup conflict model to solve multicriteria large-scale GDM problems. A compatibility index is proposed based on two kinds of conflicts among experts: 1) cognitive conflict and 2) interest conflict. Then, the fuzzy $c$ -means clustering algorithm is used to classify experts into several subgroups. A subgroup-to-subgroup conflict detection method and a weight-determination approach are developed based on the clustering results. Afterward, a conflict resolution model, which can dynamically generate feedback suggestion, is introduced. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning approaches have significantly contributed to recent progress in stereo matching. These deep stereo matching methods are usually based on supervised training, which requires a large amount of high-quality ground-truth depth map annotations that are expensive to collect. Furthermore, only a limited quantity of stereo vision training data are currently available, obtained either by active sensors (Lidar and ToF cameras) or through computer graphics simulations and not meeting requirements for deep supervised training. Here, we propose a novel deep stereo approach called the “self-supervised multiscale adversarial regression network (SMAR-Net),” which relaxes the need for ground-truth depth maps for training. Specifically, we design a two-stage network. The first stage is a disparity regressor, in which a regression network estimates disparity values from stacked stereo image pairs. Stereo image stacking method is a novel contribution as it not only contains the spatial appearances of stereo images but also implies matching correspondences with different disparity values. In the second stage, a synthetic left image is generated based on the left–right consistency assumption. Our network is trained by minimizing a hybrid loss function composed of a content loss and an adversarial loss. The content loss minimizes the average warping error between the synthetic images and the real ones. In contrast to the generative adversarial loss, our proposed adversarial loss penalizes mismatches using multiscale features. This constrains the synthetic image and real image as being pixelwise identical instead of just belonging to the same distribution. Furthermore, the combined utilization of multiscale feature extraction in both the content loss and adversarial loss further improves the adaptability of SMAR-Net in ill-posed regions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that SMAR-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and achieves comparable outcomes to supervised methods.

Unlike most existing NN-based works that normally ignore the precondition on the functionality and reliability of NN unit and thus can only ensure semiglobal stability, the proposed method explicitly addresses the issue of reliable in-loop operation of NN approximation-based control unit, resulting in a safeguarded NN-based control solution capable of ensuring globally stable tracking. Furthermore, the control method proposed guarantees exponentially globally stable tracking for systems with self-restructuring nonlinearities and uncertainties, distinguishing itself from those that only yield uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) regulation/tracking results for nonlinear systems with fixed structures. All of these features are achieved by the proposed strategy consisting of two cooperative control units: 1) safeguard control and 2) NN-based control. The role of the safeguard control is to force the states (starting from any initial condition) to enter a stable region, so that the NN-based control can be activated trustworthily and safely. It is such cooperation of the two units that not only ensures the tracking error entering the stable region first within a prespecified finite time but also guarantees the tracking error converging to zero exponentially thereafter, resulting in global zero-error tracking. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation authenticate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

For the time-invariant linear systems, · x(t)=A x(t)+B u(t), and the traditional linear quadratic regulator (LQR), which minimizes a quadratic cost function, has been well established given both the adjacency matrix A and the control input matrix B. However, this conventional approach is not applicable when we have the freedom to design B. In this article, we investigate the situation when the input matrix B is a variable to be designed to reduce the control cost. First, the problem is formulated and we establish an equivalent expression of the quadratic cost function with respect to B, which is difficult to obtain within the traditional theoretical framework as it requires obtaining an explicit solution of a Riccati differential equation (RDE). Next, we derive the gradient of the quadratic cost function with respect to the matrix variable B analytically. Further, we obtain three inequalities of the cost functions, after which several possible design (optimization) problems are discussed, and algorithms based on gradient information are proposed. It is shown that the cost of controlling the LTI systems can be significantly reduced when the input matrix becomes “designable.” We find that the nodes connected to input sources can be sparsely identified and they are distributed as evenly as possible in the LTI networks if one wants to control the networks with the lowest cost. Our findings help us better understand how the LTI systems should be controlled through designing the input matrix.},

  abstract     = {The study on the stabilization of planar underactuated manipulators without gravity is well recognized as a major challenge since the system includes a second-order nonholonomic constraint when the passive link is not located at the first link. It is important to solve this difficulty for applications such as systems working in aerospace or underwater. This article presents a position control method based on bidirectional motion planning and intelligent optimization for this kind of system. The control objective is to move the end effector of the manipulator from its initial position to a given target position. The differential evolution algorithm is applied to solve the target angles of all links corresponding to the target position of the end effector. Then, bidirectional motion planning is performed, which consists of forward and backward motions. Each motion is planned by designing a trajectory for every active link based on their initial and target angles. During the forward motion, all active links except the first one are moved to their target angles, and the first active link and the passive link to the intermediate angles. For the backward motion, the first active link is moved to its target angle, the other active links remain at their target angles, and the passive link will be moved to its target angle at the same time. The planned trajectories are chosen based on the time-scaling method and differential evolution algorithm to make sure that the forward and backward planned motions can be connected smoothly. Finally, the trajectory tracking controllers for all active links are designed based on the sliding-mode control method. The proposed control method is verified on planar four-link underactuated manipulators with different passive joints. This strategy has the advantage that it works for planar underactuated manipulators with a second-order nonholonomic constraint whose passive link can be at different positions. Meanwhile, by combining intelligent optimization with bidirectional motion planning, the control process becomes simpler and more effective.},

The purpose is to reconstruct the unavailable system state based on a group of distributed observers, where each of them can only receive at most 1-D output measurement from the system. First, in the absence of disturbance, a new distributed prescribed finite-time observer featuring time-varying gains is constructed and designed under the assumption of joint observability. It is analytically proved that for any prescribed instant independent of system initial conditions and other design parameters, the obtained distributed observer can guarantee not only the asymptotic convergence to zero of the state error between each observer state and the system state at this prescribed instant but also the definite zero-state error after this prescribed instant. Second, a distributed prescribed finite-time bounded observer is delicately proposed to account for the presence of external disturbance in the system dynamics. It is shown that the state error can be bounded by an arbitrarily positive constant after a prescribed instant. Finally, a numerical example and an electromechanical system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

To tackle the above problems, we propose a linear control scheme by using the low-gain feedback technique under the assumptions that each node is asymptotically null controllable and the underlying topology of each cluster (the extended cluster under the intermittent pinning control) has a directed spanning tree. The Lyapunov-based method and the low-gain feedback technique are developed for convergence analysis.

The proposed SOF fuzzy control framework is established via the absolute stability theory with appropriate sector-bounded properties of the local state and input nonlinearities. Moreover, both state and input constraints are explicitly taken into account in the control design using set-invariance arguments. Especially, we include the local sector-bounded nonlinearities of the fuzzy systems in the construction of both the nonlinear controller and the nonquadratic Lyapunov function. Within the considered local control context, the new class of nonquadratic Lyapunov functions provides an effective solution to estimate the closed-loop domain of attraction, which can be nonconvex and even disconnected. The convexification procedure is performed using specific congruence transformations in accordance with the special structures of the proposed SOF controllers and nonquadratic Lyapunov functions. Consequently, the fuzzy SOF control design can be reformulated as an optimization problem under strict linear matrix inequality constraints with a linear search parameter. Compared to existing fuzzy SOF control schemes, the new structures of the control law and the Lyapunov function are more general and offer additional degrees of freedom for the control design. Both theoretical arguments and numerical illustrations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the design conservatism.},

  abstract     = {In this article, by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Laplacian L, we investigate the controllability of multiagent systems under equitable partitions. Two classes of nontrivial cells are defined according to the different numbers of links between them, which are completely connected nontrivial cells (CCNCs) and incompletely connected nontrivial cells. For the system with CCNCs, a necessary condition for controllability is found to be choosing leaders from each nontrivial cell, the number of which should be one less than the cardinality of the cell. It is shown that the controllability is affected by three factors: 1) the number of the links between nontrivial cells; 2) the rank of the connection matrix; and 3) the odevity of the capacity of the nontrivial cells. In the case of nontrivial cells under the equitable partition, there are automorphisms of interconnection graph G , which induce the eigenvectors of L with zero entries. For the system with automorphisms, by taking advantage of the property of eigenvectors associated with L, we propose several graphical necessary conditions for controllability. In addition, by the PBH rank criterion, the controllable subspaces of the system with different classes of nontrivial cells are compared. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability under minimum inputs is given.},

To solve this problem, a feedforward-feedback composite control framework is established, which contains two main stages. In the first stage, for disturbed second-order individual systems with generally strongly convex cost functions, a composite finite-time optimization control scheme is proposed based on the combination of adding a power integrator and the finite-time disturbance observer techniques and the use of the cost functions&#39; gradients and Hessian matrices. In the second stage, based on the result of the first stage, a distributed composite finite-time optimization control framework is built for disturbed second-order multiagent systems with quadratic-like local cost functions. This framework involves a kind of finite-time consensus algorithm, some novel distributed finite-time estimators designed for each agent to estimate the velocity, the gradient and Hessian matrix for the local cost function of any other agent, and some optimization terms in the form of the optimization controllers proposed in the first stage and based on the estimates from the distributed estimators. The finite-time convergence of the closed-loop systems is rigorously proved. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework.},

Second, by constructing a parameterized set, it is shown that PBNs subject to function perturbation keep FTSPO if and only if the perturbed point does not belong to the parameterized set, while PBNs become ASPO if and only if the perturbed point belongs to the parameterized set. Third, as an application of perturbed stability analysis, the robust state-feedback stabilization is discussed for probabilistic Boolean control networks (PBCNs) with function perturbation.

First, by carefully modeling such DoS attacks as aperiodic pulse-width-modulated (PWM) jamming signals, a switching observer, adapting to the DoS attacks, is delicately constructed to deal with the unavailability of full-state information. Second, to economize the limited bandwidth resources, a dynamic event-triggered communication scheme is designed under the aperiodic DoS jamming attacks, whose duration and frequency are assumed to be restricted. Third, a switching system model with artificial state delay is formulated, which characterizes the effects of the aperiodic DoS attacks and event-triggered communication scheme in a unified framework. Then, the asymptotic stability analysis and controller/observer synthesis conditions of the resulting switching system are obtained by using a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Furthermore, a co-design method of the dynamic triggering parameters, controller, and observer gains is presented. Finally, an example is employed to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

OB control is to design all virtual controls and the actual control of backstepping to be the optimized solutions of corresponding subsystems. If the control is developed by employing the existing RL-based optimal control methods, it will become very intricate because their critic and actor updating laws are derived by carrying out gradient descent algorithm to the square of Bellman residual error, which is equal to the approximation of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that contains multiple nonlinear terms. In order to effectively accomplish the optimized control, a simplified RL algorithm is designed by deriving the updating laws from the negative gradient of a simple positive function, which is generated from the partial derivative of the HJB equation. Meanwhile, the design can also release the condition of persistence excitation, which is required in most existing optimal controls.

  abstract     = {Many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) pose a big challenge to the traditional Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). As the number of objectives increases, the number of mutually nondominated solutions explodes and MOEAs become invalid due to the loss of Pareto-based selection pressure. Indicator-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been proposed to address this issue by enhancing the environmental selection. Indicator-based MaOEAs are easy to implement and of good versatility, however, they are unlikely to maintain the population diversity and coverage very well. In this article, a new indicator-based MaOEA with boundary protection, namely, MaOEA-IBP, is presented to relieve this weakness. In MaOEA-IBP, a worst elimination mechanism based on the ${I}_{{\epsilon }^{+}}$ indicator and boundary protection strategy is devised to enhance the balance of population convergence, diversity, and coverage. Specifically, a pair of solutions with the smallest ${I}_{{\epsilon }^{+}}$ value are first identified from the population. If one solution dominates the other, the dominated solution is eliminated. Otherwise, one solution is eliminated by the boundary protection strategy. MaOEA-IBP is compared with four indicator-based algorithms (i.e., ${I}_{{{ {SDE}}}^{+}}$ , SRA, MaOEAIGD, and ARMOEA) and other five state-of-the-art MaOEAs (i.e., KnEA, MaOEA-CSS, 1by1EA, RVEA, and EFR-RR) on various benchmark MaOPs. The experimental results demonstrate that MaOEA-IBP can achieve competitive performance with the compared algorithms.},

With the advent of mobile computing, the recent focus of text-entry research has moved from physical keyboards to soft keyboards. Current soft keyboards, however, increase the typo rate due to a lack of tactile feedback and degrade the usability of mobile devices due to their large portion on screens. To tackle these limitations, we propose a fully imaginary keyboard (I-Keyboard) with a deep neural decoder (DND). The invisibility of I-Keyboard maximizes the usability of mobile devices and DND empowered by a deep neural architecture allows users to start typing from any position on the touch screens at any angle. To the best of our knowledge, the eyes-free ten-finger typing scenario of I-Keyboard which does not necessitate both a calibration step and a predefined region for typing is first explored in this article. For the purpose of training DND, we collected the largest user data in the process of developing I-Keyboard. We verified the performance of the proposed I-Keyboard and DND by conducting a series of comprehensive simulations and experiments under various conditions. I-Keyboard showed 18.95\% and 4.06\% increases in typing speed (45.57 words per minute) and accuracy (95.84\%), respectively, over the baseline.},

The current state-of-the-art fingerprint classification methods use a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to assign confidence for the classification prediction, and based on this prediction, the input fingerprint is matched with only the subset of the database that belongs to the predicted class. It can be observed for the DCNNs that as the architectures deepen, the farthest layers of the network learn more abstract information from the input images that result in higher prediction accuracies. However, the downside is that the DCNNs are data hungry and require lots of annotated (labeled) data to learn generalized network parameters for deeper layers. In this article, a shallow multifeature view CNN (SMV-CNN) fingerprint classifier is proposed that extracts: 1) fine-grained features from the input image and 2) abstract features from explicitly derived representations obtained from the input image. The multifeature views are fed to a fully connected neural network (NN) to compute a global classification prediction. The classification results show that the SMV-CNN demonstrated an improvement of 2.8\% when compared to baseline CNN consisting of a single grayscale view on an open-source database. Moreover, in comparison with the state-of-the-art residual network (ResNet-50) image classification model, the proposed method performs comparably while being less complex and more efficient during training. The result of classification-based fingerprint identification has shown that the search space is reduced by over 50\% without degradation of identification accuracies.},

  abstract     = {GWI survey 1 has highlighted the flourishing use of multiple social networks: the average number of social media accounts per Internet user is 5.54, and among them, 2.82 are being used actively. Indeed, users tend to express their views in more than one social media site. Hence, merging social signals of the same user across different social networks together, if available, can facilitate the downstream analyses. Previous work has paid little attention on modeling the cooperation among the following factors when fusing data from multiple social networks: 1) as data from different sources characterizes the characteristics of the same social user, the source consistency merits our attention; 2) due to their different functional emphases, some aspects of the same user captured by different social networks can be just complementary and results in the source complementarity; and 3) different sources can contribute differently to the user characterization and hence lead to the different source confidence. Toward this end, we propose a novel unified model, which co-regularizes source consistency, complementarity, and confidence to boost the learning performance with multiple social networks. In addition, we derived its theoretical solution and verified the model with the real-world application of user interest inference. Extensive experiments over several state-of-the-art competitors have justified the superiority of our model. 1 http://tinyurl.com/zk6kgc9},

Unlike the existing works, we model the GAP as a bi-objective constrained optimization problem. The total walking distance of passengers and the total robust cost of the gate assignment are the two objectives to be optimized, while satisfying the constraints regarding the limited number of flights assigned to apron, as well as three types of compatibility. A set of real instances is then constructed based on the data obtained from the Baiyun airport (CAN) in Guangzhou, China. A two-phase large neighborhood search (2PLNS) is proposed, which accommodates a greedy and stochastic strategy (GSS) for the large neighborhood search; both to speed up its convergence and to avoid local optima. The empirical analysis and results on both the synthetic instances and the constructed real-world instances show a better performance for the proposed 2PLNS as compared to many state-of-the-art algorithms in literature. An efficient way of choosing the tradeoff from a large number of nondominated solutions is also discussed in this article.},

With the development of the related technologies such as single-cell RNA-Seq, the dimensions of gene expression data are increased to hundreds of thousands or more for high-resolution insights. There is a long-lasting challenge in exploiting the relations between transcriptomic profiles and random composite measurements. To address it, we proposed a mathematical framework based on differential evolution (global search) with the help of compressed sensing (local search) termed as DECS. Exploiting the inherent sparse nature of gene expression data, the proposed DECS method can learn the sparse module dictionaries and levels from the low-dimensional random composite measurements for reconstructing the high-dimensional gene expression data with significant orders of magnitude (e.g. 200 ×). Several experiments were conducted to compare DECS with three benchmark methods, demonstrating that the proposed DECS outperforms the benchmark methods and can recover most of the gene expression patterns. The underlying reasons are discussed and illustrated by revealing the related mechanistic insights through extensive benchmarks on nine GSE datasets and their sensitivity analysis.},

In this article, we propose an automatic symmetry detection method for brain MR images in 2-D slices based on a 2-channel convolutional neural network (CNN). Different from the existing detection methods that mainly rely on the local image features (gradient, edge, etc.) to determine the MSP, we use a CNN-based model to implement the brain symmetry detection, which does not require any local feature detections and feature matchings. By training to learn a wide variety of benchmarks in the brain images, we can further use a 2-channel CNN to evaluate the similarity between the pairs of brain patches, which are randomly extracted from the whole brain slice based on a Poisson sampling. Finally, a scoring and ranking scheme is used to identify the optimal symmetry axis for each input brain MR slice. Our method was evaluated in 2166 artificial synthesized brain images and 3064 collected in vivo MR images, which included both healthy and pathological cases. The experimental results display that our method achieves excellent performance for symmetry detection. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods also demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages for our approach in achieving higher accuracy than the previous competitors.},

  abstract     = {Recently, salient object detection (SOD) has witnessed vast progress with the rapid development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the improvement of SOD accuracy comes with the increase in network depth and width, resulting in large network size and heavy computational overhead. This prevents state-of-the-art SOD methods from being deployed into practical platforms, especially mobile devices. To promote the deployment of real-world SOD applications, we aim at developing a lightweight SOD model in this article. Our observation comes from that the primate visual system processes visual signals hierarchically with different receptive fields and eccentricities in different visual cortex areas. Inspired by this, we propose a hierarchical visual perception (HVP) module to imitate the primate visual cortex for hierarchical perception learning. With the HVP module incorporated, we design a lightweight SOD network, namely, HVPNet. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HVPNet achieves highly competitive accuracy compared with state-of-the-art SOD methods while running at 4.3 frames/s CPU speed and 333.2 frames/s GPU speed with only 1.23M parameters.},

In the last decade, the integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) problem has become a research hotspot in the manufacturing system area. It is an NP-hard problem and is more complicated than the job shop scheduling problem. Although some progress has been obtained in the IPPS field, there are still many unsolved open problems. In this article, the novel integrated encoding and decoding methods are proposed by considering the OR-node of the process network graph. Moreover, a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) is designed based on the proposed coding methods. The process planning and the scheduling parts can be represented simultaneously in one individual. As for the precedence constraints between operations, the specifically designed operators are able to guarantee the feasibility of the operation sequence during the searching procedure. Then, the superiority of MGA is verified by updating nine new records on 37 well-known open problems, four of them reach their lower bounds. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also tested on a real-world case from a nonstandard equipment workshop in a Chinese machine tool company, which produces a common module of a packaging machine. The results show that the proposed MGA can solve the real-world case better than the comparative algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Band selection has been widely utilized in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification to reduce the dimensionality of HSIs. Recently, deep-learning-based band selection has become of great interest. However, existing deep-learning-based methods usually implement band selection and classification in isolation, or evaluate selected spectral bands by training the deep network repeatedly, which may lead to the loss of discriminative bands and increased computational cost. In this article, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based on bandwise-independent convolution and hard thresholding (BHCNN) is proposed, which combines band selection, feature extraction, and classification into an end-to-end trainable network. In BHCNN, a band selection layer is constructed by designing bandwise $1\times 1$ convolutions, which perform for each spectral band of input HSIs independently. Then, hard thresholding is utilized to constrain the weights of convolution kernels with unselected spectral bands to zero. In this case, these weights are difficult to update. To optimize these weights, the straight-through estimator (STE) is devised by approximating the gradient. Furthermore, a novel coarse-to-fine loss calculated by full and selected spectral bands is defined to improve the interpretability of STE. In the subsequent layers of BHCNN, multiscale 3-D dilated convolutions are constructed to extract joint spatial–spectral features from HSIs with selected spectral bands. The experimental results on several HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method uses selected spectral bands to achieve more encouraging classification performance than current state-of-the-art band selection methods.},

Most previous works in the artificial-intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather than mining the reason why emotions are not or wrongly recognized. The correlation among emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition. In this article, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion correlation mining through natural language text from Web news. The correlation among emotions, expressed as the confusion and evolution of emotion, is primarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation from emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep neural-network models are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted through an orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution law is evaluated from three perspectives: one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path transfer. The method is validated using three datasets: 1) the titles; 2) the bodies; and 3) the comments of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in varying lengths (long and short). The experimental results show that in subjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger. Comments tend to arouse emotion circulations of love–anger and sadness–anger. In objective news, it is easy to recognize text emotion as love and cause fear–joy circulation. These findings could provide insights for applications regarding affective interaction, such as network public sentiment, social media communication, and human–computer interaction.},

However, due to the complexity of emotions and individual differences in physiological responses, how to design reliable and effective models has become an important issue. In this article, we propose a regularized deep fusion framework for emotion recognition based on multimodal physiological signals. After extracting the effective features from different types of physiological signals, we construct ensemble dense embeddings of multimodal features using kernel matrices, and then utilize a deep network architecture to learn task-specific representations for each kind of physiological signal from these ensemble dense embeddings. Finally, a global fusion layer with a regularization term, which can efficiently explore the correlation and diversity among all of the representations in a synchronous optimization process, is designed to fuse generated representations. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that this framework can improve the performance of subject-independent emotion recognition compared to single-modal classifiers or other fusion methods. Data visualization also demonstrates that the final fusion representation exhibits higher class-separability power for emotion recognition.},

Due to the significant visual variants, the conventional methods lack scalability. Most existing works focus on the frontal face images in the controlled environment, such as the laboratory, and need to design specific systems for different eyeglass types. To address the limitation, we propose a unified eyeglass removal model called the eyeglasses removal generative adversarial network (ERGAN), which could handle different types of glasses in the wild. The proposed method does not depend on the dense annotation of eyeglasses location but benefits from the large-scale face images with weak annotations. Specifically, we study the two relevant tasks simultaneously, that is, removing eyeglasses and wearing eyeglasses. Given two face images with and without eyeglasses, the proposed model learns to swap the eye area in two faces. The generation mechanism focuses on the eye area and invades the difficulty of generating a new face. In the experiment, we show the proposed method achieves a competitive removal quality in terms of realism and diversity. Furthermore, we evaluate ERGAN on several subsequent tasks, such as face verification and facial expression recognition. The experiment shows that our method could serve as a preprocessing method for these tasks.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the low-rank and sparse decomposition model (LSDM) has been used for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery. The traditional LSDM assumes that the sparse component where anomalies and noise reside can be modeled by a single distribution which often potentially confuses weak anomalies and noise. Actually, a single distribution cannot accurately describe different noise characteristics. In this article, a combination of a mixture noise model with low-rank background may more accurately characterize complex distribution. A modified LSDM, by modeling the sparse component as a mixture of Gaussian (MoG), is employed for hyperspectral anomaly detection. In the proposed framework, the variational Bayes (VB) algorithm is applied to infer a posterior MoG model. Once the noise model is determined, anomalies can be easily separated from the noise components. Furthermore, a simple but effective detector based on the Manhattan distance is incorporated for anomaly detection under complex distribution.

  abstract     = {Face photo-sketch synthesis aims at generating a facial sketch/photo conditioned on a given photo/sketch. It covers wide applications including digital entertainment and law enforcement. Precisely depicting face photos/sketches remains challenging due to the restrictions on structural realism and textural consistency. While existing methods achieve compelling results, they mostly yield blurred effects and great deformation over various facial components, leading to the unrealistic feeling of synthesized images. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose using facial composition information to help the synthesis of face sketch/photo. Especially, we propose a novel composition-aided generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) for face photo-sketch synthesis. In CA-GAN, we utilize paired inputs, including a face photo/sketch and the corresponding pixelwise face labels for generating a sketch/photo. Next, to focus training on hard-generated components and delicate facial structures, we propose a compositional reconstruction loss. In addition, we employ a perceptual loss function to encourage the synthesized image and real image to be perceptually similar. Finally, we use stacked CA-GANs (SCA-GANs) to further rectify defects and add compelling details. The experimental results show that our method is capable of generating both visually comfortable and identity-preserving face sketches/photos over a wide range of challenging data. In addition, our method significantly decreases the best previous Fréchet inception distance (FID) from 36.2 to 26.2 for sketch synthesis, and from 60.9 to 30.5 for photo synthesis. Besides, we demonstrate that the proposed method is of considerable generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with position-based synchronization of networked harmonic oscillators. Note that synchronization cannot be achieved via current-position-based protocols. The objective of this paper is to investigate the positive effects of network-induced delays on the synchronization of networked harmonic oscillators. That is, if taking network-induced delays into account, the motion of harmonic oscillators can be really synchronized via a proper position-based control protocol. In doing so, the harmonic oscillators are connected via a shared digital communication network. Different from some existing results, system measurements from oscillator nodes are sampled in an asynchronous way; and network-induced delays are assumed to be time varying and bounded, and they do not need to be synchronous with those from the other communication channels. At each oscillator node, a buffer is embedded into the controller to store the newest sampled-data packets transmitted from its neighboring nodes through communication channels. Then, based on the store of the buffer, the controller computes its control signal with its own period. As a result, the overall synchronization error system is modeled as a linear system with multiple interval time-varying delays. By employing the discretized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, a sufficient condition on synchronization of networked harmonic oscillators is derived, which can ensure that the synchronization error system is asymptotically stable for network-induced delays falling into a certain closed interval whose lower bound is a positive real number. This condition is thus used to design suitable control protocols in terms of linear matrix inequalities with several tuning parameters. Finally, a multirobot platform is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, the optimization problem is difficult to solve since it is both nonsmooth and nonseparable. The existing numerical solutions implicate the use of several auxiliary variables in order to deal with the nondifferentiable penalty. Thus, the resulting algorithms are both time- and memory-inefficient. This paper proposes a compact neural network to solve the FLSA. The neural network has a one-layer structure with the number of neurons proportionate to the dimension of the given signal, thanks to the utilization of consecutive projections. The proposed neural network is stable in the Lyapunov sense and is guaranteed to converge globally to the optimal solution of the FLSA. Experiments on several applications from signal processing and biomedical engineering confirm the reasonable performance of the proposed neural network.},

Specifically, if linear or bipolar-sigmoid activation functions are applied, the IRNN possess exponential convergence performance. The IRNN has finite-time convergence property by using power activation function. To obtain faster convergence performance and finite-time convergence property, an SP-AF is designed. Furthermore, by using the discretization method, the discrete IRNN model and its convergence analysis are also presented.

This paper designs two strategies to estimate the missing outputs. The first one is based on the expectation maximization formulation in which a joint posterior distribution over the missing outputs and the weights vector is derived as a multivariate Gaussian form, and the another maximizes the marginal likelihood function with respect to the missing outputs and other hyperparameters. To verify the performance of the two proposed computing strategies, two synthetic time series and a real-life dataset are employed.

The geomagnetic field (GF) is a ubiquitous cue for navigation by these animals. Inspired by the goal-oriented navigation of animals, a novel long-distance underwater geomagnetic navigation (LDUGN) method is presented in this article, which only utilizes the declination component ( D) and inclination component ( I) of GF for underwater navigation without any prior knowledge of the geographical location or geomagnetic map. The D and I measured by high-precision geomagnetic sensors are compared periodically with that of the destination to determine the velocity and direction in the next step. A model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with control and state constraints is proposed to achieve the control and optimization of navigation trajectory. Because the optimal control is recalculated at each sampling instant, the MPC algorithm can overcome interferences of geomagnetic daily fluctuation, geomagnetic storms, ocean current, and geomagnetic local anomaly. The simulation results validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.},

In order to guarantee the system’s decay rate to be faster than a prespecified value, a constraint on the dominant eigenvalue of the system is required to be considered. This results in a nonconvex optimization problem as eigenvalue of a parametric nonsymmetric matrix is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, and even non-Lipschitz function. Here, we present a convex equivalent optimization problem whose minimizer also solves this eigenvalue optimization problem. This optimization problem proposes a state-feedback matrix which results in a decay rate faster than a given value while input signal costs are considered. The equivalent optimization problem in combination with sparsity-promoting optimal control constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem. Using alternating direction method of multipliers, the problem is decomposed into a chain of analytically solvable subproblems which are differentiable and separable. The proposed optimization framework includes relative preference between the topology of the control network and the decay rate of the system. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Competitive accuracies have been observed by the deep recognition models recently. Nevertheless, these deep architectures cannot explicitly characterize human visual perception, that is, the sequence of gaze allocation and the subsequent cognitive processes when viewing each scenery. In this paper, a novel spatially aware aggregation network is proposed for scene categorization, where the human gaze behavior is discovered in a semisupervised setting. In particular, as semantically labeling a large quantity of scene images is labor-intensive, a semisupervised and structure-preserved non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is proposed to detect a set of visually/semantically salient regions from each scenery. Afterward, the gaze shifting path (GSP) is engineered to characterize the process of humans perceiving each scene picture. To deeply describe each GSP, a novel spatially aware CNN termed SA-Net is developed. It accepts input regions with various shapes and statistically aggregates all the salient regions along each GSP. Finally, the learned deep GSP features from the entire scene images are fused into an image kernel, which is subsequently integrated into a kernel SVM to categorize different sceneries. Comparative experiments on six scene image sets have shown the advantage of our method.},

However, the demand for the avoidance of TD defects, such as low data-efficiency and divergence in off-policy learning, has inspired the studies of a large number of novel TD-based approaches. Gradient-based and least-squares-based algorithms comprise the major part of these new approaches. This paper aims to combine advantages of these two categories to derive an efficient policy evaluation algorithm with O( n 2 ) per-time-step runtime complexity. The least-squares-based framework is adopted, and the gradient correction is used to improve convergence performance. This paper begins with the revision of a previous O( n 3 ) batch algorithm, least-squares TD with a gradient correction (LS-TDC) to regularize the parameter vector. Based on the recursive least-squares technique, an O( n 2 ) counterpart of LS-TDC called RC is proposed. To increase data efficiency, we generalize RC with eligibility traces. An off-policy extension is also proposed based on importance sampling. In addition, the convergence analysis for RC as well as LS-TDC is given. The empirical results in both on-policy and off-policy benchmarks show that RC has a higher estimation accuracy than that of RLSTD and a significantly lower runtime complexity than that of LSTDC.},

In this paper, we develop a divisively normalized sparse coding scheme, aiming to further bridge the gap between sparse representation and human visual perception. We show that such a scheme is perceptually meaningful for representing visual signals, with which the pixel-domain image representation and processing tasks can be feasibly and efficiently achieved in the divisively normalized sparse-domain. Specifically, we develop a sparse-domain similarity (SDS) index for perceptual quality evaluation, where the DNT is employed for transforming image signals into a perceptually uniform space. Furthermore, the proposed SDS index is employed to optimize the sparse coding process when representing natural images. The experimental results indicate that the SDS can provide accurate and consistent predictions of perceived image quality, and the performance of sparse coding can be significantly improved in terms of both objective and subjective quality evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Saliency detection is a hot topic in recent years and much efforts have been made to address it from different perspectives. However, current saliency models cannot meet the needs for diversified scenes due to their limited generalization capability. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a hybrid saliency model, which can fuse heterogeneous visual cues for robust salient object detection. A new contour cue is first introduced to provide discriminative saliency information for scene description. Its realization is based on a discrete optimization objective and can be solved efficiently with an iterative algorithm. Followed by this, the contour cue is taken as a part of a hybrid sparse learning model, in which cues from different domains can interact and complement with each other for joint saliency fusion. This saliency fusion model is parameter-free and its numerical solution can be obtained using gradient descent methods. Finally, we advance an object proposal-based collaborative filtering strategy to generate high quality saliency maps from the above fusion results. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed saliency model can fuse heterogeneous cues in a unified optimization framework rather than combine them separately. Therefore, it has favorable modeling capability under diversified scenes where the saliency patterns appear quite differently. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we take experiments on four large saliency benchmark datasets and compare it with other 26 state-of-the-art saliency models. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results indicate the superiority of our method, especially in challenging situations. Besides, we apply our saliency model to ship detection of radar platforms and promising results are obtained over traditional detectors.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the cooperative output regulation problem of nonlinear output feedback systems under the communication network modeled by the proximity graph, which is time varying and state dependent. Under the relaxed assumption that the proximity graph is initially connected, based on an improved potential function, we first propose a distributed connectivity-preserving output feedback control law with a linear internal model and distributed observer, which is robust to uncertain parameter and external disturbances in heterogeneous subsystems with strong nonlinearity. Successively, an adaptive design with parameter update law is derived to further tolerate an uncertain parameter in the exosystem, which generates the leader&#39;s trajectory and external disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the learning rules of humans/animals, self-paced learning (SPL) ranks the samples from easy to complex and assigns real-valued weights to the samples. The current SPL regimes adopt an increasing pace parameter to select the training samples. Obviously, it is difficult to tune the pace parameter during iterations. Furthermore, the current SPL regimes cannot go back to the previous stage even when the current model is worse than the previous one. In this article, a novel Pareto SPL (PSPL) approach is proposed to address the above issues. In PSPL, the SPL problem is considered as a multiobjective optimization problem. Then, a Pareto-based differential evolution algorithm is utilized to optimize the self-paced function and the weighted loss function simultaneously. In PSPL, a new representation method is designed to assign nonpositive weights to the unselected samples. Then, a modified mutation operator inspired by the SPL idea is proposed to generate new population based on ranking the individuals and assigning weights. No pace parameters are introduced in the proposed technique and PSPL can obtain entire solution spectrum to automatically adjust the solution path. The effectiveness of the PSPL has been demonstrated through rigorous studies with matrix factorization and multiclass classification problems.},

  abstract     = {The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) has been extensively investigated in the past years due to their applications in a variety of real-world scenarios. However, it is still very challenging for most existing algorithms to tackle large-scale CVRPs (LSCVRPs), namely, CVRPs with hundreds or thousands of customers. In this article, we propose a heuristic algorithm, called EMRG-HA, to address LSCVRPs based on the framework of divide and conquer, where an evolutionary multiobjective route grouping (EMRG) method is suggested to decompose an LSCVRP into small subcomponents. The suggested EMRG adopts a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for route grouping by simultaneously optimizing three well-defined objectives, intragroup distance, intergroup distance, and intergroup balance in size, which can obtain a set of promising decompositions of LSCVRPs. Based on the EMRG, a local search method is suggested to improve the quality of routes in groups, where only routes in one group instead of in all groups are improved which is determined according to the average serving cost of routes in each group. The performance of the proposed EMRG-HA is verified on 42 test instances from three popular benchmark suites. The experimental results show that the EMRG-HA is superior over eight existing algorithms on most test instances of LSCVRPs, in terms of both computational efficiency and solution quality.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate modeling of a surveillance scene is essential for the detection of anomalies in road traffic. Learning usual paths can provide valuable insight into road traffic conditions and thus can help in identifying unusual routes taken by commuters/vehicles. If usual traffic paths are learned in a nonparametric way, manual interventions in road marking can be avoided. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised and nonparametric method to learn the frequently used paths from the tracks of moving objects in Θ(kn) time, where k denotes the number of paths and n represents the number of tracks. In the proposed method, temporal dependencies of the moving objects are considered to make the clustering meaningful using temporally incremental gravity model (TIGM). In addition, the distance-based scene learning makes it intuitive to estimate the model parameters. Further, we have extended the TIGM hierarchically as a dynamically evolving model (DEM) to represent notable traffic dynamics of a scene. The experimental validation reveals that the proposed method can learn a scene quickly without prior knowledge about the number of paths ( k). We have compared the results with various state-of-the-art methods. We have also highlighted the advantages of the proposed method over the existing techniques popularly used for designing traffic monitoring applications. It can be used for administrative decision making to control traffic at junctions or crowded places and generate alarm signals, if necessary.},

In this article, we propose a novel elastic differential evolution algorithm to solve automatic data clustering. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed algorithm considers each clustering layout as a whole and adapts the cluster number and cluster centroids inherently through the variable-length encoding and the evolution operators. The encoding scheme contains no redundancy. To enable the individuals of different lengths to exchange information properly, we develop a subspace crossover and a two-phase mutation operator. The operators employ the basic method of differential evolution and, in addition, they consider the spatial information of cluster layouts to generate offspring solutions. Particularly, each dimension of the parameter vector interacts with its correlated dimensions, which not only adapts the cluster number but also avoids the cross-dimension learning error. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms that it is able to identify the correct number of clusters and obtain a good cluster validation value.},

  abstract     = {In conventional aurora image classification methods, it is general to employ only one single feature representation to capture the morphological characteristics of aurora images, which is difficult to describe the complicated morphologies of different aurora categories. Although several studies have proposed to use multiple feature representations, the inherent correlation among these representations are usually neglected. To address this problem, we propose a group-wise learning (GWL) method for the automatic aurora image classification using multiple representations. Specifically, we first extract the multiple feature representations for aurora images, and then construct a graph in each of multiple feature spaces. To model the correlation among different representations, we partition multiple graphs into several groups via a clustering algorithm. We further propose a GWL model to automatically estimate class labels for aurora images and optimal weights for the multiple representations in a data-driven manner. Finally, we develop a label fusion approach to make a final classification decision for new testing samples. The proposed GWL method focuses on the diverse properties of multiple feature representations, by clustering the correlated representations into the same group. We evaluate our method on an aurora image data set that contains 12 682 aurora images from 19 days. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GWL method achieves approximately 6\% improvement in terms of classification accuracy, compared to the methods using a single feature representation.},

The proposed MSPA duly considers the separation of all class pairs in multiclass linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and thus improves the subsequent classification performance. DR via MSPA leads to a nonconvex optimization problem. We develop an algorithm to solve the problem and the global optimal solution can be found by converting the original problem into a series of second-order cone programming problems.

  abstract     = {Hashing-based approximate nearest neighbors search has attracted broad research interest, due to its low computational cost and fast retrieval speed. The hashing technique maps the data points into binary codes and, meanwhile, preserves the similarity in the original space. Generally, we need to solve a discrete optimization problem to learn the binary codes and hash functions, which is NP-hard. In the literature, most hashing methods choose to solve a relaxed problem by discarding the discrete constraints. However, such a relaxation scheme will cause large quantization error, which makes the learned binary codes less effective. In this paper, we present an equivalent continuous formulation of the discrete hashing problem. Specifically, we show that the discrete hashing problem can be transformed into a continuous optimization problem without any relaxations, while the transformed continuous optimization problem has the same optimal solutions and the same optimal value as the original discrete hashing problem. After transformation, the continuous optimization methods can be applied. We devise the algorithms based on the idea of DC (difference of convex functions) programming to solve this problem. The proposed continuous hashing scheme can be easily applied to the existing hashing models, including both supervised and unsupervised hashing. We evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks and the results show the superiority of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art hashing methods.},

Then, the convergence analysis of mean square consensus in the case of an unbounded quantizer is given to explain the sufficiency of the extended model and convergence conditions. To overcome the uncertainty of saturation in the case of a bounded quantizer, we also give a statistical analysis on the boundedness of quantization that the bounded quantizer with a finite number of bits can remain unsaturated with a desired high probability under certain conditions. Furthermore, we provide the statistical analysis on the convergent accuracy, which shows that the agreement value just converges to a random variable that falls in the neighboring range of the initial state average and the expectation of the agreement value is equal to the initial state average exactly. In addition, we provide the differential privacy analysis for individual agents and the whole network, and then establish the potential relationship between the dynamic encoding/decoding scheme and the differential privacy mechanism.

The proposed method solves a multiobjective optimal control model in order to optimize the maneuver time duration, the trajectory smoothness, and the vehicle visibility, while taking into account different types of mission-dependent constraints. However, one problem that could have an impact on the optimization process is the selection of algorithm control parameters. To desensitize the negative influence, a novel fuzzy adaptive strategy is proposed and embedded in the algorithm framework. This allows the optimization process to dynamically balance the local exploitation and global exploration, thereby exploring the tradeoff between objectives more effectively. The performance of using the designed fuzzy adaptive multiobjective method is analyzed and validated by executing a number of simulation studies. The results confirm the effectiveness of applying the proposed algorithm to produce multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectories for autonomous ground vehicles. Moreover, the comparison to other state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization schemes shows that the designed strategy tends to be more capable in terms of producing a set of widespread and high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral image (HSI) generally contains a complex manifold structure and strong sparse correlation in its nonlinear high-dimensional data space. However, the existing manifold learning and sparse learning methods usually consider the manifold structure and sparse relationship separately rather than combining manifold and sparse properties to discover the intrinsic information in the original data. To simultaneously reveal the complex sparse relation and manifold structure of HSI, a novel feature extraction (FE) method, called local manifold-based sparse discriminant learning (LMSDL), has been proposed on the basis of manifold learning and sparse representation (SR). The LMSDL method first designs a new sparse optimization model called local manifold-based SR (LMSR) to reveal the local manifold-based sparse structure of data. Then, two geometrical sparse graphs are constructed to represent the discriminant relationship between samples and the geometrical and sparse neighbors. An objective function is constructed via geometrical sparse graphs and reconstruction points to learn a projection matrix for FE. The LMSDL effectively reveals the complex sparse relation and manifold structure in high-dimensional data, and it enhances the representation ability of extracted features for HSI classification significantly. The experimental results on the three real HSI datasets show that the proposed LMSDL algorithm possesses better performance in comparison with some state-of-the-art FE methods.},

In this article, a novel method called correntropy-based hypergraph regularized NMF (CHNMF) is proposed to solve the above problem. Specifically, we use the correntropy instead of the Euclidean norm in the loss term of CHNMF, which will improve the robustness of the algorithm. And the hypergraph regularization term is also applied to the objective function, which can explore the high-order geometric information in more sample points. Then, the half-quadratic (HQ) optimization technique is adopted to solve the complex optimization problem of CHNMF. Finally, extensive experimental results on multi-cancer integrated data indicate that the proposed CHNMF method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods for clustering and feature selection.},

However, the performance of DDEAs relies on their surrogate quality and often deteriorates if the amount of available data decreases. To solve these problems, this article proposes a new DDEA framework with perturbation-based ensemble surrogates (DDEA-PES), which contain two efficient mechanisms. The first is a diverse surrogate generation method that can generate diverse surrogates through performing data perturbations on the available data. The second is a selective ensemble method that selects some of the prebuilt surrogates to form a final ensemble surrogate model. By combining these two mechanisms, the proposed DDEA-PES framework has three advantages, including larger data quantity, better data utilization, and higher surrogate accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, this article provides both theoretical and experimental analyses. For the experimental comparisons, a specific DDEA-PES algorithm is developed as an instance by adopting a genetic algorithm as the optimizer and radial basis function neural networks as the base models. The experimental results on widely used benchmarks and an aerodynamic airfoil design real-world optimization problem show that the proposed DDEA-PES algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art DDEAs. Moreover, when compared with traditional nondata-driven methods, the proposed DDEA-PES algorithm only requires about 2\% computational budgets to produce competitive results.},

These alternative driving modes will benefit from new research toward novel steering control devices, more suitably where machine intelligence only partially controls the vehicle. In this article, it is proposed that when the human shares the control of a vehicle with an autonomous or semiautonomous system, a force control, or nondisplacement steering wheel (i.e., a steering wheel which does not rotate but detects the applied torque by the human driver) can be advantageous under certain schemes: tight rein or loose rein modes according to the H-metaphor. We support this proposition with the first experiments to the best of our knowledge, in which human participants drove in a simulated road scene with a force control steering wheel (FCSW). The experiments exhibited that humans can adapt promptly to force control steering and are able to control the vehicle smoothly. Different transfer functions are tested, which translate the applied torque at the FCSW to the steering angle at the wheels of the vehicle; it is shown that fractional order transfer functions increment steering stability and control accuracy when using a force control device. The transition of control experiments is also performed with both: a conventional and an FCSW. This prototypical steering system can be realized via steer-by-wire controls, which are already incorporated in commercially available vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering procedure is an unsupervised form of grouping the homogenous pixels of an image in the feature space into clusters. A brain magnetic resonance (MR) image is affected by noise and intensity inhomogeneity (IIH) during the acquisition process. FCM has been used in MR brain tissue segmentation. However, it does not consider the neighboring pixels for computing the membership values, thereby misclassifying the noisy pixels. The inaccurate cluster centers obtained in FCM do not address the problem of IIH. A fixed value of the fuzzifier ( m) used in FCM brings uncertainty in controlling the fuzziness of the extracted clusters. To resolve these issues, we suggest a novel type-2 adaptive weighted spatial FCM (AWSFCM) clustering algorithm for MR brain tissue segmentation. The idea of type-2 FCM applied to the problem on hand is new and is reported in this article. The application of the proposed technique to the problem of MR brain tissue segmentation replaces the fixed fuzzifier value with a fuzzy linguistic fuzzifier value ( M). The introduction of the spatial information in the membership function reduces the misclassification of noisy pixels. Furthermore, the incorporation of adaptive weights into the cluster center update function improves the accuracy of the final cluster centers, thereby reducing the effect of IIH. The suggested algorithm is evaluated using T1-w, T2-w, and proton density (PD) brain MR image slices. The performance is justified in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures followed by statistical analysis. The outcomes demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. This article is useful for the cybernetics application.},

Different from the existing unsupervised and supervised methods, we first model the background in a weakly supervised manner, which achieves better performance without prior information and is not restrained by richly correct annotation. Considering reconstruction biases introduced by the weakly supervised estimation, LRR is an effective method for further exploring the intricate background structures. Instead of directly applying the conventional LRR approaches, a dictionary-based LRR, including both observed training data and hidden learned data drawn by the background estimation model, is proposed. Finally, the derived low-rank part and sparse part and the result of the initial detection work together to achieve anomaly detection. Comparative analyses validate that the proposed WSLRR method presents superior detection performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

In this article, we present a federated continuous learning scheme based on broad learning (FCL-BL) to support efficient and accurate federated continuous learning (FCL). In FCL-BL, we propose a weighted processing strategy to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem, so FCL-BL can handle continuous learning. Then, we develop a local-independent training solution to support fast and accurate training in FCL-BL. The proposed solution enables us to avoid using a time-consuming synchronous approach while addressing the inaccurate-training issue rooted in the previous asynchronous approach. Moreover, we introduce a batch-asynchronous approach and broad learning (BL) technique to guarantee the high efficiency of FCL-BL. Specifically, the batch-asynchronous approach reduces the number of client-server interaction rounds, and the BL technique supports incremental learning without retraining when learning newly produced data. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results further illustrate that FCL-BL is superior to the existing FL schemes in terms of efficiency and accuracy in FCL.},

By use of it, the fuzzy system with different input matrices could be studied. At the same time, the controlled system still has strong robustness to external disturbance. Second, since time delay is variable, there is not the time-delay term in the function of the new sliding-mode surface. It makes the controller construct hard. Third, the process of constructing the controller is different from the traditional method. The process of designing the controller does not use the border of external disturbance. Using a new self-adaptive method, the considered system reaches and is kept on the surface. Unlike the earlier sliding-mode controller, the virtue of this controller is that the fluctuation of the controller is small.

Then, the authors propose a heuristic adaptive consensus algorithm for distributed training, which adaptively adjusts the weighted connectivity matrix based on the performance of each agent over the communication graph. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed distributed heuristic adaptive neural networks ensure the convergence of all the agents to the optimum with a single communication among connected neighbors after every training step, which is also suitable for switching graphs. This theorem is verified by the simulation, which gives the results that fewer iterations are required for all agents to reach the optimum using the proposed heuristic adaptive consensus algorithm, and the SVRG can greatly decrease the fluctuations caused by the stochastic gradient and improve its performance with only a little extra computational cost.},

Compared with the conventional fuzzy neural network (NN), a prominent feature can be achieved by taking the advantage of the broad learning system (BLS) to explicitly tackle the problem of how to choose a sufficient number of NN units to approximate the unknown dynamic model. Aiming at providing a soft compliant contact scheme without the requirement of the environment model, an adaptive impedance learning is developed to establish the optimal interaction between the robot and the environment. Meanwhile, the problems related to the state constraints are addressed by incorporating a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) into the design of a trajectory tracking controller. The proposed method can achieve desired tracking and interaction performance while guaranteeing the stability of the closed-loop system. In addition, simulation and experimental studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of BFNN under optimal impedance control with a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator and a Baxter robot, respectively.},

Multimodal hashing methods that embed data into binary codes can boost the retrieving speed and reduce storage requirements. Since unsupervised multimodal hashing methods are usually inferior to supervised ones and the supervised ones require too much manually labeled data, the proposed method in this paper utilizes partially available labels to design a semisupervised multimodal hashing method. The labels for unlabeled data are treated as an interval type-2 fuzzy set and estimated by the available labels. By defuzzifying the estimated labels using hard partitioning, a supervised multimodal hashing method is used to generate binary codes. Experiments show that the proposed semisupervised method with 50\% labels can get a medium performance among the compared supervised ones and achieve approximate performance to the best supervised method with 90\% labels. With only 10\% labels, the proposed method can still compete with the worst compared supervised one. Furthermore, the proposed label estimation method has been experimentally proven to be more feasible for a multilabeled MIRFlickr data set in a hash lookup task.},

This article aims at addressing the combinatorial, discrete resource allocation problems (RAPs) in virus spreading control. To meet the challenges of increasing network scales and improve the solving efficiency, an evolutionary divide-and-conquer algorithm is proposed, namely, a coevolutionary algorithm with network-community-based decomposition (NCD-CEA). It is characterized by the community-based dividing technique and cooperative coevolution conquering thought. First, to reduce the time complexity, NCD-CEA divides a network into multiple communities by a modified community detection method such that the most relevant variables in the solution space are clustered together. The problem and the global swarm are subsequently decomposed into subproblems and subswarms with low-dimensional embeddings. Second, to obtain high-quality solutions, an alternative evolutionary approach is designed by promoting the evolution of subswarms and the global swarm, in turn, with subsolutions evaluated by local fitness functions and global solutions evaluated by a global fitness function. Extensive experiments on different networks show that NCD-CEA has a competitive performance in solving RAPs. This article advances toward controlling virus spreading over large-scale networks.},

In this article, a novel adaptive multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is proposed on the basis of an evolutionary state estimation mechanism, which is used to detect the evolutionary environment whether in exploitation or exploration state. During the search process, different types of leaders, such as a convergence global best solution (c-gBest) and several diversity global best solutions (d-gBests), are to be selected from the external archive for particles under different evolutionary environments. The c-gBest is selected for improving the convergence when the swarm is in an exploitation state, while the d-gBests are chosen for enhancing the diversity in an exploration state. Furthermore, a modified archive maintenance strategy based on some predefined reference points is adopted to maximize the diversity of the Pareto solutions in the external archive. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the several state-of-the-art multiobjective PSO algorithms and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on 31 benchmark functions in terms of convergence and diversity of those obtained approximate Pareto fronts.},

First, a novel auxiliary variable is designed to provide more stable performance. The radial basis function (RBF) neural network is introduced to estimate dynamic uncertainties. Second, two adaptive finite-time control schemes are investigated. In control scheme I, the RBF neural network and the gain switching strategy are applied to compensate the actuator saturation. In control scheme II, an auxiliary compensation filter and the compensation adaptive update laws, which contain the finite-time structure, are developed for dealing with saturation. Third, the finite-time adaptive controller is designed in each of these two control schemes. Based on the multiple Lyapunov function method, the closed-loop teleoperation system with these two control methods is proved to be bounded and finite-time stability. Finally, the simulation experiments are performed and the comparisons with other control methods are shown. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Because of the simple structure and strong flexibility, multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted considerable attention among scientific researches and engineering fields during the past decades. In this paper, a novel adaptive multilayer neural dynamic (AMND)-based controllers design method is proposed for designing the attitude angle (the roll angle Ψ, the pitch angle θ, and the yaw angle ψ), height ( z), and position ( x and y) controllers of a general multirotor UAV model. Global convergence and strong robustness of the proposed AMND-based method and controllers are analyzed and proved theoretically. By incorporating the adaptive control method into the general multilayer neural dynamic-based controllers design method, multirotor UAVs with unknown disturbances can complete time-varying trajectory tracking tasks. AMND-based controllers with the self-tuning rates can estimate the unknown disturbances and solve the model uncertainty problems. Both the theoretical theorems and simulation results illustrate that the proposed design method and its controllers with strong anti-interference property can achieve the time-varying trajectory tracking control stably, reliably, and effectively. Moreover, a practical experiment by using a mini multirotor UAV illustrates the practicability of the AMND-based method.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the finite-horizon $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ bipartite consensus control problem for a class of discrete time-varying cooperation–competition multiagent systems (DTV-CCMASs) with the round-robin (RR) protocol. The cooperation–competition relationship among agents is characterized by a signed graph, whose edges are with positive or negative connection weights. Specifically, a positive weight corresponds to an allied relationship between two agents and a negative one means an adversary relationship. The data exchange between each agent and its neighbors is orchestrated by an RR protocol, where only one neighboring agent is authorized to transmit the data packet at each time instant, and therefore, the data collision is prevented. This article aims to design a bipartite consensus controller for DTV-CCMASs with the RR protocol such that the predetermined $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ bipartite consensus is satisfied over a given finite horizon. A sufficient condition is first established to guarantee the desired $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ bipartite consensus by resorting to the completing square method. With the help of an auxiliary cost combined with the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse method, a design scheme of the bipartite consensus controller is obtained by solving two coupled backward recursive Riccati difference equations (BRRDEs). Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme of the bipartite consensus controller.},

To establish resiliency against such attacks and ensure optimal operation, a localized event-driven attack-resilient scheme is proposed. Most of the existing works examine neighboring information to infer the presence of DIAs, where the detection is limited to events such as multiple link failures. Two kinds of DIAs are considered in this article-namely, fault and random attacks, which are segregated based on the final values of consensus updates. First, to improve the robustness of the detection theory, a localized resilient control update is designed by modeling each DG with a reference incremental cost. Second, event-driven control signal is generated for the local incremental cost and held upon the detection of attacks, to prevent malicious data from propagating to the neighboring nodes. The proposed strategy acts immediately upon the detection of DIA to ensure maximization in the economic profit. Furthermore, the proposed detection approach is theoretically verified and validated using simulation conditions.},

During the information exchanges among the sensors, topological attacks are suitably modeled in such a way to incorporate the random and intermittent disruption of the heterogeneous sensor interaction topologies. Second, two sets of distributed resilient estimators are delicately constructed to cope with the resulting random denial of information exchanges within the specific repaired periods and compromised periods caused by the topological attacks.

The underlying fading channels, whose channel fading amplitudes (characterized by the expectation and variance) are allowed to be different, are modeled as a finite-state Markov process. A key feature of the problem addressed is to use a hidden Markov mode detector to estimate the actual network mode. The novel model of hidden Markov fading channels (HMFCs) is shown to be more general yet practical than the existing fading channel models. Based on a linear sliding surface, a switching-type SMC law is dedicatedly constructed by just using the estimated network mode. By exploiting the concept of stochastic Lyapunov stability and the approach of hidden Markov models, sufficient conditions are obtained for the resultant SMC systems that ensure both the mean-square stability and the reachability with a sliding region. With the aid of the Hadamard product, a binary genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to solve the proposed SMC design problem subject to some nonconvex constraints induced by the state saturations and the fading channels, where the proposed GA is based on the objective function for optimal reachability. Finally, a numerical example is employed to verify the proposed GA-assisted SMC scheme over the HMFCs.},

First, bear in mind the advantages of density-based clustering, DBSCAN is proposed to generate data structures. Based on these data structures, two rule-based models are constructed: 1) models using DBSCAN clusters to construct granules and rules directly and 2) models generating subgranules in each DBSCAN cluster for rule formation. Experiments involving these two models are completed, and obtained results are compared with those generated with a traditional model involving fuzzy C-means-based granules. Numerical results show that the rule-based model, which builds rules from subgranules of DBSCAN structures, performs the best in analyzing system behaviors.},

It judiciously integrates the merits of the rough hypercuboid approach, c-means algorithm, and interval type-2 fuzzy set, to address the uncertainty associated with real-life datasets. Using the concept of hypercuboid equivalence partition matrix (HEM) of rough hypercuboid approach, the lower approximation and boundary region of each cluster are implicitly defined, without using any prespecified threshold parameter. The interval-valued fuzzifier is applied to address the uncertainty coupled with different parameters of rough-fuzzy clustering algorithms, where the determination of the appropriate value of fuzzifier is a difficult task. An analytical formulation on the convergence analysis of the proposed RIT2FCM algorithm, along with a theoretical bound of its fuzzifier, is also introduced. The efficacy of the proposed RIT2FCM method is extensively compared with that of several existing clustering algorithms, using some cluster validity and classification rate indices on various real-life datasets. The proposed algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art c-means algorithms in 92.59\% cases, with respect to different cluster validity indices, in lesser computation time.},

To cater to this rather major shortcoming, this work shows how a variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (vBGMM) framework can be employed to predict the future trajectory of moving obstacles; and then with this methodology, a trajectory generation framework is proposed which will efficiently and effectively address trajectory generation in the presence of moving obstacles, and incorporate the presence of uncertainty within a prediction horizon. In this work, the full predictive conditional probability density function (PDF) with mean and covariance is obtained and, thus, a future trajectory with uncertainty is formulated as a collision region represented by a confidence ellipsoid. To avoid the collision region, chance constraints are imposed to restrict the collision probability, and subsequently, a nonlinear model predictive control problem is constructed with these chance constraints. It is shown that the proposed approach is able to predict the future position of the moving obstacles effectively; and, thus, based on the environmental information of the probabilistic prediction, it is also shown that the timing of collision avoidance can be earlier than the method without prediction. The tracking error and distance to obstacles of the trajectory with prediction are smaller compared with the method without prediction.},

  abstract     = {Conventional nonlinear subspace learning techniques (e.g., manifold learning) usually introduce some drawbacks in explainability (explicit mapping) and cost effectiveness (linearization), generalization capability (out-of-sample), and representability (spatial–spectral discrimination). To overcome these shortcomings, a novel linearized subspace analysis technique with spatial–spectral manifold alignment is developed for a semisupervised hyperspectral dimensionality reduction (HDR), called joint and progressive subspace analysis (JPSA). The JPSA learns a high-level, semantically meaningful, joint spatial–spectral feature representation from hyperspectral (HS) data by: 1) jointly learning latent subspaces and a linear classifier to find an effective projection direction favorable for classification; 2) progressively searching several intermediate states of subspaces to approach an optimal mapping from the original space to a potential more discriminative subspace; and 3) spatially and spectrally aligning a manifold structure in each learned latent subspace in order to preserve the same or similar topological property between the compressed data and the original data. A simple but effective classifier, that is, nearest neighbor (NN), is explored as a potential application for validating the algorithm performance of different HDR approaches. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed JPSA on two widely used HS datasets: 1) Indian Pines (92.98\%) and 2) the University of Houston (86.09\%) in comparison with previous state-of-the-art HDR methods.

Recently, cloud computing architectures have become more relevant to address the big computational challenges introduced in the HSI field. This article proposes an acceleration method for HSI classification that relies on scheduling metaheuristics to automatically and optimally distribute the workload of HSI applications across multiple computing resources on a cloud platform. By analyzing the procedure of a representative classification method, we first develop its distributed and parallel implementation based on the MapReduce mechanism on Apache Spark. The subtasks of the processing flow that can be processed in a distributed way are identified as divisible tasks. The optimal execution of this application on Spark is further formulated as a divisible scheduling framework that takes into account both task execution precedences and task divisibility when allocating the divisible and indivisible subtasks onto computing nodes. The formulated scheduling framework is an optimization procedure that searches for optimized task assignments and partition counts for divisible tasks. Two metaheuristic algorithms are developed to solve this divisible scheduling problem. The scheduling results provide an optimized solution to the automatic processing of HSI big data on clouds, improving the computational efficiency of HSI classification by exploring the parallelism during the parallel processing flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheduling-guided approach achieves remarkable speedups by facilitating the automatic processing of HSI classification on Spark, and is scalable to the increasing HSI data volume.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is a fundamental data exploration task which aims at discovering the hidden grouping structure in the data. The traditional clustering methods typically compute a single partition. However, there often exist different and equally meaningful clusterings in complex data. To solve this issue, multiple clustering approaches have emerged with the goal of exploring alternative clusterings from different perspectives. Existing solutions to this problem mainly focus on one-way clustering, that is, they cluster either the samples or the features. However, for many practical tasks, it is meaningful and desirable to explore alternative two-way clusterings (or co-clusterings), which capture not only the sample cluster structure but also the feature cluster structure. To tackle this interesting and unresolved task, we introduce an approach, called multiple co-clusterings (MultiCCs), to generate multiple alternative co-clusterings at the same time. MultiCC takes advantage of matrix tri-factorization to seek the co-clustering indicator matrices for samples and features and defines the row and column redundancy quantification terms to enforce diversity among co-clusterings based on these indicator matrices. After that, it integrates matrix tri-factorization and two nonredundancy terms into a unified objective function and gives an alternative optimization procedure to optimize the objective function. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MultiCC performs significantly better than the existing multiple clustering methods. In addition, MultiCC can find out interesting co-clusters, which cannot be made by those comparing methods.},

  abstract     = {Visual attention prediction (VAP) is a significant and imperative issue in the field of computer vision. Most of the existing VAP methods are based on deep learning. However, they do not fully take advantage of the low-level contrast features while generating the visual attention map. In this article, a novel VAP method is proposed to generate the visual attention map via bio-inspired representation learning. The bio-inspired representation learning combines both low-level contrast and high-level semantic features simultaneously, which are developed by the fact that the human eye is sensitive to the patches with high contrast and objects with high semantics. The proposed method is composed of three main steps: 1) feature extraction; 2) bio-inspired representation learning; and 3) visual attention map generation. First, the high-level semantic feature is extracted from the refined VGG16, while the low-level contrast feature is extracted by the proposed contrast feature extraction block in a deep network. Second, during bio-inspired representation learning, both the extracted low-level contrast and high-level semantic features are combined by the designed densely connected block, which is proposed to concatenate various features scale by scale. Finally, the weighted-fusion layer is exploited to generate the ultimate visual attention map based on the obtained representations after bio-inspired representation learning. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In a hospital, very often there are center-islands to decrease the flow cost among facilities or rooms. However, these islands have not been considered before. In this article, we propose an FLP with center-islands that involves two parallel rows and center-islands. A mixed-integer program formulation is established for modeling it. A methodology for combining a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and linear program is proposed to solve this problem. MOEA/D optimizes the sequence of facilities on two rows and center-islands while the linear program is embedded into MOEA/D to optimize the exact locations of center-islands. A tabu search with a local search is also integrated into MOEA/D to enhance its search capability. Experiments show that our proposed methodology can effectively solve the problem.},

  abstract     = {Single-image super-resolution (SR) has been widely used in computer vision applications. The reconstruction-based SR methods are mainly based on certain prior terms to regularize the SR problem. However, it is very challenging to further improve the SR performance by the conventional design of explicit prior terms. Because of the powerful learning ability, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in single-image SR task. However, it is difficult to achieve further improvement by only designing the network architecture. In addition, most existing deep CNN-based SR methods learn a nonlinear mapping function to directly map low-resolution (LR) images to desirable high-resolution (HR) images, ignoring the observation models of input images. Inspired by the split Bregman iteration (SBI) algorithm, which is a powerful technique for solving the constrained optimization problems, the original SR problem is divided into two subproblems: 1) inversion subproblem and 2) denoising subproblem. Since the inversion subproblem can be regarded as an inversion step to reconstruct an intermediate HR image with sharper edges and finer structures, we propose to use deep CNN to capture low-level explicit image profile enhancement prior (PEP). Since the denoising subproblem aims to remove the noise in the intermediate image, we adopt a simple and effective denoising network to learn implicit image denoising statistics prior (DSP). Furthermore, the penalty parameter in SBI is adaptively tuned during the iterations for better performance. Finally, we also prove the convergence of our method. Thus, the deep CNNs are exploited to capture both implicit and explicit image statistics priors. Due to SBI, the SR observation model is also leveraged. Consequently, it bridges between two popular SR approaches: 1) learning-based method and 2) reconstruction-based method. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art SR results.},

The surrogate cost function is an estimate of the Bayesian risk, where the estimates of the conditional probabilities for each class are defined in terms of a 1-D Parzen window estimator of the output of (discriminative) neural networks. This probability density is modeled with the objective of allowing an easy minimization of a sampled version of the Bayes risk. The conditional probabilities included in the definition of the risk are not explicitly estimated, but the risk is minimized by a gradient-descent algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using linear classifiers and neural networks, with both shallow (a single hidden layer) and deep (multiple hidden layers) architectures.

Original normalized cross-covariance operator represents a kernel-based nonlinear dependence measure between features and labels, whose empirical estimator is formulated as a trace operation including two inverse matrices of feature and label kernels with a regularization constant. Due to such a complicated expression, it is impossible to derive an eigenvalue problem for linear FE directly. In this paper, we approximate this measure using Moore-Penrose inverse matrix, linear kernel for feature space, and delta kernel for label space, and then symmetrize the entire matrix in the trace operation, resulting in an effective approximated and symmetrized representation. According to orthonormal projection direction constraints, maximizing such a modified form induces a novel eigenvalue problem for multilabel linear FE. Experiments on 12 data sets illustrate that our proposed method works the best, compared with seven existing FE techniques, according to eight multilabel classification performance metrics and three statistical tests.},

  abstract     = {Subspace learning for tensors attracts increasing interest in recent years, leading to the development of multilinear extensions of principal component analysis (PCA) and probabilistic PCA (PPCA). Existing multilinear PPCAs are based on the Tucker or CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) models. Although both kinds of multilinear PPCAs have shown their effectiveness in dealing with tensors, they also have their own limitations. Tucker-based multilinear PPCAs have a restrictive subspace representation and suffer from rotational ambiguity, while CP-based ones are more prone to overfitting. To address these problems, we propose probabilistic rank-one tensor analysis (PROTA), a CP-based multilinear PPCA. PROTA has a more flexible subspace representation than Tucker-based PPCAs, and avoids rotational ambiguity. To alleviate overfitting for CP-based PPCAs, we propose two simple and effective regularization strategies, named as concurrent regularizations (CRs). By adjusting the noise variance or the moments of latent features, our strategies concurrently and coherently penalize the entire subspace. This relaxes unnecessary scale restrictions and gains more flexibility in regularizing CP-based PPCAs. To take full advantage of the probabilistic framework, we further propose a Bayesian treatment of PROTA, which achieves both automatic feature determination and robustness against overfitting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of PROTA in subspace estimation and classification, as well as the effectiveness of CRs in alleviating overfitting.},

  abstract     = {A model can be easily influenced by unseen factors in nonstationary environments and fail to fit dynamic data distribution. In a classification scenario, this is known as a concept drift. For instance, the shopping preference of customers may change after they move from one city to another. Therefore, a shopping website or application should alter recommendations based on its poorer predictions of such user patterns. In this article, we propose a novel approach called the multiscale drift detection test (MDDT) that efficiently localizes abrupt drift points when feature values fluctuate, meaning that the current model needs immediate adaption. MDDT is based on a resampling scheme and a paired student t-test. It applies a detection procedure on two different scales. Initially, the detection is performed on a broad scale to check if recently gathered drift indicators remain stationary. If a drift is claimed, a narrow scale detection is performed to trace the refined change time. This multiscale structure reduces the massive time of constantly checking and filters noises in drift indicators. Experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with several algorithms via synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that it outperforms others when abrupt shift datasets are handled, and achieves the highest recall score in localizing drift points.},

It first introduces a suitable distributed negative gradient plus damping injection controller, based on which it establishes that the local connectivity of time-delay Euler-Lagrange networks can be preserved by appropriately regulating the interagent connections and increasing the damping injection locally. Yet, actuator saturation may impede the proper modulation of the interagent connections and the injection of sufficient damping and, thus, may threaten the maintenance of connectivity. This paper then develops an indirect coupling control framework which integrates the bounded actuation constraints into the control design. The framework endows every agent with a virtual proxy and couples initially adjacent agents through their virtual proxies. The interproxy couplings then tackle the time-varying delays while the agent-proxy couplings account for the saturation of actuators. Lyapunov-Krasovskii analysis proves that the indirect coupling strategy can drive time-delay Euler-Lagrange networks with bounded actuation to connectivity-preserving synchronization by limiting the energy of the agent-proxy and interproxy couplings according to the actuation constraints. Experiments with Geomagic Touch haptic robots validate the proposed designs compared to a conventional proportional plus damping controller.},

The Gaussian mixture models (GMM) is one of the most popular soft sensing methods for the non-Gaussian industrial processes. However, in industrial applications, the quantity of samples with known labels is usually quite limited because of the technical limitations or economical reasons. Traditional GMM-based soft sensor models solely depending on labeled samples may easily suffer from singular covariances, overfitting, and difficulties in model selection, which results in the performance deterioration. To tackle these issues, we propose a semisupervised Bayesian GMM (S 2 BGMM). In the S 2 BGMM, we first propose a semisupervised fully Bayesian model, which enables learning from both the labeled and unlabeled datasets for remedying the deficiency of infrequent labeled samples. Subsequently, a general framework of weighted variational inference is developed to train the S 2 BGMM, such that the rate of learning from unlabeled samples can be controlled by penalizing the unlabeled dataset. Case studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the S 2 BGMM through a numerical example and two real-world industrial processes, which demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Thin-section magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide higher resolution anatomical structures and more precise clinical information than thick-section images. However, thin-section MRI is not always available due to the imaging cost issue. In multicenter retrospective studies, a large number of data are often in thick-section manner with different section thickness. The lack of thin-section data and the difference in section thickness bring considerable difficulties in the study based on the image big data. In this article, we introduce DeepVolume, a two-step deep learning architecture to address the challenge of accurate thin-section MR image reconstruction. The first stage is the brain structure-aware network, in which the thick-section MR images in axial and sagittal planes are fused by a multitask 3-D U-net with prior knowledge of brain volume segmentation, which encourages the reconstruction result to have correct brain structure. The second stage is the spatial connection-aware network, in which the preliminary reconstruction results are adjusted slice-by-slice by a recurrent convolutional network embedding convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) block, which enhances the precision of the reconstruction by utilizing the previously unassessed sagittal information. We used 305 paired brain MRI samples with thickness of 1.0 mm and 6.5 mm in this article. Extensive experiments illustrate that DeepVolume can produce the state-of-the-art reconstruction results by embedding more anatomical knowledge. Furthermore, considering DeepVolume as an intermediate step, the practical and clinical value of our method is validated by applying the brain volume estimation and voxel-based morphometry. The results show that DeepVolume can provide much more reliable brain volume estimation in the normalized space based on the thick-section MR images compared with the traditional solutions.},

It is known that the difficulty of maintaining the convergence and diversity performances rapidly grows as the number of objectives increases. This phenomenon is especially evident for the Pareto-dominance-based EAs, because the nondominated sorting often fails to provide enough convergent pressure toward the Pareto front (PF). Therefore, many researchers came up with some non-Pareto-dominance-based EAs, which are based on indicator, decomposition, and so on. In this article, we propose a polar-metric ( p-metric)-based EA (PMEA) for tackling both MOPs and MaOPs. p-metric is a recently proposed performance indicator which adopts a set of uniformly distributed direction vectors. In PMEA, we use a two-phase selection which combines both nondominated sorting and p-metric. Moreover, a modification is proposed to adjust the direction vectors of p-metric dynamically. In the experiments, PMEA is compared with six state-of-the-art EAs in total and is measured by three performance metrics, including p-metric. According to the empirical results, PMEA shows promising performances on most of the test problems, involving both MOPs and MaOPs.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world optimization problems involve multiple objectives, constraints, and parameters that may change over time. These problems are often called dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs). The difficulty in solving DMOPs is the need to track the changing Pareto-optimal front efficiently and accurately. It is known that transfer learning (TL)-based methods have the advantage of reusing experiences obtained from past computational processes to improve the quality of current solutions. However, existing TL-based methods are generally computationally intensive and thus time consuming. This article proposes a new memory-driven manifold TL-based evolutionary algorithm for dynamic multiobjective optimization (MMTL-DMOEA). The method combines the mechanism of memory to preserve the best individuals from the past with the feature of manifold TL to predict the optimal individuals at the new instance during the evolution. The elites of these individuals obtained from both past experience and future prediction will then constitute as the initial population in the optimization process. This strategy significantly improves the quality of solutions at the initial stage and reduces the computational cost required in existing methods. Different benchmark problems are used to validate the proposed algorithm and the simulation results are compared with state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithms (DMOAs). The results show that our approach is capable of improving the computational speed by two orders of magnitude while achieving a better quality of solutions than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Partial domain adaptation (PDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain based on an assumption that the source label space subsumes the target label space. The major challenge is to promote positive transfer in the shared label space and circumvent negative transfer caused by the large mismatch across different label spaces. In this article, we propose a dual alignment approach for PDA (DAPDA), including three components: 1) a feature extractor extracts source and target features by the Siamese network; 2) a reweighting network produces “hard” labels, class-level weights for source features and “soft” labels, instance-level weights for target features; 3) a dual alignment network aligns intra domain and interdomain distributions. Specifically, the intra domain alignment aims to minimize the intraclass variances to enhance the intraclass compactness in both domains, and interdomain alignment attempts to reduce the discrepancies across domains by domain-wise and class-wise adaptations. The negative transfer can be alleviated by down-weighting source features with nonshared labels. The positive transfer can be enhanced by upweighting source features with shared labels. The adaptation can be achieved by minimizing the discrepancies based on class-weighted source data with hard labels and instance-weighed target data with soft labels. The effectiveness of our method has been demonstrated by outperforming state-of-the-art PDA methods on several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation is suitable for transferring knowledge learned from one domain to a different but related domain. Considering the substantially large domain discrepancies, learning a more generalized feature representation is crucial for domain adaptation. On account of this, we propose an adaptive component embedding (ACE) method, for domain adaptation. Specifically, ACE learns adaptive components across domains to embed data into a shared domain-invariant subspace, in which the first-order statistics is aligned and the geometric properties are preserved simultaneously. Furthermore, the second-order statistics of domain distributions is also aligned to further mitigate domain shifts. Then, the aligned feature representation is classified by optimizing the structural risk functional in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Extensive experiments show that our method can work well on six domain adaptation benchmarks, which verifies the effectiveness of ACE.},

QUAD-conditions play a key role in describing the intrinsic property of the uncoupled system. With QUAD-conditions, we unify synchronization and consensus of multiagents in a framework.

  abstract     = {Up to now, various matrix norms (e.g., l 1 -norm, l 2 -norm, l 2,1 -norm, etc.) have been widely leveraged to form the loss function of different regression models, and have played an important role in image analysis. However, the previous regression models adopting the existing norms are sensitive to outliers and, thus, often bring about unsatisfactory results on the heavily corrupted images. This is because their adopted norms for measuring the data residual can hardly suppress the negative influence of noisy data, which will probably mislead the regression process. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel δ(delta)-norm to count the nonzero blocks around an element in a vector or matrix, which weakens the impacts of outliers and also takes the structure property of examples into account. After that, we present the δ-norm-based robust regression (DRR) in which the data examples are mapped to the kernel space and measured by the proposed δ-norm. By exploring an explicit kernel function, we show that DRR has a closed-form solution, which suggests that DRR can be efficiently solved. To further handle the influences from mixed noise, DRR is extended to a multiscale version. The experimental results on image classification and background modeling datasets validate the superiority of the proposed approach to the existing state-of-the-art robust regression models.},

In this paper, a new output feedback distributed containment control algorithm is proposed based on a novel dynamic compensator, which can not only simplify the control design procedure but also relax the condition on nonlinear terms. The proposed distributed containment protocol for each agent depends only on the agent output and the relative outputs of its neighbor agents, and can reduce the communication burden between the agents. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the outputs of the followers are driven into the convex hull spanned by the outputs of the leaders with the proposed linear controller.

In the past few years, several local community detection algorithms have been proposed. However, the previous methods only make use of the limited local information of networks but overlook the other valuable information. In this article, we propose an evolutionary computation-based algorithm called evolutionary-based local community detection (ELCD) algorithm to detect local communities in the complex networks by taking advantages of the entire obtained information. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world benchmark networks. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art local community detection methods.

In the proposed strategy, all of the individuals are first clustered into different manifolds according to their distribution in the objective space, and then the mating reproduction is restricted among individuals in the same manifold. Moreover, we embed the proposed mating strategy in three representative MOEAs and compare the embedded MOEAs with their original versions using the assortative genetic operators on a variety of MOP-cPS.

It is noted that the interconnection terms are arbitrary nonlinear functions and unnecessary to satisfy the bound constraints, while these constraints are mandatory in the previous studies. Therefore, the proposed method is more relaxed and applicable in practice. A new observer form based on an unknown input method is proposed to simultaneously estimate the unmeasurable states and interconnection terms, which has not been taken into consideration in any previous articles. The information of the unknown states and interconnection is fed back to the controller for stabilizing the system. With the support of the Lyapunov function, the sum-of-square (SOS) technique, the conditions for designing the observer and controller are derived.

To address the two problems, a novel correntropy-based multiview subspace clustering (CMVSC) method is proposed in this article. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part utilizes the Frobenius norm to efficiently estimate the dense connections between the points lying in the same subspace instead of following the standard compressive sensing approach. In the second part, the correntropy-induced metric (CIM) is introduced to characterize the noise in each view and utilize the information embedded in different views from an information-theoretic perspective. Furthermore, an efficient iterative algorithm based on the half-quadratic technique (HQ) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to optimize the proposed joint learning problem, and extensive experimental results on six real-world multiview benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods can outperform several state-of-the-art multiview subspace clustering methods.},

By using deep learning, the subvision system can classify common static terrains (e.g., level ground, stairs, and ramps) and estimate corresponding motion intents of amputees with high accuracy (98\%). After applying the subvision system to the locomotion control system, the powered prosthesis can help amputees to achieve nonrhythmic locomotion naturally, including switching between different locomotion modes and crossing the obstacle. The subvision system can also recognize dynamic objects, such as an unexpected obstacle approaching the amputee, and assist in generating an agile obstacle-avoidance reflex movement.

However, many existing MKGC methods design a fat model that poses challenges for computational cost and clustering performance, as they learn both an affinity graph and an extra consensus kernel cumbersomely. To tackle this challenging problem, this article proposes a new MKGC method to learn a consensus affinity graph directly. By using the self-expressiveness graph learning and an adaptive local structure learning term, the local manifold structure of the data in kernel space is preserved for learning multiple candidate affinity graphs from a kernel pool first. After that, these candidate affinity graphs are synthesized to learn a consensus affinity graph via a thin autoweighted fusion model, in which a self-tuned Laplacian rank constraint and a top- k neighbors sparse strategy are introduced to improve the quality of the consensus affinity graph for accurate clustering purposes. The experimental results on ten benchmark datasets and two synthetic datasets show that the proposed method consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiview data processing has attracted sustained attention as it can provide more information for clustering. To integrate this information, one often utilizes the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) scheme which can reduce the data from different views into the subspace with the same dimension. Motivated by the clustering performance being affected by the distribution of the data in the learned subspace, a tri-factorization-based NMF model with an embedding matrix is proposed in this article. This model tends to generate decompositions with uniform distribution, such that the learned representations are more discriminative. As a result, the obtained consensus matrix can be a better representative of the multiview data in the subspace, leading to higher clustering performance. Also, a new lemma is proposed to provide the formulas about the partial derivation of the trace function with respect to an inner matrix, together with its theoretical proof. Based on this lemma, a gradient-based algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model, and its convergence and computational complexity are analyzed. Experiments on six real-world datasets are performed to show the advantages of the proposed algorithm, with comparison to the existing baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective multitasking optimization (MTO), which is an emerging research topic in the field of evolutionary computation, was recently proposed. MTO aims to solve related multiobjective optimization problems at the same time via evolutionary algorithms. The key to MTO is the knowledge transfer based on sharing solutions across tasks. Notably, positive knowledge transfer has been shown to facilitate superior performance characteristics. However, how to find more valuable transferred solutions for the positive transfer has been scarcely explored. Keeping this in mind, we propose a new algorithm to solve MTO problems. In this article, if a transferred solution is nondominated in its target task, the transfer is positive transfer. Furthermore, neighbors of this positive-transfer solution will be selected as the transferred solutions in the next generation, since they are more likely to achieve the positive transfer. Numerical studies have been conducted on benchmark problems of MTO to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that our proposed framework achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art MTO frameworks.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of distributed online optimization for a group of units communicating on time-varying unbalanced directed networks. The main target of the set of units is to cooperatively minimize the sum of all locally known convex cost functions (global cost function) while pursuing the privacy of their local cost functions being well masked. To address such optimization problems in a collaborative and distributed fashion, a differentially private-distributed stochastic subgradient-push algorithm, called DP-DSSP, is proposed, which ensures that units interact with in-neighbors and collectively optimize the global cost function. Unlike most of the existing distributed algorithms which do not consider privacy issues, DP-DSSP via differential privacy strategy successfully masks the privacy of participating units, which is more practical in applications involving sensitive messages, such as military affairs or medical treatment. An important feature of DP-DSSP is tackling distributed online optimization problems under the circumstance of time-varying unbalanced directed networks. Theoretical analysis indicates that DP-DSSP can effectively mask differential privacy as well as can achieve sublinear regrets. A compromise between the privacy levels and the accuracy of DP-DSSP is also revealed. Furthermore, DP-DSSP is capable of handling arbitrarily large but uniformly bounded delays in the communication links. Finally, simulation experiments confirm the practicability of DP-DSSP and the findings in this article.},

To avoid the separation method, a complex-valued sign function is proposed and its properties are established. By means of the introduced sign function, two discontinuous control strategies are developed under the quadratic norm and a new norm based on absolute values of real and imaginary parts. By applying nonsmooth analysis and some novel inequality techniques in the complex field, several synchronization criteria and the estimates of the settling time are derived. In particular, under the new norm framework, a unified control strategy is designed and it is revealed that a parameter value in the controller completely decides the networks are synchronized whether in finite time or in fixed time.

  abstract     = {The data stream poses additional challenges to statistical classification tasks because distributions of the training and target samples may differ as time passes. Such a distribution change in streaming data is called concept drift. Numerous histogram-based distribution change detection methods have been proposed to detect drift. Most histograms are developed on the grid-based or tree-based space partitioning algorithms which makes the space partitions arbitrary, unexplainable, and may cause drift blind spots. There is a need to improve the drift detection accuracy for the histogram-based methods with the unsupervised setting. To address this problem, we propose a cluster-based histogram, called equal intensity k-means space partitioning (EI-kMeans). In addition, a heuristic method to improve the sensitivity of drift detection is introduced. The fundamental idea of improving the sensitivity is to minimize the risk of creating partitions in distribution offset regions. Pearson&#39;s chi-square test is used as the statistical hypothesis test so that the test statistics remain independent of the sample distribution. The number of bins and their shapes, which strongly influence the ability to detect drift, are determined dynamically from the sample based on an asymptotic constraint in the chi-square test. Accordingly, three algorithms are developed to implement concept drift detection, including a greedy centroids initialization algorithm, a cluster amplify-shrink algorithm, and a drift detection algorithm. For drift adaptation, we recommend retraining the learner if a drift is detected. The results of experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of EI-kMeans and show its efficacy in detecting concept drift.},

To tackle these problems, we propose spectral-spatial weighted kernel manifold embedded distribution alignment (SSWK-MEDA) for remote sensing image classification. The proposed method applies a novel spatial information filter to effectively use similarity between nearby sample pixels and avoid the influence of nonsample pixels. Then, a complex kernel combining spatial kernel and spectral kernel with different weights is constructed to adaptively balance the relative importance of spectral and spatial information of the remote sensing image. Finally, we utilize the geometric structure of features in manifold space to solve the problem of feature distortions of remote sensing data in transfer learning scenarios. SSWK-MEDA provides a novel approach for the combination of transfer learning and remote sensing image characteristics. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method is more effective than several state-of-the-art methods.},

Furthermore, to meet the requirement in today&#39;s cloud computing service, wherein multiple optimization tasks may need to be solved at the same time, we propose a novel evolutionary multitasking algorithm (EMA) to optimize multiple VRPHTOs simultaneously with a single population. Finally, 56 new VRPHTO instances are generated based on the existing common vehicle routing benchmarks. Comprehensive empirical studies are conducted to illustrate the benefits of the new VRPHTOs and to verify the efficacy of the proposed EMA for multitasking against a state-of-art single task evolutionary solver. The obtained results showed that the employment of occasional drivers could significantly reduce the routing cost, and the proposed EMA is not only able to solve multiple VRPHTOs simultaneously but also can achieve enhanced optimization performance via the knowledge transfer between tasks along the evolutionary search process.},

In this article, TF is first predicted using a deep-learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN), and different forecast uncertainties are evaluated to formulate the TF prediction intervals (PIs). Then, the EV arrival rates are calculated according to the historical data and the proposed mixture model. Based on TF forecasting and arrival rate results, the EV charging process is studied to convert the TF to the charging load using a novel probabilistic queuing model that takes into consideration charging service limitations and driver behaviors.

  abstract     = {Recently, evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has been proposed in the field of evolutionary computation as a new search paradigm, for solving multiple optimization tasks simultaneously. By sharing useful traits found along the evolutionary search process across different optimization tasks, the optimization performance on each task could be enhanced. The autoencoding-based EMT is a recently proposed EMT algorithm. In contrast to most existing EMT algorithms, which conduct knowledge transfer across tasks implicitly via crossover, it intends to perform knowledge transfer explicitly among tasks in the form of task solutions, which enables the employment of task-specific search mechanisms for different optimization tasks in EMT. However, the autoencoding-based explicit EMT can only work on continuous optimization problems. It will fail on combinatorial optimization problems, which widely exist in real-world applications, such as scheduling problem, routing problem, and assignment problem. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing effort working on explicit EMT for combinatorial optimization problems. Taking this cue, in this article, we thus embark on a study toward explicit EMT for combinatorial optimization. In particular, by using vehicle routing as an illustrative combinatorial optimization problem, the proposed explicit EMT algorithm (EEMTA) mainly contains a weighted l 1 -norm-regularized learning process for capturing the transfer mapping, and a solution-based knowledge transfer process across vehicle routing problems (VRPs). To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed EEMTA, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted with the commonly used vehicle routing benchmarks in multitasking environment, against both the state-of-the-art EMT algorithm and the traditional single-task evolutionary solvers. Finally, a real-world combinatorial optimization application, that is, the package delivery problem (PDP), is also presented to further confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

To address this issue, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm driven by the generative adversarial networks (GANs). At each generation of the proposed algorithm, the parent solutions are first classified into real and fake samples to train the GANs; then the offspring solutions are sampled by the trained GANs. Thanks to the powerful generative ability of the GANs, our proposed algorithm is capable of generating promising offspring solutions in high-dimensional decision space with limited training data. The proposed algorithm is tested on ten benchmark problems with up to 200 decision variables. The experimental results on these test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Following the above idea, this article proposes an evolutionary algorithm to solve sparse LMOPs by learning the Pareto-optimal subspace. The proposed algorithm uses two unsupervised neural networks, a restricted Boltzmann machine, and a denoising autoencoder to learn a sparse distribution and a compact representation of the decision variables, where the combination of the learnt sparse distribution and compact representation is regarded as an approximation of the Pareto-optimal subspace. The genetic operators are conducted in the learnt subspace, and the resultant offspring solutions then can be mapped back to the original search space by the two neural networks. According to the experimental results on eight benchmark problems and eight real-world problems, the proposed algorithm can effectively solve sparse LMOPs with 10000 decision variables by only 100000 evaluations.},

The idea of decomposition is adopted to decompose the MOP into a set of scalar optimization subproblems. Then, each subproblem is modeled as a neural network. Model parameters of all the subproblems are optimized collaboratively according to a neighborhood-based parameter-transfer strategy and the DRL training algorithm. Pareto-optimal solutions can be directly obtained through the trained neural-network models. Specifically, the multiobjective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP) is solved in this article using the DRL-MOA method by modeling the subproblem as a Pointer Network. Extensive experiments have been conducted to study the DRL-MOA and various benchmark methods are compared with it. It is found that once the trained model is available, it can scale to newly encountered problems with no need for retraining the model. The solutions can be directly obtained by a simple forward calculation of the neural network; thereby, no iteration is required and the MOP can be always solved in a reasonable time. The proposed method provides a new way of solving the MOP by means of DRL. It has shown a set of new characteristics, for example, strong generalization ability and fast solving speed in comparison with the existing methods for multiobjective optimizations. The experimental results show the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method in terms of model performance and running time.},

The objective is to minimize a coverage cost function in finite time which characterizes the largest arrival time from the multiagent system to any point on the curve. Low gain feedback is employed to design the distributed coverage control laws for the agents with different input constraints due to their limited movement capabilities. An upper bound on each low gain is also provided by showing that the distance between the neighboring agents is always lower and upper bounded. Under the proposed control laws, the networked mobile agents can be driven to the optimal configuration, minimizing the coverage cost function in finite time. Due to the unidirectional motion of the agents, there exists at least one agent which remains static throughout the coverage task. As a result, a less conservative upper bound on the low gains is derived, which provides the possibility of better convergence rates of the proposed coverage control laws.},

Under the drive of the reference signals, the semiglobally uniformly ultimate boundedness for all signals and the tracking errors converging to a small neighborhood of the origin are proved based on the Lyapunov function theory by choosing appropriate design parameters.

By employing the new ψ-type integral inequality, several sufficient conditions are derived for the robust stability of RNNs with discrete and distributed delays. Meanwhile, the robust boundedness of neural networks is explored by the bounded input perturbation and L 1 -norm constraint. Moreover, RNNs have a strong anti-jamming ability to input perturbation, and the robustness of RNNs is suitable for associative memory. Specifically, when input perturbation belongs to the specified and well-characterized space, the results cover both monostability and multistability as special cases. It is revealed that there is a relationship between the stability of neural networks and input perturbation. Compared with the existing results, these conditions proposed in this paper improve and extend the existing stability in some literature.

By examining the stabilization problem, the nonconvex stabilization criterion represented in terms of bilinear sum-of-squares (SOS) constraints is proposed to complement the existing convex stabilization criteria. Based on the polynomial Lyapunov function and considering the operation domain, the stabilization control is designed with a systematic region of attraction (ROA) analysis method. Since the proposed stabilization criterion remains in nonconvex form, the conservativeness caused by the transformation from nonconvex (bilinear SOS) constraints into convex (SOS) constraints can be avoided. Moreover, the restriction on the Lyapunov function candidates for the convex transformation in the literature does not exist in the proposed nonconvex stabilization criterion. The stabilization analysis for polynomial fuzzy control systems is concerned with the double fuzzy summation problem that can be treated as the copositivity problem. Therefore, the SOS-based copositive relaxation technique is applied for the proposed stabilization criterion. Since the proposed nonconvex stabilization criterion is represented in terms of bilinear SOS constraints, the path-following method is employed for solving the bilinear SOS problem. Finally, design examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed nonconvex stabilization criterion complements the existing convex stabilization criteria.},

To solve this problem, two control schemes are proposed via synthesizing the techniques of the event-triggered strategy, fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs), and adaptive backstepping control. The first basic design scheme applies an effective method to keep a balance between communication constraints and system performance under the influence of actuator PI hysteresis, while the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Furthermore, the basic design scheme not only guarantees the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero but also establishes a preserved transient performance. Nevertheless, note that the inclusive sign functions of the basic design scheme will cause possible chattering phenomenon, an alternative event-triggered adaptive control approach is then proposed. Unlike the previous control scheme, the second chattering-avoidance design approach ensures asymptotic convergence of the tracking error within a prescribed boundary δ, and finally the \unicode 0x00A3 2 -norm transient performance of the tracking error is constructed. Simulations verify the established theoretical results that the proposed schemes successfully overcome the communication constraints and compensate the actuator PI hysteresis, and also present different tracking performances between two control schemes for comparison.},

Then, by introducing an internal dynamic variable, a distributed Zeno-free dynamic event-triggered controller is constructed. Compared with the static event-triggering results, the interevent time of the proposed dynamic event-triggering mechanism is shown to be prolonged and, thus, the advantages of the event-triggered control approaches can be enhanced. Further, to avoid continuously monitoring the states, a Zeno-free self-triggering mechanism is given. It is shown that the expectations of the output tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small set if the diffusion terms are different for all agents, and that the expectations of all state tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small set if the diffusion terms are the same for all agents.

  abstract     = {Consensus control of multiagent systems (MASs) has applications in various domains. As MASs work in networked environments, their security control becomes critically desirable in response to various cyberattacks, such as denial of service (DoS). Efforts have been made in the development of both time- and event-triggered consensus control of MASs. However, there is a lack of precise calculation of control input during the attacking periods. To address this issue, a distributed secure consensus control with event triggering is developed for linear leader-following MASs under DoS attacks. It is designed with a dual-terminal event-triggered mechanism, which schedules information transmission through two triggered functions for each follower: one on the measurement channel (sensor-to-controller) and the other on the control channel (controller-to-actuator). To deal with DoS attacks, the combined states in the triggered functions are replaced by their estimations from an observer. Sufficient conditions are established for the duration and frequency of DoS attacks. To remove continuous monitoring of the measurement errors, a self-triggered secure control scheme is further developed, which combines the system states and other information at past triggered instants. Theoretical analysis shows that the followers in MASs under DoS attacks are able to track the leader and meanwhile the Zeno behavior is excluded. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our distributed secure consensus control of MASs.},

First, some more relaxed conditions for FXT stability are established and several more accurate estimates for the settling time (ST) are obtained by means of some special functions. Based on the improved FXT stability, FXT synchronization for discontinuous networks is discussed by designing a simple controller without a linear feedback term. Besides, the PAT synchronization is also explored by developing several nontrivial control protocols with finite control gains, where the synchronized time can be prespecified according to actual needs and is irrelevant with any initial value and any parameter.

Different from the existing finite-time control results, the nonlinearity of each agent is totally unknown in this article. To overcome the difficulties caused by asymmetric hysteresis quantization and PI hysteresis, a new distributed control method is proposed by adopting the adaptive compensation technique without estimating the lower bounds of parameters. Radial basis function neural networks are employed to estimate unknown nonlinear functions and solve the problem of algebraic loop caused by the pure-feedback nonlinear systems. Then, an adaptive neural-network compensation control approach is proposed to tackle the problem of sensor faults. The problem of the “explosion of complexity” caused by repeated differentiations of the virtual controller is solved by using the dynamic surface control technique. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop systems are semiglobal practical finite-time stable in probability, and the bipartite tracking control performance is achieved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by some simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the robust estimation of the output layer linear parameters in a radial basis function network (RBFN). A prominent method used to estimate the output layer parameters in an RBFN with the predetermined hidden layer parameters is the least-squares estimation, which is the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution in the specific case of the Gaussian noise. We highlight the connection between the ML estimation and minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the actual noise distribution and the assumed Gaussian noise. Based on this connection, a method is proposed using a variant of a generalized KL divergence, which is known to be more robust to outliers in the pattern recognition and machine-learning problems. The proposed approach produces a surrogate-likelihood function, which is robust in the sense that it is adaptive to a broader class of noise distributions. Several signal processing experiments are conducted using artificially generated and real-world data. It is shown that in all cases, the proposed adaptive learning algorithm outperforms the standard approaches in terms of mean-squared error (MSE). Using the relative increase in the MSE for different noise conditions, we compare the robustness of our proposed algorithm with the existing methods for robust RBFN training and show that our method results in overall improvement in terms of absolute MSE values and consistency.},

However, the enhancement of the diversity is at the expense of reducing the accuracies of individual classifiers in general and, thus, how to balance the diversity and accuracies is crucial for improving the ensemble performance. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble method which exploits the correlation between individual classifiers and their corresponding weights by constructing a joint optimization model to achieve the tradeoff between the diversity and the accuracy. Specifically, the proposed framework can be modeled as a shallow network and efficiently trained by the end-to-end manner. In the proposed ensemble method, not only can a high total classification performance be achieved by the weighted classifiers but also the individual classifier can be updated based on the error of the optimized weighted classifiers ensemble. Furthermore, the sparsity constraint is imposed on the weight to enforce that partial individual classifiers are selected for final classification. Finally, the experimental results on the UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the performance of classification compared with relevant existing ensemble methods.},

The feature maps learned with and without the proposed feature loss for a toy network suggest that our approach can fully explore the complementarity between handcrafted features and deep features. Based on the feature loss, a general framework for embedding the traditional feature information into deep network training was developed and tested using the FER2013, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, and MMI datasets. Moreover, adaptive loss weighting strategies are proposed to balance the influence of different losses for different expression databases. The experimental results show that the proposed feature loss with adaptive weighting achieves much better accuracy than the original handcrafted feature and the network trained without using our feature loss. Meanwhile, the feature loss with adaptive weighting can provide complementary information to compensate for the deficiency of a single feature.},

In light of this observation, this article focuses on automated construction of ANFISs in an effort to enhance the potential of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy regression models for situations where only limited training data are available. In particular, the proposed approach works by interpolating a group of fuzzy rules in a certain given domain with the assistance of existing ANFISs in its neighboring domains. The construction process involves a number of computational mechanisms, including a rule dictionary which is created by extracting the rules from the existing ANFISs; a group of rules which are interpolated by exploiting the local linear embedding algorithm to build an intermediate ANFIS; and a fine-tuning method which refines the resulting intermediate ANFIS. The experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets is reported, demonstrating that when facing the data shortage situations, the proposed approach helps significantly improve the performance of the original ANFIS modeling mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The training of autoencoder (AE) focuses on the selection of connection weights via a minimization of both the training error and a regularized term. However, the ultimate goal of AE training is to autoencode future unseen samples correctly (i.e., good generalization). Minimizing the training error with different regularized terms only indirectly minimizes the generalization error. Moreover, the trained model may not be robust to small perturbations of inputs which may lead to a poor generalization capability. In this paper, we propose a localized stochastic sensitive AE (LiSSA) to enhance the robustness of AE with respect to input perturbations. With the local stochastic sensitivity regularization, LiSSA reduces sensitivity to unseen samples with small differences (perturbations) from training samples. Meanwhile, LiSSA preserves the local connectivity from the original input space to the representation space that learns a more robustness features (intermediate representation) for unseen samples. The classifier using these learned features yields a better generalization capability. Extensive experimental results on 36 benchmarking datasets indicate that LiSSA outperforms several classical and recent AE training methods significantly on classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Compared with the normal low dynamic range (LDR) images, the high dynamic range (HDR) images provide more dynamic range and image details. Although the existing techniques for generating the HDR images have a good effect for static scenes, they usually produce artifacts on the HDR images for dynamic scenes. In recent years, some learning-based approaches are used to synthesize the HDR images and obtain good results. However, there are also many problems, including the deficiency of explaining and the time-consuming training process. In this article, we propose a novel approach to synthesize multiview HDR images through fuzzy broad learning system (FBLS). We use a set of multiview LDR images with different exposure as input and transfer corresponding Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy subsystems; then, the structure is expanded in a wide sense in the “enhancement groups” which transfer from the TS fuzzy rules with nonlinear transformation. After integrating fuzzy subsystems and enhancement groups with the trained-well weight, the HDR image is generated. In FBLS, applying the incremental learning algorithm and the pseudoinverse method to compute the weights can greatly reduce the training time. In addition, the fuzzy system has better interpretability. In the learning process, IF-THEN fuzzy rules can effectively help the model to detect the artifacts and reject them in the final HDR result. These advantages solve the problem of existing deep-learning methods. Furthermore, we set up a new dataset of multiview LDR images with corresponding HDR ground truth to train our system. Our experimental results show that our system can synthesize high-quality multiview HDR images, which has a higher training speed than other learning methods.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of an optimization problem is determined by its decision and objective spaces. Over the past few decades, a large number of works have focused on the performance improvement of metaheuristic algorithms via the objective space, whereas studies related to the decision space have attracted little attentions. Moreover, metaheuristic algorithms may not obtain satisfactory results within an entire feasible region, even if sufficient computational resources are available. Therefore, reducing the search space (i.e., finding a trust region) may be an effective method to ensure that the convergence is sufficiently close to the global optimal region. However, inappropriate subspace size may also weaken the performance of algorithms except for ones with a sufficiently small search space. To alleviate aforementioned problems, a variable search space (VSS) strategy based on a sequential trust region determination approach is proposed in this paper. In the VSS, the entire optimization process is divided into two stages: the first stage is to use an optimization approach for sequentially finding the trust domain of each variable and then determine the best-matched subspace; the second stage is to employ the optimization method for searching an optimal/near-optimal solution within the found trust region. The effectiveness of the VSS is evaluated using two widely used test suites, that is, IEEE CEC2014 and BBOB2012. Experimental results indicate that improving the algorithm performance is an important method for tackling problems, but locating a trust region is also beneficial for metaheuristic algorithms to improve the solution precision, especially for complex optimization problems.},

We focus on a fundamental issue regarding how to allocate a minimum number of control sources to guarantee the controllability of each given target subset in each layer, where the external control sources are limited to interact with only one layer. It is shown that this issue is essentially a path cover problem, which is to locate a set of directed paths denoted as P and cycles denoted as C to cover the target sets under the constraint that the nodes in the second layer cannot be the starting node of any element in P , and the number of elements in P attains its minimum. In addition, the formulated path cover problem can be further converted into a maximum network flow problem, which can be efficiently solved by an algorithm called maximum flow-based target path-cover (MFTP). We rigorously prove that MFTP provides the minimum number of control sources for guaranteeing the target controllability of two-layer multiplex networks. It is anticipated that this paper would serve wide applications in target control of real-life networks.},

Our experiments involve a flush-mounted conductance probe that collects voltage signals across a closed channel. The channel geometry is a horizontal annulus, which is commonly found in many industries. Eight distinct flow regimes were observed at selected gas-liquid flow rate settings. An objective flow regime identifier was then trained by learning a mapping between the probability density function (PDF) of the voltage signals and the observed flow regimes via kernel principal components analysis and multiclass support vector machine. The objective identifier was then applied in realtime by processing a moving time-window of voltage signals. Our approach has: 1) achieved more than 90\% accuracy against visual observations by an expert for static test data; 2) successfully visualized conductance data in 2-D space using virtual flow regime maps, which are useful for tracking flow regime transitions; and 3) introduced an efficient real-time automatic flow regime identifier, with only conductance data as inputs.},

  abstract     = {In domain adaptation, the automatic discovery of multiple latent source domains has succeeded by capturing the intrinsic structure underlying the source data. Different from previous works that mainly rely on shallow models for domain discovery, we propose a novel unified framework based on deep neural networks to jointly address latent domain prediction from source data and deep representation learning from both source and target data. Within this framework, an iterative algorithm is proposed to alternate between 1) utilizing a new probabilistic hierarchical clustering method to separate the source domain into latent clusters and 2) training deep neural networks by using the domain membership as the supervision to learn deep representations. The key idea behind this joint learning framework is that good representations can help to improve the prediction accuracy of latent domains and, in turn, domain prediction results can provide useful supervisory information for feature learning. During the training of the deep model, a domain prediction loss, a domain confusion loss, and a task-specific classification loss are effectively integrated to enable the learned feature to distinguish between different latent source domains, transfer between source and target domains, and become semantically meaningful among different classes. Trained in an end-to-end fashion, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for latent domain discovery, as validated by extensive experiments on both object classification and human action-recognition tasks.},

Moreover, from the perspective of business managers, it is indispensable to balance the tradeoff between the objective of influence spread maximization and objective of promotion cost minimization. Therefore, these two goals need to be seamlessly combined and optimized jointly. In this paper, considering the requirements of real-world applications, we develop a multiobjective optimization-based influence spread framework for geo-social networks, revealing the full view of Pareto-optimal solutions for decision makers. Based on the reverse influence sampling (RIS) model, we propose a similarity matching-based RIS sampling method to accommodate diverse users, and then transform our original problem into a weighted coverage problem. Subsequently, to solve this problem, we propose a greedy-based incrementally approximation approach and heuristic-based particle swarm optimization approach.

  abstract     = {Flocking control has been studied extensively along with the wide applications of multivehicle systems. In this article, the distributed flocking control strategy is studied for a network of autonomous vehicles with limited communication range. The main difference from the existing methods lies in that collision avoidance is considered a necessary condition while the vehicles are driven to follow a common desired trajectory under the proximity network. The sufficient conditions for system feasibility and stability are given by the proposed strategy. First, a centralized standard model predictive control (MPC) scheme is adopted to formulate the multivehicle flocking control problem by setting collision avoidance as an optimization constraint under the proximity network. Further, an equivalent distributed MPC (DMPC) is developed based on the consensus of local controllers under the existing framework of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). However, it may require infinite time to achieve consensus for all vehicles and, thus, the local controllers resulting in a limited number of ADMM iterations may not satisfy the given constraints. The constraints for each local controller are then modified so that the collision between vehicles is avoided all of the time. The feasibility and stability of the proposed method are analyzed under practical conditions. Simulation and experimental results show that the flocking of vehicles can track the common desired trajectory stably with no collisions by the proposed method.},

However, most of the existing methods used to construct GFMs are based on the principle of optimal allocation of information granularity, which requires that a numeric model be provided in advance. In this paper, a straightforward and convincing modeling method is proposed to directly construct GFM on a basis of experimental data. The method first granulates the output space to form some interval information granules with distinct semantics and then uses them to partition the entire input space into a series of input subspaces. Subsequently, an initial GFM is emerged by using “If-Then” rules to relate with those interval information granules positioned in the output space and structures expressed in prototypes that are produced by clustering individual input subspaces. Further, the initial GFM is also refined by continuously migrating prototypes in individual input subspaces. The experimental studies using the synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets are reported. They offer a useful insight into the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modeling method and reveal the impact of parameters on the performance of the ensuing GFMs. An application example is also presented to exhibit the advantages of the resulting GFM.},

This paper presents an entropy c-means (ECM), a method of fuzzy clustering that simultaneously optimizes two contradictory objective functions, resulting in the creation of fuzzy clusters with different levels of fuzziness. This allows ECM to identify clusters with different degrees of overlap. ECM optimizes the two objective functions using two multiobjective optimization methods, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). We also propose a method to select a suitable tradeoff clustering from the Pareto front. Experiments on challenging synthetic datasets as well as real-world datasets show that ECM leads to better cluster detection compared to the conventional fuzzy clustering methods as well as previously used multiobjective methods for fuzzy clustering.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses the problem of tracking a moving target by means of a cluster of mobile agents that is able to sense the acoustic emissions of the target, with the aim of improving the target localization and tracking performance with respect to conventional fixed-array acoustic localization. We handle the acoustic part of the problem by modeling the cluster as a sensor network, and we propose a centralized control strategy for the agents that exploits the spatial sensitivity pattern of the sensor network to estimate the best possible cluster configuration with respect to the expected target position. In order to take into account the position estimation delay due to the frame-based nature of the processing, the possible positions of the acoustic target in a given future time interval are represented in terms of a compatible set, that is, the set of all possible future positions of the target, given its dynamics and its present state. A frame-by-frame cluster reconfiguration algorithm is presented, which adapts the position of each sensing agent with the goal of pursuing the maximum overlap between the region of high acoustic sensitivity of the entire cluster and the compatible set of the sound-emitting target. The tracking scheme iterates, at each observation frame, the computation of the target compatible set, the reconfiguration of the cluster, and the target acoustic localization. The reconfiguration step makes use of an opportune cost function proportional to the difference of the compatibility set and the acoustic sensitivity spatial pattern determined by the mobile agent positions. Simulations under different geometric configurations and positioning constraints demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to effectively localize and track a moving target based on its acoustic emission. The Doppler effect related to moving sources and sensors is taken into account, and its impact on performance is analyzed. We compare the localization results with conventional static-array localization and positioning of acoustic sensors through genetic algorithm optimization, and results demonstrate the sensible improvements in terms of localization and tracking performance. Although the method is discussed here with respect to acoustic target tracking, it can be effectively adapted to video-based localization and tracking, or to multimodal information settings (e.g., audio and video).},

The existing data-driven approaches often ignore the dynamical relationships among multiple sites in urban areas, which results in nonideal prediction accuracy. In response to this problem, this article proposes a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder multitask learning model to predict PM 2.5 time series in multiple locations city wide. The model could implicitly and automatically excavate the intrinsic relevance among the pollutants in different stations. And the meteorological information from the monitoring stations is fully utilized, which is beneficial for the performance of the proposed model. Specifically, multilayer LSTM networks can simulate the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban air pollution particles. And using the stacked autoencoder to encode the key evolution pattern of urban meteorological systems could provide important auxiliary information for PM 2.5 time-series prediction. In addition, multitask learning could automatically discover the dynamical relationship between multiple key pollution time series and solve the problem of insufficient use of multisite information in the modeling process of the traditional data-driven methods. The simulation results of PM 2.5 prediction in Beijing indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) is a recently proposed algorithm for evolutionary multitasking, which optimizes multiple optimization tasks simultaneously. With the design of knowledge transfer among different tasks, MFEA has demonstrated the capability to outperform its single-task counterpart in terms of both convergence speed and solution quality. In MFEA, the knowledge transfer across tasks is realized via the crossover between solutions that possess different skill factors. This crossover is thus essential to the performance of MFEA. However, we note that the present MFEA and most of its existing variants only employ a single crossover for knowledge transfer, and fix it throughout the evolutionary search process. As different crossover operators have a unique bias in generating offspring, the appropriate configuration of crossover for knowledge transfer in MFEA is necessary toward robust search performance, for solving different problems. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no effort being conducted on the adaptive configuration of crossovers in MFEA for knowledge transfer, and this article thus presents an attempt to fill this gap. In particular, here, we first investigate how different types of crossover affect the knowledge transfer in MFEA on both single-objective (SO) and multiobjective (MO) continuous optimization problems. Furthermore, toward robust and efficient multitask optimization performance, we propose a new MFEA with adaptive knowledge transfer (MFEA-AKT), in which the crossover operator employed for knowledge transfer is self-adapted based on the information collected along the evolutionary search process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, comprehensive empirical studies on both SO and MO multitask benchmarks have been conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed MFEA-AKT is able to identify the appropriate knowledge transfer crossover for different optimization problems and even at different optimization stages along the search, which thus leads to superior or competitive performances when compared to the MFEAs with fixed knowledge transfer crossover operators.},

However, the similarity matrix in the traditional SymNMF methods is usually predefined, resulting in limited clustering performance. Considering that the quality of the similarity graph is crucial to the final clustering performance, we propose a new semisupervised model, which is able to simultaneously learn the similarity matrix with supervisory information and generate the clustering results, such that the mutual enhancement effect of the two tasks can produce better clustering performance. Our model fully utilizes the supervisory information in the form of pairwise constraints to propagate it for obtaining an informative similarity matrix. The proposed model is finally formulated as a non-negativity-constrained optimization problem. Also, we propose an iterative method to solve it with the convergence theoretically proven.

To solve this problem, we present two algorithms. The first algorithm is similar to a dual subgradient algorithm that requires a center node in the network. The main advantage of the first algorithm is that it achieves the optimal convergence rate O([1/√k]). Moreover, it does not require additional treatment for the primal recovery. These merits are achieved by using an iterate-averaging feedback technique on the basis of the dual subgradient method. The second algorithm further removes the requirement of a center node by employing consensus tracking iterates. As a result, the second algorithm is fully distributed at the price of achieving an O([lnk/√k]) convergence rate.},

In this paper, an optimal controller, based on a dynamic multiobjective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO) algorithm, is developed to deal with the dynamic multiple conflicting criteria [i.e., effluent quality (EQ), operation cost, and operation stability]. The novelties and advantages of this proposed DMOPSO-based optimal controller (DMOPSO-OC) include the following two aspects. First, an integrated optimization framework, where the multiple objectives not only conflict with each other but also change over time, is able to catch more characteristics of WWTP than the existing works. Second, a DMOPSO algorithm, with an adaptive global best selection mechanism, is designed to solve the multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) for the proposed optimal controller, thus leading to a significant improvement of optimal synthesis for performance. Finally, the proposed DMOPSO-OC is tested in the benchmark simulation model No. 1 (BSM1) and implemented in a real WWTP to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that this proposed DMOPSO-OC can achieve a significant improvement in optimal control performance and obey the requirement of multiple conflicting criteria.},

After the input-output linearization, the vehicle model can be decomposed into two uncertain subsystems by considering matching disturbances and parametric uncertainties. For each subsystem, an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic system (IT2-TSK-FLS) is then employed to approximate the unavailable model information. Following the idea of a small-gain approach, a composite feedback form for each subsystem is constructed, based on which the final robust adaptive tracking control law is developed. Rigorous stability analysis shows that all signals in the derived closed-loop system are kept uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). The main contribution of this paper is that the proposed control law for the hypersonic vehicle is with only two adaptive parameters in total which can greatly alleviate the computation and storage burden in practice; meanwhile its superiority over the conventional minimal-learning-parameter (MLP)-based one is specifically illustrated. Comparative numerical simulations of three cases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed control method with respect to complicated uncertainties.},

We integrate a spiking cerebellar network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot&#39;s sensorial signals, the robot&#39;s goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing univocally a specific system state at every point of time. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for building adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously adapts the torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is deployed. Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar controller to cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot&#39;s actuators mimicking human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration of a bioinspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant robot. We prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the default factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for addressing cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF) in smooth movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario compliant movements.},

Different from the previous studies, a memory-based ISMC scheme that has a constant delay is taken for the first time to design the ISMC for the T-S fuzzy systems. The DOB is given to estimate the disturbances, which are incorporated in the controller design to counteract the disturbance. To fully abide by the model characteristics of the PMSM-based T-S fuzzy systems and DOB, an integral-type fuzzy switching surface function (IFSSF), which involves state-dependent input matrix and memory parameter simultaneously, is defined. From the IFSSF, the fuzzy ISMC is designed to ensure the reachability condition in finite time. Besides that, the designed fuzzy ISMC can effectively attenuate the mismatched disturbances based on the H ∞ control theory. Also, a set of sufficient conditions is derived to ensure the global asymptotic stability for the sliding-mode dynamics by the proposed controller. Finally, the applicability of designed DOB-based memory fuzzy ISMC methodology is demonstrated by a controller design for the PMSM model.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the synchronization control problem of leader-follower multiagent systems with each follower described by a class of high-order nonlinear multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) dynamics in the presence of time delays and actuator faults. A distributed synchronization scheme with guaranteed synchronization performance based on the radial basis function neural network (RBF NN) is introduced. We propose an augmented quadratic Lyapunov function by incorporating the lower bounds of control gain matrices and the actuator healthy indicator, and the problems caused by the unknown time-varying control gain matrices, actuator faults, and coupling terms among agents are solved. Meanwhile, the output of followers can track that of the leader and the steady state, and the transient performance of synchronization can be guaranteed, while all the other signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be bounded. Finally, numerical analysis has been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

A Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy partial differential equation (PDE) model with space-varying coefficient matrices is first assumed to be derived for exactly describing nonlinear system dynamics. In the light of the fuzzy model, a local piecewise fuzzy feedback controller is then constructed to guarantee the exponential stability with a prescribed H ∞ disturbance attenuation level for the resulting closed-loop system, while the control constraints are also ensured. A sufficient condition on the existence of such fuzzy controller is developed by the Lyapunov direct method and an integral inequality and presented in terms of space algebraic linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) coupled with LMIs. By virtue of extreme value theorem, a suboptimal-constrained local piecewise H ∞ fuzzy control design in the sense of minimizing the disturbance attenuation level is formulated as a minimization optimization problem with LMI constraints. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve the feedback control of a quasi-linear FitzHugh-Nagumo equation with space-varying coefficients, and simulation results show its effectiveness and merit.},

In view of the network induced delay and the potential packet dropout, our RIHQAETC method is designed to actively compensate the negative effects caused by these two issues. The corresponding coder and decoder are also excogitated on account of the potential packet dropout based on the proposed triggering mechanism. Furthermore, the transmission of the important triggering information can be ensured as well as the finite-gain L 2 stability performance.

With the aid of partitioned regions, piecewise fuzzy H ∞ observers are presented. Availability of the piecewise fuzzy H ∞ observers gives us an accurate picture of the overall evolution of the augmented systems leading therefore to an improved situational awareness for the noncoordination of premise variables and external interference and, hence, the augmented systems achieve the performance conditions: asymptotic convergence and H ∞ performance.

Compared with some existing control schemes, the two fuzzy sampled-data control schemes cannot only tolerate some uncertainties but also save the limited communication resources for the considered systems. A new fuzzy-dependent adjustable matrix inequality technique is proposed. According to different fuzzy plant and controller rules, different adjustable matrices are introduced. In comparison with some traditional estimation techniques with a determined constant matrix, the fuzzy-dependent adjustable matrix approach is more flexible. Then, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and using the fuzzy-dependent adjustable matrix approach, new exponential synchronization criteria are derived for T-S fuzzy RDNNs with ATVDs. Meanwhile, the desired fuzzy time and time-space sampled-data control gains are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

By introducing the multilevel saturation feedback control approach, a fully distributed adaptive anti-windup protocol is proposed, where a local observer, a distributed observer, as well as an anti-windup observer are separately constructed for each agent to estimate consensus error, achieve consensus for a certain internal state, and provide anti-windup compensator, respectively. A dual protocol is further presented with the distributed observer designed based on the input matrix, which gives a thorough view on the connection between the distributed observer and the anti-windup observer, and provides the opportunity to reduce the order of the controller by designing the integrated distributed anti-windup observer. Then, three types of distributed anti-windup protocols are proposed based on the integrated distributed anti-windup observer, which requires different assumptions. Specifically, the first protocol needs two-hop relay information to generate the local observer to estimate consensus error; the second protocol designs the local observer with absolute output information to estimate the state instead; while the last protocol introduces certain assumption on transmission zero of agents&#39; dynamics to design the unknown input observer to estimate consensus error. All of the protocols are validated by strictly theoretical proof, and are illustrated by performing simulation examples.},

The serial-parallel estimation model (SPEM) is constructed to estimate the error dynamics, where the derived prediction error could improve the compensation effect of the NNs.

The hyperbolic tangent function is employed to process the error caused by the event-triggered scheme, and an indicator function of the saturation degree is used to analyze the influence generated by the asymmetric input saturation. By adopting the common Lyapunov function method and the dynamic gain control design approach, a new design procedure based on a reduced-order observer is proposed to construct an output feedback controller. It is proved by the Lyapunov analysis that the proposed event-triggered control scheme can ensure that all the signals of the closed-loop system are globally bounded. Furthermore, the output can be converged to a bounded region around the origin, and this region can be tuned to be small by adjusting the design parameters. Different from typical existing results on the switched nonlinear strict-feedback systems, the celebrated backstepping method is not employed in this article.

  abstract     = {The relative state between neighbors represents the difference of two connected agents&#39; states, and it possesses specific physical meanings in practice. Under this background, the saturation constraints in the relative state inevitably occur. This article studies the consensus problems under the relative state saturation constraints. Novel adaptive proportional-integral (PI) protocols are designed to solve the constrained consensus problem. Specifically, the adaptive coupling weights and the saturation functions are embedded into the proposed protocols, and the former can render the protocols independent of any global topology graph information, while the latter can confine the relative state to stay in its constrained set. Sufficient conditions are identified under which the constrained consensus can be achieved. Considering that the solution matrix is required to be diagonally dominant, an iterative learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to seek the diagonally dominant positive-definite solution matrix. For the special case that the input matrix is row full rank, more stringent saturation functions are constructed, and it not only achieves the constrained consensus but also realizes the nonovershoot and shorter settling time associated with edge states. Besides, this result can be applied to preserve connectivity of the communication network. The theoretical analyses are validated by a simulation example.},

The experimental results and performances are presented based on the Numenta anomaly benchmark. Compared with the anomaly detection algorithm using the hierarchical temporal memory proposed by Numenta (which outperforms a wide range of other anomaly detection algorithms), our algorithm can perform better in many cases, that is, with higher detection rates and earlier detection for contextual anomalies and concept drifts.},

Taking into account the fact that in many real-world applications, the given training samples are limited and can be inherently arranged into multidimensional arrays (tensors), we are motivated by the advantages of MTL, where the shared structural information among related tasks can be leveraged to produce better generalization performance. We propose a regularized tensor-based MTL method for joint feature selection and classification. For feature selection, we employ the Fisher discriminant criterion to both select discriminative features and control the within-class nonstationarity. For classification, we take both shared and task-specific structural information into consideration. We decompose the regression tensor for each task into a linear combination of a shared tensor and a task-specific tensor and propose a composite tensor norm. Specifically, we use the scaled latent trace norm for regularizing the shared tensor and the $\ell _{1}$ -norm for task-specific tensor. Further, we give a computationally efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to tackle the joint learning of discriminative features and multitask classification. The experimental results on real electroencephalography (EEG) datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

It is assumed that each cost function is convex and the optimization variable is subject to an inequality constraint. The objective is to make all the agents reach consensus, and meanwhile converge to the minimum point of the sum of local cost functions. A distributed protocol is proposed to guarantee that all agents can reach consensus in finite time and converge to the optimal point within the inequality constraints. Based on the ideas of parameter projection, the protocol includes two decent directions. One makes the cost function decrease, and the other makes agents step forward to the constraint set. It is shown that the proposed protocol solves the problem under connected undirected graphs without using a Lagrange multiplier technique. Especially, all of the agents could reach the constraint sets in finite time and stay in there after. The method could also be used in the centralized optimization problems.},

Without regulating the original network, possible identification failure caused by network synchronization cannot be avoided. In this paper, we propose a new method to overcome these shortcomings. We add a regulation mechanism to the original network and construct an auxiliary network consisting of isolated nodes. Along with the outer synchronization between the regulated network and the auxiliary network, we show that the original network can be identified.

An interesting phenomenon of SMO is that most of the computational time is wasted on the first half of iterations for building a good solution closing to the optimal. However, as we all know, the stochastic subgradient descent (SSGD) method is extremely fast for building a good solution. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework of accelerating SMO through SSGD for a variety of SVMs of binary classification, regression, ordinal regression, and so on.

To reflect the specificity of production reflected in the fluctuation of data, a series of information granules is constructed and described. In the dynamic scheduling phase, based on the granular feature description, a scheduling action network is established and further updates of information granules are realized. Considering a slow adjustment process and delay characteristics of the BFG system, the cumulative reward of the critic network is calculated on the basis of the data partition to construct a tendency attenuation-based cost function. In order to determine the future trends of the gas tank level that targets real-time determination of the scheduling moment, a reinforcement learning-based granulation and prediction process is also proposed. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, a number of comparative experiments are presented by using the practical industrial data. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits high accuracy and can deliver an effective solution to justified scheduling of the BFG system.},

This article studies the domain adaptive feature representation problem for the heterogeneous data, of which both the feature dimensions and the sample distributions across domains are so different that their features cannot be matched directly. To transfer the discriminant information efficiently from the source domain to the target domain, and then enhance the classification performance for the target data, we first introduce two projection matrices specified for different domains to transform the heterogeneous features into a shared space. We then propose a joint kernel regression model to learn the regression variable, which is called feature translator in this article. The novelty focuses on the exploration of optimal experimental design (OED) to deal with the heterogeneous and nonlinear DA by seeking the covariance structured feature translators (CSFTs). An approximate and efficient method is proposed to compute the optimal data projections. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed model.

  abstract     = {Automatic pancreas segmentation is crucial to the diagnostic assessment of diabetes or pancreatic cancer. However, the relatively small size of the pancreas in the upper body, as well as large variations of its location and shape in retroperitoneum, make the segmentation task challenging. To alleviate these challenges, in this article, we propose a cascaded multitask 3-D fully convolution network (FCN) to automatically segment the pancreas. Our cascaded network is composed of two parts. The first part focuses on fast locating the region of the pancreas, and the second part uses a multitask FCN with dense connections to refine the segmentation map for fine voxel-wise segmentation. In particular, our multitask FCN with dense connections is implemented to simultaneously complete tasks of the voxel-wise segmentation and skeleton extraction from the pancreas. These two tasks are complementary, that is, the extracted skeleton provides rich information about the shape and size of the pancreas in retroperitoneum, which can boost the segmentation of pancreas. The multitask FCN is also designed to share the low- and mid-level features across the tasks. A feature consistency module is further introduced to enhance the connection and fusion of different levels of feature maps. Evaluations on two pancreas datasets demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method in correctly segmenting the pancreas in various settings. Our experimental results outperform both baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study shows that our proposed parts/modules are critical for effective multitask learning.},

Some criteria are derived to guarantee the global exponential stability of CVNNs with proportional delays and inhibitory factors. The obtained criteria are applicable not only to systems with proportional delays but also to systems with arbitrary delays. Here, the Lyapunov functions are not constructed. Compared with the Lyapunov method, the matrix measure method makes the obtained criteria more concise, and the Halanay inequality makes the analytical procedure more compact. Furthermore, the global exponential synchronization of two neural-network models with proportional delays and inhibitory factors is also studied. By designing a feedback controller and giving some limitation conditions, the drive system and the response system realize global exponential synchronization.

The follower’s nonlinear dynamics is approximated using the fuzzy-logic systems, and the fuzzy weights are updated in a nonperiodic manner. By introducing a fuzzy state observer to reconstruct the system states, an observer-based event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control and a novel event-triggered condition are designed, simultaneously. In addition, the nonzero positive lower bound on interevent intervals is presented to avoid the Zeno behavior. It is proved via an extension of the Lyapunov approach that ultimately bounded control is achieved for the leader-following consensus of the considered multiagent systems. One remarkable advantage of the proposed control protocol is that the control law and fuzzy weights are updated only when the event-triggered condition is violated, which can greatly decrease the data transmission and communication resource.

The attacker is an active adversary whose aim is to severely degrade the tracking performance of the system by launching deception attacks on the sensor-to-controller communication channels and denial-of-service attacks on the controller-to-plant channels, respectively. First, a concept of resilient set-membership tracking control is presented, through which the system&#39;s true state is guaranteed to reside in a bounding ellipsoidal set of the reference state regardless of the existence of attacks and unknown-but-bounded (UBB) noises. Second, in the case that full information of the system&#39;s state is not implicitly trusted in the presence of attacks, a resilient set-membership estimation strategy is provided to secure the state estimates against the deception attacks. Furthermore, based on a recursive computation of a reference state ellipsoid and confidence state estimation ellipsoids, a convex optimization algorithm in terms of recursive linear matrix inequalities is proposed to obtain the gain parameters for both the desired resilient state estimator and the tracking controller.

  abstract     = {Numerous learning methods for fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), such as the Hebbian-based and the population-based learning methods, have been developed for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. However, these methods are faced with several obvious limitations. Most of these models are extremely time consuming when learning the large-scale FCMs with hundreds of nodes. Furthermore, the FCMs learned by those algorithms lack robustness when the experimental data contain noise. In addition, reasonable distribution of the weights is rarely considered in these algorithms, which could result in the reduction of the performance of the resulting FCM. In this article, a straightforward, rapid, and robust learning method is proposed to learn FCMs from noisy data, especially, to learn large-scale FCMs. The crux of the proposed algorithm is to equivalently transform the learning problem of FCMs to a classic-constrained convex optimization problem in which the least-squares term ensures the robustness of the well-learned FCM and the maximum entropy term regularizes the distribution of the weights of the well-learned FCM. A series of experiments covering two frequently used activation functions (the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions) are performed on both synthetic datasets with noise and real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method is rapid and robust against data containing noise and that the well-learned weights have better distribution. In addition, the FCMs learned by the proposed method also exhibit superior performance in comparison with the existing methods.},

This article proposes an event-triggered multiagent coordinated optimization strategy with two-layered architecture. First, the price-bidding-based DR model is proposed with different stakeholders, and it also deduces the optimal bidding price with the Nash equilibrium theory. Then, four agents are designed to control different kinds of energy resources: agent 1 mainly analyzes the uncertainty or randomness caused by intermittent power, agent 2 takes charge of the dynamic economic dispatch (DED) within thermal units, agent 3 manages the optimal scheduling of energy storage, and agent 4 mainly undertakes the load-shifting strategy from consumers. In the upper-layer level, all agents coordinate together to ensure the stability of the hybrid energy system with an event-triggered mechanism, and the intelligent control approach mainly depends on switching ON/OFF power generators or curtailing system load, and the consensus algorithm is utilized to optimize the subsystem problem in the lower-layer level. Furthermore, the simulation results can further verify the efficiency of the proposed method, and it also reveals that the event-triggered multiagent optimization strategy can be a promising way to solve the hybrid energy system problem.},

However, they will encounter difficulties in their scalability upon many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) due to the poor discriminability of Pareto optimality, which will affect the selection of leaders, thereby deteriorating the effectiveness of the algorithm. This paper presents a new scheme of discriminating the solutions in objective space. Based on the properties of Pareto optimality, we propose the dominant difference of a solution, which can demonstrate its dominance in every dimension. By investigating the norm of dominant difference among the entire population, the discriminability between the candidates that are difficult to obtain in the objective space is obtained indirectly. By integrating it into PSO, we gained a novel algorithm named many-objective PSO based on the norm of dominant difference (MOPSO/DD) for dealing with MaOPs. Moreover, we design a L p -norm-based density estimator which makes MOPSO/DD not only have good convergence and diversity but also have lower complexity. Experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that our proposal is competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art MOPSOs and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.},

However, there are some challenging factors in learning and representing the question corpus of HQA datasets, such as high dimensionality, sparseness, noise, nonprofessional expression, etc. To address these issues, we propose an inception convolutional autoencoder model for Chinese healthcare question clustering (ICAHC). First, we select a set of kernels with different sizes using convolutional autoencoder networks to explore both the diversity and quality in the clustering ensemble. Thus, these kernels encourage to capture diverse representations. Second, we design four ensemble operators to merge representations based on whether they are independent, and input them into the encoder using different skip connections. Third, it maps features from the encoder into a lower-dimensional space, followed by clustering. We conduct comparative experiments against other clustering algorithms on a Chinese healthcare dataset. Experimental results show the effectiveness of ICAHC in discovering better clustering solutions. The results can be used in the prediction of patients’ conditions and the development of an automatic HQA system.},

  abstract     = {Conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) can capture the discrepancy between conditional distributions by drawing support from nonlinear kernel functions; thus, it has been successfully used for pattern classification. However, CMMD does not work well on complex distributions, especially when the kernel function fails to correctly characterize the difference between intraclass similarity and interclass similarity. In this paper, a new kernel learning method is proposed to improve the discrimination performance of CMMD. It can be operated with deep network features iteratively and thus denoted as KLN for abbreviation. The CMMD loss and an autoencoder (AE) are used to learn an injective function. By considering the compound kernel, that is, the injective function with a characteristic kernel, the effectiveness of CMMD for data category description is enhanced. KLN can simultaneously learn a more expressive kernel and label prediction distribution; thus, it can be used to improve the classification performance in both supervised and semisupervised learning scenarios. In particular, the kernel-based similarities are iteratively learned on the deep network features, and the algorithm can be implemented in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets, including MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that KLN achieves the state-of-the-art classification performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an output consensus problem for a heterogeneous linear multiagent system with a predictive event-triggered mechanism on directed graphs is investigated. An event-triggered consensus protocol is proposed by introducing an internal reference model for each agent to handle the heterogeneity existing in the system. With the proposed mechanism, each agent predicts its internal reference model’s input by employing the estimate of the internal reference model’s state differences between itself and its neighbor agents. As it considers the internal reference model’s inputs of agents, the system requires far fewer event-triggered times to achieve consensus, leading to a significant reduction in communication cost among agents. A necessary and sufficient condition of the output consensus for the heterogeneous linear multiagent system is put forth. Furthermore, Zeno behavior can be ruled out for each agent. Some numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Manifold learning has been widely used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction of data recently. However, in the application of the related algorithms, it often suffers from noisy or unreliable data problems. For example, when the sample data have complex background, occlusions, and/or illuminations, the clustering of data is still a challenging task. To address these issues, we propose a family of novel algorithms for manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization in this paper. In the algorithms, based on the alpha-beta-divergences, graph regularization with multiple segments is utilized to constrain the data transitivity in data decomposition. By adjusting two tuning parameters, we show that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve the robustness with respect to the images with complex background. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is confirmed by the experiments on four different datasets. For different initializations and datasets, variations of cost functions and decomposition data elements in the learning are presented to show the convergent properties of the algorithms.},

In the framework of time-dependent switching mechanism, sufficient conditions for the existence of the sampled-data controllers are derived under the variable sampling and asynchronous switching. We prove that the proposed method not only renders the synchronization error system exponentially stable but also constrains the influence of the exogenous perturbations on the synchronization performance at a specified level.

  abstract     = {The past years have witnessed a revival of neural network and learning strategies. These models configure multiple hidden layers hierarchically and require large amounts of labeled samples to estimate the model parameters. It is yet difficult to be met for target recognition under the realistic environments. For either space borne or airborne radars, collecting multiple samples with label information is very expensive and difficult. In addition, the huge computational cost and poor speed of convergence limit the practical applications. To address the problems, this article presents a new thought of receptive, under which a special hierarchy of feedforward neural network has been built. The proposed strategy consists of two sequential modules: 1) feature generation and 2) feature refinement. We first build pairwise baseline signals by means of the Riesz transform along the range and the azimuth, and extend them to a family of receptive signals using the bandpass filter bank. The input SAR image is then generally convoluted with the set of receptive signals to extract the global features. Certain kinds of information can be then exploited. We make the receptive signals predefined, rather than learned automatically, to handle the environment of a small sample size. In addition, the expert knowledge can be transmitted into the neural network. The resulting features are further refined by a special unit, wherein the input neurons and the latent states are bridged by the weights and the bias randomly generated. They are fixed during the training process. On the other hand, we cast the latent state into the Hilbert space, forming the kernel version of refinement. We aim to achieve the comparable or even better performance yet with limited training resources.},

At the same time, tangent type time-varying barrier Lyapunov functions (tan-TVBLFs) are constructed to ensure the full state constraints are never violated, where tan-TVBLFs are beneficial to integrate constraint analysis into a common method. Furthermore, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove that all closed-loop signals are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded in probability and error signals remain in the compact set do not violate the time-varying constraints.

The large-scale system consists of a set of the uncertain polynomial T-S fuzzy system with interconnection terms. Modeling the large-scale nonlinear system under the framework of the polynomial form will decrease both the modeling errors and the number of fuzzy rules with respect to the conventional large-scale T-S fuzzy system. In addition, because of the existence of uncertainties, the synthesizing controller for the large-scale polynomial fuzzy system becomes much more challenging and has not been investigated in the previous studies. In this paper, a controller is synthesized to simultaneously eliminate the impact of the uncertainties and stabilize the system. With the aid of Lyapunov theory, sum-of-square technique, and S-procedure, the conditions for controller synthesis are derived in the main theorems. Finally, two examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem for unknown affine nonlinear systems with actuators faults. The considered types of faults are stuck (lock-in-place), loss-in-effectiveness (LIE), and bias, under which a part of the actuators is disabled. The objective is to find the remaining (not fully LIE) actuators, and manipulate them to obtain the best achievable performance in real time. First, considering that the best achievable performance is determined by the remaining actuators, a set of basic policies is predesigned with multiple levels of performances for different groups of activated actuators. Second, an identifier is designed based on history data to find the remaining actuators and, thus, the suitable predesigned basic policy. Third, to further accommodate the partial LIEs and biases, a compensator works together with the selected basic policy, to build the predesigned performance. In addressing the FTC problem, several techniques are developed: adjustable mechanisms are novelly integrated to deal with the state-dependent nonlinearities in neural network (NN) approximation, disturbances, and mismatch errors; history data are newly applied to estimate the faulty parameters; and a compensator is specially designed to deal with LIEs and biases in different input channels. Also in theory, the convergences of algorithms and the stability of closed-loop systems are proved, by formally giving the invariant sets of the initial state and the NN weights. Unlike the existing FTC methods dealing with LIE and bias based on model information to optimize the tracking error, this result can handle stuck faults without knowing system dynamics and satisfy different levels of performances described by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Finally, a simulation example of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FTC scheme.},

In this paper, a novel approach to accelerate on-chip learning systems using memristive quantized neural networks (M-QNNs) is presented. A real problem of multilevel memristive synaptic weights due to device-to-device (D2D) and cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variations is considered. Different levels of Gaussian noise are added to the memristive model during each adjustment. Another method of using memristors with binary states to build M-QNNs is presented, which suffers from fewer D2D and C2C variations compared with using multilevel memristors. Furthermore, methods of solving the sneak path issues in the memristive crossbar arrays are proposed. The M-QNN approach is evaluated on two image classification datasets, that is, ten-digit number and handwritten images of mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST). In addition, input images with different levels of zero-mean Gaussian noise are tested to verify the robustness of the proposed method. Another highlight of the proposed method is that it can significantly reduce computational time and memory during the process of image recognition.},

  abstract     = {Person reidentification (Re-ID) aims to match observations of individuals across multiple nonoverlapping camera views. Recently, metric learning-based methods have played important roles in addressing this task. However, metrics are mostly learned in supervised manners, of which the performance relies heavily on the quantity and quality of manual annotations. Meanwhile, metric learning-based algorithms generally project person features into a common subspace, in which the extracted features are shared by all views. However, it may result in information loss since these algorithms neglect the view-specific features. Besides, they assume person samples of different views are taken from the same distribution. Conversely, these samples are more likely to obey different distributions due to view condition changes. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised cross-view metric learning method based on the properties of data distributions. Specifically, person samples in each view are taken from a mixture of two distributions: one models common prosperities among camera views and the other focuses on view-specific properties. Based on this, we introduce a shared mapping to explore the shared features. Meanwhile, we construct view-specific mappings to extract and project view-related features into a common subspace. As a result, samples in the transformed subspace follow the same distribution and are equipped with comprehensive representations. In this paper, these mappings are learned in an unsupervised manner by clustering samples in the projected space. Experimental results on five cross-view datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a Bayesian method to acquire the estimation of human impedance and motion intention in a human–robot collaborative task. Combining with the prior knowledge of human stiffness, estimated stiffness obeying Gaussian distribution is obtained by Bayesian estimation, and human motion intention can be also estimated. An adaptive impedance control strategy is employed to track a target impedance model and neural networks are used to compensate for uncertainties in robotic dynamics. Comparative simulation results are carried out to verify the effectiveness of estimation method and emphasize the advantages of the proposed control strategy. The experiment, performed on Baxter robot platform, illustrates a good system performance.},

Unlike the existing event-triggered consensus results, more general heterogeneous linear MASs and nonuniform communication delays are considered. To reduce communication among subsystems, novel dynamic periodic event-triggered mechanisms are proposed. By using the event-triggered signals at the previous sampling instant, new distributed observers are designed to eliminate asynchronous behavior caused by nonuniform communication delays. Based on the developed observers, the observer error system is converted into a time-delay system with interval time-varying delays. Besides, a controller is designed by using the states of observers. It is shown that the consensus problem can be solved by the proposed method. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling (DFJSS) is a challenging combinational optimization problem that takes the dynamic environment into account. Genetic programming hyperheuristics (GPHH) have been widely used to evolve scheduling heuristics for job-shop scheduling. A proper selection of the terminal set is a critical factor for the success of GPHH. However, there is a wide range of features that can capture different characteristics of the job-shop state. Moreover, the importance of a feature is unclear from one scenario to another. The irrelevant and redundant features may lead to performance limitations. Feature selection is an important task to select relevant and complementary features. However, little work has considered feature selection in GPHH for DFJSS. In this article, a novel two-stage GPHH framework with feature selection is designed to evolve scheduling heuristics only with the selected features for DFJSS automatically. Meanwhile, individual adaptation strategies are proposed to utilize the information of both the selected features and the investigated individuals during the feature selection process. The results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully achieve more interpretable scheduling heuristics with fewer unique features and smaller sizes. In addition, the proposed algorithm can reach comparable scheduling heuristic quality with much shorter training time.},

  abstract     = {Humans have the ability to identify recurring patterns in diverse situations encountered over a lifetime, constantly understanding relationships between tasks and efficiently solving them through knowledge reuse. The capacity of artificial intelligence systems to mimic such cognitive behaviors for effective problem solving is deemed invaluable, particularly when tackling real-world problems where speed and accuracy are critical. Recently, the notion of evolutionary multitasking has been explored as a means of solving multiple optimization tasks simultaneously using a single population of evolving individuals. In the presence of similarities (or even partial overlaps) between high-quality solutions of related optimization problems, the resulting scope for intertask genetic transfer often leads to significant performance speedup-as the cost of re-exploring overlapping regions of the search space is reduced. While multitasking solvers have led to recent success stories, a known shortcoming of existing methods is their inability to adapt the extent of transfer in a principled manner. Thus, in the absence of any prior knowledge about the relationships between optimization functions, a threat of predominantly negative (harmful) transfer prevails. With this in mind, this article presents a realization of a cognizant evolutionary multitasking engine within the domain of multiobjective optimization. Our proposed algorithm learns intertask relationships based on overlaps in the probabilistic search distributions derived from data generated during the course of multitasking-and accordingly adapts the extent of genetic transfers online. The efficacy of the method is substantiated on multiobjective benchmark problems as well as a practical case study of knowledge transfers from low-fidelity optimization tasks to substantially reduce the cost of high-fidelity optimization.},

  abstract     = {Image classification is a popular task in machine learning and computer vision, but it is very challenging due to high variation crossing images. Using ensemble methods for solving image classification can achieve higher classification performance than using a single classification algorithm. However, to obtain a good ensemble, the component (base) classifiers in an ensemble should be accurate and diverse. To solve image classification effectively, feature extraction is necessary to transform raw pixels into high-level informative features. However, this process often requires domain knowledge. This article proposes an evolutionary approach based on genetic programming to automatically and simultaneously learn informative features and evolve effective ensembles for image classification. The new approach takes raw images as inputs and returns predictions of class labels based on the evolved classifiers. To achieve this, a new individual representation, a new function set, and a new terminal set are developed to allow the new approach to effectively find the best solution. More important, the solutions of the new approach can extract informative features from raw images and can automatically address the diversity issue of the ensembles. In addition, the new approach can automatically select and optimize the parameters for the classification algorithms in the ensemble. The performance of the new approach is examined on 13 different image classification datasets of varying difficulty and compared with a large number of effective methods. The results show that the new approach achieves better classification accuracy on most datasets than the competitive methods. Further analysis demonstrates that the new approach can evolve solutions with high accuracy and diversity.},

  abstract     = {Due to its various application potentials, the remote sensing image scene classification (RSSC) has attracted a broad range of interests. While the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently achieved tremendous success in RSSC, its superior performances highly depend on a large number of accurately labeled samples which require lots of time and manpower to generate for a large-scale remote sensing image scene dataset. In contrast, it is not only relatively easy to collect coarse and noisy labels but also inevitable to introduce label noise when collecting large-scale annotated data in the remote sensing scenario. Therefore, it is of great practical importance to robustly learn a superior CNN-based classification model from the remote sensing image scene dataset containing non-negligible or even significant error labels. To this end, this article proposes a new RSSC-oriented error-tolerant deep learning (RSSC-ETDL) approach to mitigate the adverse effect of incorrect labels of the remote sensing image scene dataset. In our proposed RSSC-ETDL method, learning multiview CNNs and correcting error labels are alternatively conducted in an iterative manner. It is noted that to make the alternative scheme work effectively, we propose a novel adaptive multifeature collaborative representation classifier (AMF-CRC) that benefits from adaptively combining multiple features of CNNs to correct the labels of uncertain samples. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of error-tolerant methods in the remote sensing domain, we construct remote sensing image scene datasets with: 1) simulated noisy labels by corrupting the open datasets with varying error rates and 2) real noisy labels by deploying the greedy annotation strategies that are practically used to accelerate the process of annotating remote sensing image scene datasets. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that our proposed RSSC-ETDL approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Active suspension systems are widely used in vehicles to improve ride comfort and handling performance. However, existing control strategies may be limited by various factors, including insufficient consideration of different operation conditions, such as changing in vehicle mass, defects in strategy design leading to incapability for guaranteeing finite-time stability, lack of considering input effects of dead zone and saturation, excessive energy cost, etc. Importantly, very few results considered the energy-saving performance of active suspension systems although a well-perceived issue in practice. An adaptive fuzzy SMC method based on a bioinspired reference model is established in this article, which is to purposely address these problems and be able to provide finite-time convergence and energy-saving performance simultaneously. The proposed control method effectively utilizes beneficial nonlinear stiffness and nonlinear damping properties that the bioinspired reference model could provide. Therefore, superior vibration suppression performance with less energy consumption and improved ride comfort can all be obtained readily. By using a fuzzy-logic system (FLS), the proposed method is beneficial in compensating for system parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, input dead zones, and saturations. Furthermore, based on the adaptive PD-SMC method, the tracking errors can converge to zeros in finite time. The stability of the equilibrium point of all the states in active suspension systems is theoretically proven by Lyapunov techniques. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Although producing good segmentation results, the efficiency of these two-stage approaches is far from satisfactory, restricting their applicability in practice. In this article, we propose a one-stage framework, single-pixel reconstruction net (SPRNet), which performs efficient instance segmentation by introducing a single-pixel reconstruction (SPR) branch to off-the-shelf one-stage detectors. The added SPR branch reconstructs the pixel-level mask from every single pixel in the convolution feature map directly. Using the same ResNet-50 backbone, SPRNet achieves comparable mask AP with Mask R-CNN at a higher inference speed and gains all-round improvements on box AP at every scale compared with RetinaNet.},

In this article, we propose a novel approach [individuality- and commonality-based multiview multilabel learning (ICM2L)] to explicitly explore the individuality and commonality information of multilabel multiple view data in a unified model. Specifically, a common subspace is learned across different views to capture the shared patterns. Then, multiple individual classifiers are exploited to explore the characteristics of individual views. Next, an ensemble strategy is adopted to make a prediction. Finally, we develop an alternative solution to jointly optimize our model, which can enhance the robustness of the proposed model toward rare labels and reinforce the reciprocal effects of individuality and commonality among heterogeneous views, and thus further improve the performance. Experiments on various real-word datasets validate the effectiveness of ICM2L against the state-of-the-art solutions, and ICM2L can leverage the individuality and commonality information to achieve an improved performance as well as to enhance the robustness toward rare labels.},

Usually, the number of anomaly samples is extremely small compared to the normal samples. To handle such imbalanced sample distribution, one-class classification has been widely used in identifying the anomaly by modeling the features of normal data using only normal data. Recently, recurrent autoencoder (RAE) has shown outstanding performance in the sequential anomaly detection compared to the other conventional methods. However, RAE, which has a long-term dependency problem, is optimized only to handle the fixed-length inputs. To overcome the limitations of RAE, we propose recurrent reconstructive network (RRN) as a novel RAE, with three functionalities for anomaly detection of streaming data: 1) a self-attention mechanism; 2) hidden state forcing; and 3) skip transition. The designed self-attention mechanism and the hidden state forcing between the encoder and decoder effectively manage the input sequences of varying length. The skip transition with the attention gate improves the reconstruction performance. We conduct a series of comprehensive experiments on four datasets and verify the superior performance of the proposed RRN in the sequential anomaly detection tasks.},

In this article, we propose the joint embedding learning and low-rank approximation (JELLA) framework for IML. The JELLA framework approximates the incomplete data by a set of low-rank matrices and learns a full and common embedding by linear transformation. Several existing IML methods can be unified as special cases of the framework. More interestingly, some linear transformation-based complete multiview methods can be adapted to IML directly with the guidance of the framework. Thus, the JELLA framework improves the efficiency of processing incomplete multiview data, and bridges the gap between complete multiview learning and IML. Moreover, the JELLA framework can provide guidance for developing new algorithms. For illustration, within the framework, we propose the IML with the block-diagonal representation (IML-BDR) method. Assuming that the sampled examples have an approximate linear subspace structure, IML-BDR uses the block-diagonal structure prior to learning the full embedding, which would lead to more correct clustering. A convergent alternating iterative algorithm with the successive over-relaxation optimization technique is devised for optimization. The experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IML-BDR.},

This article proposes a novel objective function based on a bidirectional kernel mean p -power error (KMPE) loss, to jointly deal with the above nonideal situations. KMPE is a nonsecond-order similarity measure in kernel space and shows a strong robustness against various noise and outliers. Moreover, a bidirectional measure is applied to judge the registration, which can avoid the ill-posed problem when a lot of points converges to the same point.

To address the above problems, we propose two novel center-weight-based models, namely, centered PCA (C-PCA) and generalized centered 2DPCA with l 2,p -norm minimization (GC-2DPCA), which are developed for vector- and matrix-based data, respectively. The C-PCA can preserve the structural information of data by measuring the similarity between the data points and can also retain the PCA&#39;s original desirable properties such as the rotational invariance. Furthermore, GC-2DPCA can learn efficient and robust projection matrices to suppress outliers by utilizing the variations between each row of the image matrix and employing power p of l 2,1 -norm. We also propose an efficient algorithm to solve the C-PCA model and an iterative optimization algorithm to solve the GC-2DPCA model, and we theoretically analyze their convergence properties. Experiments on three public databases show that our models yield significant improvements over the state-of-the-art PCA and 2DPCA approaches.},

  abstract     = {The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for single-objective real-valued optimization. However, the time and space complexity may preclude its use in high-dimensional decision space. Recent studies suggest that putting sparse or low-rank constraints on the structure of the covariance matrix can improve the efficiency of CMA-ES in handling large-scale problems. Following this idea, this paper proposes a search direction adaptation evolution strategy (SDA-ES) which achieves linear time and space complexity. SDA-ES models the covariance matrix with an identity matrix and multiple search directions, and uses a heuristic to update the search directions in a way similar to the principal component analysis. We also generalize the traditional 1/5th success rule to adapt the mutation strength which exhibits the derandomization property. Numerical comparisons with nine state-of-the-art algorithms are carried out on 31 test problems. The experimental results have shown that SDA-ES is invariant under search-space rotational transformations, and is scalable with respect to the number of variables. It also achieves competitive performance on generic black-box problems, demonstrating its effectiveness in keeping a good tradeoff between solution quality and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we elaborate on a new design approach to the development and analysis of granular input spaces and ensuing granular modeling. Given a numeric model (no matter what specific design methodology has been used to construct it and what architecture has been adopted), we form a granular input space through allocating a certain level of information granularity across the input variables. The formation of granular input space helps us gain a better insight into the ranking of input variables with respect to their precision (the variables with a lower level of information granularity need to be specified in a precise way when estimating the inputs). As a consequence, for granular inputs, the outputs of the granular model are also information granules (say, intervals, fuzzy sets, rough sets, etc.). It is shown that the process of forming granular input space can be sought as an optimization of allocation of information granularity across the input variables so that the specificity of the corresponding granular outputs of the granular model becomes the highest while coverage of data becomes maximized. The construction of granular input space dwells upon two fundamental principles of granular computing-the principle of justifiable granularity and the optimal allocation of information granularity. The quality of the granular input space is quantified in terms of the two conflicting criteria, that is, the specificity of the results produced by the granular model and the coverage of experimental data delivered by this model. In the ensuing optimization problem, one maximizes a product of specificity and coverage. Differential evolution is engaged in this optimization task. The experimental studies involve both synthetic dataset and data coming from the machine learning repository.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been regarded as fundamental tools for many disciplines. Meanwhile, they are known for their large-scale parameters, high redundancy in weights, and extensive computing resource consumptions, which pose a tremendous challenge to the deployment in real-time applications or on resource-constrained devices. To cope with this issue, compressing DNNs for accelerating its inference has drawn extensive interest recently. The basic idea is to prune parameters with little performance degradation. However, the overparameterized nature and the conflict between parameters reduction and performance maintenance make it prohibitive to manually search the pruning parameter space. In this paper, we formally establish filter pruning as a multiobjective optimization problem, and propose a knee-guided evolutionary algorithm (KGEA) that can automatically search for the solution with quality tradeoff between the scale of parameters and performance, in which both conflicting objectives can be optimized simultaneously. In particular, by incorporating a minimum Manhattan distance approach, the search effort in the proposed KGEA is explicitly guided toward the knee area, which greatly facilitates the manual search for a good tradeoff solution. Moreover, the parameter importance is directly estimated on the criterion of performance loss, which can robustly identify the redundancy. In addition to the knee solution, a performance-improved model can also be found in a fine-tuning-free fashion. The experiments on compressing fully convolutional LeNet and VGG-19 networks validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art competing methods.},

Although they have achieved great success in modeling time series, a single ESN may have difficulty in capturing the multitimescale structures that naturally exist in temporal data. In this paper, we propose the convolutional multitimescale ESN (ConvMESN), which is a novel training-efficient model for capturing multitimescale structures and multiscale temporal dependencies of temporal data. In particular, a multitimescale memory encoder is constructed with a multireservoir structure, in which different reservoirs have recurrent connections with different skip lengths (or time spans). By collecting all past echo states in each reservoir, this multireservoir structure encodes the history of a time series as nonlinear multitimescale echo state representations (MESRs). Our visualization analysis verifies that the MESRs provide better discriminative features for time series. Finally, multiscale temporal dependencies of MESRs are learned by a convolutional layer. By leveraging the multitimescale reservoirs followed by a convolutional learner, the ConvMESN has not only efficient memory encoding ability for temporal data with multitimescale structures but also strong learning ability for complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the training-free reservoirs and the single convolutional layer provide high-computational efficiency for the ConvMESN to model complex temporal data. Extensive experiments on 18 multivariate time series (MTS) benchmark datasets and 3 skeleton-based action recognition datasets demonstrate that the ConvMESN captures multitimescale dynamics and outperforms existing methods.},

This paper, therefore, studies the imbalanced data clustering problem within the framework of k-means-type competitive learning. We introduce a new method called self-adaptive multiprototype-based competitive learning (SMCL) for imbalanced clusters. It uses multiple subclusters to represent each cluster with an automatic adjustment of the number of subclusters. Then, the subclusters are merged into the final clusters based on a novel separation measure. We also propose a new internal clustering validation measure to determine the number of final clusters during the merging process for imbalanced clusters. The advantages of SMCL are threefold: 1) it inherits the advantages of competitive learning and meanwhile is applicable to the imbalanced data clustering; 2) the self-adaptive multiprototype mechanism uses a proper number of subclusters to represent each cluster with any arbitrary shape; and 3) it automatically determines the number of clusters for imbalanced clusters. SMCL is compared with the existing counterparts for imbalanced clustering on the synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results show the efficacy of SMCL for imbalanced clusters.},

In this article, a kind of flat neural networks called the broad learning system (BLS) is employed to derive two novel learning methods for text classification, including recurrent BLS (R-BLS) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-like architecture: gated BLS (G-BLS). The proposed two methods possess three advantages: 1) higher accuracy due to the simultaneous learning of multiple information, even compared to deep LSTM that extracts deeper but single information only; 2) significantly faster training time due to the noniterative learning in BLS, compared to LSTM; and 3) easy integration with other discriminant information for further improvement. The proposed methods have been evaluated over 13 real-world datasets from various types of text classification. From the experimental results, the proposed methods achieve higher accuracies than LSTM while taking significantly less training time on most evaluated datasets, especially when the LSTM is in deep architecture. Compared to R-BLS, G-BLS has an extra forget gate to control the flow of information (similar to LSTM) to further improve the accuracy on text classification so that G-BLS is more effective while R-BLS is more efficient.},

Nevertheless, most existing proximity-based methods take the predefined proximity matrices as input and their performance relies heavily on the quality of the predefined proximity matrices. A few multiview proximity learning (MVPL) methods have been proposed to tackle this problem but there are still some limitations, such as only emphasizing the intraview relation but overlooking the inter-view correlation, or not taking the weight differences of different views into account when considering the inter-view correlation. These limitations affect the quality of the learned proximity matrices and therefore influence the clustering performance. With the aim of breaking through these limitations simultaneously, a novel proximity learning method, called adaptively weighted MVPL (AWMVPL), is proposed. In the proposed method, both the intraview relation and the inter-view correlation are considered. Besides, when considering the inter-view correlation, the weights of different views are learned in a self-weighted scheme. Furthermore, through an adaptively weighted scheme, the information of the learned view-specific proximity matrices is integrated into a view-common cluster indicator matrix which outputs the final clustering result. Extensive experiments are conducted on several synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method compared with the existing methods.},

To solve the problems caused by unlabeled, unbalanced condition monitoring (CM) data and uncertainties of the prognostics process, a novel data-driven aero-engine degradation prognostic strategy is proposed in this article. First, two indicators are defined to remove redundant degradation features. Then, the number of discrete states of health is determined by a fuzzy $c$ -means algorithm, and the health state labels can be automatically assigned for health state estimation, where the uncertain initial condition and the uncertainty of health state&#39;s transition are fully considered. Finally, a multivariate health estimation model and a multivariate multistep-ahead long-term degradation prediction model are proposed for remaining useful life estimation for aero-engines. Verification results using the aero-engine data from NASA can show that the proposed data-driven degradation prognostic strategy is effective and feasible.},

To take full advantage of the knowledge transferred by attributes, in this paper, we introduce the notion of the complementary attributes (CAs), as a supplement to the original attributes, to enhance the semantic representation ability. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that CAs can improve the PAC-style generalization bound of the original ZSL model. Since the proposed CA focuses on enhancing the semantic representation, CA can be easily applied to any existing attribute-based ZSL methods, including the label-embedding strategy-based ZSL (LEZSL) and the probability-prediction strategy-based ZSL (PPZSL). In PPZSL, there is a strong assumption that all attributes are independent of each other, which is arguably unrealistic in practice. To solve this problem, a novel rank aggregation (RA) framework is proposed to circumvent the assumption. Extensive experiments on five ZSL benchmark datasets and the large-scale ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed CA and RA can significantly and robustly improve the existing ZSL methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

However, since social images contain both multimodal contents (e.g., visual images and textual descriptions) and social relations among images, simply modeling the content information may lead to suboptimal embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal representation learning model for social images, that is, correlational multimodal variational autoencoder (CMVAE) via triplet network. Specifically, in order to mine the highly nonlinear correlation between the visual content and the textual content, a CMVAE is proposed to learn a unified representation for the multiple modalities of social images. Both common information in all modalities and private information in each modality are encoded for the representation learning. To incorporate the social relations among images, we employ the triplet network to embed multiple types of social links in the representation learning. Then, a joint embedding model is proposed to combine the social relations for representation learning of the multimodal contents. Comprehensive experiment results on four datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method in two tasks, namely, multilabel classification and cross-modal retrieval. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal representation learning methods with significant improvement of performance.},

  abstract     = {The self-expressive property of data points, that is, each data point can be linearly represented by the other data points in the same subspace, has proven effective in leading subspace clustering (SC) methods. Most self-expressive methods usually construct a feasible affinity matrix from a coefficient matrix, obtained by solving an optimization problem. However, the negative entries in the coefficient matrix are forced to be positive when constructing the affinity matrix via exponentiation, absolute symmetrization, or squaring operations. This consequently damages the inherent correlations among the data. Besides, the affine constraint used in these methods is not flexible enough for practical applications. To overcome these problems, in this article, we introduce a scaled simplex representation (SSR) for the SC problem. Specifically, the non-negative constraint is used to make the coefficient matrix physically meaningful, and the coefficient vector is constrained to be summed up to a scalar s &lt;; 1 to make it more discriminative. The proposed SSR-based SC (SSRSC) model is reformulated as a linear equality-constrained problem, which is solved efficiently under the alternating direction method of multipliers framework. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SSRSC algorithm is very efficient and outperforms the state-of-the-art SC methods on accuracy. The code can be found at https://github.com/csjunxu/SSRSC.},

  abstract     = {The task of reidentifying groups of people under different camera views is an important yet less-studied problem. Group reidentification (Re-ID) is a very challenging task since it is not only adversely affected by common issues in traditional single-object Re-ID problems, such as viewpoint and human pose variations, but also suffers from changes in group layout and group membership. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of group granularity by characterizing a group image by multigrained objects: individual people and subgroups of two and three people within a group. To achieve robust group Re-ID, we first introduce multigrained representations which can be extracted via the development of two separate schemes, that is, one with handcrafted descriptors and another with deep neural networks. The proposed representation seeks to characterize both appearance and spatial relations of multigrained objects, and is further equipped with importance weights which capture variations in intragroup dynamics. Optimal group-wise matching is facilitated by a multiorder matching process which, in turn, dynamically updates the importance weights in iterative fashion. We evaluated three multicamera group datasets containing complex scenarios and large dynamics, with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Modern soccer increasingly places trust in visual analysis and statistics rather than only relying on the human experience. However, soccer is an extraordinarily complex game that no widely accepted quantitative analysis methods exist. The statistics collection and visualization are time consuming which result in numerous adjustments. To tackle this issue, we developed GreenSea, a visual-based assessment system designed for soccer game analysis, tactics, and training. The system uses a broad learning system (BLS) to train the model in order to avoid the time-consuming issue that traditional deep learning may suffer. Users are able to apply multiple views of a soccer game, and visual summarization of essential statistics using advanced visualization and animation that are available. A marking system trained by BLS is designed to perform quantitative analysis. A novel recurrent discriminative BLS (RDBLS) is proposed to carry out long-term tracking. In our RDBLS, the structure is adjusted to have better performance on the binary classification problem of the discriminative model. Several experiments are carried out to verify that our proposed RDBLS model can outperform the standard BLS and other methods. Two studies were conducted to verify the effectiveness of our GreenSea. The first study was on how GreenSea assists a youth training coach to assess each trainee’s performance for selecting most potential players. The second study was on how GreenSea was used to help the U20 Shanghai soccer team coaching staff analyze games and make tactics during the 13th National Games. Our studies have shown the usability of GreenSea and the values of our system to both amateur and expert users.},

In the model, one layer represents a social network with positive and negative preventive information spreading competitively, while the other one denotes the physical contact network with epidemic propagation. The individuals who are aware of positive prevention will take more effective measures to avoid being infected than those who are aware of negative prevention. Taking the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) approach, we analytically derive the expression of the epidemic threshold for the proposed epidemic model, which indicates that the diffusion of positive and negative prevention information, as well as the topology of the physical contact network have a significant impact on the epidemic threshold. By comparing the results obtained with MMC and those with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, it is found that they are in good agreement, but MMC can well describe the dynamics of the proposed model. Meanwhile, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the impact of positive and negative preventive information on the epidemic threshold, as well as the prevalence of infectious diseases. We also find that the epidemic prevalence and the epidemic outbreaks can be suppressed by the diffusion of positive preventive information and be promoted by the diffusion of negative preventive information.},

However, most of the existing CNN-based SR models require high computing power, which considerably limits their real-world applications. In addition, most CNN-based methods rarely explore the intermediate features that are helpful for final image recovery. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a dense lightweight network, called MADNet, for stronger multiscale feature expression and feature correlation learning. Specifically, a residual multiscale module with an attention mechanism (RMAM) is developed to enhance the informative multiscale feature representation ability. Furthermore, we present a dual residual-path block (DRPB) that utilizes the hierarchical features from original low-resolution images. To take advantage of the multilevel features, dense connections are employed among blocks. The comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of our MADNet model while employing considerably fewer multiadds and parameters.},

A self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm is developed for addressing the problem. In our proposed algorithm, mutation operators are adaptively chosen based on their historical performances. Also, control parameter values are adaptively determined based on their historical performances. Our proposed algorithm is compared to CPLEX, existing metaheuristics for this problem and conventional differential evolution algorithms through comprehensive experiments.

In this paper, a two-round environmental selection strategy is proposed to pursue good tradeoff between population diversity and convergence for many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs). Particularly, in the first round, the solutions with small neighborhood density are picked out to form a candidate pool, where the neighborhood density of a solution is calculated based on a novel adaptive position transformation strategy. In the second round, the best solution in terms of convergence is selected from the candidate pool and inserted into the next generation. The procedure is repeated until a new population is generated. The two-round selection strategy is embedded into an MaOEA framework and the resulting algorithm, namely, 2REA, is compared with eight state-of-the-art MaOEAs on various benchmark MaOPs. The experimental results show that 2REA is very competitive with the compared MaOEAs and the two-round selection strategy works well on balancing population diversity and convergence.},

Moreover, there is no systematic approach for the decision makers to intervene and embed their knowledge and preferences in the evolutionary process. This article develops a novel people-centric evolutionary system for dynamic production scheduling. The two key components of the system are a new mapping technique to incrementally monitor the evolutionary process and a new adaptive surrogate model to improve the efficiency of GP. The experimental results with dynamic flexible job shop scheduling show that the proposed system outperforms the existing algorithms for evolving scheduling heuristics in terms of scheduling performance and heuristic sizes.

Consider that the information of the system mode is transmitted to the filter over the communication network that is vulnerable to external attacks, which may lead to the undesired performance of the resulting system by injecting malicious information from the attackers. As a result, the filter has difficulty completing information from the original system. Besides, an event-triggered communication mechanism is introduced to reduce the communication frequency between data transmission due to the limited network resources, and different triggering conditions corresponding to different jump modes are developed. Then, based on the above considerations, the sufficient condition is derived to ensure the stochastic stability and dissipativity of the resulting augmented system although the deception attacks and incomplete information exist.

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, the synchronization of complex networks with directed topologies has received considerable attention owing to its extensive applications in the realistic world. Design of proportional-integral–derivative (PID) control protocols for achieving synchronization with directed networks is known to be a challenging task. The purpose of this paper is to establish a connection between the PID control protocols and synchronization of complex dynamical networks with directed topologies. Based on the classical complex network model, we investigate global synchronization with PD controller of a balanced strongly connected directed network and global synchronization with PI controller of a strongly connected directed network, and a directed network containing a spanning tree, respectively. Several sets of sufficient conditions are established under which the network reaches global synchronization. The simulation examples are presented to verify the efficiency of the theoretical results.},

The considered distributed optimization is to search for a minimizer of the summation of nonsmooth convex functions on some agents, which have local general constraints. The proposed approach solves the objective function of each agent individually, and the state solutions of all agents reach consensus asymptotically under mild assumptions. In particular, the existence and boundedness of the global state solution to the dynamical system are guaranteed. Moreover, the state solution reaches the feasible region of equivalent optimization problem asymptotically and the output of each agent is convergent to the optimal solution set of the primal distributed problem. In contrast to the existing methods in a distributed manner, the proposed approach is more convenient for general constrained distributed problems and has low structure complexity which could narrow the bandwidth of communication. Finally, the proposed neurodynamic approach is applied to two numerical examples and a class of power system optimal load-sharing problems to support the theoretical results and its efficiency.},

By constructing an augmented LKF, using an equivalent transformation method to deal with the unknown TPs and utilizing the extended reciprocally convex matrix inequality, and the free matrix weighting approach to estimate the forward difference of the constructed LKF, several sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of an ellipsoidal reachable set are established.

Our goal is to achieve asymptotic (rather than ultimately uniformly bounded) consensus tracking, which is quite challenging especially if nonvanishing/nonparametric uncertainties are involved and at the same time the control protocol is required to be fully distributed and continuous everywhere. Here, we present a conceptually new and structurally simple solution with distributed and continuous control action. The developed method is capable of ensuring zero-error tracking with a unique converging feature in that the consensus tracking error first converges to a small adjustable residual set around zero within a prescribed finite time, and then further shrinks to zero exponentially. The key technique lies in the utilization of a state transformation based on certain scaling function. Our method also prevents the restrictive requirement that all subsystems have access to the linearly parameterized information as imposed in most existing consensus tracking results for nonlinear MAS.},

In such systems, different sensors can receive different types of operation signals, such as pressure, temperature, and volume. The desired references for different sensors may conflict in that an input signal that can precisely track all references simultaneously does not exist yet. This gap has motivated us to consider the incompatible multiobjective tracking problem for multisensor systems with random process disturbances and measurement noises. Our primary approach is to solve the problem as a weighted optimization problem using iterative learning control (ILC). First, the best achievable trajectory based on multiple references, as well as the weighted optimal tracking index, is carefully defined and then the ILC algorithms with both fixed and decreasing steps are proposed to generate the input sequence. The output driven by the proposed algorithms has been strictly proven to converge to the best achievable trajectory in both the mean square and almost-sure senses. Extensions to a networked implementation, in which the networks between the sensors and the learning controller suffer random data dropouts, are also detailed. Illustrative simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results.},

In this paper, we study the problem of event-triggered control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems by considering the cases with or without state constraints in a unified manner. By introducing a new universal-constrained function and using certain transformation techniques, the original-constrained system is converted into an equivalent totally unconstrained one. Then, an event-triggered adaptive neural-network (NN) controller is designed to stabilize the unconstrained system and compensate for the control sampling errors caused by event-triggered transmission of control signals. Unlike some existing control schemes developed for systems with state constraints, which need to check whether each virtual control meets certain feasibility conditions at every design step, our proposed unified method enables such feasibility conditions to be relaxed. In addition, a suitable event-triggering rule is designed to determine when to transmit control signals. It is theoretically shown that the designed controller can achieve the desired tracking ability and reduce the communication burden from the controller to the actuator at the same time. Simulation verification also confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Since the whole protocols are designed according to sampled information at event instants rather than real-time information, these protocols efficiently avoid continuous communications, reduce the bandwidth need of communication, and decrease the energy consuming. The distributed static state feedback edge-based event-triggered protocol or the adaptive one is applicable for the occasions with available states. Different from the state feedback protocols, users can choose the distributed static output feedback edge-based event-triggered protocol or the adaptive one no matter whether agents&#39; states are available or not. It is worth emphasizing that the adaptive state (or output) feedback event-triggered protocol requires no global information of the network topology and can be used in a fully distributed and scalable manner.

  abstract     = {Large-scale optimization has become a significant and challenging research topic in the evolutionary computation (EC) community. Although many improved EC algorithms have been proposed for large-scale optimization, the slow convergence in the huge search space and the trap into local optima among massive suboptima are still the challenges. Targeted to these two issues, this article proposes an adaptive granularity learning distributed particle swarm optimization (AGLDPSO) with the help of machine-learning techniques, including clustering analysis based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and adaptive granularity control based on logistic regression (LR). In AGLDPSO, a master–slave multisubpopulation distributed model is adopted, where the entire population is divided into multiple subpopulations, and these subpopulations are co-evolved. Compared with other large-scale optimization algorithms with single population evolution or centralized mechanism, the multisubpopulation distributed co-evolution mechanism will fully exchange the evolutionary information among different subpopulations to further enhance the population diversity. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive granularity learning strategy (AGLS) based on LSH and LR. The AGLS is helpful to determine an appropriate subpopulation size to control the learning granularity of the distributed subpopulations in different evolutionary states to balance the exploration ability for escaping from massive suboptima and the exploitation ability for converging in the huge search space. The experimental results show that AGLDPSO performs better than or at least comparable with some other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, even the winner of the competition on large-scale optimization, on all the 35 benchmark functions from both IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC2010) and IEEE CEC2013 large-scale optimization test suites.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the adaptive fault-tolerant tracking control problem for a class of discrete-time multiagent systems via a reinforcement learning algorithm. The action neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate unknown and desired control input signals, and the critic NNs are employed to estimate the cost function in the design procedure. Furthermore, the direct adaptive optimal controllers are designed by combining the backstepping technique with the reinforcement learning algorithm. Comparing the existing reinforcement learning algorithm, the computational burden can be effectively reduced by using the method of less learning parameters. The adaptive auxiliary signals are established to compensate for the influence of the dead zones and actuator faults on the control performance. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

It is on the road and deployment requires the design of distributed control strategies, leveraging secure vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Indeed, wireless communication networks can be affected by various security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks leading to dangerous implications for cooperative driving safety. Control design can play an important role in providing both resilience and robustness to vehicular networks. To this aim, in this article, we tackle and solve the problem of cyber-secure tracking for a platoon that moves as a cohesive formation along a single lane undergoing different kinds of cyber threats, that is, application layer and network layer attacks, as well as network induced phenomena. The proposed cooperative approach leverages an adaptive synchronization-based control algorithm that embeds a distributed mitigation mechanism of malicious information. The closed-loop stability is analytically demonstrated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, while its effectiveness in coping with the most relevant type of cyber threats is disclosed by using PLEXE, a high fidelity simulator which provides a realistic simulation of cooperative driving systems.},

In the control scheme, a quantized output-feedback control for position tracking and a state-feedback quantized control for attitude trajectory tracking are combined to deal with the underactuated and strong coupling problems of the quadrotor. The main contributions are: 1) the adaptive fuzzy quantized control is realized, then the strong nonlinearities caused by the quantizer are effectively mitigated, which implies that the control precision can be improved when a low communication rate is required in the real-time control system of quadrotor; 2) by applying the adaptive fuzzy dynamic surface control (DSC) technique to the underactuated quadrotor control system, the “explosion of complexity” problem in the backstepping method is overcome and the L ∞ tracking performance is achieved with the proposed initializing technique inspired by Zhang et al. This guarantees that the attitude signals promptly converge to the desired trajectories, then the underactuated problem of the quadrotor is overcome by solving the designed adaptive fuzzy-quantized control equations; and 3) the experiments on the platform of the Quanser Qball-X4 quadrotor are conducted and the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated.},

The barrier Lyapunov function is incorporated into each step of backstepping, and the condition of the state constraint is satisfied. The dynamic surface technique with an auxiliary first-order linear filter is applied to avoid the problem of an “explosion of complexity.” Based on the finite-time stability theory, an adaptive fuzzy controller is constructed to guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in a finite time, and all states are ensured to remain in the predefined sets.

  abstract     = {This article reports our study on a reduced adaptive fuzzy decoupling control for our lower limb exoskeleton system which typically is a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) uncertain nonlinear system. To show the applicability and generality of the proposed control methods, a more general MIMO uncertain nonlinear system model is considered. By decoupling control, the entire MIMO system is separated into several MISO subsystems. In our experiments, such a system may have problems (even unstable) if a traditional fuzzy approximator is used to estimate the complicated coupling terms. In this article, to overcome this problem, a reduced adaptive fuzzy system together with a compensation term is proposed. Compared to traditional approaches, the proposed fuzzy control approach can reduce possible chattering phenomena and achieve better control performance. By employing the proposed control scheme to an actual 2-DOF lower limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot system, it can be seen from the experimental results that, as expected, it has good performance to track the model trajectory of a human walking gait. Therefore, it can be concluded that the developed approach is effective for the control of a lower limb exoskeleton system.},

Inspired by the activation function of neural networks, the new strategy is employed to update the acceleration coefficients by using the sigmoid function. The search capability of the developed adaptive weighting PSO (AWPSO) algorithm is comprehensively evaluated via eight well-known benchmark functions including both the unimodal and multimodal cases.

  abstract     = {Synergies have been adopted in prosthetic limb applications to reduce the complexity of design, but typically involve a single synergy setting for a population and ignore individual preference or adaptation capacity. However, personalization of the synergy setting is necessary for the effective operation of the prosthetic device. Two major challenges hinder the personalization of synergies in human-prosthesis interfaces (HPIs). The first is related to the process of human motor adaptation and the second to the variation in motor learning dynamics of individuals. In this paper, a systematic personalization of kinematic synergies for HPIs using online measurements from each individual is proposed. The task of reaching using the upper limb is described by an objective function and the interface is parameterized by a kinematic synergy. Consequently, personalizing the interface for a given individual can be formulated as finding an optimal personalized parameter. A structure to model the observed motor behavior that allows for the personalized traits of motor preference and motor learning is proposed, and subsequently used in an online optimization scheme to identify the synergies for an individual. The knowledge of the common features contained in the model enables online adaptation of the HPI to happen concurrently to human motor adaptation without the need to retune the personalization algorithm for each individual. Human-in-the-loop experimental results with able-bodied subjects, performed in a virtual reality environment to emulate amputation and prosthesis use, show that the proposed personalization algorithm was effective in obtaining optimal synergies with a fast uniform convergence speed across a group of individuals.},

To alleviate this problem, we present an efficient model-free off-policy actor-critic algorithm for robotic skill acquisition and continuous control, by fusing the task reward with a task-oriented guiding reward, which is formulated by leveraging few and imperfect expert demonstrations. In this framework, the agent can explore the environment more intentionally, thus sampling efficiency can be achieved; moreover, the agent can also exploit the experience more effectively, thereby substantially improved performance can be realized simultaneously. The empirical results on robotic locomotion tasks show that the proposed scheme can lower sample complexity by 2-10 times in contrast with the state-of-the-art baseline deep RL (DRL) algorithms, while achieving performance better than that of the expert. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement in both sampling efficiency and asymptotic performance on tasks with sparse and delayed reward, wherein those baseline DRL algorithms struggle to make progress. This takes a substantial step forward to implement these methods to acquire skills autonomously for real robots.},

These methods may be suboptimal since they do not exploit the similarities and differences among different subpopulations and data types. In this article, we propose a joint graphical model to estimate the multiple gene networks simultaneously. Our model decomposes each subpopulation-specific gene network as a sum of common and unique components and imposes a group lasso penalty on gene networks corresponding to different data types. The gene network variations across subpopulations can be learned automatically by the decompositions of networks, and the similarities and differences among data types can be captured by the group lasso penalty. The simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also apply our method to the cancer genome atlas breast cancer datasets to reconstruct subtype-specific gene networks. Hub nodes in the estimated subnetworks unique to individual cancer subtypes rediscover well-known genes associated with breast cancer subtypes and provide interesting predictions.},

In this article, we derive a mechanism to extract label-specific features in local and global levels. We also derive a mechanism to train label-specific classifiers in individual and joint levels. Extracting features globally and training classifiers jointly can be seen as a dual process of learning the mapping function on two domains in a coarse-tuned way, while extracting features locally and training classifiers individually can be seen as a dual process of learning the mapping function on two domains in a fine-tuned way. The two-level feature selection and the two-level classifier training are derived to make the entire mapping learning process robust.

  abstract     = {Gradient-based method has been extensively used in today&#39;s multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). In a gradient-based MARL algorithm, each agent updates its parameterized strategy in the direction of the gradient of some performance index. However, studies on the convergence of the existing gradient-based MARL algorithms for identical interest games are quite few. In this article, we propose a policy gradient potential (PGP) algorithm that takes PGP as the source of information for guiding the strategy update, as opposed to the gradient itself, to learn the optimal joint strategy that has a maximal global reward. Since the payoff matrix and the joint strategy are often unavailable to the learning agents in reality, we consider the probability of obtaining the maximal reward as the performance index. Theoretical analysis of the PGP algorithm on the continuous model involving an identical interest repeated game shows that if the component action of every optimal joint action is unique, the critical points corresponding to all optimal joint actions are asymptotically stable. The PGP algorithm is experimentally studied and compared against other MARL algorithms on two commonly used collaborative tasks-the robots leaving a room task and the distributed sensor network task, as well as a real-world minefield navigation problem where only local state and local reward information are available. The results show that the PGP algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of the cumulative reward and the number of time steps used in an episode.},

  abstract     = {The rising demand for surveillance systems naturally necessitates more efficient and noise robust moving object detection (MOD) systems from the captured video streams. Inspired by the challenges in MOD which are yet to be addressed properly, this paper proposes a new MOD scheme using l 1/2 regularization in the tensor framework. It takes advantage of the special features of tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) along with regularizations using l 1/2 -norm with half thresholding operation and tensor total variation (TTV) to develop a noise robust MOD system with improved detection accuracy. While t -SVD exploits the spatio-temporal correlation of the video background, l 1/2 regularization provides noise robustness besides removing the sparser but discontinuous dynamic elements in the spatio-temporal direction. Moreover, TTV enhances the spatio-temporal continuity and fills up the gaps due to the lingering objects and thereby extracting the foreground precisely. The proposed three-way optimization method is designed to address both static and dynamic background cases of MOD separately with the intention to reduce the misclassifications due to moving/cluttered background. The brilliance of this method is confirmed by the impressive visual quality of the background/foreground separation, noise robustness, reduced computational complexity, and rapid response. The quantitative evaluation discloses the predominance of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art techniques.},

Assume that the jammer can interfere with a subset of channels at each attack time in active period. For an energy-constraint jammer, the problem of how to select the number of channels at each attack time to maximally deteriorate the CPS performance is investigated. Based on the index of average estimation error, we introduce two different attack strategies, which include selecting identical number of channels and unequal number of channels at each attack time, and further show theoretically that the attack effect by selecting unequal number of channels is better than that of selecting identical number of channels. By formulating the problem of selecting the number of channels as integer programming problems, we present the corresponding algorithm to approximate the optimal attack schedule for both cases. The numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

In such systems, state information is quantized and transmitted among agents through digital communication networks which suffer from network-induced delays. In order to save communication resources, we implement a periodic event-triggering scheme, under which agents quantize and transmit their own states when a predefined event is triggered. By introducing a well-designed internal saturation function, the proposed strategy can place a priori bounds on the control inputs of agents and guarantee the asymptotic consensus of agents at a finite bit rate, even under network-induced delays. By extracting extra information from the receive time instants of data packets, our strategy can require less information carried by data packets and a lower bit rate to maintain the desired asymptotic consensus than some state-of-the-art time-triggered consensus strategies. Under our strategy, the obtained bit-rate conditions depend on the network-induced delays, the unstable eigenvalue of agent dynamics, and the network topology. The simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of these bit-rate conditions.},

The core requirement for dealing with such problems is to balance the ability of exploration in the global space and exploitation in the multiple optimal areas. In this paper, based on the differential evolution (DE), we propose a novel algorithm focusing on the formulation, balance, and keypoint of species for MMOPs, called FBK-DE. First, nearest-better clustering (NBC) is used to divide the population into multiple species with minimum size limitations. Second, to avoid placing too many individuals into one species, a species balance strategy is proposed to adjust the size of each species. Third, two keypoint-based mutation operators named DE/keypoint/1 and DE/keypoint/2 are proposed to evolve each species together with traditional mutation operators. The experimental results of FBK-DE on 20 benchmark functions are compared with 15 state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms. The comparisons show that the proposed FBK-DE performs competitively with these algorithms.},

First, several useful linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions are derived to verify the dissipative stability of the T-S fuzzy system and then the controller gains matrices are expressed by resorting the LMI approach with the maximal-allowable upper bound (MAUB) of sampling periods. The proposed LMI conditions can be easily solved by using the MATLAB tool box.

Type-1 and type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models are used to describe the MIMO system, and the relative normalized gain array-based criterion is employed to measure the coupling effects. The main contributions include: 1) compared to the previous studies, a manner with less computational cost to build fuzzy models for the MIMO systems is provided, and a more accurate method to construct the so-called effective T-S fuzzy model (ETSM) to express the coupling effects is developed; 2) for the sparse control strategy, four indexes are defined in order to extend a decentralized control structure to a sparse one. Afterward, an ETSM-based method is presented that a sparse control system can be realized by designing multiple independent single-input single-output (SISO) control loops; and 3) for the decoupling control strategy, a novel and simple ETSM-based decoupling compensator is developed that can effectively compensate for both steady and dynamic coupling effects. As a result, the MIMO controller design can be transformed to multiple noninteracting SISO controller designs. Both of the sparse and decoupling strategies allow to use linear SISO control algorithms to regulate a closely coupled nonlinear MIMO system without knowing its exact mathematical functions. Two examples are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

First, an event-dependent intermittent mechanism is originally designed, which is described by the Lyapunov function and three non-negative real regions. The distinctive feature is that the controller starts to work only when the trajectory of the Lyapunov function goes into the presupposed work region. The proposed method fundamentally changes the principle of the existing intermittent control schemes. Under the proposed framework of the intermittent mechanism, the work/rest time of the controller is aperiodic, unpredictable, and initial value dependent. Second, several succinct sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are developed to achieve the quasisynchronization of the considered DNNs. A simple optimization algorithm is established to compute the control gains and the Lyapunov matrices such that synchronization error is stabilized to the smallest convergence region. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the designed intermittent mechanism.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the tracking control problems of the nonlinear nonstrict-feedback systems are considered. By combining the backstepping technique and bound estimation method, a novel nonlinear adaptive asymptotical control law is proposed, which offsets the effect of the unknown virtual control parameters and the uncertain nonlinearities. Correspondingly, an improved Lyapunov function by introducing the lower bounds of control parameters has been devised in this article. Compared with the existing adaptive tracking control schemes, the controller designed in this article can guarantee that the tracking control error converges to zero asymptotically and all the signals which contain the state variables and the adaptive laws are bounded. Moreover, the asymptotic stability of the system is realized for the first time. Finally, simulation examples are applied to test and prove the availability of the presented methods and the performance of the controlled system.},

  abstract     = {Froth color can be referred to as a direct and instant indicator to the key flotation production index, for example, concentrate grade. However, it is intractable to measure the froth color robustly due to the adverse interference of time-varying and uncontrollable multisource illuminations in the flotation process monitoring. In this article, we proposed an illumination-invariant froth color measuring method by solving a structure-preserved image-to-image color translation task via an introduced Wasserstein distance-based structure-preserving CycleGAN, called WDSPCGAN. WDSPCGAN is comprised of two generative adversarial networks (GANs), which have their own discriminators but share two generators, using an improved U-net-like full convolution network to conduct the spatial structure-preserved color translation. By an adversarial game training of the two GANs, WDSPCGAN can map the color domain of froth images under any illumination to that of the referencing illumination, while maintaining the structure and texture invariance. The proposed method is validated on two public benchmark color constancy datasets and applied to an industrial bauxite flotation process. The experimental results show that WDSPCGAN can achieve illumination-invariant color features of froth images under various unknown lighting conditions while keeping their structures and textures unchanged. In addition, WDSPCGAN can be updated online to ensure its adaptability to any operational conditions. Hence, it has the potential for being popularized to the online monitoring of the flotation concentrate grade.},

  abstract     = {Single-image dehazing has been an important topic given the commonly occurred image degradation caused by adverse atmosphere aerosols. The key to haze removal relies on an accurate estimation of global air-light and the transmission map. Most existing methods estimate these two parameters using separate pipelines which reduces the efficiency and accumulates errors, thus leading to a suboptimal approximation, hurting the model interpretability, and degrading the performance. To address these issues, this article introduces a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) for single-image dehazing. The network consists of a novel compositional generator and a novel deeply supervised discriminator. The compositional generator is a densely connected network, which combines fine-scale and coarse-scale information. Benefiting from the new generator, our method can directly learn the physical parameters from data and recover clean images from hazy ones in an end-to-end manner. The proposed discriminator is deeply supervised, which enforces that the output of the generator to look similar to the clean images from low-level details to high-level structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end generative adversarial model for image dehazing, which simultaneously outputs clean images, transmission maps, and air-lights. Extensive experiments show that our method remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we create the HazeCOCO dataset which is currently the largest dataset for single-image dehazing.},

The model utilizes the additionally captured attribute as the latent variable for a supervised granulation procedure. It was fulfilled for EMG-based pinch-type classification and the fingertip force grand prediction. In the experiments, 16 channels of surface electromyographic signals (i.e., main attribute) and continuous fingertip force (i.e., subattribute) were simultaneously collected while subjects performing eight types of hand pinches. The use of AGrM improved the pinch-type recognition accuracy to around 97.2\% by 1.8\% when constructing eight granules for each grasping type and received more than 90\% force grand prediction accuracy at any granular level greater than six. Further, sensitivity analysis verified its robustness with respect to different channel combination and interferences. In comparison with other clustering-based granulation methods, AGrM achieved comparable pinch recognition accuracy but was of lowest computational cost and highest force grand prediction accuracy.},

For the wireless dropping communication channel, the packet dropout rates depend on both the signal-to-noise ratio and the transmission power used by the sensor. We formulate the problem of the optimal transmission power allocation to minimize the remote estimation error covariances as a Markov decision processes (MDPs) subject to energy constraint of the sensor. By analyzing the MDP algorithm, we show that an optimal deterministic and stationary transmission power policy exists. Moreover, we show that the optimal policy has a threshold-type structure.

  abstract     = {Traditional reproduction operators in many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) seem to not be so effective to tackle many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). This is mainly because the population size cannot be set to an arbitrarily large value if the computational efficiency is of concern. In such a case, the distance between the parents becomes remarkably large and, consequently, it is not easy to reproduce a superior offspring in high-dimensional objective space. To alleviate this problem, an elite gene-guided (EGG) reproduction operator is proposed to tackle MaOPs in this article. In this operator, an elite gene pool is built by collecting the knee points from the current population. Then, the offspring is produced by exchanging the genes with this elite gene pool under an exchange rate, aiming to reserve more promising genes into the next generation. In order to provide new genes for the population, other genes will be disturbed under a disturbance rate. The settings and functional analysis of the exchange rate and disturbance rate are studied using several experiments. The proposed EGG operator is easy to implement and can be embedded to any MaOEA. As examples, we show the embedding of the proposed EGG operator into four competitive MaOEAs, that is, MOEA/D, NSGA-III, $\theta $ -DEA, and SPEA2-SDE provide some advantages over simulated binary crossover, differential evolution, and an evolutionary path-based reproduction operator on solving a number of benchmark problems with 3 to 15 objectives.},

The faults are considered to be “small” in the sense that the system trajectories in the faulty mode always remain close to those in the normal mode, and the magnitude of fault can be smaller than that of the system&#39;s uncertain dynamics. A novel adaptive dynamics learning-based sFD framework is proposed. Specifically, an adaptive dynamics learning approach using radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) is first developed to achieve locally accurate identification of the system uncertain dynamics, where the obtained knowledge can be stored and represented in terms of constant RBF NNs. Based on this, a novel residual system is designed by incorporating a newmechanism of absolute measurement of system dynamics changes induced by small faults. An adaptive threshold is then developed for real-time sFD decision making. Rigorous analysis is performed to derive the detectability condition and the analytical upper bound for sFD time. Simulation studies, including an application to a three-tank benchmark engineering system, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.},

By using the relative threshold event-triggered strategy, the communication resource constraint is availably resolved, while the Zeno behavior can be avoided. In addition, by constructing a series of novel Lyapunov functions, an effective adaptive fuzzy control method is developed. The proposed fuzzy control scheme contains fewer calculations by the operation of addressing the square of the norm of the fuzzy weight vector for the entire MIMO system. It is proved that all of the closed-loop signals are global bounded, and the proposed method is not only capable of guaranteeing output tracking performance but is also available to ensure preserved transient performance.

  abstract     = {Although numerous effective and efficient multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been developed in recent years to search for a well-converged and well-diversified Pareto optimal front, most of these designs are computationally expensive and have to maintain a large population of individuals throughout the evolutionary process. Once the Pareto optimal front is found satisfactorily, the cognitive burden is then imposed upon decision makers to handpick one solution for implementation among a massive number of candidates even with powerful multicriteria decision-making tools. With the increase in the number of decision variables and objective functions in the face of real-world applications, these problems have become a daunting challenge. In this article, we propose a recursive evolutionary algorithm, called EvoKneer, to directly search for global knee solutions, but also multiple local knee solutions using the minimum Manhattan distance approach as opposed to an enormous number of Pareto optimal solutions. Compared with the traditional evolutionary approaches, the proposed design herein only preserves nondominated solutions in rank one in each generation. Boundary Individuals Selection is tailored to select only M2 boundary individuals where M is the number of objectives. Relieving the burden of maintaining a large population size and its diversity throughout a lengthy evolutionary process, this design with a very low computational cost allows the evolutionary algorithm to converge to knee solutions quickly. To facilitate the experimental validations, a simulator with a graphical user interface is developed under the Delphi XE7 platform and made available for public use. In addition, the proposed algorithm is evaluated with the DO2DK, DEB2DK, DEB2DK2, and DEB3DK benchmark functions. The comparison results validate that the proposed EvoKneer algorithm is computationally and efficiently finding all global and local knee solutions.},

Next, based on the time-derivative of an appropriately defined risk metric, we develop a nonlinear state feedback strategy for the evader which provides a feasible solution to the game. This control strategy involves switching between different control laws in different parts of the state-space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed feedback control in terms of the evader&#39;s performance, through numerical simulations. We also show that for the special case of the reach-avoid game with only one pursuer, the proposed control law is successful in guiding the evader to the target location from almost all initial conditions, and ensures that the evader will remain uncaptured.},

  abstract     = {Modeling a real-world system by means of a neural model involves numerous challenges that range from formulating transparent knowledge representations to obtaining reliable simulation errors. However, that knowledge is often difficult to formalize in a precise way using crisp numbers. In this paper, we present the long-term grey cognitive networks which expands the recently proposed long-term cognitive networks (LTCNs) with grey numbers. One advantage of our neural system is that it allows embedding knowledge into the network using weights and constricted neurons. In addition, we propose two procedures to construct the network in situations where only historical data are available, and a regularization method that is coupled with a nonsynaptic backpropagation algorithm. The results have shown that our proposal outperforms the LTCN model and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel nonlocal patch tensor-based visual data completion algorithm and analyze its potential problems. Our algorithm consists of two steps: the first step is initializing the image with triangulation-based linear interpolation and the second step is grouping similar nonlocal patches as a tensor then applying the proposed tensor completion technique. Specifically, with treating a group of patch matrices as a tensor, we impose the low-rank constraint on the tensor through the recently proposed tensor nuclear norm. Moreover, we observe that after the first interpolation step, the image gets blurred and, thus, the similar patches we have found may not exactly match the reference. We name the problem “Patch Mismatch,” and then in order to avoid the error caused by it, we further decompose the patch tensor into a low-rank tensor and a sparse tensor, which means the accepted horizontal strips in mismatched patches. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that the error caused by Patch Mismatch can be decomposed into two components, one of which can be bounded by a reasonable assumption named local patch similarity, and the other part is lower than that using matrix completion. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets verify our method&#39;s superiority to the state-of-the-art tensor-based image inpainting methods.},

Using the special structure of neural networks with global Lipschitz activation function, nonidentical terms are treated as external disturbances, which can then be compensated via robust adaptive control techniques. For the case where no common reference trajectory is given in advance, a distributed adaptive controller is proposed to drive the synchronization error to an adjustable bounded area. For the case where a reference trajectory is predesigned, two distributed adaptive controllers are proposed, respectively, to address the tracking synchronization problem with bounded and unbounded reference trajectories, different decomposition methods are given to extract the heterogeneous characteristics. To avoid the appearance of global information, such as the spectrum of the coupling matrix, corresponding adaptive designs on coupling strengths are also provided for both cases. Moreover, the upper bounds of the final synchronization errors can be gradually adjusted according to the parameters of the adaptive designs. Finally, numerical examples are given to test the effectiveness of the control algorithms.},

The present interconnected systems differ from most of the existing interconnected plants in that their equilibrium points are no longer assumed to be zero. Initially, we establish a theorem to indicate that the decentralized ETC law for the overall system can be represented by an array of optimal ETC laws for nominal subsystems. Then, to obtain these optimal ETC laws, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations arising in the discounted-cost optimal ETC problems of the nominal subsystems. Meanwhile, we only use critic networks to implement the RL-based approach and tune the critic network weight vectors by using the gradient descent method and the concurrent learning technique together. With the proposed weight vectors tuning rule, we are able to not only relax the persistence of the excitation condition but also ensure the critic network weight vectors to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, by utilizing the Lyapunov method, we prove that the obtained decentralized ETC law can force the entire system to be stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness. Finally, we validate the proposed decentralized ETC strategy through simulations of the nonlinear-interconnected systems derived from two inverted pendulums connected via a spring.},

However, DDPG still suffers from data insufficiency and training inefficiency, especially, in computationally complex environments. In this article, we propose asynchronous episodic DDPG (AE-DDPG), as an expansion of DDPG, which can achieve more effective learning with less training time required. First, we design a modified scheme for data collection in an asynchronous fashion. Generally, for asynchronous RL algorithms, sample efficiency or/and training stability diminish as the degree of parallelism increases. We consider this problem from the perspectives of both data generation and data utilization. In detail, we redesign experience replay by introducing the idea of episodic control so that the agent can latch on good trajectories rapidly. In addition, we also inject a new type of noise in action space to enrich the exploration behaviors. Experiments demonstrate that our AE-DDPG achieves higher rewards and requires less time consumption than most popular RL algorithms in learning to run task which has a computationally complex environment. Not limited to the control tasks in the computationally complex environments, AE-DDPG also achieves higher rewards and two-fold to four-fold improvement in sample efficiency on average compared with other variants of DDPG in MuJoCo environments. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of each proposed technique component through abundant ablation study.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a heuristic optimization algorithm generally applied to continuous domains. Binary PSO is a form of PSO applied to binary domains but uses the concepts of velocity and momentum from continuous PSO, which leads to its limited performance. In our previous work, we reformulated momentum as a stickiness property and velocity as a flipping probability to develop sticky binary PSO. The initial design provides a good base, but many key factors need to be investigated. In this article, we propose a new algorithm called dynamic sticky binary PSO by developing a dynamic parameter control strategy based on an investigation of exploration and exploitation in the binary search spaces. The proposed algorithm is compared with four state-of-the-art dynamic binary algorithms on two types of binary problems: 1) knapsack and 2) feature selection. The experimental results on the knapsack datasets show that the new velocity and momentum assist sticky binary PSO in evolving better solutions than the benchmark algorithms. On feature selection, the dynamic strategy takes the advantages of these two newly defined movement concepts to help the proposed algorithm to produce smaller feature subsets with higher classification performance. This is the first time in the binary PSO, the four important concepts, that is, velocity, momentum, exploration, and exploitation, are investigated systematically to capture the properties of the binary search spaces to evolve better solutions for binary problems.},

In this article, we propose a new method, called spatiotemporal-filtering-based channel selection (STECS), to automatically identify a designated number of discriminative channels by leveraging the spatiotemporal information of the EEG data. In STECS, the channel selection problem is cast under the framework of spatiotemporal filter optimization by incorporating a group sparsity constraints, and a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. The performance of STECS is assessed on three motor imagery EEG datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art spatiotemporal filtering algorithms using full EEG channels, STECS yields comparable classification performance with only half of the channels. Moreover, STECS significantly outperforms the existing channel selection methods. These results suggest that this algorithm holds promise for simplifying BCI setups and facilitating practical utility.},

  abstract     = {Multiview learning has been widely studied in various fields and achieved outstanding performances in comparison to many single-view-based approaches. In this paper, a novel multiview learning method based on the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) is proposed. In contrast to existing GPLVM methods which only assume that there are transformations from the latent variable to the multiple observed inputs, our proposed method simultaneously takes a back constraint into account, encoding multiple observations to the latent variable by enjoying the Gaussian process (GP) prior. Particularly, to overcome the difficulty of the covariance matrix calculation in the encoder, a linear projection is designed to map different observations to a consistent subspace first. The obtained variable in this subspace is then projected to the latent variable in the manifold space with the GP prior. Furthermore, different from most GPLVM methods which strongly assume that the covariance matrices follow a certain kernel function, for example, radial basis function (RBF), we introduce a multikernel strategy to design the covariance matrix, being more reasonable and adaptive for the data representation. In order to apply the presented approach to the classification, a discriminative prior is also embedded to the learned latent variables to encourage samples belonging to the same category to be close and those belonging to different categories to be far. Experimental results on three real-world databases substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Establishing correspondence between two given geometrical graph structures is an important problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a robust graph matching (RGM) model to improve the effectiveness and robustness on the matching graphs with deformations, rotations, outliers, and noise. First, we embed the joint geometric transformation into the graph matching model, which performs unary matching over graph nodes and local structure matching over graph edges simultaneously. Then, the L 2,1 -norm is used as the similarity metric in the presented RGM to enhance the robustness. Finally, we derive an objective function which can be solved by an effective optimization algorithm, and theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on various graph matching tasks, such as outliers, rotations, and deformations show that the proposed RGM model achieves competitive performance compared to the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {High-utility sequential pattern (HUSP) mining is an emerging topic in the field of knowledge discovery in databases. It consists of discovering subsequences that have a high utility (importance) in sequences, which can be referred to as HUSPs. HUSPs can be applied to many real-life applications, such as market basket analysis, e-commerce recommendations, click-stream analysis, and route planning. Several algorithms have been proposed to efficiently mine utility-based useful sequential patterns. However, due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space for low utility threshold and large-scale data, the performances of these algorithms are unsatisfactory in terms of runtime and memory usage. Hence, this article proposes an efficient algorithm for the task of HUSP mining, called HUSP mining with UL-list (HUSP-ULL). It utilizes a lexicographic q-sequence (LQS)-tree and a utility-linked (UL)-list structure to quickly discover HUSPs. Furthermore, two pruning strategies are introduced in HUSP-ULL to obtain tight upper bounds on the utility of the candidate sequences and reduce the search space by pruning unpromising candidates early. Substantial experiments on both real-life and synthetic datasets showed that HUSP-ULL can effectively and efficiently discover the complete set of HUSPs and that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Face restoration from low resolution and noise is important for applications of face analysis recognition. However, most existing face restoration models omit the multiple scale issues in the face restoration problem, which is still not well solved in the research area. In this paper, we propose a sequential gating ensemble network (SGEN) for a multiscale noise robust face restoration issue. To endow the network with multiscale representation ability, we first employ the principle of ensemble learning for SGEN network architecture design. The SGEN aggregates multilevel base-encoders and base-decoders into the network, which enables the network to contain multiple scales of receptive field. Instead of combining these base-en/decoders directly with nonsequential operations, the SGEN takes base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential data. Specifically, it is visualized that SGEN learns to sequentially extract high-level information from base-encoders in a bottom-up manner and restore low-level information from base-decoders in a top-down manner. Besides, we propose realizing bottom-up and top-down information combination and selection with a sequential gating unit (SGU). The SGU sequentially takes information from two different levels as inputs and decides the output based on one active input. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our SGEN is more effective at multiscale human face restoration with more image details and less noise than state-of-the-art image restoration models. Further utilizing an adversarial training scheme, SGEN also produces more visually preferred results than other models under subjective evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Tissue P systems with promoters provide nondeterministic parallel bioinspired devices that evolve by the interchange of objects between regions, determined by the existence of some special objects called promoters. However, in cellular biology, the movement of molecules across a membrane is transported from high to low concentration. Inspired by this biological fact, in this article, an interesting type of tissue P systems, called monodirectional tissue P systems with promoters, where communication happens between two regions only in one direction, is considered. Results show that finite sets of numbers are produced by such P systems with one cell, using any length of symport rules or with any number of cells, using a maximal length 1 of symport rules, and working in the maximally parallel mode. Monodirectional tissue P systems are Turing universal with two cells, a maximal length 2, and at most one promoter for each symport rule, and working in the maximally parallel mode or with three cells, a maximal length 1, and at most one promoter for each symport rule, and working in the flat maximally parallel mode. We also prove that monodirectional tissue P systems with two cells, a maximal length 1, and at most one promoter for each symport rule (under certain restrictive conditions) working in the flat maximally parallel mode characterizes regular sets of natural numbers. Besides, the computational efficiency of monodirectional tissue P systems with promoters is analyzed when cell division rules are incorporated. Different uniform solutions to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT problem) are provided. These results show that with the restrictive condition of “monodirectionality,” monodirectional tissue P systems with promoters are still computationally powerful. With the powerful computational power, developing membrane algorithms for monodirectional tissue P systems with promoters is potentially exploitable.},

Using the Lyapunov method, the properties of $M$ -matrix, and some inequalities, the sufficient criteria of synchronous control are derived. The results can be used in the analysis of other multiagent nonlinear systems. A norm-based threshold function is given to determine the update time of the controller, and it is proved that the trigger condition excludes the Zeno behavior. Subject to parameter mismatch, a quasisynchronous control strategy is proposed, which can be extended to complete synchronization provided that the system mismatch or disturbance disappears. It is worth mentioning that this article introduces the signal function into the controller, so that the theoretical error can be limited to an arbitrarily small range. Furthermore, this new controller is used in the PETC strategy which automatically avoids the Zeno behavior. Finally, one example is given to illustrate our results.},

In our scheme, the proposed network plays the role of a dealer and treats the secret-sharing process as a classification issue. The key idea is to view the secret as an image during the secret-sharing process. If the user&#39;s private key is text, we can covert the key text into an image called the original image. Specifically, we first divide the original image into original subimages by the image segmentation. Next, we encode each original subimage by DNA coding. Finally, we train the proposed network to find the key secret-sharing results. Our proposed scheme is not only a significant extension of the GANs but also a new direction for the key secret-sharing technology.

A BCN is a Boolean network with Boolean control inputs in it. When the given BCNs cannot realize stabilization under existing Boolean control inputs, pinning control strategy is introduced to make the BCNs achieve stabilization. The Warshall algorithm is introduced to verify the stabilizability of BCNs, then novel computational feasible algorithms are developed to design the minimum number pinning controller for the system. By using our method, the minimum set of pinned nodes can be found with relatively low computational complexity. Finally, the theoretical result is validated using a biological example.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) as a class of randomized learner model have been successfully employed in data analytics due to its universal approximation capability and fast modeling property. The technical essence lies in stochastically configuring the hidden nodes (or basis functions) based on a supervisory mechanism rather than data-independent randomization as usually adopted for building randomized neural networks. Given image data modeling tasks, the use of 1-D SCNs potentially demolishes the spatial information of images, and may result in undesirable performance. This paper extends the original SCNs to a 2-D version, called 2DSCNs, for fast building randomized learners with matrix inputs. Some theoretical analysis on the goodness of 2DSCNs against SCNs, including the complexity of the random parameter space and the superiority of generalization, are presented. Empirical results over one regression example, four benchmark handwritten digit classification tasks, two human face recognition datasets, as well as one natural image database, demonstrate that the proposed 2DSCNs perform favorably and show good potential for image data analytics.},

In this paper, we propose a geometric low-rank Laplacian regularized semisupervised classifier, by exploring both the global spectral geometric structure and local spatial geometric structure of hyperspectral data. A new geometric regularized Laplacian low-rank representation (GLapLRR)-based graph is developed to evaluate spectral-spatial affinity of mixed pixels. By revealing the global low-rank and local spatial structure of images via GLapLRR, the constructed graph has the characteristics of spatial-spectral geometry description, robustness, and low sparsity, from which a more accurate classification of mixed pixels can be achieved. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on three real hyperspectral datasets, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts, when only a small number of labeled instances are available.},

  abstract     = {How to track the attention of the pilot is a huge challenge. We are able to capture the pupil status of the pilot and analyze their anomalies and judge the attention of the pilot. This paper proposes a new approach to solve this problem through the integration of spherical Haar wavelet transform and deep learning methods. First, considering the application limitations of Haar wavelet and other wavelets in spherical signal decomposition and reconstruction, a feature learning method based on the spherical Haar wavelet is proposed. In order to obtain the salient features of the spherical signal, a rotating spherical Haar wavelet is also proposed, which has a consistent scale in the same direction between the reconstructed image and the original image. Second, in order to find a better characteristic representation of the spherical signal, a higher contractive autoencoder (HCAE) is designed for the potential representation of the spherical Haar wavelet coefficients, which has two penalty items, respectively, from Jacobian and two order items from Taylor expansion of the point ${x}$ for the contract learning of sample space. Third, in order to improve the classification performance, this paper proposes a fuzzy Gaussian support vector machine (FGSVM) as the top classification tool of the deep learning model, which can punish some Gaussian noise from the output of the deep HCAE network (DHCAEN). Finally, a DHCAEN-FGSVM classifier is proposed to identify the location of the pupil center. The experimental results of the public data set and actual data show that our model is an effective method for spherical signal detection.},

We design the opinion sifting strategies which are purely distributed and provide resilience to a range of adversarial environment involving locally and globally bounded threats as well as malicious and Byzantine individuals. We establish the sufficient and necessary graph-theoretic criteria for normal individuals to attain opinion consensus in both directed-fixed and time-varying networks. Two classes of opinion clustering problems are introduced as an extension. By designing the resilient opinion separation algorithms, we develop necessary and sufficient criteria, which characterize the resilient opinion clustering in terms of the ratio of opinions as well as the difference of opinions.

The criterion ensuring the mean-square exponential stability of the fuzzy filtering error system is further formed based on similar procedures.

Considering that the information required for decision-making and people&#39;s cognition processes is becoming more and more complex, double hierarchy linguistic preference relation (DHLPR) can be used to express complex linguistic information reasonably and intuitively. Sometimes experts in LSGDM unwillingly modify their preferences or even modify them on purpose in a contrary way to the other experts. Thus, differing opinions or minority preferences are often referred to as obstacles to decision-making. This article develops a consensus model to manage minority opinions and noncooperative behaviors in LSGDM with DHLPRs. In addition, to establish the consensus model, some basic tools, such as the clustering method, weights-determining method, and adjustment coefficients-determining method, are developed. Finally, a practical LSGDM problem is set up to prove that the proposed consensus model is feasible and effective, and some comparative analyses are made to highlight the advantages of these methods and models, as well as to analyze current deficiencies.},

And the main designs in these two layers are two event-triggered mechanisms, where one mechanism is used to improve the voltage and frequency stability of MG considering the packet loss problem, the other is used to reduce the communication burden in the control process. More specifically, the control process of the first mechanism can be understood as we use these event-triggered mechanisms to complete the secondary control in the physical layer based on the information in the cyber layer. In this mechanism, the packet loss situation in one communication channel is divided into three categories: 1) to handle the case where the loss rate is small, an adaptive virtual leader-following consensus controller (AVLFCC) is proposed in the cyber layer; 2) to handle the case where the loss rate is large and the forecasted data can be used, a hybrid forecast supplement method (HFSM) is proposed in the physical layer; and 3) to handle the case where the loss rate is large and the forecasted data cannot be used, a path reconstruction method combined with a novel sliding-mode control (SMC) is proposed in the cyber layer. In the second mechanism, an event-triggered protocol is designed for the consensus controller to reduce the communication burden based on the designs in 1)-3). Finally, based on these designs in the two mechanisms, a novel secondary controller is designed. And the experimental results have confirmed the validity of the contributed strategy.},

In this paper, we tackle the problem for a single-master multislave (SMMS) teleoperation system by assuming an asymmetric and semi-Markovian jump protocol for communication of the slaves with the master under time-varying transition rates. A nonlinear robust controller is designed for the system that guarantees its global robust ${H_{\infty}} $ stochastic stability in the sense of the Lyapunov theory. Employing the nonlinear feedback linearization technique, the dynamics of the closed-loop teleoperator is decoupled into two interconnected subsystems: 1) master-slave tracking dynamics (coordination) and 2) multislave synchronization dynamics. Employing an improved reciprocally convex combination technique, the stability analysis of the closed-loop teleoperator is conducted using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii methodology, and the stability conditions are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities that can be solved efficiently using numerical algorithms. Numerical studies and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design algorithm in both tracking and synchronization performance of the SMMS system, and robustly handling the stochastic and nondifferentiable nature of communication delays.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with an irreversible and progressive process. To understand the brain functions and identify the biomarkers of AD and early stages of the disease [also known as, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)], it is crucial to build the brain functional connectivity network (BFCN) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Existing methods have been mainly developed using only a single time-point rs-fMRI data for classification. In fact, multiple time-point data is more effective than a single time-point data in diagnosing brain diseases by monitoring the disease progression patterns using longitudinal analysis. In this article, we utilize multiple rs-fMRI time-point to identify early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI), by integrating the fused sparse network (FSN) model with parameter-free centralized (PFC) learning. Specifically, we first construct the FSN framework by building multiple time-point BFCNs. The multitask learning via PFC is then leveraged for longitudinal analysis of EMCI and LMCI. Accordingly, we can jointly learn the multiple time-point features constructed from the BFCN model. The proposed PFC method can automatically balance the contributions of different time-point information via learned specific and common features. Finally, the selected multiple time-point features are fused by a similarity network fusion (SNF) method. Our proposed method is evaluated on the public AD neuroimaging initiative phase-2 (ADNI-2) database. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve quite promising performance and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

A cooperative protocol is proposed to achieve this objective and, additionally, generalizes the circumnavigation problem of unicycle vehicles around a target (moving and stationary). Due to the nonholonomic constraints, existing protocols cannot be extended directly to achieve this objective. Thus, the proposed algorithm is worked out from the desired geometry to achieve the objective. A fixed-time consensus estimator is designed under a cyclic digraph to arrive at the desired interagent angular separation in the target-centric frame. The target information and desired formation parameters are assumed to be known to only one agent partially. Due to uncertainty in the target&#39;s motion, it is assumed that the target&#39;s acceleration and angular velocity are unknown. Fixed-time estimators under a digraph address the lack of information. The tracking controller drives the agents to the desired position around the target, thus making the errors go to zero instead of any finite bounds. The controller guarantees the bounded control effort irrespective of the error magnitude. The numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a fuzzy adaptive two-bit-triggered control for uncertain nonlinear systems with actuator failures and dead-zone constraint. Actuator failures and dead-zone constraint exist frequently in practical systems, which will affect the system performance greatly. Based on the improved fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs), a fuzzy adaptive compensation control is established to address these issues. The approximation error is introduced to the control design as a time-varying function. In addition, for the limited transmission resources of the practical system, a two-bit-triggered control mechanism is proposed to further save system transmission resources. It is proved that the proposed method can guarantee the system tracking performance and all the signals are bounded. Its effectiveness is verified by the simulation examples.},

The contributions of this article are two-fold: 1) the bearing-rigid theory is extended to solve the nonlinear robotic systems with the Euler-Lagrange-like model and 2) a novel almost global stable distributed bearing-only formation control law is proposed for the nonlinear robotic systems. Specifically, the robotic systems subject to nonholonomic constraints and dynamics are first transformed into a Euler-Lagrange-like model. By exploring the bearing-rigid graph theory, a backstepping approach is used to design the distributed formation controller. Simulations for 3-D robotics are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.

To deal with this problem, a self-adaptive collaborative control (SCC) mode is proposed for smart production-logistics systems to enhance the capability of intelligence, flexibility, and resilience. By leveraging cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), real-time status data are collected and processed to perform decision making and optimization. Hybrid automata is used to model the dynamic behavior of physical manufacturing resources, such as machines and vehicles in shop floors. Three levels of collaborative control granularity, including nodal SCC, local SCC, and global SCC, are introduced to address different degrees of exceptions. Collaborative optimization problems are solved using analytical target cascading (ATC). A proof of concept simulation based on a Chinese aero-engine manufacturer validates the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method, showing reductions in waiting time, makespan, and energy consumption with reasonable computational time. This article potentially enables manufacturers to implement CPS and IIoT in manufacturing environments and build up smart, flexible, and resilient production-logistics systems.},

  abstract     = {Finding the optimal signal timing strategy is a difficult task for the problem of large-scale traffic signal control (TSC). Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a promising method to solve this problem. However, there is still room for improvement in extending to large-scale problems and modeling the behaviors of other agents for each individual agent. In this article, a new MARL, called cooperative double Q-learning (Co-DQL), is proposed, which has several prominent features. It uses a highly scalable independent double Q-learning method based on double estimators and the upper confidence bound (UCB) policy, which can eliminate the over-estimation problem existing in traditional independent Q-learning while ensuring exploration. It uses mean-field approximation to model the interaction among agents, thereby making agents learn a better cooperative strategy. In order to improve the stability and robustness of the learning process, we introduce a new reward allocation mechanism and a local state sharing method. In addition, we analyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Co-DQL is applied to TSC and tested on various traffic flow scenarios of TSC simulators. The results show that Co-DQL outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized MARL algorithms in terms of multiple traffic metrics.},

Different from the existing researches on MASs with a fixed topological graph, the changes of communication topologies caused by DoS attacks are considered for MASs. Besides, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted for mitigating a load of network bandwidth by scheduling the transmission of sampled data. Then, an event-based consensus control protocol is first developed for MASs subjected to multiple cyber attacks. In view of this, by using the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the mean-square exponential consensus of MASs. Furthermore, the event-based controller gain is derived by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is simulated for confirming the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world networks, the structural connections of networks and the attributes about each node are always available. We typically call such graphs attributed networks, in which attributes always play the same important role in community detection as the topological structure. It is shown that the very existence of overlapping communities is one of the most important characteristics of various complex networks, while the majority of the existing community detection methods was designed for detecting separated communities in attributed networks. Therefore, it is quite challenging to detect meaningful overlapping structures with the combination of node attributes and topological structures. Therefore, in this article, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on the similarity attribute for overlapping community detection in attributed networks (MOEA-SA$_{OV}$ ). In MOEA-SA$_{OV}$ , a modified extended modularity $EQ_{OV}$ , dealing with both directed and undirected networks, is well designed as the first objective. Another objective employed is the attribute similarity $S_{A}$ . Then, a novel encoding and decoding strategy is designed to realize the goal of representing overlapping communities efficiently. MOEA-SA$_{OV}$ runs under the framework of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and can automatically determine the number of communities. In the experiments, the performance of MOEA-SA$_{OV}$ is validated on both synthetic and real-world networks, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively find Pareto fronts about overlapping community structures with practical significance in both directed and undirected attributed networks.},

However, the majority of existing CNN-based models maintain high performance with massive parameters and exceedingly deeper structures. Moreover, several algorithms essentially have underused the low-level features, thus causing relatively low performance. In this article, we address these problems by exploring two strategies based on novel local wider residual blocks (LWRBs) to effectively extract the image features for SISR. We propose a cascading residual network (CRN) that contains several locally sharing groups (LSGs), in which the cascading mechanism not only promotes the propagation of features and the gradient but also eases the model training. Besides, we present another enhanced residual network (ERN) for image resolution enhancement. ERN employs a dual global pathway structure that incorporates nonlocal operations to catch long-distance spatial features from the the original low-resolution (LR) input. To obtain the feature representation of the input at different scales, we further introduce a multiscale block (MSB) to directly detect low-level features from the LR image. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our models outperform most of the advanced methods while still retaining a reasonable number of parameters.},

The presence of the incomplete settings generally disables the conventional multiview clustering methods. In this article, we propose a simple but effective incomplete multiview clustering (IMC) framework, which simultaneously considers the local geometric information and the unbalanced discriminating powers of these incomplete multiview observations. Specifically, a novel graph-regularized matrix factorization model, on the one hand, is developed to preserve the local geometric similarities of the learned common representations from different views. On the other hand, the semantic consistency constraint is introduced to stimulate these view-specific representations toward a unified discriminative representation. Moreover, the importance of different views is adaptively determined to reduce the negative influence of the unbalanced incomplete views. Furthermore, an efficient learning algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Extensive experimental results performed on several incomplete multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior clustering performance in comparison with some state-of-the-art multiview learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Salient object detection from RGB-D images is an important yet challenging vision task, which aims at detecting the most distinctive objects in a scene by combining color information and depth constraints. Unlike prior fusion manners, we propose an attention steered interweave fusion network (ASIF-Net) to detect salient objects, which progressively integrates cross-modal and cross-level complementarity from the RGB image and corresponding depth map via steering of an attention mechanism. Specifically, the complementary features from RGB-D images are jointly extracted and hierarchically fused in a dense and interweaved manner. Such a manner breaks down the barriers of inconsistency existing in the cross-modal data and also sufficiently captures the complementarity. Meanwhile, an attention mechanism is introduced to locate the potential salient regions in an attention-weighted fashion, which advances in highlighting the salient objects and suppressing the cluttered background regions. Instead of focusing only on pixelwise saliency, we also ensure that the detected salient objects have the objectness characteristics (e.g., complete structure and sharp boundary) by incorporating the adversarial learning that provides a global semantic constraint for RGB-D salient object detection. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against 17 state-of-the-art saliency detectors on four publicly available RGB-D salient object detection datasets. The code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/Li-Chongyi/ASIF-Net.},

Then inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (IADMMs) is proposed and convergence property is theoretically established. Based on the degree distribution, an extension method named degree-based IADMM (D-IADMM) is proposed such that key nodes are pinpointed. In addition, with the technique of local optimization employed on the results of D-IADMM, we also develop LD-IADMM and the performance is greatly improved. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated on different networks ranging from Erdös-Rényi networks and scale-free networks to some real-life networks.},

  abstract     = {Benefitting from the advances in sensor nets, wireless communication, and embedded systems, the cyber-physical system (CPS) has been implemented in many practical areas. The cyber world and the physical world in CPS are closely linked and merged, guaranteeing the reliable and efficient performance of the physical world. The service-oriented CPS has been the hot research and development. In this paper, we present a novel velocity-profile prediction method based on the specific CPS architecture. Three main efforts have been made. First, a CPS architecture which is appropriate for velocity-profile prediction is built. Second, the hybrid velocity-profile prediction (HVPP) method is developed based on the exclusive CPS architecture. The HVPP method accomplishes the velocity-profile prediction by cooperatively employing different control units in CPS. Third, a case study in a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is performed to evaluate the effect of CPS-based service in the real application. Results of the case study demonstrate that the HVPP method can improve the fuel economy of PHEV significantly.},

  abstract     = {The group consensus problem for fractional-order multiagent systems is investigated in this paper. With the help of double-tree-form transformations, the group consensus problem of fractional-order multiagent systems is proved to be equivalent to the asymptotical stability problem of reduced-order error systems. A class of distributed control protocols and some simple LMI sufficient conditions as well as necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed in this paper to solve the group consensus problem for fractional multiagent systems. Moreover, pinning control strategy has been taken into consideration. It is shown that the system converges more rapidly when the designed pinning protocols are adopted. In addition, the case of fractional system with switching topologies is also discussed and some corresponding sufficient conditions are obtained. Finally, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the relative-position-based reference-frame-free formation control in the plane for discretetime multiagent systems under both measurement and communication noises. To achieve the desired formation, a robust distributed orientation estimate algorithm and a robust distributed formation control law are designed. The main idea of our method is to use the historical measurement information to get unbiased estimates and use the stochastic approximation method to inhibit the noise. Under mild assumptions on the measurement/communication noises and agents&#39; initial orientation angles, we show that a common reference frame can be asymptotically shared by all agents and the desired formation can be asymptotically stabilized almost surely under the designed distributed control law, if and only if the magnitude of the bearing measurement noise is less than (π/4), the communication and distance sensing topology is rooted and the corresponding bearing sensing topology is connected. Simulations are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of our orientation estimate algorithm and formation control law.},

  abstract     = {We propose a fast online video pose estimation method to detect and track human upper-body poses based on a conditional dynamic Bayesian modeling of pose modes without referring to future frames. The estimation of human body poses from videos is an important task with many applications. Our method extends fast image-based pose estimation to live video streams by leveraging the temporal correlation of articulated poses between frames. Video pose estimation is inferred over a time window using a conditional dynamic Bayesian network (CDBN), which we term time-windowed CDBN. Specifically, latent pose modes and their transitions are modeled and co-determined from the combination of three modules: 1) inference based on current observations; 2) the modeling of mode-to-mode transitions as a probabilistic prior; and 3) the modeling of state-to-mode transitions using a multimode softmax regression. Given the predicted pose modes, the body poses in terms of arm joint locations can then be determined more accurately and robustly. Our method is suitable to investigate high frame rate (HFR) scenarios, where pose mode transitions can effectively capture action-related temporal information to boost performance. We evaluate our method on a newly collected HFR-Pose dataset and four major video pose datasets (VideoPose2, TUM Kitchen, FLIC, and Penn_Action). Our method achieves improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over existing online video pose estimation methods.},
