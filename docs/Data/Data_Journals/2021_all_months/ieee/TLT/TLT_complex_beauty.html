  abstract     = {Augmented reality (AR) for learning is a relevant topic that has recently received considerable attention. However, the current literature lacks a survey of AR-based educational approaches and experiences in the specific field of engineering studies. Five research questions were addressed: RQ1) engineering studies where AR is used; RQ2) types of educational activities where AR is used; RQ3) evaluation of its impact on students and instructors; RQ4) relevant characteristics of AR apps; and RQ5) their degree of interactivity. Regarding RQ1, it is concluded that AR has been mainly used in technical drawing, electronics, and construction. Concerning RQ2, AR apps have assisted in lectures, exercise classes, and laboratories. However, the preferred educational activity varies for each discipline. Regarding RQ3, it has been found that AR apps have been evaluated with respect to students’ or instructors’ perceptions and students’ academic performance. In general, the perceptions are positive, but students criticize some technical elements. Moreover, academic performance is increased in most studies. Finally, regarding RQ4 and RQ5, AR apps do not achieve the highest levels of functional characteristics and have low degrees of interactivity. The systematic review indicates that there is plenty of room for the future use of AR in engineering studies, but each engineering area must identify adequate educational purposes. It is also recommended to assess apps through objective measures, more structured constructs, and validated scales. Finally, higher functional characteristics and interactivity should be encouraged to exploit the full potential of AR.},

  abstract     = {Social presence is an essential construct of the well-known Community of Inquiry (CoI) model, which is created to support design, facilitation, and analysis of asynchronous online discussions. Social presence focuses on the extent to which participants of online discussions can see each other as “real persons” in computer-mediated communication. In the CoI model, social presence is looked at through the affective, interactive, and cohesive categories. Previous research has obtained good results in the automatic identification of these three categories in the analysis of transcripts of asynchronous online discussions using the random forest algorithms benefiting from traditional text mining features in combination with structural features such as Coh-Metrix and linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC). In this context, this study evaluated the performance of the state-of-the-art decision tree algorithms and the deep learning linguistic model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for automatic detection of social presence in online discussions. The results revealed that eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) outperformed the traditional random forest classifier that was commonly used in the previous works on automatic analysis of social presence reaching 0.38, 0.79, and 0.94 for the affective, interactive, and cohesive categories, respectively. Moreover, the proposed classifiers also reached better result when compared to BERT. Finally, this study explored a broad range of features used in the automatic classification of online discussion messages according to the categories of social presence. The results showed the importance of the features provided by the well-known linguistic framework LIWC and features calculated by techniques, such as social network analysis and sentiment analysis, that had never been reported previously in the literature for the automatic detection of social presence.},

  abstract     = {Sustainability science has been gaining traction within academic research and teaching over the past few decades, and it is now entering a phase of greater maturity as a discipline, with links to sectors beyond the academy including energy, finance, advocacy, development, design, construction, agriculture, and healthcare. Concurrently, the growth of the internet has spurred innovation in platform development. This convergence has generated technology-enabled opportunities for training sustainability scholars and practitioners grounded in active learning pedagogies. Case studies are one active learning strategy becoming established within the fields of environment and sustainability. However, the traditional case study form and mode of delivery, which excel at a retroactive analysis of strategic decision-making and outcomes, can create challenges for teaching about issues involving emergent technologies and rapidly changing scientific and social dimensions. This article describes one novel platform, called Gala, for teaching and learning about sustainability science through case studies that address these challenges. Gala closely integrates text and multimedia components, is easily updated, and embraces content consumers as content creators and vice versa. We also report here the results of one pilot study that investigated differences between graduate and undergraduate student interactions with different case components. Results indicate that both groups heavily used the case narrative, but varied in their use of multimedia components. Such insights into patterns of case use are informing decisions about improvements to Gala and directions for future case production, teaching, and assessment, in order to create better tools for teaching and learning about sustainability.},

Traditional AES typically relies on handcrafted features, whereas recent studies have proposed AES models based on deep neural networks to obviate the need for feature engineering. Those AES models generally require training on a large dataset of graded essays. However, assigned grades in such a training dataset are known to be biased owing to effects of rater characteristics when grading is conducted by assigning a few raters in a rater set to each essay. Performance of AES models drops when such biased data are used for model training. Researchers in the fields of educational and psychological measurement have recently proposed item response theory (IRT) models that can estimate essay scores while considering effects of rater biases. This study, therefore, proposes a new method that trains AES models using IRT-based scores for dealing with rater bias within training data.},

Virtual reality (VR) has been widely used in the training of athletes to strengthen their ability to make optimal decisions by creating controllable repeatable training scenarios. In this article, an action-aware offensive decision-making training system for basketball using VR and artificial intelligence is proposed. The proposed system is composed of different virtual defensive scenarios and an offensive action recognition framework. Trainees wearing head-mounted display and a motion capture suit are trained by intuitively interacting with the VR system and receive decision suggestions when a bad one is made. This study changes the training media and methods to create an immersive training environment during the training phase and evaluates the training effectiveness. These training scenarios are a conventional tactics board, the proposed VR system with a prerecorded $360^\circ$ panorama video, and the VR system with computer-simulated virtual content. Results indicate that the training scenario affects the training in terms of decision time.},

In this article, we make the journey from defining a formal measure of creativity, that is, efficiently computable to applying the measure in a practical domain. The measure is general and relies on core theoretical concepts in creativity theory, namely fluency, flexibility, and originality, integrating with prior cognitive science literature. We adapted the general measure for projects in the popular visual programming language Scratch. We designed a machine learning model for predicting the creativity of Scratch projects, trained and evaluated on human expert creativity assessments in an extensive user study. Our results show that opinions about creativity in Scratch varied widely across experts. The automatic creativity assessment aligned with the assessment of the human experts more than the experts agreed with each other. This is a first step in providing computational models for measuring creativity that can be applied to educational technologies, and to scale up the benefit of creativity education in schools.},

A recent review of the literature highlights that the study of these connections has been mainly unidirectional, focusing on how formative assessment helps students to self-regulate their learning, being much less explored the effect of self-regulated learning strategies on formative assessment. In this context, analyzing automatically captured students&amp;#x2019; activities within online learning tools can provide us further insights on the interactions between these two topics. More specifically, this article examines the activity traces of 382 students who used an online tool to learn a programming language. The tool incorporates review exercises for promoting self-assessment (an important self-regulated learning strategy). Furthermore, the tool is used in supervised laboratories where students receive formative assessment. This study uses process mining techniques to analyze the temporal component of student behavior in both types of activities, their interaction, and how self-assessment relates to formative assessment. Some key lessons are learned: 1) activities promoting self-assessment significantly improved students&amp;#x2019; involvement in formative assessment activities; and 2) increasing self-assessment cannot compensate for a lack of effort in formative assessment. We also underline that, to the best of our knowledge, to date no research has used process mining to consider the time component in the analysis of the relationships between formative assessment and self-assessment.},

  abstract     = {Research on the use of modeling and mapping tools in curriculum management is thriving, often focusing on the perspectives of the faculty alone. However, scholarly works that also incorporate the students’ curriculum concerns are rare. A recurring theme in students’ curriculum concerns is the perceived overlap among courses, usually expressed at the level of common concepts across courses. This common “concept” emphasis imposes a challenge for modelers, who often focus on the course-level comparisons because they usually lack tools with subcourse (concept)-level granularity. This article investigates how to model and represent curriculum information to help in reconciling the gap between instructors’ and students’ views of cross-course overlap. The proposed approach involves the design and development of a digital environment to model a curriculum via linked data through an ontology representing concept-level granularity, offer instructors aid in populating course content, and facilitate the visualization and manipulation of data. The visualization tools are designed to offer functions for perceived common concept overlap identification and rectification. This digital environment was deployed and evaluated in the context of a curriculum review process, in which 25 course instructors employed the visualization tools to address a perceived course overlap problem. The preliminary results demonstrate, first, the usefulness of the approach in reconciling the views of instructors and students regarding perceived course overlap. Second, the results highlight that the approach contributes to transforming course overlap from a fuzzy notion to a more concrete and actionable construct defined as either repetition or reinforcement .},

  abstract     = {This article provides computational and rule-based approaches for detecting confusion that is expressed in students&amp;#x0027; comments in couse forums. To obtain reliable, ground truth data about which posts exhibit student confusion, we designed a decision tree that facilitates the manual labeling of forum posts by experts. However, manual labeling is costly in time and resources, which limits the amount of data that can be generated using this process. Our strategy for overcoming these limitations was to generate rules for detecting confusion based on student input via hashtags, which reflect the student&#39;s affective states. We show that the resulting rules closely align with the ground truth judgement of experts. We next applied these rules to datasets of students&amp;#x0027; forum posts in a large-scale biology course, thereby automatically generating thousands of labeled instances of &amp;#x201C;confused posts.&amp;#x201D; Finally, the resulting dataset was used to train a machine learning model for detecting whether students&amp;#x0027; posts exhibit confusion in the absence of hashtags. In this task, the pretrained language model based on bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) was able to outperform traditional machine learning models for classifying confusion in posts. This model was also able to generalize and detect student confusion across different offerings of the same course. Ultimately, the use of pretrained language models of this type will provide teachers with better technologies for detecting and alleviating confusion in online discussion forums by leveraging the combined input of teachers and students.},

  abstract     = {The use of conversational agents in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has been identified as a useful tactic for motivational intervention. The purpose of the current study was to design and implement a conversational agent called a motivational online conversational agent (MOCA) that incorporated motivational interviewing (MI) and was based on an intelligent dialog engine to enhance learner engagement in CSCL. Additionally, the study empirically examined the effects of MOCA on promoting positive changes in collaborative learning engagement through multiturn conversation interventions. A prototype system was developed by combining MOCA and an immersive virtual world, and an effectiveness study was conducted with 40 volunteers. A series of multilevel growth models based on the framework of the hierarchical linear model was established through multiwave longitudinal data. The results indicated that the use of MOCA significantly improved student engagement scores (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and that female students performed better on collaborative tasks than male students (p &amp;lt; 0.05, t &amp;#x003D; 2.97). Additionally, time was an important predictor and significantly interacted with the MOCA-use condition. The study has implications for the design and assessment of conversational agents embodied in virtual reality.},

  abstract     = {Developing effective assessments is a critical component of quality instruction. Assessments are effective when they are well-aligned with the learning outcomes, can confirm that all intended learning outcomes are attained, and their obtained grades are accurately reflecting the level of student achievement. Developing effective assessments is not easy, especially when considering the large number of assessments that instructors are required to develop each semester. To facilitate the process of developing effective assessments, this article introduces a novel tool called &amp;#x201C;LOsMonitor.&amp;#x201D; The tool utilizes machine learning and text mining to classify the cognitive level of assessment questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom&amp;#x0027;s revised taxonomy. It uses the classification results to show statistics and charts that could allow management and instructors to judge the quality of assessment questions and monitor the cognitive levels at which the students are being assessed. The classification performance of LOsMonitor was evaluated in terms of accuracy, recall, and precision. A focus group was also used to assess the usability and usefulness of LOsMonitor. Besides, a case study was conducted to test how the tool would perform in a real-world scenario. The evaluation results indicate that LOsMonitor can be very helpful in developing effective assessments. It was able to discover and report various issues in assessments that instructors did not notice. Instructors who participated in the focus group reported that LOsMonitor would facilitate their quality assurance work and help them to ensure better alignment between assessments and learning outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive learning technology solutions often use a learner model to trace learning and make pedagogical decisions. The present research introduces a formalized methodology for specifying learner models, logistic knowledge tracing (LKT), that consolidates many extant learner modeling methods. The strength of LKT is the specification of a symbolic notation system for alternative logistic regression models that is powerful enough to specify many extant models in the literature and many new models. To demonstrate the generality of LKT, we fit 12 models, some variants of well-known models and some newly devised, to six learning technology datasets. The results indicated that no single learner model was best in all cases, further justifying a broad approach that considers multiple learner model features and the learning context. We introduce features to stand in for student-level intercepts and argue that to be maximally applicable, a learner model needs to adapt to student differences. The results of our comparisons show the general importance of modeling recent learning for all datasets, with special importance for terms that model memory in datasets involving fact learning.},

The analysis was performed from different perspectives. First, a descriptive approach was used to analyze technologies that are considered as the most important for the experts and a nonparametric perspective approach was adopted to evaluate variation in the responses according to discipline, region, and years of experience. Second, a decision tree technique was used to establish technology profiles based on when the experts expected that the technologies will impact mass engineering education and the challenges or requirements needed to get widespread use. Third, the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the value of social interest, measured through Google Trends, as a predictor of expert ratings of different technologies. Results indicate adaptive and personalized learning technologies, learning analytics, and open educational resources are the three most promising technologies that will impact engineering education in the short term. Results also show a relation between the predictions made by the experts in 2019 and the social interest in the Google Trends education category.},

However, there is a lack of research investigating the effectiveness of visualization methods regarding learners&amp;#x2019; participation levels. Accordingly, in this study, two visualization methods are applied to participation dashboards to show peer participation levels and to support online discussion activities. The Transparent Participation Dashboard (TPD) provides the exact participation levels for all learners who participate in an online discussion, whereas the Private Participation Dashboard (PPD) visualizes a learner&amp;#x0027;s relative level of participation in comparison to the average value of a class. This study aimed to compare the effects of these two types of participation dashboards on the behavioral, cognitive, and affective aspects of online discussion activities. Toward this end, we conducted an experimental study. The participants included 62 undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to two groups. Thirty-two students were assigned to the Transparent group, which received the TPD. Thirty students were assigned to the Private group, which received the PPD. Our findings showed no significant difference in usability, quality of discussions, or learning outcomes between the two groups. However, the Transparent group was more active in its online discussions and expressed more negative satisfaction with the dashboard. This study&amp;#x0027;s conclusions suggest that dashboards for promoting learner competitiveness can positively affect learners&amp;#x2019; behavioral aspects but they may negatively impact their emotions.},

  abstract     = {Early warning systems (EWSs) have proven to be useful in identifying students at risk of failing both online and conventional courses. Although some general systems have reported acceptable ability to work in modules with different characteristics, those designed from a course-specific perspective have recently provided better outcomes. Hence, the main goal of this article is to design a tailored EWS for a conventional course in power electronic circuits. For that purpose, effectiveness of some common classifiers in predicting at-risk students has been analyzed. Although slight differences in their performance have only been noticed, an ensemble classifier combining outputs from several of them has provided to be the best performer. As a major contribution, a novel weighted voting combination strategy has been proposed to exploit global information about how basic prediction algorithms perform on several time points during the semester and diverse subsets of student-related features. Predictions at five critical points have been analyzed, revealing that the end of the fourth week is the optimal time to identify students at risk of failing the course. At that moment, accuracies about 85%–90% have been reached. Moreover, several scenarios with different subsets of student-related attributes have been considered in every time point. Besides common parameters from student&#39;s background and continuous assessment, novel features estimating student&#39;s performance progression on weekly assignments have been introduced. The proposal of this set of new input variables is another key contribution, because they have allowed to improve more than 5% predictions of at-risk students at every time point.},

  abstract     = {Computational thinking (CT) can be considered a 21st century core skill and, accordingly, it should be taught to students at an early age. Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode. The combination of different assessment methodologies&amp;#x2014;including CT pre- and posttests, data-driven analytics, direct observation, and questionnaires&amp;#x2014;provides assessment for each of the framework computational dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Simulation plays an important part in enhancing the outcomes of clinical training worldwide. In particular, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving procedure that utilizes a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to offer short or mid-term respiratory and circulatory assistance to seriously ill patients. After the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic hit the world, in-person simulations became quite challenging to organize, due to the precautionary physical distancing practices. Due to ECMO&amp;#x0027;s reliance on hands-on training, there is a need for a physical distancing-compatible solution that does not compromise on learning fidelity. Consequently, an assessment application has been developed to assist ECMO centers in carrying out simulations while being assessed by ECMO educators remotely. In this article, we conceptually introduce a revolutionary tablet-based assessment application for convenient, yet sophisticated and structured assessment of ECMO learners as a companion to an ECMO simulator and instructor application. The proposed application allows real-time assessment of the ECMO simulation experience and creates standardized simulation assessment curricula synced with a high-realism ECMO simulator. Initial app prototype showcases basic functionality, low communication latency, and a prototype simulation system that can simulate various ECMO emergencies.},

In this article, an automated approach is proposed to assist teachers in recommending groups of students to learning management systems. We developed and validated a conceptual framework for group recommendation for collaborative activities using the characterization of learners based on learning paths (LPs). The approach emphasizes the formation of groups by applying the k-means algorithm, associated with three distance metrics of similarity (i.e., Euclidean, Manhattan, and cosine) in conjunction with the attributes derived from LPs. The framework was validated through the implementation of an M-Cluster tool. The M-Cluster presents three solution options, which can be visualized in a descriptive manner or via a bubble graph; it is the teacher who chooses the most acceptable solution for each case. The results of the case study indicate that the tool shows promise for improving the performance of students to up to 75&amp;#x0025;.},

IoT gained traction with developers and consumers in recent years, driven by low-cost open-source hardware that enables easy prototyping and testing. IoT must be a part of the educational curriculum in higher education and follow a project-based learning pedagogy. This article describes a teaching framework for embedded systems and IoT, supported by a remote laboratory (RL) to allow students to work on project-based learning. RLs are online environments that let remote users access physical hardware. The hardware is designed as multipurpose multiobjective (MPMO), that is, the hardware components can be reconfigured to suit many different and unrelated learning objectives. RL for IoT benefits from certain advantages. First, IoT activities relating to communication often involve devices set apart geographically; running them as part of a single activity in a Web platform is the most efficient way. Second, some IoT activities require an enormous amount of time before conclusions can be made, and such activities are best carried out through an online environment. Using RL to teach students about embedded systems and IoT allows them to access equipment and IoT scenarios beyond their personal space. It is shown that students have been able to undertake the activities using RL successfully.},

This article utilizes, rather than discards, student data from review form comments to deliver better information to the instructor. In this article, we detail the process by which we create our domain-dependent lexicon and aspect-informed review form as well as our entire sentiment analysis algorithm, which provides a fine-grained sentiment score from text alone. We end by analyzing validity and discussing conclusions from our corpus of over 6800 peer reviews from nine courses to understand the viability of sentiment in the classroom for increasing the information from and reliability of grading open-ended assignments in large courses.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) technology provides new possibilities for educators to design and optimize learning experiences. However, it remains largely unclear how virtual learning environments can be engineered to achieve measurable improvements in the learners’ performance. To advance the development and application of VR learning technologies, we systematized instruction principles from the literature known to be congruent with cognitive and affective learning outcomes. We then combined these principles and designed a VR training program, which we subsequently tested in a large first-person VR experiment and real-world application to understand behavioral performance effects. In this article, we found that a purposefully engineered VR environment, which had been designed with an evidence-based selection of instruction principles, significantly improved the human performance compared to both a baseline training with textual instructions and a basic VR training. Our results indicate that perception engineering learning with VR is possible and offers substantial opportunities to improve learning outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The incorporation of collaborative work in the educational field grows day after day, as does the research associated with this topic. One of the most recurring problems faced by teachers who want to employ this learning strategy is the good students’ group formation since this task can be complex both conceptually and computationally, especially if the aim is to automate it. Considering that group formation is key when developing activities in collaborative learning scenarios, this article aims to propose a technique based on a genetic algorithm approach for achieving homogeneous groups, considering the students personality traits as grouping criteria, since, the aforementioned traits, have proven to be significantly predictive of academic performance and, in addition, to be associated with variables with a strong influence on academic success, such as intelligence and beliefs of self-efficacy. A controlled experiment was designed with 132 students, quantifying the personality traits through the “Big Five Inventory,” forming working groups and developing a collaborative activity in the initial programming courses. The experiment results allowed validation, not only from a computational point of view evaluating the algorithm performance but also from a pedagogical point of view, confronting the results obtained by students: formation based on personality traits versus formation by the students’ preference. The highlight of this article is that the homogeneous groups generated by the proposed approach produced better academic results compared to those obtained by groups generated by the students&#39; preference, at the moment of developing a collaborative activity.},

This study proposes a novel predictive modeling method to improve model transferability over time within the same course and across different courses. The research gaps addressed are limited evidence showing whether a predictive model built on historical data retrospectively can be directly applied to a future offering of the same course or to another different course; lacking interpretable data mining models to improve model transferability over time and across courses. Three datasets from two distinct online courses with one course offered two times over two years were applied using direct transferring of the predictive model and the proposed Bayesian updating technique for model transfer. The results showed that the direct transferring of predictive model to the subsequent offering of the course and to a totally different course did not work effectively. By contrast, the proposed Bayesian updating provided a robust and interpretable approach with improved model transferability results for both situations. This Bayesian updating model can be continuously updated with new collected data rather than building prediction model from scratch every time, which can serve as a new methodological framework to carry experience and knowledge from past and other courses forward to new courses.},

DBCIs have been successful in the past for delivering interventions that support sustained changes to health behaviors, such as disease prevention and health promotion. During research tasks, university students can require interventions associated with critical thinking skills and behaviors. By using a DBCI, educators can assist students with improving their learning skills in research projects. This study aims to understand student interactions and engagement with mobile-based DBCIs with the objective of improving their critical thinking skills. An experimental group was used to explore the effects of students’ interactions with an engaging mobile-based DBCI with real-time feedback and it was designed using the LifeGuide Toolbox platform, which supports their critical thinking skills over a period of two months while they conduct a research project. A comparison between formative expert assessments and self-reported evaluation was also performed. This experiment reveals that using a DBCI to encourage critical thinking skills within a research project context can significantly improve engagement with intervention components, as well as recommend areas that require further exploration where specific critical thinking skills and digital interventions components are the most promising.},

We notice that learners mainly use the combination of online and offline learning methods to complete the entire autonomous learning process, but most of the existing models cannot effectively describe the complex process of knowledge diffusion under the multinetworks framework. By analyzing the relationship between online learning and offline learning in the autonomous learning, we develop a novel formal model to characterize the dynamic process of knowledge diffusion in the autonomous learning under multiple networks. To guide learners to learn independently and effectively expand the scope of knowledge through hybrid online learning, we then introduce the personalized needs of learners and the guidance of educators and further propose an effective algorithm (ERAA) to allocate educational resources. Through the experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the model and analyze the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Then, we compare the proposed algorithm with the existing four algorithms and the results show that the proposed algorithm improves performance by 38%.

Using this methodology, a new taxonomy is proposed and the implications of its facets (and combinations of facets) are demonstrated. The taxonomy focuses on technology used to provide the virtual or augmented reality as well as the content presented to the user, including the type of gamification and how it is operated. It also accommodates a large number of devices and approaches developed throughout the years and for multiple industries, and provides a way to categorize them in order to clarify communication between researchers, developers, and educators.

However, in most classrooms, students and assignments do not have enough historical data for feeding these data hungry algorithms. Previous work on predicting dropout is data hungry and, moreover, requires the code to be syntactically correct. As we deal with beginners’ code in a text-based language our models are trained on noisy student text; almost 40% of the code in our datasets contains parsing errors. In this article, we compare two machine learning models that predict whether students need help regardless of whether their code compiles or not. That is, we compare two methods for automatically predicting whether students will be able to solve a programming exercise on their own. The first model is a heavily feature-engineered approach that implements pedagogical theories of the relation between student interaction patterns and the probability of dropout; it requires a rich history of student interaction. The second method is based on a short program (that may contain errors) written by a student, together with a few hundred attempts by their classmates on the same exercise. This second method uses natural language processing techniques; it is based on the intuition that beginners’ code may be closer to a natural language than to a formal one. It is inspired by previous work on predicting people&#39;s fluency when learning a second natural language.},

Co-located collaboration (CC) is a very complex process that involves subtle human interactions that can be described with indicators like eye gaze, speaking time, pitch, and social skills from different modalities. With the advent of sensors, multimodal learning analytics has gained momentum to detect CC quality. Indicators (or low-level events) can be used to detect CC quality with the help of measurable markers (i.e., indexes composed of one or more indicators) which give the high-level collaboration process definition. However, this understanding is incomplete without considering the scenarios (such as problem solving or meetings) of CC. The scenario of CC affects the set of indicators considered: For instance, in collaborative programming, grabbing the mouse from the partner is an indicator of collaboration; whereas in collaborative meetings, eye gaze, and audio level are indicators of collaboration. This can be a result of the differing goals and fundamental parameters (such as group behavior, interaction, or composition) in each scenario. In this article, we present our work on profiles of indicators on the basis of a scenario-driven prioritization, the parameters in different CC scenarios are mapped onto the indicators and the available indexes. This defines the conceptual model to support the design of a CC quality detection and prediction system.},

Our in-depth analysis of 52 existing proposals not only provides a descriptive view of the field, but also reflects on researcher conceptions of learning and their influence on the design, analytics, and technology choices made in this area. We also discuss the characteristics of workplace learning that make WPLA proposals different from LA in formal education contexts and the challenges resulting from this. We found that WPLA is gaining momentum, especially in some fields, like healthcare and education. The focus on theory is generally a positive feature in WPLA, but we encourage a stronger focus on assessing the impact of WPLA in realistic settings.},

Such applications are routinely subject to targeted cyberattacks, which result in significant loss of sensitive data (e.g., due to data exfiltration in advanced persistent threats) or valuable utilities (e.g., due to resource the exfiltration of power in cryptojacking). There is a critical need to train highly skilled cybersecurity professionals, who are capable of defending against such targeted attacks. In this article, we present the design, development, and evaluation of the Mizzou Cyber Range, an online platform to learn basic/advanced cyber defense concepts and perform training exercises to engender the next-generation cybersecurity workforce. Mizzou Cyber Range features flexibility, scalability, portability, and extendability in delivering cyberattack/defense learning modules to students. We detail our “research-inspired learning” and “learn-apply-create” three-phase pedagogy methodologies in the development of four learning modules that include laboratory exercises and self-study activities using realistic cloud-based application testbeds. The learning modules allow students to gain skills in using latest technologies (e.g., elastic capacity provisioning, software-defined everything infrastructure) to implement sophisticated “attack defense by pretense” techniques. Students can also use the learning modules to understand the attacker-defender game in order to create disincentives (i.e., pretense initiation) that make the attacker&#39;s tasks more difficult, costly, time consuming, and uncertain. Lastly, we show the benefits of our Mizzou Cyber Range through the evaluation of student learning using auto-grading, rank assessments with peer standing, and monitoring of students&#39; performance via feedback from prelab evaluation surveys and postlab technical assessments.},

  abstract     = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been an important learning tool in education. In order to reduce the high dropout rate and improve learners&#39; satisfactions, it is urgent for MOOCs platform to provide course recommendation and tutoring service. To achieve it, it is necessary to determine and trace learners&#39; learning state. Cognitive diagnosis in psychometric is a good way to quantify learners&#39; capacities, but it demands explicit learner feedback, which does not always exist in MOOCs platform, such a typical weak-interaction scenario. Therefore, in this article, multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) is exploratively integrated into recommendation models in MOOCs by introducing a time-effectiveness hypothesis to obtain the implicit response on a followed course. To dynamically update learners&#39; capacities by considering real-time and capacity multidimensionality, MIRT is extended to a capacity tracing model. The estimation for learner capacity is treated as attributes and integrated into collaborative filtering framework in course recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate capacity tracing into course recommendation in MOOCs. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset, demonstrating that the capacity tracing-enhanced course recommendation has improved effectiveness and explainability in MOOCs.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the impact of educational contexts on automatic classification of online discussion messages according to cognitive presence, an essential construct of the community of inquiry model. In particular, the work reported in the article analyzed online discussion messages written in Brazilian Portuguese from two different courses that were from different subject areas (biology and technology) and had different teaching presence in the online discussions. The study explored a set of 127 features of online discussion messages and a random forest classifier to automatically recognize the phases of the cognitive presence in online discussion messages. The results showed that the classifier achieved better performance when applied to the entire dataset. It reveals that when a classifier is created for a specific course it is not generic enough to be applied to a course from a different field of knowledge. The results also showed the importance of the features that were predictive of the phases of the cognitive presence in the educational context. Based on the findings of this study, future work should adopt the same feature set as used in the current study, but it should train the classifier of the cognitive presence on datasets in subject areas related to the topic of the discussions.},

However, there is still not a clear understanding of how CI has been used in combination with online educational technologies, due to a lack of secondary studies in this context. Thus, in this article, we conducted a systematic literature review with the objectives of determining how CI has been used in online learning environments and identifying the benefits and/or the difficulties that are encountered in the process of its use. We have analyzed 354 studies and only 30 have met our inclusion criteria. The main contributions to online learning of these 30 studies were categorized and discussed. Our results have shown that CI enables the exploration. of the potential of collaboration and collaborative learning in social environments to create more diverse educational contents and to improve educational aspects using group intelligence. Moreover, approximately 74% of the studies presented positive evidence of learning benefits. However, approximately 40% of the studies also presented positive evidence of implementation difficulties. These and other results presented in this article demonstrate that more research is necessary to explore the potential of CI in online learning technologies.},

It is significant because each successful course accomplishment is required for a degree. Further, early predictions provide enough time to make necessary changes for ultimate success. This article aims at an effective solution to this task. Different from the existing works, we resolve the task in a more practical context. First, the temporal aspects of the task and its data are considered. For the task, historical datasets are used to support the task on current ones. For the data, both labeled and unlabeled data before the midterm break are used. Second, our solution examines assessment data for the task, and thus, requires less data collection cost and effort over time. Third, we propose a semisupervised learning method, ST_OS, to obtain a better prediction model because ST_OS handles data insufficiency when exploiting all the labeled and unlabeled data. Moreover, ST_OS combines Self-Training and Tri-Training to create a resulting ensemble model in an effective semisupervised learning process with local learning for each selected unlabeled instance. Above all, the task is addressed in a general manner for different course types. As a result, our solution outperforms several existing supervised and semisupervised learning ones with higher Accuracy and F-measure. Therefore, it can be used as a forecasting tool before their courses end. More activities can be then improved to help the students complete the courses successfully.},

To date, few robust IoT classroom systems have emerged, partially due to lack of appropriate curriculum and student-accessible interfaces, and partially due to lack of classroom-compliant server technology. In this article, we present an architecture and sensor kit system that addresses issues of sensor ubiquity, acquisition clarity, data transparency, reliability, and security. The system has a dataflow programming interface to support both science practices and computational data practices, exposing the movement of data through programs and data files. The IoT Dataflow System supports authentic uses of computational tools for data production through this distributed cloud-based system, overcoming a variety of implementation challenges specific to making programs run for arbitrary duration on a variety of sensors. In practice, this system provides a number of unique yet unexplored educational opportunities.

  abstract     = {In this digital age, there is an abundance of online educational materials in public and proprietary platforms. To allow effective retrieval of educational resources, it is a necessity to build keyword-based search engines over these collections. In modern Web search engines, high-quality rankings are obtained by applying machine learning techniques, known as learning to rank (LTR). In this article, our focus is on constructing machine-learned ranking models to be employed in a search engine in the education domain. Our contributions are threefold. First, we identify and analyze a rich set of features (including click-based and domain-specific ones) to be employed in educational search. LTR models trained on these features outperform various baselines based on ad-hoc retrieval functions and two neural models. As our second contribution, we utilize domain knowledge to build query-dependent ranking models specialized for certain courses or education levels. Our experiments reveal that query-dependent models outperform both the general ranking model and other baselines. Finally, given well-known importance of user clicks in LTR, our third contribution is for handling singleton queries without any click information. To this end, we propose a new strategy to “propagate” click information from the other, similar, queries to the singleton queries. The proposed click propagation approach yields a better ranking performance than the general ranking model and another baseline from the literature. Overall, these findings reveal that both the general and query-dependent ranking models, trained using LTR approaches, yield high effectiveness in educational search, which may ultimately lead to a better learning experience.},

  abstract     = {Although many schools in the Netherlands have purchased adaptive learning systems (ALSs) to reduce workload and improve differentiated instruction, the use of ALSs with teacher dashboards in the classroom does not in itself necessarily improve differentiated instruction. The question is, what skills and knowledge do teachers need to provide differentiated instruction with the help of ALSs with teacher dashboards and how does this differ from a context in which such technologies are not used? By means of a cognitive task analysis, consisting of classroom observations, interviews, and several expert meetings, teachers&#39; skills, and knowledge necessary for providing differentiated instruction when using teacher dashboards and ALSs were disentangled. These findings were compared with the skills and knowledge needed by teachers providing differentiated instruction without these tools. Results show that teachers&#39; dashboards can support teachers when providing differentiated instruction by providing up-to-date information about students&#39; progress. Nevertheless, coping with the new information provided on the dashboards also requires new skills and knowledge such as interpreting information from the dashboard and understanding how the information in the ALS is calculated. Although there are some differences, the core principles of differentiated instruction-being goal-oriented, continually monitoring, adapting instruction and assignments, being ambitious, stimulating students&#39; self-regulation-are critical for high-quality differentiated instruction regardless of the available tools in the classroom.},

Toward this goal, we designed and evaluated a scalable targeted intervention: a mobile app that would deploy push notifications when students were missing submissions for assignments with imminent deadlines. Results from two experimental pilots demonstrate that this intervention system significantly decreased missed assignments compared with control notifications about instructor announcements to the class (in Experiment 1), and improved assignment adherence and course grades compared with courses that were not using the app (in Experiment 2). In this article, we discuss the benefits and theoretical implications of this behavioral guide rail, a purely informative proactive intervention to mitigate risk in advance of a negative outcome.},

As a step toward this goal, in this study, we considered how to broaden the context of a single learning environment into a learning ecosystem that integrates three separate e-learning systems. We present a cross-platform architecture that captures, integrates, and stores learning-related data from the learning ecosystem. To demonstrate the feasibility and the benefits of cross-platform architecture, we used regression and classification techniques to generate interpretable models with analytics that can be relevant for instructors in understanding learning behavior and sensemaking of the instructional method on learner performance. The results show that combining data across three e-learning systems improve the classification accuracy compared to data from a single learning system by a factor of 5.

  abstract     = {With the abrupt nationwide lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities suspended face-to-face activities. Some of them decided to continue their academic courses, adapting traditional approaches to online learning. An important challenge was to deliver programming labs over the Internet without important methodological changes, which might imply modifications of the learning outcomes. Most of the existing approaches to remote programming labs are based on asynchronous learning, where students work autonomously and contact the lecturers if they have any issues. The existing systems to provide synchronous programming labs are restricted to a single programming language or application type, and show significant interaction limitations. Therefore, we defined an infrastructure that allowed us to deliver synchronous programming labs over the Internet during the COVID-19 lockdown, as we used to do face-to-face. After using it for both programming labs and exams, students showed a high level of satisfaction. Compared to previous years, the use of our system produced no statistically significant difference in student&#39;s grades, pass and fail rates, or the number of students taking the lab exam. The network bandwidth, CPU, and memory resources consumed are sufficiently low to have allowed all the students to use it without any issues. Regardless of the pedagogical and methodological approach selected, our infrastructure provides the synchronous and remote delivery of programming labs, similar to the original face-to-face approach. Its features make it appropriate to deliver synchronous remote classes where strong lecturer-student interaction is required, and all the student work can be done with their computers.},

(Q2) What your least favorite part and why? (Q3) How could the course be improved? We used the latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to identify prominent topics present in learner responses to each question. We determined the theme of each identified topic through qualitative analysis. Our results show that the following aspects of MOOCs can significantly impact the learning experience: quality of course content, accurate description of prerequisites and required time commitment in course syllabus, quality of assessment and feedback, meaningful interaction with peers and educators, engaging instructor and videos, accessibility of learning materials, and usability of platform.},

  abstract     = {Smart learning environments (SLEs) have gained considerable momentum in the last 20 years. The term SLE has emerged to encompass a set of recent trends in the field of educational technology, heavily influenced by the growing impact of technologies, such as cloud services, mobile devices, and interconnected objects. However, the term SLE has been used inconsistently by the technology-enhanced learning (TEL) community since different research works employ the adjective “smart” to refer to different aspects of novel learning environments. Previous surveys on SLEs are narrowly focused on specific technologies or remain at a theoretical level that does not discuss practical implications found in empirical studies. To address this inconsistency and also to contribute to a common understanding of the SLE concept, this article presents a systematic literature review of papers published between 2000 and 2019 discussing SLEs in empirical studies. Sixty-eight papers out of an initial list of 1341 papers were analyzed to identify the following: 1) what affordances make a learning environment smart; 2) which technologies are used in SLEs; and 3) in what pedagogical contexts are SLEs used. Considering the limitations of previous surveys, and the inconsistent use of the SLE concept in the TEL community, this article presents a comprehensive characterization to describe SLEs through their affordances, the technologies used, and pedagogical approaches considered in the selected papers. As a result, specific core functions of SLEs are identified and explained. This work aims at ensuring a relevant knowledge base and reference toward the implementation of future SLEs.},

Learning path plays an important role in this area and has attracted great concern. Many generating mechanisms have been proposed from different perspectives for assisting learning. Some methods focus on learners’ interest, while some methods pay close attention to learning styles. This article proposes a new learning path generating method named learning diagnosis–learning path (LD–LP), which is based on knowledge structure and learning diagnosis. Different from the previous work, it takes knowledge relation, learner&#39;s ability, learning time, and repetition into account. The difficulty of knowledge provided to students will be adjusted according to students’ academic achievement and learning time adaptively. The system generates personalized learning path by the sequence of learning knowledge. Students who were majoring in mathematics were invited to participate in the experiment. Experimental result demonstrates that LD–LP works effectively and it has high adaptivity and positive feedback.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we empirically validate Tinto&#39;s Student Integration model, in particular, the predictions the model makes regarding both students&#39; academic outcomes and their dropout decisions. In doing so, we analyze three decades&#39; worth of student enrollments at an Australian university and present a novel methodological approach using graph embedding techniques to capture both structural and neighborhood-based features of the co-enrollment network. In keeping with Tinto&#39;s model, we find that not only do these embedded representations of students&#39; social network predict their final grade point average (GPA), but also are able to successfully classify students who dropout. Our results show that these embedded representations of a student&#39;s social network can achieve F 1 -scores of up to 0.79 when classifying dropout and explain up to 10% of the variance in student&#39;s final GPA. When controlling for a small set of covariates and variables common to the literature, this performance increases to 0.83 and 24%, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of these methods is robust to both changes in their parameterization and to corruption of the underlying social networks. Importantly, this implies that hyperparameters may be selected to reduce the computational demands of this method without loss of predictive power. The novelty of this method, and its ability to identify student dropout, merits further investigation to preemptively identify at-risk students.},

  abstract     = {Today, in the era of robotics, different types of educational robots have been used extensively in school classrooms to facilitate teaching activities related to a variety of computer science concepts. Numerous studies have been performed that attempt to examine the effects of using tangible interfaces to enhance collaborative learning experiences. In most of these studies, feedback, which is a vital function for a successful game activity, is mainly provided by the trainers. However, this kind of feedback can be considered as static and general, while each trainee seeks clear, consistent, and even personalized feedback. This article proposes an interactive learning tool for introducing algorithmic thinking and sequencing using educational robots suitable for elementary and intermediate students. In more detail, in this article, we leverage a fuzzy-rule-based system and computer vision techniques to provide immediate, personalized feedback and recommendations to young students while they perform a series of activities using tangible robots. These activities relate to teaching programming skills and improve the algorithmic thinking of students. Experimental results revealed that participants were able to increase their algorithmic/programming thinking skills while developing a positive attitude toward programming. The interactive gaming factor that is embedded in the use of tangible robots, while participating in the activities, was proved to be a compelling and a rewarding experience. The article concludes that the use of the proposed feedback mechanism, when placed in a robot game environment, can lead to a positive and more effective learning process.},

  abstract     = {Learnersourcing is emerging as a viable approach for mobilizing the learner community and harnessing the intelligence of learners as creators of learning resources. Previous works have demonstrated that the quality of resources developed by students is quite diverse with some resources meeting rigorous judgmental criteria, whereas other resources are ineffective, inappropriate, or incorrect. Consequently, to effectively utilize these large repositories of resources in student learning, there is a need for a selection and moderation process to separate high-quality resources from low-quality ones in such repositories. Instructors and domain experts are potentially the most reliable source for doing this task; however, their availability is often quite limited. This article explores whether and how learnersourcing, as an alternative approach, can be used for evaluating the quality of learning resources. To do so, we first follow a data-driven approach to explore students&#39; ability in judging the quality of learning resources. Results from this study suggest that, overall, ratings provided by students strongly correlate with ratings from experts; however, students&#39; ability in evaluating learning resources can also vary significantly. We then present a consensus approach based on matrix factorization and indicate how it can be used for improving the accuracy of aggregating learnersourced decisions. In this article, we also demonstrate how utilizing information on student performance and incorporating ratings from domain experts on a limited number of learning resources can be leveraged to further improve the accuracy of the results.},

By applying nonnegative matrix factorization and latent Dirichlet allocation techniques, we extract the underlying relationship between questions and validate the results using an external dataset.

Applications of solving varieties of MWPs can increase the efficacy of teaching-learning systems, such as e-learning systems, intelligent tutoring systems, etc., to help improve learning (or teaching) to solve word problems by providing interactive computer support for peer math tutoring. This article is specifically intended to benefit such teaching-learning systems on arithmetic word problems solving by adding an interactive and intelligent word problem solver to assess an individual&#39;s learning outcome. This article presents arithmetic mathematical word problems solver (AMWPS), an educational software application for solving arithmetic word problems involving single equation with single operation. This article is based on a combination of a machine learning based (classification) approach and a rule-based approach. We start with classification of arithmetic word problems into four categories (Change, Compare, Combine, and Division-Multiplication) along with their subcategories, followed by the classification of operations (+, -, *, and /) related to different subcategories. Our system processes an input arithmetic word problem, predicts the category and subcategory, predicts the operation, identifies and retrieves the relevant quantities within the problem with respect to answer generation, and formulates and evaluates the mathematical expression to generate the final answer. AMWPS outperformed similar systems on the standard AddSub and SingleOp datasets and produced new state-of-the-art result (94.22% accuracy).},

Some VR setups can deliver immersive VR training (e.g., on multiple projected screens), while others can deliver nonimmersive VR training (e.g., on standard desktop monitors). Recently, consumer VR headsets make it possible to deliver immersive VR training with six-degrees-of-freedom tracking of trainees&#39; head as well as hand controllers, while most smartphones can deliver nonimmersive VR training without the need for additional hardware. Previous studies compared immersive and nonimmersive VR setups for training, highlighting effects on performance, learning, presence, and engagement, but no study focused on contrasting procedural training with (immersive) VR headsets and (nonimmersive) smartphones. This article conducts a comparison of these two VR setups in the aviation safety domain. The considered training concerned door opening procedures in different aircraft and included a virtual instructor. In addition, we compared the two VR setups with the traditional printed materials used in the considered domain, i.e., safety cards. Results show that both VR setups allowed gaining and retaining more procedural knowledge than printed materials, and led to higher confidence in performing procedures. However, only the VR headset was considered to be significantly more usable than the printed materials, and presence was higher with the VR headset than the smartphone. The VR headset turned out to be important also for engagement and satisfaction, which were higher with the VR headset than both the printed materials and the smartphone.
