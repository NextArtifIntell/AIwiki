We have derived the sufficient conditions for the monotonicity of SFS and could show that, since the smooth fuzzy compositions are differentiable to the membership functions (MFs), irrespective to the shape of the membership function, one can obtain the monotonic SFS by the proper selection of the inference scheme and the consequent parts. This gives more flexibility that the MFs can have discontinuity in the universe of discourse or switch their values and the SFS still keep to be monotonic. This property is useful for the control and modeling of switched and hybrid dynamic systems.},

To achieve a sound tradeoff between detail preservation and noise suppression, morphological reconstruction is used to filter the observed image. By combining the observed and filtered images, a weighted sum image is generated. Tight wavelet frame decomposition is used to transform the weighted sum image into its corresponding feature set. Taking such feature set as data for clustering, we impose an $\ell _0$ regularization term on residual to FCM&#39;s objective function, thus resulting in residual-sparse FCM, where spatial information is introduced for improving its robustness and making residual estimation more reliable. To further enhance segmentation accuracy of the proposed FCM, we employ morphological reconstruction to smoothen the labels generated by clustering. Finally, based on the prototypes and smoothed labels, a segmented image is reconstructed by using tight wavelet frame reconstruction. Experimental results regarding synthetic, medical, and real-world images show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient, and outperforms its peers.},

The dynamic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is utilized to monitor the data transmission from the system plant to the controller, which more efficiently reduces the amount of transmitted data than the conventional static one. First, it is demonstrated that the adopted dynamic ETM can avoid the Zeno behavior, and also yield a larger minimal interexecution time compared with the static one. Then, an improved criterion of finite-time $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance is introduced by utilizing a novel Lyapunov-like function with an internal dynamic variable.

To preserve the membership similarity between an arbitrary image pixel and its neighbors, a Kullback–Leibler divergence term on partition matrix is introduced as a part of FCM. As a result, similarity-preserving FCM is developed by considering spatial information of image pixels for its robustness enhancement. Due to superior characteristics of a wavelet space, the proposed FCM is performed in this space rather than the Euclidean one used in conventional FCM to secure its high robustness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world G-images demonstrate that it indeed achieves higher robustness and performance than the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Moreover, it requires less computation than most of them.},

The salient features of the approach are the following. 1) A deep model, consisting of a nested composition of mappings, discovers layers of increasingly abstract heartbeat interval data representation. 2) An analytical solution of the deep model&#39;s learning problem facilitates inducing a mapping from the noninterpretable heartbeat-interval-data-space onto another interpretable domain spanned by a stress index. A given noninterpretable R– R interval feature vector is explained by: 1) estimating the corresponding stress value; 2) providing the weights which must be assigned to the subjective ratings of stress; and 3) providing various information about the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities of autonomic nervous system by analyzing R-R interval sequence in frequency domain at different abstraction levels. The proof-of-concept is provided by experimentation on a previously studied dataset of 50 subjects and a new dataset of 100 subjects.},

The uncertainty is (possibly fast) time varying, which lies in prescribed fuzzy sets (hence fuzzy mechanical systems) and may be unbounded. The control goal is formulated as servo constraints (hence constraint-following control), which may be holonomic or nonholonomic. We introduce the possibility theory into the Lyapunov stability analysis (LSA), proposing possibility-based LSA (PBLSA), which allows a maximum failure possibility (generally small) prescribed by designers. It can be viewed as a generalization of the conventional LSA, and the resultant performance is interpreted in the context of possibility. By the PBLSA, a class of robust constraint-following controls that is not IF–THEN heuristic rules based is proposed, which renders approximate constraint following for the system performance with a prescribed maximal failure possibility. Optimal design of a control parameter considering both system performance and control cost is investigated. The benefits of the proposed design framework are discussed and simulations on two applications are given for demonstrations.},

The existing models are elevated to a more abstract (general) level by allocating a certain level of information granularity throughout the parameter space. In a concise way, the essence of the overall architecture of the proposed modeling mechanism could be generalized as follows: Numeric model (granular model of type-0)→granular model of type-1→granular model of type-2→…→granular model of higher type. The results of the granular models come in the form of type-0, type-1, or higher type information granules, which are decided by the overall level of hierarchy of the corresponding granular model. The specificity of granular outputs becomes a more comprehensive and sound quantification of the prediction accuracy and precision of the model and the quality of the specific prediction outputs. The proposed method facilitates effective communication with humans, who could get actively involved in the modeling process and determine the suitable level of abstraction depending upon the requirements of the problem. The determination of a suitable level of information granularity is realized with the guidance of the principle of justifiable granularity. A number of experimental studies concerning publicly available datasets are presented to illustrate the development methodology and show the effectiveness of the approach to form hierarchically structured solutions (reflecting different levels of abstraction) to the problem.},

Effective cancer mortality risk estimation for genomic data associated with cancer remains a vital challenge. The combination of machine learning algorithms and conventional survival analysis can advance the detection of high-risk missense mutation variants and candidate genes associated with cancer mortality in next-generation genomic data. In this article, a fuzzy logic system combined with machine learning algorithms and conventional survival analysis named FuzzyDeepCoxPH was proposed to identify high-risk missense mutation variants and candidate genes highly associated with cancer mortality. DL-derived abstracted weights and Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) ratios were used to develop four model-based risk scores to consider the factor importance associated with risk stratification, time-varying effects, and individual and interaction effects among features. Fuzzy rules based on a fuzzy logic system were designed to integrate these considerations by merging four model-based risk scores to develop advanced risk estimation. The clinical features and next-generation sequencing of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid genomic data were used to evaluate FuzzyDeepCoxPH performance. The results indicated that FuzzyDeepCoxPH can effectively distinguish high-risk variants and candidate genes related to cancer mortality. In FuzzyDeepCoxPH, the fuzzy logic system was applied to combine DL-based and CoxPH-based models to provide a comprehensive cancer mortality risk estimation for cancer medicine.},

The proposed scheme can be divided into the guidance module and the control module. An improved logic virtual ship guidance principle, considering the ship-to-ship collision avoidance, is developed to generate the real-time reference signal for USVs. The main characteristic of the guidance principle is to ensure USVs sailing in the path following mode and collision avoidance mode. Especially for the collision avoidance mode, the collision avoidance guidance is targetedly designed for three sailing situations (the head-on situation, the overtaking situation, and the crossing situation), which is consistent with the COLREGs. Furthermore, an adaptive fuzzy event-triggered law is designed to control the USVs to converge to the desired path. The model unknown terms and the basic fault of the actuator are identified by the fuzzy logic system, and the fuzzy logic state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states of the USVs. Unlike the existing results, the communication burden from the controller to the actuators is reduced for the merits of the input event-triggered rule. Through the Lyapunov theory, it is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop control system are the semiglobal uniform ultimate bounded. Finally, the simulated examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed control approach.},

The considered systems contain not only unknown random interference terms but also general nonlinear functions that are not required to be globally Lipschitz, in contrast to most of the existing results in the area. To solve the problem of wasted communication resources, the control signal with the relative threshold strategy is designed via the event-triggered control technique. As a class of cyber–physical systems, the securities of MASs are vulnerable to actuator faults and DoS attacks. When the system suffers from coupled DoS attacks and actuator failures, its performance will deteriorate rapidly and even the controlled system will collapse. To overcome this difficulty, a novel fault-tolerant and antiattack control method is proposed, which enables the system to achieve the security control objective even in an insecure network and physical environment. The stability analysis of the system is given by combining the adaptive backstepping recursive design process with stochastic Lyapunov stability theory. It is demonstrated that all the signals of the closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability.

Moreover, the centralized solution is further defined as the solution, which owns the biggest maximum deviation in a given max-product system. The centralized solution could be viewed as the most stable solution in the system.

Applying parallel distributed compensation technique, the asynchronous fuzzy feedback controller is devised, and the asynchronous fuzzy controller modes are depicted by a hidden Markovian model, where the modes of fuzzy controller run asynchronously with that of the original degenerate fuzzy jump systems. Exponentially decreasing function is employed to devise the triggering threshold, which can ensure not only the admissibility of the delayed fuzzy degenerate jump systems but also the effectiveness of event-driven strategy.

  abstract     = {Although fuzziness universally diffuses in the real-world data, the fuzzy information is tricky to harness for feature selection such that it is rarely utilized. Therefore, how to efficiently exploit fuzzy information has become the major focus for feature selection recently. In this article, a novel unsupervised feature selection method is proposed via exploiting the sparse fuzzy membership efficiently. In general, $\ell _{2,1}$ norm is utilized to induce sparsity, while Frobenius norm is used to prevent overfitting. To obtain sparsity and avoid overfitting simultaneously, adaptive loss regularization is introduced to the least-squares regression, such that a sparse and nontrivial projection matrix can be achieved via continuous interpolation between $\ell _{2,1}$ and Frobenius regularization. Additionally, the fuzzy $k$ -means problem is further embedded with the adaptive loss regression model to avoid the trivial solution caused by the linearity of fuzzy membership. Therefore, the fuzzy cluster structure of fuzzy $k$ -means is exploited for the efficient feature selection. By performing fuzzy clustering and subspace regression simultaneously, the embedded problem is then reformulated into a general quadratic problem with $\ell _1$ ball constraint. Equipped with an auxiliary variable and standard augmented Lagrangian method, the quadratic problem, i.e., the corresponding dual problem can be solved with the closed form solutions regarding the fuzzy membership and the projection matrix. Consequently, empirical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection approach.},

More specifically, we propose a method for binary classification, in which the Sugeno integral is used as an aggregation function that combines several local evaluations of an instance, pertaining to different features, or measurements, into a single global evaluation. Due to the specific nature of the Sugeno integral, this approach is especially suitable for learning from ordinal data, i.e., when measurements are taken from ordinal scales. This is a topic that has not received much attention in machine learning so far. The core of the learning problem itself consists of identifying the capacity underlying the Sugeno integral. To tackle this problem, we develop an algorithm based on linear programming. The algorithm also includes a suitable technique for transforming the original feature values into local evaluations (local utility scores), as well as a method for tuning a threshold on the global evaluation. To control the flexibility of the classifier and mitigate the problem of overfitting the training data, we generalize our approach toward $k$ -maxitive capacities, where $k$ plays the role of a hyperparameter of the learner. We present experimental studies, in which we compare our method with competing approaches on several benchmark datasets.},

Most of the recent approaches in sarcasm detection have neglected the intrinsic vagueness and uncertainty of human language in emotional expression and understanding. To address this gap, we propose a complex-valued fuzzy network by leveraging the mathematical formalisms of quantum theory and fuzzy logic. In particular, the target utterance to be recognized is considered as a quantum superposition of a set of separate words. The contextual interaction between adjacent utterances is described as the interaction between a quantum system and its surrounding environment, constructing the quantum composite system, where the weight of interaction is determined by a fuzzy membership function. In order to model both the vagueness and uncertainty, the aforementioned superposition and composite systems are mathematically encapsulated in a density matrix. Finally, a quantum fuzzy measurement is performed on the density matrix of each utterance to yield the probabilistic outcomes of sarcasm recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MUStARD and the 2020 sarcasm detection Reddit track datasets, and the results show that our model outperforms a wide range of strong baselines.},

Therefore, it is particularly important to formulate an effective coal production decision-making scheme to support complex coal production systems for sustainable development. To address this challenge, an improved many-objective fuzzy decision-making model with human participation for coal production prediction is established in this article. The model includes five objective functions: economic, energetic, environmental, coal gangue, and safety profits. Moreover, a novel multistage many-objective optimization algorithm is designed to adjust relevant model parameters and make the obtained model solution more accurate when compared with involved algorithms. In the algorithm, there are three stages of optimization. In stage one, the model with the relatively good convergence solution is chosen. In stage two, the diversity of the model solution needs to be retained by employing a diversity maintenance mechanism. In stage three, a comprehensive measurement approach is designed to ensure the balance of convergence and diversity during population evolution. To verify the validity of the model and the superiority of the optimization algorithm, five other advanced many-objective algorithms are used for comparison. The results from simulations on a benchmark function show that the proposed optimization algorithm has better performance than involved algorithms.

However, existing fuzzy detection techniques for rumors focused their attention on supervised scenarios that require expert samples with labels for training. Thus, they are not able to well handle the unsupervised scenarios where labels are unavailable. To bridge such gap, this article proposed a fuzzy detection system for rumors through explainable adaptive learning. Specifically, its core is a graph embedding-based generative adversarial network (Graph-GAN) model. First of all, it constructs fine-grained feature spaces via graph-level encoding. Furthermore, it introduces continuous adversarial training between a generator and a discriminator for unsupervised decoding. The two-stage scheme not only solves the fuzzy rumor detection under unsupervised scenarios, but also improves robustness of the unsupervised training. Empirically, a set of experiments are carried out based on three real-world datasets. Compared with seven benchmark methods in terms of four metrics, the results of the Graph-GAN reveal a proper performance, which averagely exceeds baselines by 5–10\%.},

  abstract     = {Rule-based classifier, that extract a subset of induced rules to efficiently learn/mine while preserving the discernibility information, plays a crucial role in human-explainable artificial intelligence. However, in this era of big data, rule induction on the whole datasets is computationally intensive. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no known method focusing on accelerating rule induction has been reported. This is the first study to consider the acceleration technique to reduce the scale of computation in rule induction. We propose an accelerator for rule induction based on fuzzy rough theory; the accelerator can avoid redundant computation and accelerate the building of a rule classifier. First, a rule induction method based on consistence degree, called consistence-based value reduction (CVR), is proposed and used as basis to accelerate. Second, we introduce a compacted search space termed key set, which only contains the key instances required to update the induced rule, to conduct value reduction. The monotonicity of key set ensures the feasibility of our accelerator. Third, a rule-induction accelerator is designed based on key set, and it is theoretically guaranteed to display the same results as the unaccelerated version. Specifically, the rank preservation property of key set ensures consistency between the rule induction achieved by the accelerator and the unaccelerated method. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed accelerator can perform remarkably faster than the unaccelerated rule-based classifier methods, especially on datasets with numerous instances.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy systems have good modeling capabilities in several data science scenarios and can provide human-explainable intelligence models with explainability and interpretability. To obtain a human-explainable data intelligence model for decision making, in this article, we investigate explainable fuzzy-theoretic utility mining on multisequences. Meanwhile, a more normative formulation of the problem of fuzzy utility mining on sequences is formulated. By exploring fuzzy set theory for utility mining, we propose a novel method termed pattern growth fuzzy utility mining (PGFUM) for mining fuzzy high-utility sequences with linguistic meaning. In the case of sequence data, PGFUM reflects the fuzzy quantity and utility regions of sequences. To improve the efficiency and feasibility of PGFUM, we develop two compressed data structures with explainable fuzziness. Furthermore, one existing and two new upper bounds on the explainable fuzzy utility of candidates are adopted in three proposed pruning strategies to substantially reduce the search space and, thus, expedite the mining process. It is demonstrated that PGFUM achieves not only human-explainable mining results that contain the original nature of revealable intelligibility, but also high efficiency in terms of runtime and memory cost.},

In order to model the hesitant nature of the behavior of people to make a decision under uncertainty, we propose a hesitant fuzzy belief structure (HFBS) that is based on the BF theory and the recent hesitant fuzzy set theory. We also present the novel rule of combination of HFBS that is used and evaluated in a wearable human activity recognition (HAR) system coupled with an extreme learning machine.

The characteristics of this method include visually and linguistically explainable fuzzy features and rules and computational efficiency. This article first tracks the 2-D palms using the following four fuzzy features: optical flows; the degree of a pixel in the foreground; skin color information; and the search area around a hand palm candidate from a segmented body. Afterward, a fuzzy system (FS) is proposed to fuse the four fuzzy features to estimate the 2D- palm positions. Localization of the elbows is based on the estimated palm locations, human body skeletons, and body contour. The 2-D palms and elbows are tracked using a modified particle filter. To estimate the depth of each palm, the locations of the palm and elbow are fed as inputs to a neural FS. The 3-D palm tracking result is applied to a robot upper-body imitation system. Experiments with comparisons of different hand palm tracking methods are performed to verify the real-time computational ability and accuracy of the proposed method.},

In contrast, the aggregation of order-2 fuzzy sets requires a careful attention that needs to be paid both to the closeness determined in the space of membership degrees and the collection of information granules over which such fuzzy sets are defined. We formulate an original optimization problem that simultaneously involves considerations of distances in the membership space (space of membership grades) and some measure of resemblance formed in the space of relationships of reference information granules. The gradient-based learning scheme is constructed. Some illustrative examples are included.},

Next, an adaptive augmented state/FD observer is proposed to estimate the system state, sensor and the actuator faults simultaneously. New expected weights based on the sensor fault estimation information and a PI-type fuzzy feedback fault tolerant controller are designed to compensate the effect of sensor fault and actuator fault simultaneously. When the sensor fault occurs, the expected objective is redesigned to compensate the sensor fault. Meanwhile, the PI controller can compensate the effect of actuator fault, and the output PDF of the system can still track the desired PDF after the fault occurs.

Utility-based translation approaches are proposed, which further shows the ability of the PLTS with interval probabilities in representing quantitative information.

Integrating optimization models with the Dempster–Shafer theory, we present an aggregation method to estimate the maximum and minimum PLTSs obtained from the combination.

It states that if two outputs are far apart from each other , it is advisable to place their corresponding inputs in different clusters when forming subspaces of the input space . Considering this knowledge guidance mechanism, we propose two different methods to partition the input space. In the first method, input data are first partitioned with the use of the standard clustering algorithm, say fuzzy C-means; here, a constructed partition matrix is reflective of the structure present in the input space. Then, the knowledge tidbit is used to adjust the entries of the original partition matrix in such a way that those input data whose corresponding output data are far apart from each other are assigned with low values of proximity. In the second method, we propose two strategies to modify the distance between input data and a prototype (cluster center) identified in the input space. The crux of this method is that if there are many input data (which, in virtue of the knowledge tidbit, are regarded as being far-apart from the input data of interest) around a certain prototype, the distance between the input data of interest and this prototype should be penalized. Thus, the membership of these input data to the prototype is reduced. The comprehensive experimental studies carried out on both synthetic and publicly available data are used to examine the usefulness of the proposed methods.},

However, the interpretability of BRB has almost been ignored recently and leads to the decrease of model credibility. The main reason is the lack of unified guidelines for establishing an interpretable BRB expert system. In this article, the interpretability characteristics of BRB are summarized systematically, which can be used as the guideline of BRB establishment. Four interpretability criteria are proposed to ensure the interpretability of BRB in the optimization. A modified optimization algorithm with the interpretability constraints transformed from the interpretability criteria is further developed. As such, an interpretable BRB can be established. A case study for health state evaluation of the aerospace relay is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are artificial learning systems typically based on two operations: convolution, which implements feature extraction through filtering, and pooling, which implements dimensionality reduction. The impact of pooling in the classification performance of the CNNs has been highlighted in several previous works, and a variety of alternative pooling operators have been proposed. However, only a few of them tackle with the uncertainty that is naturally propagated from the input layer to the feature maps of the hidden layers through convolutions. In this article we present a novel pooling operation based on (type-1) fuzzy sets to cope with the local imprecision of the feature maps, and we investigate its performance in the context of image classification. Fuzzy pooling is performed by fuzzification, aggregation, and defuzzification of feature map neighborhoods. It is used for the construction of a fuzzy pooling layer that can be applied as a drop-in replacement of the current, crisp, pooling layers of CNN architectures. Several experiments using publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach can enhance the classification performance of a CNN. A comparative evaluation shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art pooling approaches.},

In real-world applications of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, there are usually thousands of sensors collecting information. It is easy to be overwhelmed by the mass of information and ignore the connections between them. The rise of the semisupervised learning method graph convolutional network makes it possible to address this issue. In this article, inspired by complex network, the basic probability assignment function, the base function of evidence theory, is modeled in a novel form of the network graph. Some typical issues of evidence theory, such as conflicting evidence, multiclass evidence clustering, and computational complexity for large-scale fusion are systematically addressed in the framework of the proposed network model. What&#39;s more, a new combination rule is presented from the point view of the graph.

This principle generates an information granule by maximizing a product of two generic characteristics of the granule, such as coverage and specificity. Given a collection of type-1 fuzzy sets, the result of the principle comes in a form of a single type-2 information granule. In general, we emphasize the effect of type elevation of information granules by stressing that a family of type- n information granules gives rise to a single type-( n +1) information granule.

  abstract     = {Although high-order Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems have demonstrated their computational advantages and simultaneously circumvent the weakness that the number of rules with the number of input variables and membership functions grows exponentially in both zero-order and first-order TSK fuzzy systems for complex modeling tasks, they still face two serious issues: incapability for a changing environment and no interpretability of the coefficients in high-order polynomial used in the consequent part of each fuzzy rule. In order to circumvent these two challenges, a novel stacked architecture of an interpretable deep higher order TSK fuzzy classifier called DHO-TSK and its deep learning method are proposed by proving the equivalence between a high-order TSK fuzzy classifier and a deep ensemble of interpretable zero-order TSK fuzzy classifiers in this article. DHO-TSK can be built by assembling interpretable zero-order TSK fuzzy classifiers in a special stacked way. Each zero-order TSK fuzzy classifier can be learnt by randomly selecting input features, randomly assigning an antecedent fuzzy subset from a fixed fuzzy partition to each of the selected input features, and then multiplying the output of each TSK fuzzy classifier by a randomly selected feature. Except for the abovementioned solid theoretical equivalence, DHO-TSK is featured in the following aspects: first, the consequent part of each fuzzy rule in DHO-TSK becomes interpretable and the output expression of each layer in DHO-TSK becomes comprehensible due to the adopted stacked ensemble; second, its enhanced classification performance can be achieved in a stacked deep learning way; third, DHO-TSK has its adoptability for changing environments owing to random selection of both features and fuzzy membership functions. Our experimental results on the benchmarking UCI and KEEL datasets and a real dataset indicate the effectiveness of DHO-TSK and its learning method in the sense of both classification performance and interpretability.},

Second, caused by DoS attacks, the transmission attempts may be denied over the communication network.

Second, taking DoS attacks, and event-triggered mechanism into consideration, a switching state-feedback controller is established, and the exponential stability is derived.

Specifically, the exhaustive type-reduction method for CIT2 Mamdani systems has been shown to be too slow to be used in practical applications and even the current approximation procedure is much slower than modern type-reduction algorithms used for IT2 fuzzy sets. In this article, a novel type-reduction procedure for CIT2 sets is presented, based on the concept of switch indices.

  abstract     = {In unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), a classifier for a target domain is trained with labeled source data and unlabeled target data. Existing UDA methods assume that the source data come from the same source domain (i.e., single-source scenario) or from multiple source domains, whose feature spaces have the same dimension ( homogeneous ) but different distributions (i.e., multihomogeneous-source scenario). However, in the real world, for a specific target domain, we probably have multiple different-dimension ( heterogeneous ) source domains, which do not satisfy the assumption of existing UDA methods. To remove this assumption and move forward to a realistic UDA problem, this article presents a shared-fuzzy-equivalence-relation neural network (SFERNN) for addressing the multisource heterogeneous UDA problem. The SFERNN is a five-layer neural network containing $c$ source branches and one target branch. The network structure of the SFERNN is first confirmed by a novel fuzzy relation called multisource shared fuzzy equivalence relation. Then, we optimize parameters of the SFERNN via minimizing cross-entropy loss on $c$ source branches and the distributional discrepancy between each source branch and the target branch. Experiments distributed across eight real-world datasets are conducted to validate the SFERNN. This testing regime demonstrates that the SFERNN outperforms the existing single-source heterogeneous UDA methods, especially when the target domain contains few data.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce novel reinforced hybrid fuzzy rule-based neural networks (RHFNNs). This article is concerned with the development of the design methodologies of hybrid fuzzy rule-based model for constructing the network structure and enhancing its predictive abilities through the combination of inhomogeneous neurons [i.e., clustering-based polynomial neurons (CPNs) and polynomial neurons (PNs)] and tournament selection. The key points of the proposed RHFNN are enumerated as follows: The first layer of the proposed network consists of CPNs. CPN can effectively reflect the complex nonlinear structure encountered in the data space, and refine (granulate) it with the help of the clustering algorithm. Two types of CPNs including hard C-means (HCM) clustering-based polynomial neuron (HCPN) and fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering-based polynomial neuron (FCPN) are designed. According to the type of CPN used in the first layer, RHFNN can be categorized into two types, namely, RHFNN based on HCPN (HRHFNN) and RHFNN based on FCPN (FRHFNN). We use PNs to construct the second and consecutive layers. PN can identify and approximate the nonlinear relationship among system&#39;s inputs and outputs. A tournament-based performance selection (TPS) algorithm stemming from evolutionary computation is used for selection of neuron. TPS not only ensures that the candidate nodes have sufficient fitting ability but also enhances the individual diversity in the node set and provides the abilities to generate better prediction nodes. In addition, L 2 -norm regularization is considered to reduce the deviation between coefficients and ameliorate overfitting as well as boost generalization ability. The performance of RHFNN is discussed through a variety of publicly available machine learning datasets. From the experimental results, we conclude that RHFNN achieves the best prediction accuracy on 13 of 15 datasets; the statistical analysis also confirms the superiority of RHFNN.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the stability analysis of a polynomial-fuzzy-model-based control system by employing a new form of approximate membership functions called Chebyshev membership functions (CMFs) based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The membership-function-dependent method shows that the approximate functions can introduce useful information to relax the conservativeness of stability analysis. Therefore, in the case of the same order and operating domain, how to design the approximate functions to introduce more information to relax stability is a concern. In this article, given the Chebyshev norm relationship between the approximate membership functions and the original ones, CMFs can be obtained by the Chebyshev approximation theory and the Remez/Remez-type iterative algorithm, which own the minimum of the maximum absolute approximation error. Together with CMFs, the boundary information of premise variables on the overall operating domain is considered to reduce the conservativeness of stability analysis. Furthermore, to further relax the stability analysis without increasing the order of CMFs, the operating domain is divided into subdomains, and piecewise Chebyshev membership functions (PCMFs) are proposed to facilitate the stability analysis. Together with PCMFs, the subdomain boundary information of premise variables is introduced into stability conditions. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Its fuzzy set-based version, i.e., the fuzzy AHP, has also been widely studied and applied since its inception. The essential distinction between the AHP and fuzzy AHP comes from the diverse transformation methods between the linguistic and numeric judgments. In this article, we conduct a thorough comparative study between the AHP and fuzzy AHP methods in the framework of two linguistic models, i.e., the linguistic model based on the membership functions and two-tuple linguistic model. First, four AHP and three fuzzy AHP methods are revisited with the involvement of two linguistic models. Then, the comparison criteria are involved by calculating the cardinal or ordinal deviation between the original information and decision solutions, and the effects of the transitivity of the reciprocal matrix are also discussed in the comparative study. Finally, the detailed experiments along with a thorough comparative analysis are conducted based on the random and publicly available data to show the difference between the AHP and fuzzy AHP methods.},

In this article, therefore, we propose a generalized model of the traditional one, so that it can have more powerful capability to represent the knowledge, and uncertainty measure. In particular, we first define a vector representation of complex-valued distribution. Then, an entropy measure is proposed for the complex-valued distribution, called $\mathcal {X}$ entropy. In this context, a transformation function to acquire the negation of the complex-valued distribution is exploited on the basis of the newly defined $\mathcal {X}$ entropy. Afterward, the properties of this negation function are analyzed, and investigated, as well as some special cases. Finally, we study the negation function on the view from the $\mathcal {X}$ entropy. It is verified that the proposed negation method for the complex-valued distribution is a scheme with a maximal entropy.},

  abstract     = {Determining the correct number of clusters is essential for efficient clustering and cluster validity indices are widely used for the same. Generally, the effectiveness of a cluster validity index relies on two factors: first, separation, defined by the distance between a pair of cluster centroids or a pair of data points belonging to different clusters and second, compactness, which is determined in terms of the distance between a data point and a centroid or between a pair of data points belonging to the same cluster. However, the existing cluster validity indices for centroid-based clustering are unreliable when the clusters are too close, but corresponding centroids are distant. To mitigate this, a new cluster validity index, Saraswat-and-Mittal index, has been proposed in this article for hyperellipsoid or hyperspherical shape close clusters with distant centroids, generated by fuzzy c-means. The proposed index computes compactness in terms of the distance between data points and corresponding centroids, whereas the distance between data points of disjoint clusters defines separation. These parameters benefit the proposed index in the analysis of close clusters with distinct centroids efficiently. The performance of the proposed index is validated against ten state-of-the-art cluster validity indices on artificial, UCI, and image datasets, clustered by the fuzzy c-means.},

First, a novel affinity calculation method considering the IT2FS values is developed. Then, four problem-specific initialization heuristics are designed to enhance both quality and diversity. To enhance the exploitation abilities, six local search approaches are conducted for the routing and scheduling vectors, respectively. Next, a simulated annealing method is embedded to accept antibodies with low affinity, which can enhance the exploration abilities of the algorithm. Moreover, a novel population diversity heuristic is presented to eliminate antibodies with high crowding values. Five efficient algorithms are selected for a detailed comparison, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IAIS algorithm is effective for IT2FS FJSPs.},

  abstract     = {In data streams, the data distribution of arriving observations at different time points may change—a phenomenon called concept drift. While detecting concept drift is a relatively mature area of study, solutions to the uncertainty introduced by observations with missing values have only been studied in isolation. No one has yet explored whether or how these solutions might impact drift detection performance. We, however, believe that data imputation methods may actually increase uncertainty in the data rather than reducing it. We also conjecture that imputation can introduce bias into the process of estimating distribution changes during drift detection, which can make it more difficult to train a learning model. Our idea is to focus on estimating the distance between observations rather than estimating the missing values, and to define membership functions that allocate observations to histogram bins according to the estimation errors. Our solution comprises a novel masked distance learning (MDL) algorithm to reduce the cumulative errors caused by iteratively estimating each missing value in an observation and a fuzzy-weighted frequency (FWF) method for identifying discrepancies in the data distribution. The concept drift detection algorithm proposed in this article is a singular and unified algorithm that can handle missing values, but not an imputation algorithm combined with a concept drift detection algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of this method and show its robustness in detecting drift in data with missing values. The results show that compared to the best-performing algorithm that handles imputation and drift detection separately, MDL-FWF reduced the average drift detection difference from 10.75\% to 5.83\%. This is a nearly 46\% improvement. These findings reveal that missing values exert a profound impact on concept drift detection, but using fuzzy set theory to model observations can produce more reliable results than imputation.},

Malware can have highly diversified features, each of which has highly heterogeneous distributions. These factors increase the difficulties for traditional data analytic approaches to deal with them. Although deep learning based methods have reported good classification performance, the deep models usually lack interpretability and are fragile under adversarial attacks. To solve these problems, fuzzy systems have become a competitive candidate in malware analysis. In this article, a new fuzzy-based approach is proposed for malware classification. We focused on portable executable files in the Windows platform and analyzed the distributions of static features and content-oriented features. Fuzzification was used to reduce the ubiquitous impact of noise and outliers in a very large dataset. Finally, a novel boosted classifier consisted of fuzzy decision trees and support vector machine is proposed to perform the malware classification. By using fuzzy decision trees, the inner structure of the classifier can be readily interpreted as discriminative rules, whereas the novel boosting strategy provides state-of-the-art classification performance. Extensive experimental results showed that our method significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art classifiers.},

Then, admissible conditions and ${H_\infty }$ performance for the system with the first case of uncertainties are derived based on a new augmented system. As for the second case, the admissibility analysis is converted into the first case by an equivalent companion system then solved as well. All conditions are cast into strict linear matrix inequalities. Besides, due to the introduction of a new nonquadratic fuzzy Lyapunov function and slack decision variables, the proposed methods are less conservative than related ones.

  abstract     = {Overlap functions, as one kind of particular binary aggregation functions, have been continuously studied in the literature for their vast preponderance in some real applications. Meanwhile, after Lucca et al. introduced the notion of preaggregation functions recently, the investigation related to such “aggregation” functions becomes an interesting, and natural research area. In this article, we continue to focus on this topic for overlap functions. First, we introduce the concept of $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap functions by replacing the monotonicity of (quasi-)overlap functions with directional monotonicity, and the notions of 0- $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap functions, 1- $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap function, and 0,1- $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap functions associated with them. And then, we propose some vital properties of $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap functions. Finally, we show several construction methods of $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap functions, 0- $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap functions, 1- $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap function, and 0,1- $\vec{r}$ -(quasi-)overlap functions.},

The novel approach encapsulates the functionary of spatially constrained fish school optimization (SCFSO) algorithm and interval type-II fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) techniques, which resolves the erroneous prediction of anomalies present in various topographical locations in brain subjects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality. Huge datasets and complex tumor (anomalies) can be intervened and examined with ease by the developed approach, and this could be a proactive measure for being implemented or incorporated in clinical practice for the betterment of both doctors and patients, and it can perpetuate a profound experience to the doctors. The developed SCFSO-IT2FLS technique was applied to BRATS-SICAS dataset, and the evaluation metrics—namely, the Dice overlap index and sensitivity value were delivered as 96 ± 2.1 and 98 ± 1.1 by the proposed technique. These values are better than the conventional techniques and the proposed technique is applicable for the segmentation of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences of various axes coordination. A clear extraction of tumor region from nontumor region (edema) is rendered by the proposed technique and a therapeutic preplanning could always be made with such a provision/advantage.},

Fuzzy logic systems are employed to deal with unknown nonlinear dynamics. By using adaptive technique and power integration technique, two barrier-function-based fixed-time control strategies are projected. In the first scheme, a novel adaptive fault-tolerant distributed fixed-time control protocol is developed. Besides, a new real-time compensation mechanism is proposed, where the compensation signal is provided if and only if there exists input saturation. Compared with the mechanisms for always compensating signals in existing results, the proposed real-time compensation mechanism may reduce energy consumption. In the second scheme, an adaptive fault-tolerant priority-based fixed-time control protocol is proposed, which may reduce the computational complexity arising from numerous neighbors’ variables. Both of the proposed two strategies can avoid the singular problem by constructing high-order derivable continuous functions. Besides, the developed control protocols can ensure the errors in MASs are practical fixed-time stable, meanwhile, the error constraints will not be violated in operation. Stability analysis and simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

Using such an ETM cannot only lead to a lower data-releasing rate but also reduce the occurrence of wrong triggering event. Furthermore, the frequency of event generation is relatively smoother than existing ETMs. From the current releasing instant to the next, two periods are designed. The ETM works only when the first period ends, thereby avoiding the Zeno behavior that commonly exists in continuous ETM designs. The control system is then formulated as a switched fuzzy control system with two modes in each releasing period. Based on an assumption of secure control, and the proposed ETM, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the exponential stability of networked T–S fuzzy systems in the presence of deception attacks in secure sense.

As a generalization of the F-transform, in this article, we introduce the continuous F-transform and its inverse, as an integral operator induced by a kernel function. Through the relation between membership functions and integral kernels, we show that the main properties (e.g., continuity and symmetry) of the membership functions are inherited by the continuous F-transform. Then, the relation between the continuous F-transform and integral operators is used to introduce a data-driven F-transform, which encodes intrinsic information (e.g., structure, geometry, and sampling density) about the input data. In this way, we avoid coarse fuzzy partitions, which group data into large clusters that do not adapt to their local behavior, or a too dense fuzzy partition, which generally has cells that are not covered by the data, thus being redundant and resulting in a higher computational cost. To this end, the data-driven membership functions are defined by properly filtering the spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator associated with the input data. Finally, we introduce the space of continuous F-transforms, which is useful for the comparison of different continuous F-transforms and for their efficient computation.},

In view of the fact that the uncertainties may occur randomly in the execution of the actuator, a nonfragile controller design scheme is presented by virtue of the Bernoulli distributed white sequence. The main novelty of this article lies in that the transition probabilities of the Markov chain are considered to be piecewise time-varying, and whose variation characteristics are described by the persistent dwell-time switching regularity. Then, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is concluded that the resulting synchronization error system is mean-square exponentially stable with a prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance in the presence of actuator gain variations.

The discrete-time semi-Markov process is employed to describe the mode jumping among several subsystems in the investigated systems. Moreover, the nonlinear characteristics are effectively tackled through utilizing the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model. Unlike some previous results, the information of the semi-Markov kernel (SMK) in this article is assumed to be partially available, which conforms better with the practical scenarios. Besides, considering the case that actuators may encounter some unexpected failures during system operation, the fault-tolerant mechanism is introduced in the process of controller design to enhance the fault tolerance of the studied systems. By means of SMK approach and Lyapunov stability theory, some elapsed-time-dependent criteria for guaranteeing the mean-square stability of the closed-loop system are established. According to these criteria, the design methodology of the reliable fuzzy state feedback controller is developed. Eventually, in order to verify the practicability and rationality of the developed control scheme, a single-link robot arm model is presented.},

Using the principle of a twin-support vector machine, the proposed approach solves four smaller quadratic programming problems, each of which constructs the lower and upper bound functions of the possibility and necessity models, rather than a single large one. This strategy significantly reduces the time that is required for training. The output from the obtained dual-regression model is characterized by an asymmetric trapezoidal fuzzy number. The obtained asymmetric dual-regression model is more flexible and models the data distribution better than a symmetric model. The proposed approach provides a unified framework that accepts various types of crisp and fuzzy input variables by using radial kernels. The proposed dual model also indicates a degree of confidence to the predicted outputs. The explicable characteristic for the degree of confidence also means that the proposed approach is more suitable for decision-making task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has a more efficient training procedure and better describes the inherent ambiguity in the observed phenomena.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an olfactory-based navigation algorithm for using a mobile robot to locate an odor source in a turbulent flow environment. We analogize the odor source localization as a reinforcement learning problem. During the odor plume tracing process, the belief state in a partially observable Markov decision process model is adapted to generate a source probability map that estimates possible odor source locations, and a hidden Markov model is employed to produce a plume distribution map that premises plume propagation areas. Both source and plume estimations are fed to the robot, and a decision-making approach based on fuzzy inference is designed to dynamically fuse information from two maps and to balance the exploitation and exploration of the search. After assigning the fused information to reward functions, a value iteration based path planning algorithm is presented to solve for the optimal action policy. Comparing to other commonly used olfactory-based navigation algorithms, such as moth-inspired and Bayesian inference methods, simulation results show that the proposed method is more intelligent and efficient.},

Recently, information granulation is shown to be an appropriate tool for the long-term forecast. Though some models for the long-term prediction problem have been proposed using information granulation recently, there is still a growing need to develop new prediction approaches for time series data based on information granule, which can capture the dynamic trend change with high accuracy. In this article, a long-term prediction approach, based on back-propagation neural network and information granule, is proposed. First, the individual numerical intervals for the time series are obtained by using the principle of justifiable granularity in information granule. Then, an automatic linear trend extraction method is developed to extract the trend change, which is inherited in granules. Finally, a hierarchy of neural network is constructed to carry out prediction by using information granule as input. Experiments using publicly available time series datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better performance than the existing models for long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy broad learning system (FBLS) is a recently proposed neuro-fuzzy model that shares the similar structure of a broad learning system (BLS). It shows high accuracy in both classification and regression tasks and inherits the fast computational nature of a BLS. However, the ensemble of several fuzzy subsystems in an FBLS decreases the possibility of understanding the fuzzy model since the fuzzy rules from different fuzzy systems are difficult to combine together while keeping the consistence. To balance the model accuracy and complexity, a synthetically simplified FBLS with better interpretability, named compact FBLS (CFBLS), is developed in this article, which can generate much fewer and more explainable fuzzy rules for understanding. In such a way, only one traditional Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system is employed in the feature layer of a CFBLS, and the input universe of discourse is equally partitioned to obtain the fuzzy sets with proper linguistic labels accordingly. The random feature selection matrix and rule combination matrix are employed to reduce the total number of fuzzy rules and to avoid the “curse of dimensionality.” The enhancement layer is kept in the CFBLS that helps to add a nonlinear transformation of input features to the traditional first-order polynomial used in the consequent part of a fuzzy rule. The pseudoinverse is also used to determine the parameters of CFBLS guaranteeing its fast computational nature. The experiments on the popular UCI and KEEL datasets indicate that the CFBLS can generate a smaller set of comprehensible fuzzy rules and achieve much higher accuracy than some state-of-the-art neuro-fuzzy models. Moreover, the advantage of CFBLS is also verified in a real-world application.},

All submodels of the new T–S fuzzy model contain constant terms due to the nonlinear characteristics of the helicopter system. In this article, sampled-data control is considered and the sampled data are transmitted to the system over a communication network. A large amount of sampled data transmitted over the network can significantly increase the computational and communication burdens for the network with a limited bandwidth. To overcome this difficulty, an event-triggered mechanism is introduced. In order to validly control the T–S fuzzy system, a fuzzy proportional integral-derivative (PID) controller is designed based on the Lyapunov method and practical stability criteria, which are obtained by using improved integral inequalities and the linear matrix inequality technique. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

This observer problem is known as a challenging task due to the mismatch caused by the unmeasurable premise variables. To deal with this major challenge, we propose to rewrite the nonlinear system as a specific fuzzy model with two types of local nonlinearities: measurable and unmeasurable. Then, a differential mean value theorem for vector-valued functions is applied to local unmeasurable nonlinearities. This allows to represent the estimation error dynamics in a special polytopic form involving measurable membership functions and unknown but bounded time-varying parameters. Using Lyapunov-based arguments, design conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the estimation error. Three illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the interests of the new fuzzy observer framework in reducing: 1) the design conservatism and 2) the numerical complexity of the fuzzy observer structure for real-world applications.},

For the subsystems of each agent, nonlinear terms are not required to satisfy any growth conditions and fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate unknown functions. In the protocol design, information on the interaction topology and the number of agents cannot be used. Since the underlying multiagent systems are heterogeneous and have switching characteristics, and the topology information is unknown, it is rather difficult to solve the consensus tracking problem using existing algorithms. In this article, a novel distributed consensus tracking protocol is developed. By using the graph theory, Lyapunov functional method and fuzzy logic systems approximation technique, it is proven that the consensus tracking control objective can be achieved for multiagent systems suffering from actuator faults and arbitrary switchings.

  abstract     = {In this article, the sliding mode control (SMC) problem is addressed for a class of Markovian jump systems via the T–S fuzzy model. First, in order to reduce the frequency of state transmission for alleviating congestion phenomenon in the bandwidth-limited communication network, a dynamic event-triggered (DET) strategy is introduced into the sensor-to-controller channel, in which an additional internal dynamical variable is employed to adjust the event-triggered condition adaptively. A fundamental issue resulting from the event-triggered strategy is that the controller cannot obtain the information about system mode during the triggering interval. Aiming at the phenomenon, this work utilizes a mode detector to estimate the unavailable system mode. Then, this article proposes a detected-mode-dependent event-triggered sliding mode controller whose membership grades are determined only via the transmitted state at the triggering instant. By constructing a relation on the membership functions (MFs) between the fuzzy model and the controllers for MF-dependent analysis, the conditions on the reachability and stability conditions are relaxed. Furthermore, an optimization algorithm is provided for the minimum control power via a high-dimensional grid searching for the coefficients of the internal dynamic variables, which, together with the designed detected-mode-dependent sliding mode controller, constitutes the novel SMC scheme under the DET strategy. Finally, the simulation results via the single-link arm system are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy integrals (FIs) are powerful aggregation operators that fuse information from multiple sources. The aggregation is parameterized using a fuzzy measure (FM), which encodes the worths of all subsets of sources. Since the FI is defined with respect to an FM, much consideration must be given to defining the FM. However, in practice this is a difficult task—the number of values in an FM scales as $2^n$ , where $n$ is the number of input sources, thus manually specifying an FM quickly becomes tedious. In this article, we review an automatic, data-supported method of learning the FM by minimizing a sum-of-squared error objective function in the context of decision-level fusion of classifiers using the Choquet FI. While this solves the specification problem, we illuminate an issue encountered with many real-world data sets; i.e., if the training data do not contain a significant number of all possible sort orders, many of the FM values are not supported by the data. We propose various regularization strategies to alleviate this issue by pushing the learned FM toward a predefined structure; these regularizers allow the user to encode knowledge of the underlying FM to the learning problem. Furthermore, we propose another regularization strategy that constrains the learned FM&#39;s structure to be a linear order statistic. Finally, we perform several experiments using synthetic and real-world data sets and show that our proposed extensions can improve the learned FM behavior and classification accuracy. A previously proposed visualization technique is employed to simultaneously quantitatively illustrate the FM as well as the FI.},

The proposed FDI system aims to detect the saturation in the inductor core as a fault, considering the current increment can cause an avalanche effect provoking a failure in the system. A Takagi–Sugeno model of the flyback converter is used. The observer&#39;s convergence and the stability of the fault diagnosis system are guaranteed by Lyapunov&#39;s theory and the estimation error used to determine the necessary LMIs. A comparison of different FDI methods applied in fuzzy systems is performed in order to select the most robust system, capable of estimating the current in the system even in the presence of external disturbances. The system validation is performed in both, simulation and online implementation, using experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is one of the most frequently used methods for clustering. However, with increasing amount of data, FCM suffers from slow convergence and a large amount of calculation because all samples are involved in updating the solutions per iteration without considering the current clustering results. In this article, a new membership scaling FCM (MSFCM) is proposed, based on the observation that the samples, whose nearest cluster center is $\mathbf {v}$ , aid the convergence of $\mathbf {v}$ , whereas the remaining samples prevent the convergence of $\mathbf {v}$ . In the new algorithm, many samples whose nearest cluster centers do not change in the next iteration are chosen by using the triangle inequality. A new scheme for scaling the membership degrees of the chosen samples is suggested to boost the effect of the in-cluster samples and to weaken the effect of the out-of-cluster samples in the clustering process. The new scheme not only accelerates the convergence of the algorithm but also maintains the high clustering quality. Many experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the speed of the convergence of the fuzzy clustering. In particular, compared with FCM, MSFCM saves at least two thirds of the total rounds of iterations without significantly increasing the cost per iteration.},

  abstract     = {Limited by the operation time window and working space, space teleoperation tasks need to be completed within an expected time while ensuring that the end effector meets the physical constraints. Meanwhile, the interaction with unknown environments would cause uncertainty in the closed-loop system, which brings great challenges to the control design. To solve the above problems, the control performance issue for a class of space teleoperation systems subject to multiple constraints and interaction uncertainties is investigated in this article. The force interaction with the human operator/space environment is represented by interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems, where the uncertain equivalent mass and damping parameters can be effectively described and captured by IT2 membership functions. In order to reduce the communication burden and satisfy the constraints of settling time, transient-state performance and operating space, a time-varying threshold event-triggered control scheme together with exponential-type Lyapunov function is developed for the first time. We show that, with the proposed controller, the synchronization tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to a user-defined residual set within preassigned settling time, and never exceed the prescribed range despite unknown control direction and actuator faults, which solves the long-standing constraint issue with more flexibility due to the fact that the related constraints can be arbitrarily specific within the physically available range. Moreover, the convergence set is only dependent on fewer user-defined parameters rather than approximation errors, which provides an effective analysis technique to deal with the difficulty that the convergence accuracy is difficult to calculate quantitatively in the presence of unknown disturbance. Detailed simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Highly nonlinear systems exist in many real-world applications. The control design of such systems is challenging even for existing advanced control theory. Besides, when there is uncertainty in the nonlinear system and networked control strategy is considered, the problem will become even more complicated. To confront the problem, for the first time, this article provides a solution for the tracking control design of the nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) subject to uncertainty under the polynomial event-triggered mechanism (PETM). In the proposed tracking control scheme, the nonlinearity in the NCSs is effectively represented by a polynomial fuzzy model while the uncertainty is handled by the interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy sets. The tracking control objective is to properly design the event-triggered IT2 polynomial controller, which drives the states of the plant to track those of the stable reference system under the PETM. Different from the existing works in the literature, the event-triggering condition can be varied according to the state to improve the flexibility and capacity of event-triggered mechanism. Furthermore, in some works reported in the literature, the perfect match of premise variables is assumed. However, this assumption is extremely difficult to be fulfilled in the event-triggered control applications. To address the long-standing challenge of an intrinsic mismatch issue of the premise variables due to event-triggering mechanism, in the proposed analysis, the imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept is adopted along with the membership-function-dependent (MFD) approach to facilitate the stability analysis and control synthesis. The stability conditions are summarized as sum-of-squares (SOS). The H ∞ index is utilized to evaluate the tracking control performance, and the performance can be improved through minimizing the H ∞ index. A detailed simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Zadeh&#39;s extension principle (ZEP) is a fundamental concept in fuzzy set (FS) theory that enables crisp mathematical operation on FSs. A well-known shortcoming of ZEP is that the height of the output FS is determined by the lowest height of the input FSs. In this article, we introduce a generalized extension principle (GEP) that eliminates this weakness and provides flexibility and control over how membership values are mapped from input to output. Furthermore, we provide a computationally efficient point-based FS representation. In light of our new definition, we discuss two approaches to perform aggregation of FSs using the Choquet integral. The resultant integrals generalize prior work and lay a foundation for future extensions. Last, we demonstrate the extended integrals via a combination of synthetic and real-world examples.},

  abstract     = {For the output feedback control problem of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system with unknown premise variables (UPV) and external disturbances, a new observer-based controller H ∞ robust synthesis approach is proposed. To utilize the membership functions more effectively, in this article, a membership functions constructed vector is used as new premise variables. Then, the error items which are induced by UPV are decoupled into a new T-S fuzzy system. For the derived stability and robustness conditions in complex bilinear matrix inequality form, more relaxed sufficient conditions which can be solved directly by convex optimization method are proposed. Finally, a suspended floater control system based simulation process is carried out. The conservatism reduction effects among traditional and decoupling approaches are given, the state estimation effects of the observer and control performances are also verified.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the adaptive fuzzy output-feedback path-following control of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) via the event-triggered mechanism, in which the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate the uncertainties. By transforming the estimation errors, an adaptive fuzzy observer is established to estimate the kinematic states of the ASV, and a serial-parallel estimation model is fabricated based on this observer. By combining the tracking errors with the prediction errors between the observer and the serial-parallel estimation model, the composite adaptive laws are devised for the weights of the FLSs. Then, the event-triggered controller is developed in the channel of sensor to controller, in which the estimated kinematic states, the positional coordinates, and the heading angle of the ASV are sampled only when the triggering condition is violated. In this article, we put forward the problem of “jumps of virtual control laws” at the triggering instants, which commonly exists in the backstepping-based event-triggered control (ETC) in the channel of sensor to controller. To solve this problem, the dynamic surface filters are employed to generate the continuous substitutes for the virtual control laws. The proposed scheme can guarantee at least the similar control performance compared with its continuous alternatives while it importantly reduces the communication burden through the ETC and can enhance the estimation accuracy of the observer by applying the composite learning. All the errors are ensured to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through the numerical experiment.},

With consideration of fuzzy consensus and private interest of the moderator, this article presents two optimal feedback mechanisms with private interest (PIFM), which aim to minimize the consensus cost with an established consensus threshold and maximize the fuzzy consensus measure with a given cost budget. First, the fuzzy consensus measure is defined by means of specificity and coverage of information granule. Then, two PIFMs based on the minimum consensus cost and maximum fuzzy consensus are proposed to obtain the optimal modified individual opinions, and these two PIFMs are equivalently transformed into the mixed 0-1 programming models. In what follows, we develop an interactive CRP based on the proposed PIFMs, where the optimal modified individual opinions are considered as the modification references in the feedback mechanism.

For an arbitrary cardinal number κ (κ ≠ 0), we define seven operations and the point-wise order induced by ≤ on R κ (the set of all sequences indexed by κ and consisting of interval numbers). It is found that ( R,\≤), much like R (with the ordinary linear order), has some desirable properties; particularly, ≤ can be used to describe the corrected degree of possibility of an interval number is smaller than another. Generalizing the discovery process of ≤, we provide an understandable way to extend the ordinary linear order on R to a linear order on R (even on the plane R 2 ), which meets some specific requirement, and we give a clear description on the relation between the admissible orders and those we propose. Those urge us to take a look at the possible applications of ≤ (a delegation of linear orders on R).

  abstract     = {The existing approaches to interpretability in data-driven fuzzy models are reliant, heavily, on constraining different components of the model, and subsequently on sophisticated learning methods. This article, however, puts forward an alternative view of the interpretability of fuzzy models based on the concept of specificity. In addition to being free of constraints, this view can effectively deal with the subjectivity inherent in the linguistic interpretation of fuzzy sets and rules rather than suppressing it, as the constraint-based approaches do. Second to this semantic improvement, a specificity-based hierarchical fuzzy structure is also proposed to deal with the complexity-based aspect of interpretability. It achieves this purpose by means of a two-level hierarchy, in which a number of general rules at the first level localize both the inference and learning processes of the second level to a small number of relevant, specific rules. Such a localization, besides employment of the recursive least squares algorithm for parameter learning, reduces the computational burden of the model significantly, making it capable of real-time operation. The experimental results of applying the proposed fuzzy modeling approach to a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets confirm its efficacy in the sense of interpretability, accuracy, and computational simplicity.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is a powerful model for system state prediction and interpretable knowledge representation. Recent years have witnessed the tremendous efforts devoted to enhancing the basic FCM, such as introducing temporal factors, uncertainty or fuzzy rules to improve interpretation, and introducing fuzzy neural networks or wavelets to improve time series prediction. But how to achieve high-precision yet interpretable prediction in cross-domain real-life applications remains a great challenge. In this article, we propose a novel FCM extension called deep FCM (DFCM) for multivariate time series forecasting, in order to take both the advantage of FCM in interpretation and the advantage of deep neural networks in prediction. Specifically, to improve the predictive power, DFCM leverages a fully connected neural network to model connections (relationships) among concepts in a system, and a recurrent neural network to model unknown exogenous factors that have influences on system dynamics. Moreover, to foster model interpretability encumbered by the embedded deep structures, a partial derivative-based approach is proposed to measure the connection strengths between concepts in DFCM. An alternate function gradient descent algorithm is then proposed for parameter inference. The effectiveness of DFCM is validated over four publicly available datasets with the presence of seven baselines. DFCM indeed provides an important clue to building interpretable predictors for real-life applications.},

However, in some practical systems, the general behaviors, secret and nonsecret behaviors obtained by the intruder need to be expressed as fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets. Under this situation, the intruder makes inferences by fuzzy logic rather than classic logic, thus the notions of the fuzzy opacity measures are desired to be established. First, by means of the basic laws of fuzzy logic, a general fuzzy opacity measure, as a template, is presented, in this article, for the given generalized characterizations of secret and nonsecret behaviors. Moreover, a specific measure, called as fuzzy initial-final opacity (FIFO) measure, is investigated under the assumption that the secrets and nonsecrets can be coded into the initial-final state-pairs. In addition, two variants of FIFO measure are also proposed under the assumptions that the secrets and nonsecrets are only related to the initial-states or final-states. With these fuzzy opacity measures, the system designers can evaluate the opacity degree of the systems to be designed. To show the applicability of the fuzzy opacity measures to practical systems, we finally present an illustrative example of evaluating the location privacy protection systems in location-based services by means of the fuzzy opacity measures.},

  abstract     = {The use of incomplete probabilistic linguistic term sets (InPLTSs) can enrich the flexibility of qualitative decision-making information expression, especially in decision-making situations with high time pressure and insufficient knowledge. In this article, we develop a method for group decision-making (GDM) with incomplete probabilistic linguistic preference relations (InPLPRs), considering consistency and consensus simultaneously. First, to fully explore the ability of InPLTSs to express uncertain information, InPLTSs are specifically classified. Then, an expected multiplicative consistency of InPLPRs is introduced, which is conducive to estimating the missing information more accurately and effectively. Subsequently, considering the consensus of GDM problems, a consensus index, which considers the principle of majority and minority, is developed to measure the agreement degree among multiple individuals. Because individual InPLPRs may not all meet acceptable consistency after reaching consensus, a consistency- and consensus-improving mathematical programming model considering information distortion is presented. Then, to aggregate all individual preference relations into a collective one, a reliability-induced ordered weighted geometric operator is introduced, whose induced variable reliability is determined by the confidence degree and consistency index of individual preference relations. Furthermore, a multiphase algorithm with InPLPRs is developed to solve GDM problems. Finally, a numerical example of fire emergency decisions is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, and a detailed validity test and comparative analysis are conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses an adaptive fuzzy finite-time control for a class of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems with backlashlike hysteresis and stochastic disturbances. At first, a novel criterion of semiglobally finite-time stability in probability (SGFSP) is established based on Lyapunov function method. Under the proposed stability criterion, an adaptive fuzzy finite-time control scheme is designed. In the design process of the controller, command filter technique is introduced to overcome the problems of “explosion of complexity” and “singularity” inhered in the traditional adaptive finite-time control based on the backstepping method. Meanwhile, via constructing the corresponding error compensating systems, the effect of errors generated by the command filters is reduced, such that the original systems have more better tracking performance. To cope with the influence of backlashlike hysteresis input, an auxiliary system is constructed, in which the output signal is applied to compensate the effect of the hysteresis. It is shown that the tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood of original in finite time, and the closed-loop system is SGFSP under the constructed controller. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is further verified by two simulation examples.},

New types of observers, namely, switched fuzzy FD observers, are designed, which are switched at different triggering instants based on the online asynchronous premise reconstruction (APR) method. By employing new triggering instants-dependent Lyapunov functions (LFs) established via the idea of event interval partitioning, it is proved that the proposed FD observers can guarantee the stability and desired performance of the systems.

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the filtering problem and stability analysis for positive Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with time delay under L 1 -induced performance. Due to the importance of estimation of system states but the few filter design results on positive nonlinear systems, it is an attractive and meaningful topic well worth studying. In order to fully exploit and take advantage of the positivity of positive T-S fuzzy systems, many commonly used methods, for instance free-weighting matrix approach and similarity transformation are probably not suitable for positive systems. To address the hard-nut-to-crack problem, an auxiliary variable is introduced so that the augmentation approach can be employed to carry out the positivity and stability analysis of filtering error systems. In addition, another obstacle that cannot be ignored is the existence of nonconvex terms in the stability and positivity conditions. For getting around this barrier, some iterative linear matrix inequality algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, considering the weakness that these methods cannot guarantee the convergence to a numerical solution and the iterative process is exhaustive, we present an effective matrix decoupling method to convert the nonconvex conditions into convex ones in this article. Furthermore, a linear copositive Lyapunov function, which incorporates the positivity of system states and time delay at the same time is chosen so that the positivity characteristic of filtering error systems can be captured further. However, because of plenty of valuable information of membership functions being ignored, hence, the obtained results are conservative. For the sake of relaxing the conservativeness, the advanced piecewise-linear membership functions approximate method is utilized to facilitate the stability and positivity analysis. Therefore, the relaxed stability and positivity conditions, which are cast as sum of squares (SOS) are obtained and can be solved numerically. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed fuzzy filtering strategy with satisfying L 1 -induced performance are demonstrated by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a reinforced fuzzy radial basis function neural network (R-FRBFNN) classifier is proposed. It focuses on the development of methodologies of reinforced architecture to improve classification accuracy and enhance the robust capability based on two learning strategies. The two learning strategies are summarized: 1) R-FRBFNN designed via support vector (SV)-based fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering and softmax-based iterative reweighted least square (IRLS), which concentrate on improving the classification performance of R-FRBFNN; and 2) R-FRBFNN designed via SV-based FCM and softmax-based iterative quadratic programming (IQP), which focus on improving the robust abilities of the R-FRBFNN and reducing the effects of noise and outliers. The essential points of the proposed R-FRBFNN classifier are summarized as follows. a) The proposed R-FRBFNN consists of three phases: condition, conclusion, and inference. b) An SV-based FCM is considered for prioritizing the classification boundary and improving the classification performance of the proposed classifier. c) Three types of polynomials construct the conclusion phase. Two learning techniques are designed to update the coefficients of the polynomials. Softmax-based IRLS is a type of iterative learning technique based on Newton&#39;s method. Softmax-based IQP is more robust and avoids the degradation of generalization capabilities caused by outliers and noisy data. d) In the concept of reinforced architecture, SV-based FCM imposes compensation (membership degrees) on learning techniques according to the data characteristics encountered in the inference phase. Experimental results reported for benchmark data and outliers/noisy datasets demonstrate that the proposed classifier shows improved classification performance compared with other previously studied methods.},

By adopting the idea of the PROMETHEE II method, we develop three different sorting decision-making schemes on IFVISs, which consist of the subtraction of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, sorting functions, and intimacy coefficients.

  abstract     = {When it comes to time-series forecasting, it is crucial to learn the intricate temporal relationship between past and future, and historical information is of paramount importance for this purpose. Traditional neuro-fuzzy systems generally resort to an empirical (offline) method to determine the number of past instances (i.e., historical information) required for a particular model, hence often unsuitable in an online time-series scenario. In this article, we propose a Bayesian neuro-fuzzy inference system (BaNFIS), where the temporal dependence on past instances is estimated with an online Bayesian probabilistic mechanism, and the uncertainty associated with real-world data is handled by the fuzzy inference system. The BaNFIS retains historical information only as per necessity and employs it in two ways: globally or locally. Moreover, an online learning method is employed here to update the BaNFIS parameters. Hence, the BaNFIS is able to capture both the system dynamics and uncertainty efficiently in an online manner. Three real-world time-series problems are employed here to evaluate the online performance of the BaNFIS compared to seven state-of-the-art neuro-fuzzy methods both under standard train–test and prequential test–train protocols. Numerical results clearly indicate that the BaNFIS provides a statistically improved prediction performance than its peers in terms of accuracy.},

First, the measured output is adequately sampled for frequently checking a delay-dependent event-triggered condition, which reduces the number of data transmissions and controller updates. Then, an artificial time-delay estimator is used to approximate the output derivative. Based on linear matrix inequalities, a heuristic algorithm is investigated to design an event-triggered sliding mode controller, which reveals how to choose the maximum sampling interval that maintains the estimation accuracy and preserves the stability under fast event triggering.

However, this assumption does not consider the fact that people often express their opinions in a linguistic way. Particularly, for linguistic opinions, an important point to be highlighted in computing with words (CW) is that words mean different things to different people. In this article, following the idea of personalized individual semantics (PIS) model, we propose the PIS-based linguistic opinions dynamics model (PIS-LOD model) in the framework of bounded confidence effects. Then, some desired properties in the PIS-LOD model are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we design the detailed simulation experiments to show that the individuals&#39; familiarity (which refers to the knowledge on others&#39; semantics) and the PISs&#39; differences have a great influence on the stabilized time, distributions of the extreme and moderate opinions, linguistic opinions distribution, semantics distribution, number of clusters, consensus reaching and the extremely small clusters.

The convergence of optimal values is also proved. Some numerical experiments are presented for illustrating the performance and the effectiveness of the new approach.

First, we analyze this generalization error under finite solution space, and prove two theorems by Hoeffding&#39;s inequality, where one of them relies on a reasonable hypothesis. Then, we discuss the situation in which the solution space is infinite, and propose a theorem and a corollary by another hypothesis, where the results under finite solution space are used in the proofs. Finally, we bound the generalization error from the perspective of the FCM algorithm&#39;s convergence, where we take Taylor expansion to transform the risk function to the linear form and estimate the upper bound of its Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. The hypotheses proposed in this article are all intuitive and common phenomena in practice.

In this article, a novel multilayer ensemble learning model with first-order evolving fuzzy systems as its building blocks is introduced. The proposed approach can effectively learn from streaming data on a sample-by-sample basis and self-organizes its multilayered system structure and meta-parameters in a feedforward, noniterative manner. Benefiting from its multilayered distributed representation learning ability, the ensemble system not only demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on various problems, but also offers high level of system transparency and explainability. Theoretical justifications and experimental investigation show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed concept and general principles.},

Compared with those recent results in the literature, two key performance indexes, i.e., reducing the conservatism and alleviating the online computational burden, can be improved together while the off-line computational burden increases as a tradeoff but is still affordable from the point of algorithmic complexity. As a result, the efficiency of fuzzy stabilization is enhanced and thus its scope of application can be enlarged much more than before.

  abstract     = {In this article, a new adaptive fuzzy iterative learning control (AFILC) method is proposed for the tracking control of nonlinear uncertain high-speed train (HST) operation systems that have both randomly varying iteration lengths and speed and input force constraints. To cope with unknown time-varying basic resistance coefficients, an adaptive learning control law and two fully projected parameter learning laws are designed. The nonparametric and unknown additional resistance in the HST operation system is compensated and integrated into the control law by means of a newly constructed adaptive iterative learning fuzzy system. Moreover, due to the complex operation environment and various uncertainties, disturbances and emergencies, trains are often early or late compared with the prearranged timetable rather than being strictly on time in the repeated operations of each day, which leads to randomly varying operation lengths for actual HST running. Furthermore, as the traveling speed of modern HSTs increases, both the train&#39;s speed and input force should be constrained to guarantee the safe operation. Fortunately, the proposed AFILC can not only actively manipulate the position, speed, and input force of the train into prespecified and constrained ranges for safe operation but can also make both the position and speed tracking control errors converge to zero over the whole desired and scheduled time interval, even if the actual time interval varies in each operation of the HST. Simulations on a practical train operation system similar to China Railway High-speed (CRH)-3 train are further presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article describes a novel approach to the problem of developing explainable machine learning models. We consider a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model representing a highway path planning policy for autonomous highway driving [1]. The model constitutes a mapping from the continuous multidimensional state space characterizing vehicle positions and velocities to a discrete set of actions in longitudinal and lateral direction. It is obtained by applying a customized version of the double deep Q-network learning algorithm [2]. The main idea is to approximate the DRL model with a set of IF-THEN rules that provide an alternative interpretable model, which is further enhanced by visualizing the rules. This concept is rationalized by the universal approximation properties of the rule-based models with fuzzy predicates. The proposed approach includes a learning engine composed of zero-order fuzzy rules, which generalize locally around the prototypes by using multivariate function models. The adjacent (in the data space) prototypes, which correspond to the same action, are further grouped and merged into the so-called MegaClouds reducing significantly the number of fuzzy rules. The input selection method is based on ranking the density of the individual inputs. Experimental results show that the specific DRL agent can be interpreted by approximating with families of rules of different granularity. The method is computationally efficient and can be potentially extended to addressing the explainability of the broader set of fully connected deep neural network models.},

The fuzzy approximator is utilized to estimate the unknown functions. The significance and challenges of this article are to establish a new error conversion mechanism and design corresponding BLF that can be integrated into fixed-time control design to present a singularity-free adaptive fuzzy fixed-time control scheme. Benefits of the proposed adaptive fixed-time controller in comparison to the current approaches are that it cannot cause the singularity issue appearing in backstepping-based fixed-time control design and ensures quick transient response. Combining with Lyapunov stability theory, the boundedness of the closed-loop signals is ensured, and the position tracking error can be constrained in the user-defined performance boundaries.

On the one hand, the deterministic adaptive robust control put forward will guarantee the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of gait constraint deviation and parameter estimation error. On the other hand, for uncertainties and external disturbance (possibly fast time-varying), which will arise in the two-DOF LLERs inevitably, we suppose that these uncertainties and disturbances are bounded, and their bounds are lying within the fuzzy sets, which can be characterized by membership functions; with such descriptions and control performance analysis, a novel cooperative game with two players participated will be formulated to seek the Pareto optimal solutions for the control gains of deterministic adaptive robust control proposed, and furthermore, the existence of optimal solutions is also shown by invoking a numerical technique. Eventually, the simulation results presented have verified the effectiveness of our proposed methodology on improving rehabilitation training of lower limbs.},

An appropriate fuzzy integral switching manifold that fully accommodates the system features is designed to completely reject the matched perturbation without amplifying the unmatched one. To facilitate the synthesis of the high-level controller (HLC), the sliding-mode dynamics (SMD) is transformed into an augmented form. Thanks to the adoptions of a novel singular perturbation Lyapunov function, Finsler&#39;s lemma, as well as the fixed-point principle, the existence and uniqueness of the solution and the exponential admissibility for the augmented SMD are analyzed. A solution for the designed HLC is further provided. To guarantee the sliding motion, a fuzzy integral sliding-mode controller (FISMC) is synthesized by analyzing the sliding motion reachability. An adaptive FISMC is also given to deal with the unknown upper bounds of the matched perturbation. Finally, the applicability of the developed FISMC strategy is testified by a practical example.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have been successfully applied to time series forecasting. However, it still remains challenging to handle multivariate long nonstationary time series, such as EEG data, which may change rapidly and have patterns of trend. To overcome this limitation, in this article, we propose a fast prediction model to deal with multivariate long nonstationary time series based on the combination of elastic net and high order fuzzy cognitive map (HFCM), which is termed as ElasticNet HFCM . The designed FCM models each variable by one node and the high-order FCM helps to capture the patterns of trend. A case study on predicting human actions through the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data in the form of multichannel long nonstationary time series is investigated based on the proposed prediction model. Specifically, we first predict EEG signals based on the historical data, then a 1D-convolutionary neural network (1D-CNN) is developed to classify the predicted time series. The experimental results on the Grasp-and-Lift dataset show that the proposal can predict the EEG data with lower prediction error compared with the other regression methods. The area under the curve scores obtained on the Grasp-and-Lift dataset by 1D-CNN are higher than those obtained by state-of-the-art classification methods for EEG data in most cases. These results illustrate that the proposal can predict and classify multivariate long nonstationary time series with high accuracy and efficiency.},

To avoid the curse of dimensionality, this article first proposes a rough evidential K-NN (REK-NN) classification rule in the framework of rough set theory. Based on a reformulated K-NN rough set model, REK-NN selects features and thus reduces complexity by minimizing a proposed neighborhood pignistic decision error rate, which considers both Bayes decision error and spatial information among samples in feature space. In contrast to existing rough set-based feature selection methods, REK-NN is a synchronized rule rather than a stepwise one, in the sense that feature selection and learning are performed simultaneously. In order to further handle data with large sample size, we derive a distributed REK-NN method and implement it in the Apache Spark. The theoretical analysis of the classifier generalization error bound is finally presented. It is shown that the distributed REK-NN achieves good performances while drastically reducing the number of features and consuming less runtime and memory. Numerical experiments conducted on real-world datasets validate our conclusions.},

A new AET mechanism with many advantages, such as no singular problem, no degradation into a traditional time-triggered mechanism, fewer triggers, and no Zeno behavior, is constructed.

  abstract     = {Reasonable risk models in hazardous material transportation are of practical significance, for safeguarding the lives and properties, protecting the natural environment, and facilitating sustainable development. The existing risk models can be classified into summation risk and maximum risk models, which result in overreliance on overall or local risk. To overcome these problems, in this article, we present two novel risk models considering different aggregation methods on local risks. The first model is supported by an ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator, which assigns the weights according to the position of the segment risk in the process of risk aggregation, and the second model is supported by state variable weight (SVW) vector, which adjusts the weights on segments according to the change of segment risk values. Generally speaking, an OWA risk model is used under the situation with complete weighting information, whereas an SVW risk model could be used under the situation with incomplete weighting information. Based on the analysis for variable weight mechanism, we show that both models could effectively balance the overall risk with the local risks assisted by weights variety. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed risk models.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the finite-time tracking control for multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear nonstrict feedback systems with actuator faults and saturations. First, a fuzzy state observer is constructed to approximate the unmeasured system states, where the restrictions of the known actuator faults are removed from the observer design. Based on the state observer, a novel adaptive output feedback control is then proposed to achieve favorable tracking performance even if actuator saturations and faults occur. Also, the nonlinear functions in the MIMO nonlinear systems are not required to follow the linearly parameterization or growth conditions making the control design more generally available. Furthermore, the dynamic surface control technique is adopted to avoid tedious analytic computations inherent in the backstepping procedure. It can be proved that the proposed control can not only guarantee the closed-loop system states bounded, but also regulate the tracking errors to a small neighborhood around the equilibrium in finite time despite the existence of the actuator saturations and faults. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

In this article, fuzzy deep learning systems using fuzzy memristive modeling methods are presented. One key issue in memristive modeling is the device variation issue due to device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations. It is very difficult to distinguish the intermediate memristive states in a multilevel memristor. A fuzzy modeling method is therefore proposed to define the memristive states in a dynamic way. In addition, fuzzy deep learning systems are presented for fuzzy pattern recognition such as image recognition. To the authors&#39; best knowledge, this is the first work utilizing memristive fuzzy deep learning systems to realize image recognition. The expected input and output in the memristive fuzzy deep learning systems are refined via a bidirectional fuzzy rule. The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy methods has been verified with comprehensive methods, such as single-layer neural networks, multi-layer neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor method. Another highlight of the proposed fuzzy deep learning system is that there is a great reduction in memory and a significant increase in the speed for image recognition tasks with the same level of testing accuracy.},

Moreover, due to various attitudes and interests, some DMs may adopt noncooperative behaviors to further benefit themselves in LSGDM. To cope with these issues, this study develops an adaptive consensus framework to support heterogeneous LSGDM. A cosine similarity based optimization model is constructed and its analytical solution is derived to directly obtain the collective priority vector of the group using heterogeneous preferences. An extended k-means algorithm is then used to classify DMs. Subsequently, a two-stage uninorm-based behavior management method is developed to generate personalized weight feedback to each DM and subcluster according to their cooperative and noncooperative degrees in the consensus-reaching process.

This is the case, for instance, when for some reason, one or more experts refrain from evaluating certain criteria for an alternative. In these situations, approaches using n-dimensional fuzzy sets and hesitant fuzzy sets are not appropriate. This is because the first approach works only with a fixed dimension, whereas the second modifies the information, fusing equal evaluations given by different experts for the same pair of alternatives/criteria or adjusting the elements so that an order defined on hesitant fuzzy sets can be used. As such, in addition to being a natural extension of n-dimensional fuzzy sets, multidimensional fuzzy sets contemplate the aforementioned situation without modifying their elements. In this article, we introduce the concept of multidimensional fuzzy sets as a generalization of the n-dimensional fuzzy sets in which the elements can have different dimensions. We begin by presenting a way to generate a family of partial orders and conditions under which these sets have a lattice structure. Moreover, the concepts of admissible orders on multidimensional fuzzy sets and m-ary multidimensional aggregation functions with respect to an admissible order are defined and studied. Finally, we provide two multicriteria group decision-making methods based on these m-ary multidimensional aggregation functions.},

However, the probability information is expressed as the crisp numbers, which is usually difficult to be estimated and information losses may exist. To capture the inherent fuzziness and vagueness of decision information more comprehensively and accurately, in this article, we introduce a novel concept named dual linguistic term set (DLTS), which consists of two linguistic variables. The DLTS can allow the decision makers to express the probabilistic information by the means of linguistic variables. To describe the hesitant information of the decision makers, a more general concept named hesitant fuzzy DLTS is developed. Afterwards, a multicriteria decision making method with dual linguistic information is proposed based on the normal cloud model. To do so, the DLTS is first transformed into an equivalent two-tuple consisting of two independent normal clouds. Then, new multiplication operation and power operation of normal clouds are defined to obtain the expectation for each attribute value. After aggregating the evaluation information, we further develop a new score function to rank alternatives reasonably. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, also some comparisons and analyses are provided to show the advantages of the proposed method.},

In classical task-space controls, robots are often assumed to operate in the task space, where singularities do not exist. Such an assumption limits their potential applications in various workspaces. To address the potential singularity issue associated with Euler-Lagrange systems, this article proposes an adaptive fuzzy-region-based control for Euler-Lagrange systems with kinematically singular configurations. Singular regions are described by the potential energy function. The proposed controller includes a joint-space control, which is active when the system approaches singular regions, and a task-space control, which is used to track the desired trajectory. Therefore, the system can smoothly transit from singular regions to nonsingular regions or can achieve singularity avoidance during the tracking task. In order to achieve singularity avoidance while reducing control effort, the coefficients of the potential energy function are adjusted dynamically based on the designed fuzzy system. Rigorous analysis shows that singularity issues can be properly handled, and the asymptotic stability of the system is ensured. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Consequently, in such cases, experts often prefer to use the set of the unbalanced linguistic term to direct the appraisal for the problems. In this article, we tend to propose a method that is newly designed to deal with a set of unbalanced linguistic terms. In this direction, we initially propose an algorithm to represent unbalanced linguistic information via a multiplicative linguistic label set that has a global inconsistent linguistic term distribution. Furthermore, in light of the Herrera and Martínez, “2-tuple linguistic model,” we develop a novel 2-tuple approach for the unbalanced linguistic set, which is based on the notion of minimum distance measure. Finally, to validate the proposed model in the physical realm and to demonstrate the functioning of the method, a numerical example is being elucidated.

  abstract     = {As an important branch in the field of soft computing, TSK fuzzy systems have been diversely applied to supervised learning in recent years. However, real-world data may contain label noise, which has a negative impact on supervised learning. Label noise samples change the distribution of samples in each class, mislead learning algorithms and make classification problems more complicated. There are various sources of label noise, such as wrong assignment of labels during the data collection, contamination during the data storage, and so on. Thus, it is usually costly and time-consuming to obtain data with no label noise. When dealing with label noise data, existing TSK fuzzy system algorithms still have room for improvement. This article proposes a robust TSK fuzzy system based on semisupervised learning for label noise data (RTSK-FS-SS). By introducing an intuitionistic fuzzy set method, the proposed algorithm can detect label noise samples. An improved learning vector quantization is further adopted to overcome the challenge that traditional unsupervised learning-based antecedent part generation processes unable to make full use of the label information of training samples. Finally, we discard the label of suspicious samples and a consequent parameter learning method based on semisupervised learning is proposed.

This is a crucial and widely used tool in various tasks. The key issue in top-k words selection is how to measure the similarity between words. One popular and effective solution is to use a word embedding-based similarity measure, which represents words as low-dimensional vectors and measures the similarities between words according to the similarity of the vectors, using a metric. However, most word embedding methods only consider the local proximity properties of two words in a corpus. To mitigate this issue. In this article, we propose to use association rules for measuring word similarity at a global level, and a fuzzy similarity measure for top-k words selection that jointly encodes the local and the global similarities. Experiments on a real-world query task with three benchmark datasets, i.e., TREC-disk 4&amp;5, WT10G, and RCV1, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.},

After that a nonlinear fuzzy state observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasurable states, by employing the fuzzy logic systems for identifying the unknown compounded nonlinear functions, which releases the limitation in the existing references that the state observer needs to be linear in the presence of dead-zone output nonlinearity. Then, to reduce the effect of unknown dead-zone coefficients, an adaptive compensation mechanism is introduced by using the characteristic of hyperbolic tangent function, which can replace the widely used Nussbaum-type function-based control strategy. Furthermore, a novel DSC method based on the nonlinear filters is proposed, which not only avoids the issue of explosion of complexity inherent in the backstepping procedure, but also improves the system control performance. Under the certain assumptions, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved by use of Lyapunov function stability theory. Finally, the applicability of the proposed control method is rigorously verified by a single-link robot arm simulation example.},

Yager&#39;s ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators possess the properties of idempotence, monotonicity, compensativeness, and commutativity. This article aims to address whether or not T1OWA operators possess these properties when the inputs and associated weights are fuzzy sets instead of crisp numbers. To this end, a partially ordered relation of fuzzy sets is defined based on the fuzzy maximum (join) and fuzzy minimum (meet) operators of fuzzy sets, and an alpha-equivalently-ordered relation of groups of fuzzy sets is proposed. Moreover, as the extension of orness and andness of an Yager&#39;s OWA operator, joinness and meetness of a T1OWA operator are formalized, respectively. Then, based on these concepts and the representation theorem of T1OWA operators, we prove that T1OWA operators hold the same properties as Yager&#39;s OWA operators possess, i.e., idempotence, monotonicity, compensativeness, and commutativity. Various numerical examples and a case study of diabetes diagnosis are provided to validate the theoretical analyses of these properties in aggregating multiple sources of uncertain information and improving integrated diagnosis, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue monitoring is very important for driving safety, and many intricate factors while driving make fatigue monitoring harder. To effectively predict driving fatigue, this article proposes a new deep learning framework called TSK-type convolution recurrent fuzzy network (TCRFN) based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In TCRFN, the convolution block is first introduced to extract spatial dependencies from EEG signals. Furthermore, since EEG noise has a strong spatial dependence, this convolutional neural networks is used to reduce the impact of noise. Additionally, a new local feedback method in fuzzy neural network is proposed to process the EEG signals, which can better capture the temporal dependencies from EEG signals. Finally, a logarithmic spatial firing layer function is used in the proposed TCRFN. The activation performance of this function is smoother, which allows more feature numbers and provides better prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed TCRFN model has better antinoise performance and prediction accuracy compared with other widely used and state-of-the-art models.},

Moreover, by using the finite-time stability criterion, it is proven that the proposed control strategy can ensure the boundedness of the whole system variables and achieve all the state tracking errors evolve within the predesigned performance regions in finite time.

  abstract     = {In this article, an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) method for monocular camera mounted three-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robots (OMRs) is proposed using a novel fuzzy integral sliding mode control (FISMC) method. Most of the existing studies for IBVS of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) have focused only on kinematics, even though no consideration for the OMR dynamics, actuators, and target motion can lead to much degraded performance. Accordingly, a camera mounted OMR is first modeled considering the OMR dynamics, actuator dynamics, and disturbance effects of the target object motion. On the basis of the OMR model, a dynamic IBVS method (i.e., IBVS based on kinematics, dynamics, and actuators) is then proposed to replace the kinematic IBVS method (i.e., IBVS based only on kinematics) such that the effects of the OMR dynamics, actuators, and target motion can be accommodated by using the FISMC method. In particular, the proposed FISMC method for the IBVS of OMRs can eliminate the reaching phase to make the states remain on the sliding surface all the time and improve the transient performance significantly when compared with the existing methods. The robust stability of the overall system using the proposed system is demonstrated by Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation results are also provided to show that where the kinematic IBVS achieves much degraded performance owing to the OMR dynamics and target motion, the proposed FISMC-based dynamic IBVS method compensates for these effects and achieve the satisfactory feature point tracking performance, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This scheduling is complicated and involves various factors; thus, the shop scheduling problem of a PCB prototyping assembly is regarded as a multiobjective permutation flow shop scheduling problem (MOPFSP). A mathematical model with four objective functions is built based on the characteristics of a PCB prototyping assembly shop. In this article an aggregation-based approach is designed to aggregate multiple objective function values into the similarity of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (sIFSs). This approach is adopted as a fitness function assignment strategy and is combined with the optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) to build a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm: the OFA based on sIFSs (OFA-sIFSs). To verify the performance of OFA-sIFSs, six congress on evolutionary computation benchmark test functions, ten MOPFSP benchmark instances and a practical problem for a PCB prototyping assembly are solved by OFA-sIFSs and three state-of-the-art algorithms. Three types of similarity measures are evaluated. During the process of testing, four performance metrics, statistical analysis, and business software are employed. The results of this study suggest that OFA-sIFSs can be used to solve the MOPFSP and have better performances compared with the other three algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the design of fuzzy rule-based models, in the presence of high-dimensional data, we are faced with conceptual and algorithmic challenges. Conceptually, as the dimensionality of data increases, the notion of distance starts to be questionable, resulting in the well-known concentration effect. This has a direct detrimental effect given the fact that the distance is used in fuzzy clustering, using which the condition parts of the rules are being formed. Computationally, with the increase of dimensionality, the computing overhead becomes significant and has to be carefully addressed. In this article, we advocate a construction of distributed fuzzy rule-based models, where instead of a single monolithic (multivariable) rule-based model, we construct a collection of low-dimensional (in particular, 1- or 2-D) rule-based models and aggregate their results through some linear transformations. A suite of experimental studies realized using publicly available data are reported along with a comparative analysis engaging accuracy criteria and computing overhead. Interestingly, building distributed models exhibits some tangible benefits over the construction of the monolithic rule-based models. In terms of accuracy and computing costs, the gains of 1-D rule-based models with optimal linkage matrix (on average) are around 43.46\% and 98.85\%, respectively.},

A geometric consistency index is then proposed to measure the inconsistency of TFMPRs. By capturing row fuzziness proportionalities and the difference between the row increasing and decreasing part fuzziness indices, this article establishes two logarithmic least square models to find normalized fuzzy weights from two kinds of TFMPRs. The two logarithmic least square models are further integrated into one whose analytic solution is found by the method of Lagrange multipliers. A novel method is put forward to check the acceptability of TFMPRs by both examining acceptable consistency and acceptable fuzziness. This article devises a parametric defuzzification approach to obtain the real-valued weights of criteria for aggregating the local normalized fuzzy weights into the global fuzzy weights in the triangular FAHP. A comparative analysis of the proposed model with existing fuzzy eigenvector methods and fuzzy average methods is carried out by a numerical example with four TFMPRs to clarify its validity and merits.

First, a vector representation of complex-valued distribution is defined, as well as the definitions of compatibility and conflict degrees between complex-valued distributions. Based on that, the information quality measure of complex-valued distribution is devised by leveraging the concept of Gini entropy. After that, we study some special cases of the information quality measure in maximally certain and uncertain complex-valued distributions. Additionally, a uniform fusion method for complex-valued distributions is proposed on the basis of the complex-valued information quality as an initial feasible basis of decision-making. Taking into account a credibility measure in terms of the subsets of information sources, a weighted fusion method is then presented for complex-valued distributions. Particularly, the weighted fusion method can achieve the highest quality of the fused result from the associated aggregations of information that are modeled in complex-valued distributions. Finally, some examples are illustrated to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Like k-means and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), fuzzy c-means (FCM) with soft partition has also become a popular clustering algorithm and still is extensively studied. However, these algorithms and their variants still suffer from some difficulties such as determination of the optimal number of clusters which is a key factor for clustering quality. A common approach for overcoming this difficulty is to use the trial-and-validation strategy, i.e., traversing every integer from large number like √n to 2 until finding the optimal number corresponding to the peak value of some cluster validity index. But it is scarcely possible to naturally construct an adaptively agglomerative hierarchical cluster structure as using the trial-and-validation strategy. Even if possible, existing different validity indices also lead to different number of clusters. To effectively mitigate the problems while motivated by convex clustering, in this article we present a centroid auto-fused hierarchical fuzzy c-means method (CAF-HFCM) whose optimization procedure can automatically agglomerate to form a cluster hierarchy, more importantly, yielding an optimal number of clusters without resorting to any validity index. Although a recently proposed robust-learning fuzzy c-means (RL-FCM) can also automatically obtain the best number of clusters without the help of any validity index, so-involved three hyperparameters need to adjust expensively, conversely, our CAF-HFCM involves just one hyperparameter which makes the corresponding adjustment relatively easier and more operational. Further, as an additional benefit from our optimization objective, the CAF-HFCM effectively reduces the sensitivity to the initialization of clustering performance. Moreover, our proposed CAF-HFCM method is able to be straightforwardly extended to various variants of FCM. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CAF-HFCM.},

Based on the aggregated probabilities of the alternatives in the group of the decision makers, the normalized-prediction selection rate (NPSR) is defined and calculated accordingly. The alternative with maximal NPSR is selected as the correct answer, whereas the accuracy of the correct alternative selection (CAS) is guaranteed by two propositions. The iterative algorithm is first devised to determine the ranking of the alternatives depending on the CAS. For the proposed method, the decision makers require no modification of the opinions as can avoid the consensus problem, and the CAS can be obtained under the circumstances that the correct information is held by the minority of the group.

  abstract     = {This article studies secure control problems for T-S fuzzy systems equipped with a Luenberger-observer-based anomaly detector, when simultaneously subjected to stealthy sensor and actuator attacks. A key issue is that stealthy attacks can maliciously compromise control inputs, sensor outputs, and fuzzy controller&#39;s premise variables which depend on measurable states, while bypassing detection from an anomaly detector, so that they may leave the conventional control schemes invalid. To solve it, 1) by considering the impact of sensor attacks on premise variables of fuzzy controller, a new fuzzy controller with reliable premise variables constructed by the trusted sensor&#39;s and introduced filter&#39;s outputs is proposed and also a design condition for the controller with the guaranteed desired H ∞ performance is given via the property of fuzzy product inference engines. 2) With the aid of the detection mechanism and attack&#39;s structural information, an upper bound for stealthy attacks is given, which from the defender&#39;s viewpoint quantifies a class of stealthy attacks. Based on the bound, a novel adaptive attack compensator is presented such that the developed fuzzy controller with the compensator guarantees the stability of the attacked systems with a desired control performance. Three illustrative examples validate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a novel principled approach to passage-based (document) retrieval using fuzzy set theory. The approach formulates passage score combination according to general relevance decision principles. By operationalizing these principles using aggregation operators of fuzzy set theory, our approach justifies the common heuristics of taking the maximum constituent passage score as the overall document score. Experiments show that this heuristics is only the near best, with some fuzzy set aggregation operators stipulated in our approach being better methods. The significance of our principled approach is the applicability of many passage score combination methods, potentially bringing further performance enhancement. Experiments on several text retrieval conference collections demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than document-based retrieval. While recent works in the literature mostly employ document-based rather than passage-based retrieval due to the common conception that document length normalization solves the problem of varying document lengths, our results show that document length normalization alone is not sufficient, especially in pseudo-relevance feedback retrieval.},

Furthermore, we aim to design a fuzzy nonfragile controller, which can ensure that the systems under consideration are stochastically stable as well as extended dissipative. To this end, through constructing a mode-dependent Lyapunov function and applying the convex optimization theory, some sufficient conditions that are independent of the singular perturbation parameter ∈ are derived. Besides, a set of controller gains is also obtained by solving the aforesaid conditions. Based on the effectiveness of the controller, the technique to obtain the upper bound of the singular perturbation parameter is developed, and an improved system performance related to such an upper bound is achieved.

Compared with existing results, a main contribution of this article is to design a piecewise switched nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) for arbitrary switching systems to estimate unknown compound disturbances, which consist of external disturbances and approximate errors. Different from the common adaptive laws, the piecewise switched adaptive laws are designed, which reduces the conservativeness of controller design. In order to solve the difficulties caused by input delay and computational complexity, the Padé approximation and dynamic surface control technology are introduced, respectively. By utilizing the adaptive backstepping technique and the Lyapunov stability theorem, a novel controller based on the piecewise switched NDO is developed. It is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. The disturbance estimation errors and the tracking errors converge on a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The research on the problem of learning FCM from the available time series is outstanding. Many batch FCM learning methods have been proposed to address this issue and the performance of these methods is satisfactory. However, these batch-learning methods are difficult to cope with large-scale data sets (for example, the memory in computers is not enough to store all instances) and real-time streaming data, leading to the failure of real-time and online analysis of complex systems. In this article, unlike the existing batch learning methods, such as evolutionary and regression-based methods, we first extend the FCM learning to an online setting, and then develop an effective algorithm based on a follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL)-proximal style learning algorithm to address the online FCM learning problem, termed as OFCM. The performance of OFCM is validated on constructed benchmark data sets, including synthetic data sets, and gene regulatory network reconstruction data sets. The experimental results demonstrate the merits of OFCM, which can effectively solve online FCM learning problems.},

An absorption property with fuzzy rules interpretation is outlined, and the use of n-TSK-FIS as a uninorm is explained.

Following the adaptive backstepping design framework, the tangent barrier Lyapunov functions are introduced to the integrated design to address the problems in such systems. Fuzzy logic systems are used to identify the unknown smooth functions and unknown parameters. An input-driven observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable states. To distinguish the conventional deterministic dead zone models, the output of dead zone is uncertainty. The form of indeterminate dead zone as a combination of a liner and a disturbance-like term is extended by the fuzzy algorithms. Even though the output of dead zone is fuzzy and adopting the integrated design, the proposed fuzzy controller can ensure that all the signals in the closed-loop systems are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded and guarantee the tracking performance.

  abstract     = {The conventional fuzzy C -means (FCM) algorithm is not robust to noise and its rate of convergence is generally impacted by data distribution. Consequently, it is challenging to develop FCM-related algorithms that have good performance and require less computing time. In this article, we elaborate on a comprehensive FCM-related algorithm for image segmentation. To make FCM robust, we first utilize a morphological grayscale reconstruction (MGR) operation to filter observed images before clustering, which guarantees noise-immunity and image detail-preservation. Since real images can generally be approximated by sparse coefficients in a tight wavelet frame system, feature spaces of observed and filtered images can be obtained. Taking such features to be clustered, we investigate an improved FCM model in which a sparse regularization term is introduced into the objective function of FCM. We design a three-step iterative algorithm to solve the sparse regularization-based FCM model, which is constructed by the Lagrangian multiplier method, hard-threshold operator, and normalization operator, respectively. Such an algorithm can not only perform well for image segmentation, but also come with high computational efficiency. To further enhance the segmentation accuracy, we use MGR to filter the label set generated by clustering. Finally, a large number of supporting experiments and comparative studies with other FCM-related algorithms available in the literature are provided. The obtained results for synthetic, medical and color images indicate that the proposed algorithm has good ability for multiphase image segmentation, and performs better than other alternative FCM-related algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm requires less time than most of the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Some relevant notions in fuzzy set theory are those of triangular-(t)- norm, t-conorm, and negation, which provide a systematic way of defining set-theoretic operations, or, from other point of view, logical connectives. For instance, the majority of fuzzy implications are directly derived from these operators, so they play a prominent role in fuzzy control theory or in approximate reasoning. This incites the search of suitable t-norms, t-conorms, and negations for solving each specific problem. In this article, we propose a procedure, that we call induction, for designing them on spaces of lattice-valued maps. Concretely, for each family of operators (t-norms, t-conorms, or negations) indexed in the domain set, we may induce an operator of the same kind, so that our method offers a great flexibility in the design task. It may be applied to well-known fuzzy objects as interval-valued or type-2 fuzzy sets. Nevertheless, the theory is formally developed for arbitrary bounded lattices.},

  abstract     = {Information granules are fundamental, abstract, and easy-to-operate constructs supporting the human-centered handling way in granular computing (GrC). One of the basic properties of information granules comes with its hierarchy. Information granularity is the quantification expression of hierarchy of an information granule. Forming information granules with multigranularity to hierarchically describe the nature of data is an important task in GrC. In this article, a cone-shaped fuzzy set-based granular description method with multigranularity is proposed for multidimensional data. Its fundamental idea is to realize the synergy of quantification of information granularity and a hierarchical description of data by means of α-cuts of cone-shaped fuzzy sets. The proposed method first partition the entire data set into a series of data chunks. Then, some mutually nonoverlapping cone-shaped fuzzy sets are constructed by optimally determining their cores and support radii in terms of the coverage of α-cuts of these fuzzy sets to the data located in individual chunks and the corresponding specificity. Finally, by implementing α-cuts processing for these constructed cone-shaped fuzzy sets, a collection of families of hyper-spherical information granules used to hierarchically describe the structural characteristics of the data set are completely emerged. Besides, the quality of the resulting families of hyper-spherical information granules is evaluated along the granular perspective and the application perspective, respectively. A series of experimental studies concerning several synthetic and publicly available data sets are covered. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed granular description method of data with multigranularity.},

Different from the existing T-S fuzzy MNNs, the reaction and diffusion phenomena are considered, which make the presented model more applicable. A fuzzy AETSDC scheme is proposed for the first time, in which different AETSDC mechanisms will be applied for different fuzzy rules. For each fuzzy rule, the corresponding AETSDC mechanism can be promptly adaptively adjusted based on the current and last sampled signals. So the fuzzy AETSDC scheme can effectively save the limited communication resources for the considered system. By introducing a suitable Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional, new stability and stabilization criteria are established for T-S fuzzy MNNs with RDTs. Meanwhile, the desired fuzzy AETSDC gains are obtained. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the superiority of the fuzzy AETSDC scheme and the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Classifier fusion remains an effective method to improve classification performance. In applications, the classifiers learnt using different attributes may work with various frames of discernment (FoD) of classification. There generally exist more or less complementary knowledge among these classifiers. However, how to efficiently combine such classifiers under different FoD is a challenging problem. In this article, we propose a new method for classifier fusion with different FoD based on the belief functions, which allow to well represent and deal with uncertain information. The credal transformation rules are developed to map the various FoD into a common one. It allows to transfer the probability (or mass of belief) of one class in the given FoD not only to several singleton classes but also to the metaclasses (i.e., disjunction of several classes) and the ignorance in other chosen FoD according to a transformation matrix, which is estimated based on the training (pairwise) data by minimizing a certain error criteria. Thus, we can well characterize the uncertainty and imprecision during the transformation of FoD. After that, the outputs of different classifiers represented by basic belief assignments (BBAs) can be transformed to a common FoD. Then, the well-known Dempster&#39;s rule is employed to combine these transformed BBA to obtain final classification result under the chosen FoD. Several real data sets are used in the experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Our experimental results show that this new method can efficiently improve the classification accuracy with respect to other related methods.},

The manipulation behavior classification is twofold: first, “individual manipulation” where each expert manipulates his/her own behavior to achieve higher importance degree (weight); and second, “group manipulation” where a group of experts force inconsistent experts to adopt specific recommendation advices obtained via the use of a fixed feedback parameter. To counteract “individual manipulation,” a behavioral weights assignment method modeling sequential attitude ranging from “dictatorship” to “democracy” is developed, and then a reasonable policy for group minimum adjustment cost is established to assign appropriate weights to experts. To prevent “group manipulation,” an optimal feedback model is investigated where objective function is the individual adjustments cost and constraints related to the group threshold of consensus. This approach allows the inconsistent experts to balance group consensus and adjustment cost, which enhances their willingness to adopt the recommendation advices and consequently the group reaching consensus on the decision-making problem at hand. A numerical example is presented to illustrate and verify the proposed optimal feedback model.},

However, the flexibility and elasticity of the underactuated net present a new challenge to the control scheme. In this article, a fuzzy-based sliding-mode control is proposed and applied to the TSNR. The main contribution is that an adaptive super-twisting sliding-mode control (ASTSMC) is investigated with a novel adaption law based on a fuzzy estimator, eliminating the need for a derivative of uncertainty. The key advantage of the proposed scheme is that the passive adaption law of traditional ASTSMC is improved to an active law, and complex oscillations can be directly estimated and suppressed. The dynamics equations of the TSNR are first derived, and the control problem of the system is specified. For the unmeasurable and boundary-unknown uncertainties, the adaptive fuzzy logic scheme is employed to approximate the complex uncertainties. Stability analysis and approximation convergence of the proposed control scheme are then verified via Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, numerical simulations on the TSNR are provided to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.},

In this article, in order to provide flexible adaptability for tackling ambiguity and uncertainty in clustering, a new concept of fuzzy peaks is proposed to express the density of a data point as the fuzzy-operator-based coupling of the fuzzy distances between a data point and its neighbors. As a fuzzy variant of DPC, a novel fuzzy density peaks clustering (FDPC) method FDPC based on fuzzy operators (especially S-norm operators) is accordingly devised along with the same algorithmic framework of DPC. With an appropriate choice of a fuzzy operator with its associated tunable parameter for a clustering task, FDPC can indeed inherit the advantage of fuzzy partitions and simultaneously provide flexibility in enhancing clustering performance. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms or at least remains comparable to the comparative methods in clustering performance by choosing appropriate parameters in most cases.},

Fuzzy bisimulation is a counterpart of bisimulation for dealing with fuzzy structures. In this article, we present an efficient algorithm with a complexity O((m+n)n) for computing the greatest fuzzy bisimulation between two finite fuzzy interpretations in the fuzzy DL f ALC under the Gödel semantics, where n is the number of individuals and m is the number of nonzero instances of roles in the given fuzzy interpretations. We also adapt our algorithm for computing fuzzy bisimulations and simulations between fuzzy finite automata, as well as for dealing with other fuzzy DLs.

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the issue of the accelerated adaptive fuzzy optimal control of three coupled fractional-order chaotic electromechanical transducers. A small network where every transducer has the nearest-neighbor coupling configuration is used to form the coupled fractional-order chaotic electromechanical transducers. The mathematical model of the coupled electromechanical transducers with nearest-neighbors is established and the dynamical analysis reveals that its behaviors are very sensitive to external excitation and fractional order. In the controller design, the recurrent nonsingleton type-2 sequential fuzzy neural network (RNT2SFNN) with the transformation is designed to estimate unknown functions of dynamics system in the feedforward fuzzy controller, and it is constructed to approximate the critic value and actor control functions by using policy iteration (PI) in the optimal feedback controller. Meanwhile, the speed functions are employed to achieve accelerated convergence within a pregiven finite time and a tracking differentiator is used to solve the explosion of terms associated with traditional backstepping. The whole control strategy consists of a feedforward controller integrating with the RNT2SFNN, tracking differentiator, and speed function in the framework of the backstepping control and a feedback controller fusing with the RNT2SFNN and PI under an actor/critic structure to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The proposed scheme not only guarantees the boundness of all signals and realizes the chaos suppression, synchronization, and accelerated convergence, but also minimizes the cost function. Simulations demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

From a novel perspective that can easily remove this flaw, this study uses a systematical frame to better redefine induced OWA operators, which not only covers all the spirits of the original definition of induced OWA operator but also extends it to some wider understandings and usages. One significant feature related to this frame is that we can express induced OWA operators fully in terms of weighted averaging operators, making the usages and expressions of induced OWA operators much more flexible and stricter. In detail, we propose several new definitions, such as positioning transformation, permutation-based orness, and inducing function based orness.

  abstract     = {In analyzing fuzzy-valued imprecise data statistically, scale measures/estimates play an important role. Scale measures/estimates of data sets are often considered, among others, to descriptively summarize them, to compare the dispersion or the spread of different data sets, standardize data, state rules for detecting outliers, formulate regression objective functions, etc. To be robust, an estimate of scale should have a finite breakdown point close to 50\% (i.e., around half data should be replaced by “outliers” to make the estimate break down, either in the sense of exploding to infinity or imploding to zero). In this respect, the median distance deviation about the median (MDD) for fuzzy data sets has already been introduced and its robust behavior has been proved. In contrast to the real-valued case, computation of the MDD for fuzzy data is much more complex and cannot be exactly but approximately performed in general. These computational inconveniences are mainly associated with the fact that, in general, the “median of the fuzzy data set” cannot be exactly calculated, but simply approximated through some levels, and it does not preserve the shape of the fuzzy data. The same happens with the distances between data and the approximate median. Consequently, the use of location-free scale measures would be especially appropriate-to-use in this fuzzy-valued environment. This article aims to extend some robust global scale estimates, and to prove that the extension remains robust. Furthermore, it will be shown that these estimates can be easily and exactly computed for fuzzy trapezoidal data, the assumption of considering trapezoidal data not implying an important loss of generality in the setting of scale estimation.},

  abstract     = {The alternative assessment and decision-making are often complicated and involve enormous decision makers (DMs), which leads to a large group decision making (LGDM) problem, and usually requires to reach consensus within a limited time. As a powerful technique in representing linguistic evaluations, the probabilistic linguistic term set is popular to express the opinions of DMs. Under this scenario, DMs who support the same linguistic term are naturally clustered into one subgroup, whereas the distance formulas are inappropriate because whether the DM supports a linguistic term is a dichotomous variable; therefore, Tanimoto coefficient is introduced to calculate the group consensus level. Additionally, an efficient consensus model is proposed to bridge the gap between the subgroup and group opinions. In particular, a weight adjustment function is proposed to process the minority opinions. A novel method including minor and major adjustment manner is proposed to manage the noncooperative behaviors. DMs are allowed to recluster into another subgroup for major adjustment manner; on the contrary, the adjustment direction and quantities are provided for minor adjustment manner. A case study of forest fire emergency decision-making is explored and a simulation is conducted to verify the proposed consensus model in the LGDM problem. The proposed consensus model is suitable for situations where the subgroup and group decision matrices are subject to preference selections and can be applied in other decision problems.},

  abstract     = {For complex and difficult-to-control blast furnace systems with hour-level delay, accurate prediction of molten iron quality plays a very important role in guaranteeing the stable and smooth operation. Recently, some data-driven multi-input multi-output (MIMO) modeling methods have been proposed to model multiple molten iron quality indicators including molten iron temperature, silicon content ([Si]), phosphorus content ([P]), and sulfur content ([S]). However, those data-driven MIMO models ignore the interindicator correlation, which leads to the suboptimal model for the estimation of multiple molten iron quality indicators. Moreover, the above methods do not pay attention to the molten iron quality indicators missing issue, which often occurs on blast furnace. To address the above two issues, this article proposed a novel MIMO Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model by utilizing an output transfer matrix. In the novel method, the interindicator correlation was explicitly modeled by a low-rank learning of the correlation matrix that overcame the great challenge of jointly determining the fuzzy rules of the MIMO T-S model and the interindicator correlation. Moreover, a new complete complementary matrix can be obtained by the output transfer from the original incomplete matrix resulting from molten iron quality indicators missing issues. For the corresponding optimization problem, an effective alternating optimization algorithm is presented, and the convergence of the optimization algorithm is also rigorously proved. The validity of the proposed method is verified by comparison with some related methods on real blast furnace data.},

  abstract     = {There is always vagueness experienced by experts in practical decision making processes. Fuzzy sets are introduced for their ability to model objects and phenomena with a flexible degree. Then, it is more advisable to utilize fuzzy numbers to express the opinions of decision makers (DMs) for the purpose of reflecting the flexibility of DMs in a decision making process. Of much importance is how to quantify the flexibility degree of fuzzy numbers. In this article, a novel method for computing the flexibility degree of fuzzy numbers is generally presented by using the concept of α-cut sets. In particular, some novel formulas are proposed to quantify the flexibility degrees of triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers by equipping a bounded universe, respectively. The flexibility degree of a preference relation with triangular fuzzy numbers is computed by considering the effects of the applied scale and the reciprocal property. Furthermore, a new group decision making (GDM) model is formed when triangular fuzzy additive reciprocal preference relations (TFARPRs) are used to evaluate the judgments of DMs. A flexibility degree induced ordered weighted averaging operator is constructed to aggregate individual TFARPRs by offering more importance to that with less flexibility. Finally, some numerical results are reported to illustrate the new definitions and the proposed model. The sensitivity of confidence levels to the final decision reached by a group of experts is analyzed. The observations reveal that the flexibility degrees of DMs under various confidence levels are worth to be considered in the GDM problem with a dominant position, and the existing shortcomings are overcome.},

This article focuses on investigating how much power should be assigned to transmit the data packet at each time. A new framework of optimal power allocation is established by introducing a cost function, which weighs the control performance and energy cost. First, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the solution to finding an admissible schedule is given. Then, by combining an adaptive dynamic programming technique with fuzzy approximation theory, a new state-dependent scheduling algorithm is proposed to find the optimal power allocation policy. The convergence analysis shows that the proposed power scheduling algorithm can approximate the optimal solution on a compact set with a desired precision.

Then, under this exponential-type DETM, a new event-based impulsive control strategy is designed, which not only include the impulsive control on event instants, but also a state feedback control part with time-varying gains during the interval time of two consecutive events. The core idea is that the added feedback part can be regarded as a “bridge,” which connects the two consecutive impulse injections. Besides, input-to-state stability of the concerned system is investigated by transforming the attack signals into a residual term, so that some stability criteria are derived in spite of the unpredictable deception attacks. The nonexistence of Zeno behaviors is also guaranteed indirectly by utilizing the comparison relationship between DETM and its static counterpart.

This includes the cases of complete or partial immeasurable premise variables. The main aspect of the proposed methodology is to present conditions such that the control gains are independent of the premise variables that cannot be measured allowing flexibility for the designer in a realistic output feedback context.

Hereby, we construct associated cooperative games with the interval-valued cooperative games. It is proven that the Banzhaf values of the associated cooperative games with interval-valued cooperative games are monotonic and nondecreasing functions under some size monotonicity-like conditions. Hence, the mean and the lower and upper limits of the triangular fuzzy Banzhaf values can be directly and explicitly attained through using only the mean, and the lower and upper limits of the coalitions&#39; triangular fuzzy values, respectively. The developed approach does not use the subtraction of triangular fuzzy numbers and, hereby, can effectively avoid the irrational issues resulting from it.

  abstract     = {Soft overlapping clustering is one of the notable problems of community detection. Extensive research has been conducted to develop efficient methods for nonoverlapping and crisp-overlapping community detection in large-scale networks. In this article, fast fuzzy modularity maximization (FFMM) for soft overlapping community detection is proposed. FFMM exploits novel iterative equations to calculate the modularity gain associated with changing the fuzzy membership values of network vertices. The simplicity of the proposed scheme enables efficient modifications, reducing computational complexity to a linear function of the network size, and the number of communities. Moreover, to further reduce the complexity of FFMM for very large networks, multicycle FFMM (McFFMM) is proposed. The proposed McFFMM reduces complexity by breaking networks into multiple subnetworks and applying FFMM to detect their communities. Performance of the proposed techniques is demonstrated with real-world data and the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark networks. Moreover, the performance of the proposed techniques is evaluated versus some state-of-the-art soft overlapping community detection approaches. Results show that the McFFMM produces a remarkable performance in terms of overlapping modularity with fuzzy memberships, computational time, number of detected overlapping nodes, and overlapping normalized mutual information.},

By taking our previous fuzzy k plane clustering algorithm as the basic framework, a fuzzy style k-plane clustering (S-KPC) algorithm is proposed to have its distinctive merits: First, the nuances between styles of clusters can be well identified by using the proposed twofold data representation. That is to say, style matrices are used to express the structure, hence style information of each cluster, whereas the augmentation of the original features of data with enhanced nodes is taken as an abstract representation so as to move the manifold structure of data apart. Such a twofold data representation can make us realize S-KPC readily in an incremental way. Second, by means of alternating optimization strategy, the objective function of S-KPC can be optimized such that each discriminant function of each cluster shares the advantages of both simple regression models and functional-link neural networks. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that S-KPC has comparable clustering performance with several compared methods on the adopted ordinary datasets, and yet it obviously outperforms them on stylistic datasets.},

The barrier Lyapunov function is introduced to analyze the system stability, and the state constraints are, thus, guaranteed. It is proved that the closed-loop stochastic nonlinear system is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, and the output tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero.

The considered nonlinear systems contain unknown nonlinear dynamics and their states are not measured directly. Fuzzy logic systems are applied to identify the unknown nonlinear dynamics and an auxiliary nonlinear system is constructed. Based on this auxiliary system, a fuzzy state observer is first designed to estimate the immeasurable states. By using the inverse optimal principle and adaptive backstepping design theory, an observer-based fuzzy adaptive inverse optimal output feedback control scheme is then developed. The proposed inverse optimal control scheme need not assume that the states are measurable. It also guarantees that the closed-loop system is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and achieves the optimal control objective as well.

  abstract     = {Defuzzification plays an important role in the applications of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). However, computational complexity of existing defuzzification methods has turned this procedure into an important bottleneck toward the use of IT2FSs. It has been proved that the Nie-Tan method is an accurate discretizing-based method for calculating the center of gravity (COG) of IT2FSs. In this article, we propose a fast and accurate method for calculating the COG-Nie-Tan defuzzification-of polygonal IT2FSs on discrete and continuous domains without the need of discretization. The proposed method calculates the accurate COG for trapezoidal and triangular IT2FSs as special cases of polygonal IT2FSs. Moreover, any IT2FS can be approximated by a polygonal IT2FS-the higher the order of polygonal IT2FS, the better the approximation. Hence, using the proposed method on an IT2FS that is approximated by an appropriate polygonal IT2FS results in a more accurate COG.},

  abstract     = {Based on existing fuzzy simulation algorithms, this article presents two innovative techniques for approximating the expected values of fuzzy numbers’ monotone functions, which is of utmost importance in fuzzy optimization literature. In this regard, the stochastic discretization algorithm of Liu and Liu (2002) is enhanced by updating the discretization procedure for the simulation of the membership function and the calculation formula for the expected values. This is achieved through initiating a novel uniform sampling process and employing a formula for discrete fuzzy numbers, respectively, as the generated membership function in the stochastic discretization algorithm would adversely affect its accuracy to some extent. What is more, considering that the bisection procedure involved in the numerical integration algorithm of Li (2015) is time-consuming and also, not necessary for the specified types of fuzzy numbers, a special numerical integration algorithm is proposed, which can simplify the simulation procedure by adopting the analytical expressions of $\alpha$ -optimistic values. Subsequently, concerning the extensive applications of regular fuzzy intervals, several theorems are introduced and proved as an extended effort to apply the improved stochastic discretization algorithm and the special numerical integration algorithm to the issues of fuzzy intervals. Throughout this article, a series of numerical experiments are conducted from which the superiority of both the two novel techniques over others are conspicuously displayed in aspects of accuracy, stability, and efficiency.},

The weakest T-norm arithmetic is applied in the formulation of the IFLRMs to avoid wide spreads in the predicted IFN responses. The sign of the parameters is determined in the formulation process. We propose a mathematical programming problem to find the optimal IFN parameters. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the absolute distances between the observed and predicted IFNs. To enhance computational efficiency, a three-step procedure is proposed for solving a mathematical programming problem when the number of explanatory variables or the size of the observation data set is large. Comparisons with existing approaches indicate that the proposed approach has outstanding performance in terms of similarity and distance measures.},

  abstract     = {As big data often contains a significant amount of uncertain, unstructured, and imprecise data that are structurally complex and incomplete, traditional attribute reduction methods are less effective when applied to large-scale incomplete information systems to extract knowledge. Multigranular computing provides a powerful tool for use in big data analysis conducted at different levels of information granularity. In this article, we present a novel multigranulation supertrust fuzzy-rough set-based attribute reduction (MSFAR) algorithm to support the formation of hierarchies of information granules of higher types and higher orders, which addresses newly emerging data mining problems in big data analysis. First, a multigranulation supertrust model based on the valued tolerance relation is constructed to identify the fuzzy similarity of the changing knowledge granularity with multimodality attributes. Second, an ensemble consensus compensatory scheme was adopted to calculate the multigranular trust degree based on the reputation at different granularities to create reasonable subproblems with different granulation levels. Third, an equilibrium method of multigranular coevolution is employed to ensure a wide range of balancing of exploration and exploitation, and this strategy can classify super elitists&#39; preferences and detect noncooperative behaviors with a global convergence ability and high search accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the MSFAR algorithm achieves a high performance in addressing uncertain and fuzzy attribute reduction problems with a large number of multigranularity variables.},

Connectivity parameters have indispensable role in the analysis of connectivity of networks. Strength of a cycle in an unweighted graph is always one. But, in a fuzzy graph, strengths of cycles may vary even for a given pair of vertices. Cyclic reachability is a property that determines the overall connectedness of a network. This article introduces two connectivity parameters namely, cyclic connectivity index (CCI) and average CCI (ACCI) of fuzzy graphs, which can be used to represent the cyclic reachability. CCI of fuzzy graph theoretic structures, such as trees, blocks, θ-fuzzy graphs, and complete fuzzy graphs, are discussed. Vertices of a fuzzy graph are classified into three categories in terms of ACCI and their characterizations are obtained. Three algorithms are proposed. One of them is to help find CCI and ACCI of a given fuzzy graph. Another helps to identify the nature of vertices and the third to enhance the existing ACCI of a fuzzy graph. Also, future directions in the study of CCI and ACCI are proposed.},

By considering the problem of the asynchronous switching caused by the subsystems&#39; switching occurred during the sampling intervals, constructing novel time-dependent Lyapunov functional, and using average dwell time (ADT) approach, sufficient mean-square exponential stability criteria, and strictly ( Q , S , R )-γ- dissipativity criteria are proposed under the constraints that the maximum sampling period is no larger than the dwell-time between the transition rates switching instants. Meanwhile, a relationship between ADT and sampling period is revealed for FSMJSs. Based on the strictly ( Q , S , R )-γ- dissipativity criteria, the sampled-data controller is designed for FSMJSs.

  abstract     = {Quite often, complex systems or phenomena are observed from various points of view yielding the particular subsets of data usually being composed of locally available attributes. Such datasets give rise to individual models. As is reflective of the local behavior of the system (global data), each model can produce different, albeit similar results. A critical issue is to aggregate the results coming from the individual models. In virtue of the diversity of the produced results, the aggregation process has to be reflective of this variety. Equally important is a way of quantifying the diversity of the individual results. In this article, we provide an efficient and original way of aggregation of the results by engaging a principle of justifiable granularity and in this manner leading to interval-valued results summarizing the results produced by a collection of models. We develop an overall design process and discuss the associated optimization mechanism leading to a granular fuzzy model of a global nature. The detailed scheme of the principle of justifiable granularity is discussed along with the related performance indexes; in particular, two modes of design of information granules are investigated. The quality of the granular model is quantified with the aid of the criteria of coverage and specificity.},

First, an ISMC is developed for the FTC system. The major features of the approach are discussed. Then, to enhance the performance of the system, a fuzzy logic system approximation and a DO are introduced to approximate the unknown nonlinear terms, which include the model uncertainty and fault components, and to estimate the compounded disturbance and then are integrated into the ISMC. Next, a switching term based on an adaptive two-layer supertwisting algorithm is designed to compensate the disturbance estimated error and guarantee stability and convergence of the whole system. The nominal controller of the ISMC is reconstructed using a backstepping control technique to achieve the stability for the nominal system based on the Lyapunov criterion.

While the literature about real-world FCM applications is prolific, the studies devoted to understanding the foundations behind these neural networks are rather scant. In this article, we introduce several definitions and theorems that unveil the dynamic behavior of FCM-based models equipped with transfer F-functions. These analytical expressions allow estimating bounds for the activation value of each neuron and analyzing the covering and proximity of feasible activation spaces. The main theoretical findings suggest that the state space of any FCM model equipped with transfer F-functions shrinks infinitely with no guarantee for the FCM to converge to a fixed point but to its limit state space. This result in conjunction with the covering and proximity values of FCM-based models helps understand their poor performance when solving complex simulation problems.},

  abstract     = {Unification is a central concept in logic systems based on the resolution principle. As well, in knowledge representation, proximity relations (i.e., reflexive, symmetric, fuzzy binary relations) are useful for introducing semantics into a syntactic level by modeling the semantic closeness of different syntactic objects and managing vague or imprecise information. Proximity relations, in combination with the unification algorithm, make possible expressing certain forms of approximate reasoning in a logic programming framework. In this article, we use proximity relations in the context of a (fuzzy) logic programming system, called Bousi ~ Prolog, as a way of solving the limitations introduced by similarity relations (i.e., transitive proximity relations) to correctly represent fuzzy information. Recently, we introduced an accurate definition of proximity between expressions (terms or atomic formulas) and a new unification algorithm able to manage proximity relations properly. However, the so-called weak unification algorithm, which is an extension of Martelli and Montanari&#39;s unification algorithm supported by the new notion of proximity, does not have an efficient implementation. In this article, we present a method that facilitates such an efficient implementation, including an adaptation of the weak SLD resolution rule based on the new unification algorithm, and its integration and implementation into the fuzzy logic programming system Bousi ~ Prolog. A performance analysis to show its efficiency is also presented.},

To properly accommodate the characteristics of T-S fuzzy multisource disturbances and system models, a novel fuzzy switched disturbance observer is put forward to estimate the disturbances generated by a switched exogenous system. Then, a fuzzy composite antidisturbance control law is synthesized by fusing the estimation of the multisource disturbances and the state-feedback control scheme. By using the average dwell time technique and piecewise Lyapunov functions, it is proved that the resultant closed-loop system are stochastically stable and strictly (Z, Y, X)-ε-dissipative. The sufficient conditions for the existence of the fuzzy switched disturbance observer and state-feedback controller are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and the control and observation gains can be solved directly.

However, in the current type-2 representation, there is no restriction on the shape of the footprint of uncertainty and the embedded sets (ESs) that can be considered acceptable. This leads, usually, to the loss of the semantic relationship between the T2 FS and the concept it models. As a consequence, the interpretability of some of the ESs and the explainability of the uncertainty measures obtained from them can decrease. To overcome these issues, constrained type-2 (CT2) fuzzy sets have been proposed. However, no formal definitions for some of their key components [e.g., acceptable ESs (AESs)] and constrained operations have been given. In this article, we provide some theoretical underpinning for the definition of CT2 sets, their inferencing and defuzzification method. To conclude, the constrained inference framework is presented, applied to two real-world cases and briefly compared to the standard interval type-2 inference and defuzzification method.},

Thus, in this article, sentiment analysis, using natural language processing, is used to quantify raw customer feedback, to obtain drivers&#39; ratings and perform driver selection. Selection of the best drivers for ferrying riders is desired and modeled accordingly. An integrated vehicle routing problem with generalized fuzzy travel durations, and uncertain pick-up and drop demands, is modeled and solved using a hybrid genetic algorithm. Fuzzy simulations in a credibilistic environment are employed to evaluate the cost function. Performance of selected drivers is used to update driver ratings for the subsequent run, and the process is repeated multiple times. The results obtained authenticate the purpose of this article, and comparative analysis is performed to further corroborate the model&#39;s capability. An additional case of triangular fuzzy ratings is also illustrated, and its impact on the model discussed. Suggestions for driver classification are also provided for personnel management.},

Bringing type-2 fuzzy sets to clustering algorithms offers more flexibility to handle uncertainties associated with membership concepts caused by a noisy environment. However, the existing type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithms suffer from a time-consuming type-reduction process, which not only hampers the clustering performance but also increases the burden of understanding the clustering results. In order to alleviate the problem, this article introduces a set of typical characteristics of type-2 fuzzy sets and establishes a characteristic-based type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithm. Being different from the objective function used in the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm that produces cluster centers and type-1 memberships, the objective function in the proposed algorithm contains additional characteristics of type-2 membership grades, namely, centers of gravity and cardinalities of the secondary fuzzy sets. The derived iterative formulas used for these parameters are much more efficient than the interval type-2 FCM algorithm. The experiments carried out in this study show that the proposed typical characteristic-based type-2 FCM algorithm has an ability of detecting noise as well as assigning suitable membership degrees to the individual data.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFSs) have been shown to have the potential to improve the interpretability of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). However, challenges remain, such as “How can we measure their interpretability?” “How can we make an informed assessment of how HFSs should be designed to enhance interpretability?” The challenges consist of measuring the interpretability of HFSs include issues such as their topological structure, the number of layers, the meaning of intermediate variables, and so on. In this article, an initial framework to measure the interpretability of HFSs is proposed, combined with a participatory user design process to create a specific instance of the framework for an application context. This approach enables the subjective views of a range of practitioners, experts in the design and creation of FLSs, to be taken into account in shaping the design of a generic framework for measuring interpretability in HFSs. This design process and framework are demonstrated through two classification application examples, showing the ability of the resulting index to appropriately capture interpretability as perceived by system design experts.},

For most of the existing fuzzy approximation-based approaches, there are many parameters in the fuzzy systems that need to be estimated online with adaptive laws. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new fuzzy system; the remarkable advantage of this fuzzy system is that only one parameter needs to be estimated online. The fuzzy system is used to approximate the unknown nonlinear function, and an adaptive fuzzy state observer is developed to estimate the unmeasured states. By utilizing the state observer and the prescribed performance control scheme, an adaptive fuzzy prescribed performance output-feedback control method is developed. The number of the adaptive laws both for the state observer and the controller is reduced to the number of subsystems. It is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and that the prescribed performance error constraints can be achieved. Simulation examples are provided to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In real applications, different features in a dataset should take different importance with different weights. In this article, we first propose a feature-weighted PCM (FW-PCM). We then construct a feature-reduction framework. Therefore, we give a feature-weighted possibilistic c-means clustering with a feature-reduction framework, termed as a feature-weighted reduction PCM (FW-R-PCM) algorithm. The proposed FW-R-PCM can improve the clustering performance of PCM by calculating feature weights to identify important features, and so it can consequently eliminate these irrelevant features to reduce feature dimension. Its theoretical behavior and computational complexity are also analyzed. The effectiveness and usefulness of FW-R-PCM are demonstrated through experimental results using synthetic and real datasets, where comparisons of FW-R-PCM with PCM, FW-PCM, and some existing feature-weighted clustering algorithms are also made.},

Compared with the existing results, the restrictions on the multiple time-varying delays are relaxed in the derivation of this work. The suggested controller has a wider application.

So, task timing constraints are mostly approximated estimations by designers. This indicates that there are underlying uncertainties in these timing constraints, which can be appropriately modeled using fuzzy numbers. Moreover, feasible scheduling of tasks and energy efficiency are two essential requirements for better utilization and durability of RTESs. Thus, justifiable performance of this kind of systems warrants energy savings amid timely production of the computational outputs, although these two issues are mutually contradictory. This article reports a novel formulation of the energy efficient real-time scheduling problem in a fuzzy uncertain environment and proposes a novel solution approach called “ε-constraint coupled energy efficient genetic algorithm (ε-EEGA).” The working of the proposed approach is demonstrated taking a real-life example. Also, a thorough comparative analysis is provided considering well-known existing approaches including multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Results are compared using popular performance metrics, which suggests that the proposed ε-EEGA is efficient in giving better energy savings with faster computations than its existing counterparts.

To our knowledge, the proposed fuzzy-clustering-based algorithm is the first work for a general routing region with multiple-pin nets in k-layer circular topological via minimization (k-CTVM). In this article, given the topological connections in a set of routing nets and a set of k available layers in a routing plane, first, all the multipin nets can be transformed into a set of two-pin nets by introducing a set of preassigned vias onto the branch points on multipin nets and a conflict graph can be constructed for a final set of two-pin nets. Furthermore, the probabilistic similarity between two connected vertices using the same color can be computed for the constrained vertex-coloring problem with k colors in a conflict graph. Next, based on the definition of the clustering distance between two connected vertices in a conflict graph, fuzzy graph clustering can be developed to obtain a fuzzy matrix on k clusters. Finally, all the given nets can be assigned onto the k available layers by introducing a set of necessary vias on two-pin nets and eliminating the unnecessary preassigned vias on multipin nets. Compared with the combination of Cong&#39;s algorithm and an iterative net postassignment, NetInsertion1, in the k-CTVM problem, the experimental results show that our proposed fuzzy-clustering- based algorithm can use less CPU time to reduce 57.3\% of the number of the total used vias for eight tested PCB designs. Compared with the combination of Yan&#39;s algorithm and an iterative net postassignment, NetInsertion2, in the k-CTVM problem, the experimental results show that our proposed fuzzy-clustering-based algorithm can reduce 34.0\% of the number of the total used vias for eight tested PCB designs.},

  abstract     = {Yager&#39;s q-rung orthopair fuzzy set is a generalization of fuzzy sets, whose prominent feature is that the qth power sum of the membership and the nonmembership degrees is equal to or less than one, and we call its core, an ordered pair, q-rung orthopair fuzzy number (q-ROFN). More recently, the scholars have constructed the q-rung orthopair fuzzy calculus (q-ROFC), which can effectively deal with continuous q-rung orthopair fuzzy information. Nevertheless, the q-ROFC is only based on the basic operational laws of the q-ROFNs, in fuzzy theory, Archimedean t-norms and t-conorms (ATTs) are a significant class of continuous triangular norms and conorms, which are the generalizations of the intersection and union related to fuzzy sets. Thus, in order to extend the q-ROFC to a wider area, in this article, we systematically discuss the q-rung orthopair fuzzy double integrals (q-ROFDIs) in the frame of ATTs. First, we construct the q-ROFDI in the frame of Archimedean t-conorms in detail, and then provide its concrete value. In addition, we reveal the relationships with respect to two types of q-rung orthopair fuzzy spaces. Based on which, we can easily obtain another types of q-ROFDI. After that, we investigate their fundamental properties in detail so as to comprehend these kinds of q-ROFDIs in-depth. Finally, we point out the essences of these kinds of q-ROFDIs, on the basis of which we provide a practical application to show their effectiveness and elasticity via comparing with the existing methods.},

The experimental facility includes a novel decoupled electrohydraulic brake test bed characterized by highly nonlinear dynamics and time-varying behavior. It reproduces real pressure dynamics of the brake circuit allowing for simulation of various tire-road adhesions conditions and brake blending scenarios. To cope with degradation of antilock braking system performance induced by unexpected changing environmental conditions, such as road surface, the developed fuzzy control features a very simple yet effective and robust road surface recognition tool with estimation of the peak braking demands. Thus, the fuzzy logic serves as a controller and road surface estimator simultaneously allowing for complex mathematical modeling and feedback control avoidance not sacrificing safety system&#39;s performance. The results indicate that the control method manages highly nonlinear and time-variant dynamics of the brake system and offers significant feasibility for optimal slip control at regenerative braking, ensuring fuzzy control&#39;s potentiality for real-time application.},

Recently, trace containment and simulation preorder have been adopted and developed in fuzzy systems, but the generalization of their alternating versions to fuzzy systems has not been investigated. To satisfy the need for modeling and analyzing fuzzy systems, this article proposes two types of refinement relations called fuzzy alternating trace containment and fuzzy alternating simulation preorder, based on fuzzy concurrent game structures (FCGSs) under the Gödel semantics. These two fuzzy notions inherit properties from the corresponding classical setting. For example, fuzzy alternating simulation preorder for finite-state FCGSs can be computed in polynomial time; fuzzy alternating simulation preorder is a fuzzy subset of fuzzy alternating trace containment, and both relations can be logically characterized in terms of fuzzy version of alternating-time temporal logic. These properties make the theory developed here suitable for the modeling and verification of fuzzy systems.},

  abstract     = {Traditional machine learning and data mining have made tremendous progress in many knowledge-based areas, such as clustering, classification, and regression. However, the primary assumption in all of these areas is that the training and testing data should be in the same domain and have the same distribution. This assumption is difficult to achieve in real-world applications due to the limited availability of labeled data. Associated data in different domains can be used to expand the availability of prior knowledge about future target data. In recent years, transfer learning has been used to address such cross-domain learning problems by using information from data in a related domain and transferring that data to the target task. In this article, a transfer-learning possibilistic c-means (TLPCM) algorithm is proposed to handle the PCM clustering problem in a domain that has insufficient data. Moreover, TLPCM overcomes the problem of differing numbers of clusters between the source and target domains. The proposed algorithm employs the historical cluster centers of the source data as a reference to guide the clustering of the target data. The experimental studies presented here were thoroughly evaluated, and they demonstrate the advantages of TLPCM in both synthetic and real-world transfer datasets.},

A sufficient and necessary condition is derived for characterizing (internal) positivity, and certain criteria are also provided to guarantee external positivity of FONSs with or without time-varying delays. It is indicated that the positivity of the considered systems is determined purely by system matrices rather than the magnitudes of time-varying delays. Moreover, a sufficient and necessary condition for asymptotic stability of positive FONSs is obtained, and a state-feedback controller is also designed to guarantee that state variables not only converge to the origin asymptotically but also remain nonnegative, where the control gain matrix is obtained by solving an linear programming (LP) problem.

By using the precompensation technique, in this article, the working feedback control is considered as a reconstructed dynamic with the virtual control and a new augmented fuzzy interconnected tracking system is built, thus that the performance index is valid for optimal control. Then, combining the integral reinforcement learning (RL) method and decentralized control design, the novel integral RL parallel algorithm is first developed to solve the tracking controls for interconnected systems, which relax the requirements of exact matrices information $A_i^k$ and $B_i^k$ during the solving process. Both the convergence and stability of the designed control optimization scheme are guaranteed by theorems.

Correspondingly, the computation burden of the communication procedure is effectively alleviated.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the control design problem for a fuzzy vehicular platoon system consisting of one leading vehicle and N following vehicles. Due to external disturbances, uncertainty exists in the platoon system and is usually nonlinear and possibly fast time varying. In order to deal with uncertainty, fuzzy theory is employed to describe the platoon system, thereby the so-called fuzzy vehicular platoon system. Based on the fuzzy property of uncertainty, a type of adaptive law is proposed. Since the original state of the system is one-side bounded when collision avoidance is taken into account, a state transformation is made, by which a new global state is obtained. Then, the swarm intelligence is embedded into the platoon system via a function, which mimics the swarm behavior. For the control design, we focus on adaptiveness and optimization. A switching-type adaptive robust control is proposed. The control is not IF-THEN rule based. We further explore the problem of control parameter optimization. A performance index consisting of transient control cost and average control cost is proposed. Aiming at minimizing the performance index, the optimal problem is formulated. The solution to the optimal problem (i.e., optimal control parameter) exists and is unique. The control with optimal parameter is called optimal control, which guarantees both deterministic performance (uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness, and collision avoidance) and fuzzy performance of the platoon system.},

Prediction intervals (PIs) for GDSs that provide estimated values as well as their corresponding reliability play an important role for assisting on-site workers to perceive the nonstationary environment in real time. However, constructing reliable PIs for GDSs constitutes a significant challenge. To provide a solution to the problem, an interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy granular neural network (FGNN) dynamic ensemble approach (IT2FGNNDEnsemble) is proposed in this article. To fully reflect the uncertainty of GDSs, an interval value learning algorithm based IT2FGNN is developed, which can automatically generate, prune, merge, and realize recall in a single-pass learning mode. In addition, an evolving dynamic ensemble method is presented by providing an adaptive structure that considers a tradeoff between coverage and width of PIs, which can dynamically generate and prune the element of an ensemble according to current data tendency. A number of synthetic and industrial data streams experimentally validate the performance of the proposed IT2FGNNDEnsemble by using the state-of-the-art comparative methods. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach exhibits a good performance on PIs for practical applications.},

The second way, which we call “Implication Reconstructing,” is to study how to reconstruct an initial fuzzy implication through replacing its some values on given rectangular regions of the unit square with the linear transformations of respective given fuzzy implications such that the redefined function is a new fuzzy implication. In both ways, necessary and sufficient conditions for the final reconstructed functions to be fuzzy implications are given and several new constructions of ordinal sums of fuzzy implications are obtained, which would generalize the existing ordinal sums from several aspects. In particular, by adopting the idea behind the second way, the generalized ordinal sums of fuzzy implications are proposed, in which the regions where the linear transformations of given fuzzy implications are defined are neither necessarily subsquares nor necessarily along the principal or minor diagonal of the unit square.},

  abstract     = {The adaptive fuzzy finite-time tracking control problem of a class of switched nonlinear systems is investigated in this study. Fuzzy logic systems are introduced to handle the unknown nonlinear terms in the considered system. To overcome the drawback in the recursive design method, a finite-time command filter is employed. By constructing a new state-dependent switching law and adaptive fuzzy control signal, the existing restrictions on subsystems of switched systems are relaxed, all subsystems of the considered system are allowed to be unstabilizable. To avoid the Zeno behavior, a new hysteresis switching law is derived. It is proven that all states of the closed-loop system are bounded in finite time under the proposed fuzzy finite-time control scheme. Additionally, the proposed control method is extended to a class of more general switched large-scale nonlinear systems. Finally, two examples are provided to verify the developed method&#39;s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Control design and performance enhancement for uncertain mechanical systems are pursued in this article. Uncertainty in a physical system is often inevitable in practice, which is best characterized by its possible bound. Mechanical systems with uncertain nonlinearity are considered. Furthermore, even the knowledge of the coefficients in the bound is unknown, which can only be described by its fuzzy association to a set. In controlling the system, there is a hierarchical performance requirement. The first level is deterministic, including uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. This is the part the system must meet regardless of the actual value of the uncertainty. The second level is optimality, in terms of minimizing a fuzzy-theoretic performance index. We propose a novel control design with a tunable design parameter. The control guarantees the first-level performance when the design parameter falls in a range. We, then, take the advantage of this range flexibility to address the second-level requirement. The optimal choice of the design parameter can be made by solving an optimization problem. This problem is completely solved. Both the analytic (i.e., closed form) expressions of the design parameter and the resulting minimum cost are given. As a result, we accomplish a two-level control design task.},

Existing works on incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) utilize only endpoints of the original intervals and generate missing values using interval operations, resulting in the loss and distortion of information. This article considers IFPRs as linear uncertain preference relations (LUPRs), and introduces belief degree and inverse uncertainty distributions to explore the consistency and ranking problems with LUPRs. Definitions related to uncertain preference relations (UPRs) as well as their additive and multiplicative consistency are first given. Then, models to solve weight vectors are proposed under both consistency scenarios. Finally, algorithms that generate missing information in incomplete LUPRs are provided. By building mathematical relationships between the minimum deviation and the belief degree, analytic formulas for missing values are obtained when the minimum deviation is achieved. It is verified that consistent UPRs and the proposed weight-vector solving models under incomplete preference relations are extensions of the traditional IFPRs.},

Although the field in itself only dates from the second half of the last century, one could easily trace back further in time prominent examples of aggregation functions. For instance, means were already studied by Cauchy in the early 1820s. Although the most popular aggregation processes have historically been those dealing with real numbers, the interest of practitioners in different types of data is not to be neglected. Some prominent examples are the aggregation of strings, which is nowadays a popular topic for computer scientists and bioinformaticians, and the aggregation of rankings, which has been studied in social choice theory since the eighteenth century. In this article, we propose to abandon the current order-based understanding of an aggregation process and embrace a new geometrically oriented sense upon which a new theory of aggregation could be developed.},

Then, by utilizing the adaptive backstepping technique, a FLS-based adaptive fault-tolerant compensation controller is proposed, which can completely compensate for the adverse effects, arising from the additive actuator faults, the multiplicative actuator faults, and the mismatched nonlinearity simultaneously. The stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed by the proposed FLS-based adaptive controller with the adaptation laws. The novelty of this article lies in the fact that the additive and multiplicative actuator faults, and mismatched nonlinearity are considered simultaneously. Besides, the renown sliding mode control approach has limitations to deal with the FTC problem considered in this article because the considered nonlinearity is a mismatched one. The proposed control approach can cope with the challenging case.

The workload of detecting mAGDs by collecting the responses of the domain name system (DNS) is considerable. In this article, we propose a system named the automatic NXDomain classification system (ANCS) that can automatically identify and classify the nonexistent domain (NXD) as benign or malicious by studying the features extracted from benign NXDs (bNXDs) and mAGDs. The ANCS uses online, incremental, and fuzzy rough sets machine learning to improve the time, memory, false positive rate, false negative rate, and accuracy of the detection process. First, an online and incremental algorithm can reduce the training time. Second, the addition of fuzzy rough sets can dynamically adjust the degree of the membership function, optimizing the weight distribution of each feature, and further, improving the classification accuracy. The experimental evaluation shows that the ANCS can reach a very high classification accuracy at a low false positive rate and a low false negative rate, which has good practicability. Moreover, both time and memory are well guaranteed, and the ANCS also has good generalization performance, making up for sensitive points of noisy samples and the lack of nonincremental machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Hysteresis smoothing (HS) is one of the recently proposed image denoising schemes, which employs hard threshold levels to model the hysteresis process. Nevertheless, hard thresholding is in contrast with what is observed from the behavior of the hysteresis phenomenon in nature, and this implies that the HS may lead to a suboptimal model. On the other hand, it is proved that fuzzy logic is a promising research field in solving various problems by applying the uncertainty characteristics. Hence, in this article, we develop a novel HS methodology based on the fuzzy norms, which, in addition to incorporating the advantages of the HS, also manages the undesired effects of hard thresholding. In this method, which is called fuzzy HS (FHS), pointwise hard thresholding is replaced by an interval soft manner, which allows the threshold levels to be determined commensurate with the fuzzy norm&#39;s free parameter. It is shown that among the classical fuzzy norms, the Yager one can carry out the FHS relatively well. However, this norm causes oversaturation in the hysteresis loop, which leads to an oversmoothing problem in the image denoising process. To alleviate this, a new fuzzy norm with logarithmic nature, named expansion norm, has been proposed, which improves the accuracy of the FHS. The comparative simulations demonstrate the significant superiority of the FHS in terms of both objective and subjective criteria over the classical HS. Besides, the results indicate that the proposed scheme has competitive denoising performance in comparison with some well-known algorithms.},

In order to achieve the occupancy reduction of network resources, the measured outputs of interconnected systems are quantized through a logarithmic quantizer before being transmitted by the communication channel. Combining the effects of quantization and random network attacks, an observer-based control model is first constructed. Then, based on Lyapunov functional approach and stochastic analysis technique, some sufficient conditions are presented such that the considered closed-loop interconnected system is stochastically finite-time bounded with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level, and the gain matrices of fuzzy observer and fuzzy controller can be found by solving an optimization algorithm with linear matrix inequalities constraints. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.},

Fuzzy logic systems are introduced to approximate the unknown items of the system. Theoretical analysis proves that under the presented control strategy, the closed-loop system is practically fixed-time stable, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed-time interval, in which the convergence time has no connection with the initial states of the system.

  abstract     = {Transfer learning can address the learning tasks of unlabeled data in the target domain by leveraging plenty of labeled data from a different but related source domain. A core issue in transfer learning is to learn a shared feature space where the distributions of the data from the two domains are matched. This learning process can be named as transfer representation learning (TRL). Feature transformation methods are crucial to ensure the success of TRL. The most commonly used feature transformation method in TRL is kernel-based nonlinear mapping to the high-dimensional space, followed by linear dimensionality reduction. But the kernel functions are lack of interpretability, and it is difficult to select kernel functions. To this end, this article proposes a more intuitive and interpretable method, called TRL with TSK-FS (TRL-TSK-FS), by combining TSK fuzzy system (TSK-FS) with transfer learning. Specifically, TRL-TSK-FS realizes TRL from two aspects. On one hand, the data in the source and target domains are transformed into the fuzzy feature space where the distribution distance of the data between the two domains is minimized. On the other hand, discriminant information and geometric properties of the data are preserved by linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. A further advantage is that nonlinear transformation is realized in the proposed method by constructing fuzzy mapping with the antecedent part of the TSK-FS instead of kernel functions, which are difficult to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted on text and image datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

Thus, this article proposes CLEPRs with self-confidence by considering multiple self-confidence levels and presents a way to measure their consistency level. Meanwhile, personalized individual semantics (PIS), indicating that words mean different things for different people, have been highlighted and investigated in the GDM with linguistic assessment information. Considering PIS in comparative linguistic expressions, this article proposes an optimization model based on the consistency-driven methodology to assess individual semantics in CLEPRs with self-confidence. Particularly, the PIS are described and addressed by setting different numerical scales of linguistic terms for different decision makers. Finally, an optimization-based consensus model is proposed to obtain a consensual collective solution, which seeks to minimize the information loss between the decision makers&#39; preference relations with self-confidence and corresponding individual preference vectors.},

First, the criteria that have impact on the performance of the network layer are captured and transformed into fuzzy sets. Second, the fuzzy sets are characterized by fuzzy membership functions (FMFs), which are interpolated (curve fitting) based on the data collected from massive experimental simulations. Third, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is exploited to identify the relationships among the criteria. Fourth, multiple fuzzy rules are determined and the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) inference system is employed to infer and aggregate the final forwarding decision. Through integrating techniques of MCDM, FMF, AHP, and TSK, we design a distributed and opportunistic data routing protocol, namely, vehicular environment fuzzy router which targets vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and runs in two main processes-road segment selection (RSS) and relay vehicle selection (RVS). RSS is intended to select multiple successive junctions through which the packets should travel from the source to the destination, while RVS process is intended to select relay vehicles within the selected road segment. The experimental results show that our protocol performs and scales well with both network size and density, considering the combined problem of end-to-end packet delivery ratio and end-to-end latency.},

These methods (namely, the d-method and the s-method) reuse a primary sample (an initial set) of IVFNs to generate a secondary sample, which also consists of this type of fuzzy numbers, and simultaneously utilize existing dependencies in pairs of some characteristic points of IVFNs. During a corresponding resampling step, a nonparametric approach is used. Additionally, we apply a widely used assumption about the Gaussian kernel densities. The proposed methods in some way resemble Efron&#39;s bootstrap, but, contrary to this classical approach, they generate “not exactly the same as previous” IVFNs, so it leads to a greater diversity of the obtained secondary sample. We also numerically check the quality of the introduced methods using a few more statistically oriented approaches together with four similarity measures and three types of IVFNs.},

In this class of networks, the input connections (weights) and the biases of hidden neurons are generated randomly and fixed after being generated. The output connections are estimated by the LSE method rather than the back-propagation method. The random generation of the input connection weights and the hidden biases results in the larger number of hidden neurons to assure the quality of classification performance. To reduce the number of neurons in the hidden layer while maintaining the classification performance, we apply a “divide and conquer” strategy in this article. In other words, we divide an overall input space into several subspaces by using information granulation technique (Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm) and determine the local decision boundaries among related subspaces. A decision boundary defined in the input space can be considered as being composed of several decision boundaries defined in subspaces that form the entire input space. For the decision boundaries defined in the subspaces, their nonlinearity becomes lower in comparison with the one being encountered when considering the entire input space. Through the weighted LSE estimation instead of using the LSE estimation method, the connections of several NNs can be estimated without interfering with each other. After estimating the weights, the decision boundaries defined in the related subspaces are merged to a single decision boundary by using fuzzy ensemble technique. Several machine learning datasets and one real world application dataset are used to evaluate and validate the proposed fuzzy ensemble classifier. Based on the experimental results, the proposed classifier shows better classification performance when compared with the performance of some selected classifiers.},

Due to its unsupervised nature, clustering results have less accuracy compared to the supervised learning. This article aims to introduce a new perspective in clustering by defining an approach for data pruning. The method also enables clustering using multiple sets of prototypes instead of only one set to improve clustering accuracy. Consequently, this approach has the potential to be used independently or as a part of a preprocessing to prepare purified data for the training step of a supervised learning approach. An evolving fuzzy clustering approach (EFCA) utilizes the fuzzy membership concept to breakdown clustering in epochs instead of running the clustering on all data at once. In some cases, for supervised learning, we rather have a smaller subset of highly accurate labeled data instead of a dataset with less accurate labels. The EFCA&#39;s “epoch cut” enables postpruning ability to eliminate obscure data points, which results in more clustering accuracy. The EFCA has been applied to a set of eight multivariate and ten time-series datasets, and for example, after deploying epoch cut and eliminating obscure data (20\% of data) by automatic postpruning, it achieved 100\% accuracy for the rest 80\% Iris data.},

The objective of this article is to develop a new FMEA model combining linguistic Z-numbers and an extended projection method to enhance the inherent characteristics of FMEA. Specifically, the linguistic Z-numbers are used to express experts&#39; risk assessment information and the reliability of the assessment result. The normal projection method is extended to determine the risk priority of the failure modes considered in FMEA. Moreover, the relative weights of risk factors are derived objectively based on the idea of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. A practical risk evaluation case of aircraft landing system is given for verifying the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed FMEA. The results show that the proposed linguistic Z-number projection model is practical and flexible, which can not only depict experts&#39; complex and uncertain risk evaluation information accurately, but also obtain more accurate risk prioritization of failure modes.},

  abstract     = {Dominance relations exist extensively in decision-making problems. Dominance-based neighborhood rough sets (DNRS) using fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) are presented in this article to deal with attribute reduction in the large-scale decision-making problems. In this model, FPR is elicited to quantify the dominance-based rough set model, which can efficiently deal with the under-fitting problem of classical dominance-based rough sets. First, by formulating a quantified dominance-based neighborhood relation which satisfies reflexivity, the propositions of the quantified DNRSs are analyzed. Second, we propose approaches to attribute reduction based on upper-approximate and lower-approximate discernibility matrices, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate that the novel model performs efficiently and effectively in time consumption and space storage by experimental analysis. Finally, combining with parallel computing, we demonstrate that the new model can be used to deal with attribute reduction of large-scale datasets effectively.},

  abstract     = {It is interesting to study the problem of adaptive fuzzy control for uncertain nonlinear systems with input and state hysteresis. However, since the hysteresis behavior, especially the state hysteresis, present at the sensors is complicated, mainly in view of its multivalues and rate-dependent features, it is a challenging task to develop the backstepping-based control design. So far, there is still no available result in addressing the problem. In this article, we will pursue this task. A novel indirect fuzzy control scheme is proposed with an alternative adaptive hysteresis inverse, which is used to cancel the unknown input hysteresis. To tackle the effects of state hysteresis, a new dynamic compensation is developed to adaptively accommodate the uncertain dynamics involved in the sensors. It is proved that in addition to system stability, the proposed scheme enables the tracking error to approach a prescribed interval asymptotically. Illustrative examples are used to verify the method developed.},

The control signal is transmitted to the nonlinear systems through a lossy communication channel in which time-varying network-induced delay occurs. A Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is used to represent the nonlinear systems. Using membership function boundary information, a novel membership-function-dependent (MFD) analysis approach is presented. Unlike most previous results, the proposed MFD analysis approach does not need to increase the number of slack variables to reduce conservatism. Combining auxiliary matrices and this approach, we propose some new fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (FLKFs) that do not require the restrictions of positive definiteness imposed on Lyapunov matrices. Using the FLKF and MFD analysis approach, a sufficient condition in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is developed to guarantee the stability of T-S fuzzy time-varying delay systems. Based on the results for stability, less conservative stabilization conditions are also derived. Finally, numerical examples show that less conservative results can be obtained by the proposed approach. The inverted pendulum system with state delay or network-induced delay is also studied to verify the effectiveness of the suggested approach.},

By adopting fuzzy modeling techniques and varying look-ahead control strategy, an approach to the T-S fuzzy antiwindup output feedback controller design is proposed for the steering control in path tracking within T-S fuzzy-model-based analysis framework, where the actuator amplitude saturation and rate limit are simultaneously taken into consideration. Finally, valuation results with Carsim/MATLAB joint simulation are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methods, and some comparison results in path tracking performance with fixed look-ahead distance control rule and the driver model controller embedded in Carsim are provided, which illustrate the advantages of the developed controller design method.},

Both approaches are elaborated for fuzzy-valued functions. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that, by targeting the particular equation, another subordinate problem was solved under the common constraints. By this, we mean the development of a numerical method for fuzzy integrals. As a result, the proposed method is more accurate in comparison with any other mechanical combination of two separate and independent methods. We give conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a solution and estimate the error of the obtained approximation. We prove the stability and the method is performed on test problems to verify our theoretical results; numerical results are compared with those from existing methods in the literature to confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

This article proposes a method to construct classifiers from multiresolution hierarchical granular representations using hyperbox fuzzy sets. The proposed approach forms a series of granular inferences hierarchically through many levels of abstraction. An attractive characteristic of our classifier is that it can maintain a high accuracy in comparison to other fuzzy min-max models at a low degree of granularity based on reusing the knowledge learned from lower levels of abstraction. In addition, our approach can reduce the data size significantly as well as handle the uncertainty and incompleteness associated with data in real-world applications. The construction process of the classifier consists of two phases. The first phase is to formulate the model at the greatest level of granularity, while the later stage aims to reduce the complexity of the constructed model and deduce it from data at higher abstraction levels. Experimental analyses conducted comprehensively on both synthetic and real datasets indicated the efficiency of our method in terms of training time and predictive performance in comparison to other types of fuzzy min-max neural networks and common machine learning algorithms.},

The membership grades of T2FSs are T1FSs in interval [0, 1], which are referred to as fuzzy truth values (that is, functions from [0, 1] to [0, 1]). Recently, (convolution) operations on T2FSs have become a hot research topic, such as type-2 t-norms, type-2 aggregation operations, type-2 implications, and so on. So, the distributive laws between these convolution operations have become an interesting and natural research area. In this article, we investigate the distributive laws of convolution operations over meet-convolution and join-convolution (two basic operations on fuzzy truth values), respectively. At first, we consider whether the distributive laws hold in various subsets of the set of all fuzzy truth values, such as set-valued T2FSs, singletons, interval-valued T2FSs, and the set of all normal convex fuzzy truth values. Then, we discuss whether the distributive laws hold for some specific convolution operations. Finally, we give a necessary and sufficient condition under which join-convolution is distributive over meet-convolution, and similarly give a necessary and sufficient condition under which meet-convolution is distributive over join-convolution.},

To solve this problem, the R-numbers methodology has been recently developed as a powerful approach to model the risk of fuzzy sets and numbers due to risk factors. In R-numbers, only the variability of x values has been taken into account in risk modeling of the fuzzy sets, but not their membership function. Moreover, merely one source of risk factors related to fuzzy sets and numbers has been considered. Therefore, this article presents a new concept called R-sets, in which different risk cases of a membership function due to both future events and unreliable information sources are investigated, and the governing mathematical relations are presented. Subsequently, to overcome previous limitations of R-numbers, the R-sets are applied to develop a decision-making method, and it is tested by using a case study.},

To balance CAP and CRP, a dynamic clustering analysis process (DCAP) based on consensus evolution networks is proposed. A clustering algorithm proposed based on community detection method can be used to handle the diverse network structures with dynamic consensus thresholds. The clustering validity based on the intracluster consensus levels in subgroups and the intercluster consensus level among subgroups is evaluated. Then, the DCAP after each feedback adjustment round in CRP is reanalyzed. In such a way, effective clustering can also be found after a satisfying consensus is reached.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a high-order disturbance observer (HODO) and dynamic surface control (DSC) technique-based adaptive fuzzy control scheme for nonlinear systems subjected to input saturation and external time-varying disturbances. First, based on a Sigmoid function, the saturation input is tackled by utilizing a well-defined nonlinear smooth function. Furthermore, HODO and fuzzy logic systems are used to estimate the external disturbances and to handle the lumped unknown functions, respectively. Then, by using the backstepping method and DSC technique, a HODO-based adaptive fuzzy tracking control scheme is proposed for nonlinear systems with saturation nonlinearity, uncertainties, and external disturbances. The Lyapunov analysis method is used to prove that all signals in the entire system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). In addition, the tracking error converges to a compact set with a tunable error bound determined by some design parameters. Finally, a numerical simulation of two-stage chemical reactor shows the effectiveness of the developed tracking control strategy.},

First, a novel sliding mode dynamic system is established by introducing a corresponding sliding mode function and an efficient event-triggered mechanism. Then, based on a new Lyapunov function and the reciprocally convex method, sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee that the constructed network sliding mode dynamics is asymptotically stable. It is shown that the trajectories of the sliding mode dynamic system can converge into a bounded domain of a sliding mode surface in finite time. Furthermore, the explicit expression of the desired sliding mode controller is given in the form of linear matrix inequalities.

First, the IT2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model and sampled-data controllers are established subject to mismatched membership functions. Second, considering a nonuniform sampling case, a refined adaptive event-triggered communication scheme is proposed in a hierarchy form to dynamically adjust the direction and rate of the event-triggered threshold parameter by state changing trend and relative state error, respectively. Thus, a complete dual-directional regulating mechanism with sensitivity to state variation is reasonably created to give extra flexibility, which is beneficial for a preferable tradeoff between control performance and network resource. Third, considering the practical behaviors on the sampling interval, a novel integral type of time-dependent Lyapunov function is constructed. Then, the stability criterion and the controller design approach are derived. Finally, the numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods.},

In order to improve the reliability of the data transmission while reducing the network communication burden, a so-called stochastic communication protocol (SCP) governed by a Markov chain is adopted to orchestrate the data transmission order from the controller to the actuator. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a set of desired EMPC controllers so as to guarantee the mean-square system stability and obtain a good balance among the computation burden, initial feasible region, and the control performance. A novel control model is established for the SCP and IT2 T-S fuzzy nonlinearities in a unified representation by using a fuzzy periodic switching related to the transmission token and the membership function. Then, the system state, the SCP-based control perturbation, and the previous input under the SCP are fully taken into consideration for constructing the objective function. By virtue of the “min-max” strategy, a few optimizations are formulated, and the corresponding EMPC algorithm is provided, where the feedback gain is designed offline, while the control perturbation is obtained online. Furthermore, by means of the matrix partition technique, sufficient conditions are presented to rigidly guarantee the feasibility of the proposed EMPC algorithm and the mean-square stability of the underlying IT2 T-S fuzzy system. Finally, two illustrative examples are utilized to demonstrate the validity of the proposed EMPC strategy.},

The consequents of the nonlinear subsystem are characterized by a TSK-type system while the antecedents are characterized by interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The structure of the nonlinear subsystem is learned online based on the type-2 fuzzy clustering. Two new updating algorithms are introduced based on the Lyapunov theorem for learning the proposed model parameters and adaptive learning rates to assure the model stability and the parameter fast convergence.

In particular, the asynchronous resilient AETM thresholds are adaptively varied based on error information between current sampling and latest available packets. Then, a new switched IT2 fuzzy dynamical output feedback system is modeled by discussing the influence of the AETM and nonperiodic DoS attacks simultaneously. Furthermore, mismatched membership functions are considered between dynamic output feedback controller and IT2 fuzzy model, and a slack matrix is introduced to relax stability conditions. Besides, by utilizing the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii function method, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the newly constructed switching system is globally exponentially stable with H ∞ performance.

In the control method, with the help of supervisor control strategy, it is guaranteed that the resulting closed-loop signals including system states, respectively, belong to the corresponding compact sets, which is necessary for fuzzy approximation theory because it is on a compact set that an unknown smooth function can be approximated by fuzzy logic system.

A stochastic communication scheduling protocol is utilized to govern the transmission from the sensors to the controller, by which only one sensor node has the chance to transmit its value at every instant. Meanwhile, cyber attacks from malicious adversaries might be launched in vulnerable communication channels. To quantitatively analyze the effect of the stochastic communication protocol and cyber attacks, their mathematical model is first constructed based on a compensation scheme. Since the scheduling signal may be unavailable once cyber attacks are activated, a desirable sliding mode control law is synthesized with token-independent control gains, whose membership functions are mismatched with those of the fuzzy system. To deal with these mismatched membership functions, the relations between the membership functions of the system and the control law are reconstructed. Consequently, the favorable property of perfectly matched memberships could be employed. Sufficient conditions are derived so that the resultant closed-loop interval type-2 fuzzy system is stochastically stable and, at the same time, the state trajectories can be forced into a small domain around the prescribed sliding surface. The proposed control design approach is verified by two examples.},

The DPs are the total number of α planes and the tuning parameter of the secondary membership function that are interpreted as sensitivity and shape DPs, respectively. We provide a clear understanding and interpretation of the sensitivity and shape DPs on controller performance through various comparative analyses. We present design approaches on how to tune the shape DP by providing a tradeoff between robustness and performance. We also propose two online scheduling mechanisms to tune the shape DP. We explore the effect of the sensitivity DP on the GT2-FLC and provide practical insights on how to tune the sensitivity DP. We present an algorithm for tuning the sensitivity DP that provides a compromise between computational time and sensitivity. We validate our analyses, interpretations, and design methods with experimental results conducted on a drone.

  abstract     = {Dempster-Shafer evidence (DSE) theory, which allows combining pieces of evidence from different data sources to derive a degree of belief function that is a type of fuzzy measure, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty. In this framework, how to optimally manage the conflicts of multiple pieces of evidence in DSE remains an open issue to support decision making. The existing conflict measurement approaches can achieve acceptable outcomes but do not fully consider the optimization at the decision-making level using the novel measurement of conflicts. In this article, we propose a novel evidential correlation coefficient (ECC) for belief functions by measuring the conflict between two pieces of evidence in decision making. Then, we investigate the properties of our proposed evidential correlation and conflict coefficients, which are all proven to satisfy the desirable properties for conflict measurement, including nonnegativity, symmetry, boundedness, extreme consistency, and insensitivity to refinement. We also present several examples and comparisons to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ECC method. Finally, we apply the proposed ECC in a decision-making application of motor rotor fault diagnosis, which verifies the practicability and effectiveness of our proposed novel measurement.},

This article introduces fuzzy-optimized data management (FDM) technique for classifying and improving coalition of accumulated information based semantics and constraints. The dependency of the information is classified on the basis of the relationships modeled between the data based on the attributes. This technique segregates the considered attributes based on similarity index boundaries to process complex data in a controlled time. The performance of the proposed FDM is analyzed using a real-time weather forecast dataset consisting of sensor data (observed) and image data (captured). With this dataset, the functions of FDM such as input semantics analytics and classification based on similarity are performed. The metrics classification and processing time and similarity index are analyzed for the varying data sizes, classification instances, and dataset records. The proposed FDM is found to achieve 36.28\% less processing time for varying classification instances, and 12.57\% high similarity index.},

  abstract     = {Hashing methods for efficient image retrieval aim at learning hash functions that map similar images to semantically correlated binary codes in the Hamming space with similarity well preserved. The traditional hashing methods usually represent image content by hand-crafted features. Deep hashing methods based on deep neural network (DNN) architectures can generate more effective image features and obtain better retrieval performance. However, the underlying data structure is hardly captured by existing DNN models. Moreover, the similarity (either visually or semantically) between pairwise images is ambiguous, even uncertain, to be measured in the existing deep hashing methods. In this article, we propose a novel hashing method termed deep fuzzy hashing network (DFHN) to overcome the shortcomings of existing deep hashing approaches. Our DFHN method combines the fuzzy logic technique and the DNN to learn more effective binary codes, which can leverage fuzzy rules to model the uncertainties underlying the data. Derived from fuzzy logic theory, the generalized hamming distance is devised in the convolutional layers and fully connected layers in our DFHN to model their outputs, which come from an efficient xor operation on given inputs and weights. Extensive experiments show that our DFHN method obtains competitive retrieval accuracy with highly efficient training speed compared with several state-of-the-art deep hashing approaches on two large-scale image datasets: CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.},

  abstract     = {For optimal utilization of power generation resources, load forecasting plays a vital role in balancing the load flow in a power distribution network. There are several drawbacks associated with existing forecasting techniques for load flow balancing. Neural network (NN) based forecasting techniques are unable to consider the actual states of a power system, while weighted least squares state estimation (WLS) fails to counter nonlinearity in the demand profile. In this article, a hybrid approach is proposed for short term load forecasting. The hybrid technique, comprised of a WLS, NN, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), is termed WLANFIS. ANFIS itself is the combination of an NN and fuzzy logic. It takes a refined data set obtained through NN and WLS, which helps in determining the optimal number and types of membership functions. It also helps in determining the effective fuzzy set ranges for an individual membership function that is used by the fuzzy system. WLS provides estimated states in the real-world scenario while the NN models the nonlinearity in the demand profile and is tested on IEEE 14 and 30 bus systems as well on real-world data sets. Results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher generalization capability and provides accurate forecasting results even in the case of medium-term load forecasting. It outperforms other methodologies by achieving a mean absolute percentage error as low as 2.66\%.},

However, it is a challenging issue for deep learning, and clustering algorithms to analyze large medical data because of their high computational complexity, thus hindering the progress of smart medicine. In this article, we present an incremental high-order possibilistic c-means algorithm (IHoPCM) on a cloud-edge computing system to achieve medical data coclustering of multiple hospitals in different locations. Specifically, each hospital employs the deep computation model to learn a feature tensor of each medical data object on the local edge computing system, and then uploads the feature tensors to the cloud computing platform. The high-order possibilistic c-means algorithm is performed on the cloud system for medical data clustering on uploaded feature tensors. Once the new medical data feature tensors are arriving at the cloud computing platform, the incremental high-order possibilistic c-means algorithm (IHoPCM) is performed on the combination of the new feature tensors and the previous clustering centers to obtain clustering results for the feature tensors received to date. In this way, repeated clustering on the previous feature tensors is avoided to improve the clustering efficiency. In the experiments, we compare different algorithms on two medical datasets regarding clustering accuracy and clustering efficiency. Results show that the presented IHoPCM method achieves great improvements over the compared algorithms in clustering accuracy and efficiency.},

As a countermeasure, a fuzzy-based trustworthiness evaluation scheme for privilege management in VANETs is proposed in this article. In the proposed scheme, to ensure the result of trustworthiness is valid, mutual authentication with conditional anonymity between the evaluator and the vehicle to be evaluated is first employed. Then, based on the vehicle&#39;s behavioral big data, the trustworthiness of each vehicle is evaluated by utilizing the fuzzy theory. Note that the privilege of a vehicle and the reliability of the vehicle&#39;s messages are determined by its trustworthiness. Moreover, the mobility of vehicles is also considered in this article, since the location of a vehicle is not constant and the monitoring area of an road side unit is limited. The results of theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of security and efficiency.},

In this article, giving a valid and true response to the change is an essential task to improve the diversity of solutions when an environmental change occurs. The basic idea is to randomly remove some solutions and replace by newly created solutions. However, the random selection detours the algorithm&#39;s trajectory and deteriorates the performance of the optimization algorithm. Recently, the Borda method has been deployed to find the best candidates to be removed from the solutions list. Although the Borda method outperforms the random strategy, it suffers from some drawbacks. In this article, we propose an improved Borda count method incorporated with fuzzy tuned parameters so that its parameters are adjusted by Mamdani fuzzy rules. Our new Borda method can distinguish the information before and after change with different fuzzy weights. In addition to the fuzzy-based Borda, we employ an improved evolutionary algorithm based on fuzzy logic. We propose a novel nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with its parameters tuned with fuzzy rules so that it is adapted to the new environment. Experiments are conducted on standard benchmarks and the results are compared with recent algorithms. Then, multimedia data analysis, such as segmentation of moving objects, is experimented as a dynamic multiobjective problem and solved by the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for pattern recognition. Traditional ML algorithms have limited ability to reveal the most sophisticated features of cancer histopathological images, but their robustness and fault tolerance can be enhanced by using fuzzy modeling to capture the uncertainty in image data. Therefore, this article proposes a novel CoMHisP framework based on a fuzzy support vector machine with within-class density information (FSVM-WD). It utilizes a novel feature extraction technique by optimizing the block size to extract image micropatterns and computing center of mass (CoM) for each pixel to extract feature vectors. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a CMTHis dataset comprising histopathological images of canine mammary tumor (CMT), a prevalent neoplastic disease in female dogs, and an established model for human breast cancer. Data analysis reveals that stain normalization and magnification influence the performance of the CoMHisP framework, with the best results achieved at lower magnifications after stain normalization. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 97.25\% ( $\pm$ 1.80\%) using a FSVM-WD classifier, outperforming both traditional ML and deep FE-VGGNET16-based feature descriptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a CoM-based feature descriptor has been proposed for histopathological image analysis of CMTs and its performance was evaluated using a fuzzy SVM-based classifier. The proposed method performs well with datasets of limited size and low-magnification images and, therefore, has the potential to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis in low-cost clinical settings.},

In this article, a constrained multiperiod multiobjective portfolio model is established. This model introduces several constraints to reflect the trading restrictions and quantifies future security returns by fuzzy random variables to capture fuzzy and random uncertainties in the financial market. Meanwhile, it considers terminal wealth, conditional value at risk (CVaR), and skewness as tricriteria for decision making. Obviously, the proposed model is computationally challenging. This situation gets worse when investors are interested in a larger financial market since the data they need to analyze may constitute typical big data. Whereafter, a novel intelligent hybrid algorithm is devised to solve the presented model. In this algorithm, the uncertain objectives of the model are approximated by a simulated annealing resilient back propagation (SARPROP) neural network which is trained on the data provided by fuzzy random simulation. An improved imperialist competitive algorithm, named IFMOICA, is designed to search the solution space. The intelligent hybrid algorithm is compared with the one obtained by combining NSGA-II, SARPROP neural network, and fuzzy random simulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the compared one not only in the running time but also in the quality of obtained Pareto frontier. To improve the computational efficiency and handle the large scale securities data, the algorithm is parallelized using MPI. The conducted experiments illustrate that the parallel algorithm is scalable and can solve the model with the size of securities more than 400 in an acceptable time.},

Its enormous scale, high dimensionality, and inherent uncertainty make almost every aspect of machine learning difficult, from providing enough processing power to maintaining model accuracy to protecting privacy. However, perhaps the most imposing problem is that big data is often interspersed with sensitive personal data. Hence, we propose a privacy-preserving hierarchical fuzzy neural network to address these technical challenges while also alleviating privacy concerns. The network is trained with a two-stage optimization algorithm, and the parameters at low levels of the hierarchy are learned with a scheme based on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers, which does not reveal local data to other agents. Coordination at high levels of the hierarchy is handled by the alternating optimization method, which converges very quickly. The entire training procedure is scalable, fast, and does not suffer from gradient vanishing problems like the methods based on backpropagation. Comprehensive simulations conducted on both regression and classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code is available online.},

  abstract     = {Traditional deep learning methods are suboptimal in classifying ambiguity features, which often arise in noisy and hard to predict categories, especially, to distinguish semantic scoring. Semantic scoring, depending on semantic logic to implement evaluation, inevitably contains fuzzy description and misses some concepts, for example, the ambiguous relationship between normal and probably normal always presents unclear boundaries (normal-more likely normal-probably normal). Thus, human error is common when annotating images. Differing from existing methods that focus on modifying kernel structure of neural networks, this article proposes a dominant fuzzy fully connected layer (FFCL) for breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) scoring and validates the universality of this proposed structure. This proposed model aims to develop complementary properties of scoring for semantic paradigms, while constructing fuzzy rules based on analyzing human thought patterns, and to particularly reduce the influence of semantic conglutination. Specifically, this semantic-sensitive defuzzifier layer projects features occupied by relative categories into semantic space, and a fuzzy decoder modifies probabilities of the last output layer referring to the global trend. Moreover, the ambiguous semantic space between two relative categories shrinks during the learning phases, as the positive and negative growth trends of one category appearing among its relatives were considered. We first used the Euclidean distance to zoom in the distance between the real scores and the predicted scores, and then employed two sample t test method to evidence the advantage of the FFCL architecture. Extensive experimental results performed on the curated breast imaging subset of digital database of screening mammography dataset show that our FFCL structure can achieve superior performances for both triple and multiclass classification in BI-RADS scoring, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {For heterogeneous data sets containing numerical and symbolic feature values, feature selection based on fuzzy neighborhood multigranulation rough sets (FNMRS) is a very significant step to preprocess data and improve its classification performance. This article presents an FNMRS-based feature selection approach in neighborhood decision systems. First, some concepts of fuzzy neighborhood rough sets and neighborhood multigranulation rough sets are given, and then the FNMRS model is investigated to construct uncertainty measures. Second, the optimistic and pessimistic FNMRS models are built by using fuzzy neighborhood multigranulation lower and upper approximations from algebra view, and some fuzzy neighborhood entropy-based uncertainty measures are developed in information view. Inspired by both algebra and information views based on the FNMRS model, the fuzzy neighborhood pessimistic multigranulation entropy is proposed. Third, the Fisher score model is utilized to delete irrelevant features to decrease the complexity of high-dimensional data sets, and then, a forward feature selection algorithm is provided to promote the performance of heterogeneous data classification. Experimental results on 12 data sets show that the presented model is effective for selecting important features with the higher stability of classification in neighborhood decision systems.},

  abstract     = {The continuous development of industry big data technology requires better computing methods to discover the data value. Information forecast, as an important part of data mining technology, has achieved excellent applications in some industries. However, the existing deviation and redundancy in the data collected by the sensors make it difficult for some methods to accurately predict future information. This article proposes a semisupervised prediction model, which exploits the improved unsupervised clustering algorithm to establish the fuzzy partition function, and then utilize the neural network model to build the information prediction function. The main purpose of this article is to effectively solve the time analysis of massive industry data. In the experimental part, we built a data platform on Spark, and used some marine environmental factor datasets and UCI public datasets as analysis objects. Meanwhile, we analyzed the results of the proposed method compared with other traditional methods, and the running performance on the Spark platform. The results show that the proposed method achieved satisfactory prediction effect.},

  abstract     = {The papers in this special section focus on applications of fuzzy systems in data science and Big Data. In the era of Big Data, intelligent as well as fuzzy tools have become very important to understanding our changing Internet-of-Things-driven data-centric world. Extracting “intelligence” from massive amounts of data has allowed us to support decision making processes in many fields, ranging from common fields like medicine and engineering to more lucrative industries such as vehicular technology and environmental stressors. In line with the shift in many industries to analyzing big data, has added in the fuzzy perspective to allow new ways of reasoning. Examples include interpretability of computing schemes, which have become more and more complex. Yet, successful applications of biomathematical modeling in a fuzzy environment have shown a good alternative to mere common black-box tools. In the call for papers of this special issue, we had devoted our interest in research pertaining to the current state-of-the-art research in the application of fuzzy systems regarding data science and big data analytics. We actively solicited recent results mainly concerned with recent advances and challenges in the theory and applications of fuzzy systems in the fields of data sciences and big data environments.},
