The potential of sentiment analysis for detecting depression through an analysis of social media messages has brought increasing attention to this field. In this article, we propose 90 unique features as input to a machine learning classifier framework for detecting depression using social media texts. Derived from a combination of feature extraction approaches using sentiment lexicons and textual contents, these features are able to provide impressive results in terms of depression detection. While the performance of different feature groups varied, the combination of all features resulted in accuracies greater than 96% for all standard single classifiers, and the best accuracy of over 98% with Gradient Boosting, an ensemble classifier.},

  abstract     = {The protection of user privacy is an important concern in machine learning, as evidenced by the rolling out of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) in May 2018. The GDPR is designed to give users more control over their personal data, which motivates us to explore machine learning frameworks for data sharing that do not violate user privacy. To meet this goal, in this article, we propose a novel lossless privacy-preserving tree-boosting system known as SecureBoost in the setting of federated learning. SecureBoost first conducts entity alignment under a privacy-preserving protocol and then constructs boosting trees across multiple parties with a carefully designed encryption strategy. This federated learning system allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over multiple parties with common user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds to a vertically partitioned dataset. An advantage of SecureBoost is that it provides the same level of accuracy as the non -privacy-preserving approach while at the same time, reveals no information of each private data provider. We show that the SecureBoost framework is as accurate as other nonfederated gradient tree-boosting algorithms that require centralized data, and thus, it is highly scalable and practical for industrial applications such as credit risk analysis. To this end, we discuss information leakage during the protocol execution and propose ways to provably reduce it.},

Formal argumentation enables reasoning on arguments for and against a claim to decide on an outcome. An argumentation framework often models a dynamic situation where arguments as well as the way they interact frequently change over the time. As a consequence, the sets of accepted arguments (i.e., extensions under a given semantics) often need to be computed again after performing an update. In this article, we address the problem of efficiently recomputing extensions of dynamic argumentation frameworks. We present an incremental algorithmic solution whose main idea is that of using an initial extension and the update to identify a (potentially small) portion of the argumentation framework, which is sufficient to compute an extension of the whole updated framework.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has shown that entity resolution (ER) can be effectively performed by gradual machine learning (GML). GML begins with some automatically labeled easy instances and, then, gradually labels more challenging instances by iterative factor graph inference without human intervention. In GML, shared features serve as the medium for knowledge conveyance between easy instances and more challenging ones. The existing GML solution supposes that features play independent roles in gradual inference. However, in real scenarios, this assumption may be untenable since features are usually correlated with each other. To address this limitation, this article proposes an attention-enhanced approach to improve the accuracy of gradual inference. We first propose a method of spectral feature representation to map correlated features to close points in the same vector space and, then, present a model of attention neural network to learn the decisive features, given arbitrary combinations of features for improved feature weighting. Finally, our extensive experiments on real benchmark data have validated the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

One of the main issues when approaching this problem is the lack of data, and the size of the publicly available corpora. In this work, we use the recently annotated US2016 debate corpus. US2016 is the largest existing argument annotated corpus, which allows exploring the benefits of the most recent advances in natural language processing in a complex domain like argument (relation) mining. We present an exhaustive analysis of the behavior of transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, XLNET, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT) when predicting argument relations. Finally, we evaluate the models in five different domains, with the objective of finding the less domain-dependent model.

Despite rich results of risk assessment models for chronic diseases, risk prediction considering the complex mechanisms of disease development and comorbidity remains to be underresearched. This research aims to develop tensor factorization-based methods to predict the onset of new chronic diseases through incorporating the comorbidity patterns with the clinical and sequential factors revealed in the electronic health records (EHRs). The efficacy of the proposed methods was validated through predicting the onset of new chronic diseases using the EHRs data for 23 years from a major hospital in Hong Kong.

Due to the structural design and workload imbalance, many server racks suffer from a nonuniform inlet temperature in raised-floor data centers.

In this article, we employ the active ventilation tiles (AVTs), i.e., ordinary ventilation tiles with attached fans, to enhance the local cold air delivery and improve the cooling performance. We propose an AVT control algorithm adapted from the recently developed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to tackle the complex data center environment and thermodynamics. Different from previous studies where the algorithm required extensive pretraining before deployment, our algorithm is fully online. In order to improve the sample efficiency and accelerate the learning speed, we integrate the Dyna architecture to take advantage of the experienced system transitions. We also leverage the idea of shared reward and fingerprint to encourage the cooperation for multi-AVT control. The performance of the proposed solution is then evaluated by deploying a prototype implementation in a production data center. Experimental results reveal that our solution significantly improves the rack inlet temperature distribution.},

Matrix factorization is the basic idea to derive the representations of users and items by decomposing the given interaction matrix. However, existing matrix factorization based approaches share the limitation in that the interaction between user embedding and item embedding is only weakly enforced by fitting the given individual rating value, which may lose potentially useful information. In this article, we propose a novel augmented generalized matrix factorization approach that is able to incorporate the historical interaction information of users and items for learning effective representations of users and items. Despite the simplicity of our proposed approach, extensive experiments on four public implicit feedback datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts. Furthermore, the ablation study demonstrates that by using the historical interactions to enrich user embedding and item embedding for generalized matrix factorization, better performance, faster convergence, and lower training loss can be achieved.},

In this article, we propose path2rec a novel adversarial path-based recommendation model to address these limitations of existing GAN-based methods in recommendation task by naturally incorporating auxiliary information (e.g., social networks and item attributes). It is composed of two modules, 1) pathGAN and 2) path2vec. In pathGAN, we consider both explicit and implicit friends, as well as item attributes by regarding them as the source of graph construction. Then, we propose a smart walk strategy to automatically generate an optimizing path, which can effectively learn the semantic distribution of users and items. In path2vec, to fully exploit context features of the generated path, we use the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model to fine-tune nodes representations learned by pathGAN. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed path2rec by applying it into top- n item recommendation, which reaches better performance than other counterparts.},

Although traditional unimodal data analysis tasks have accumulated abundant labeled datasets, there are few labeled multimodal datasets due to the difficulty and complexity of multimodal data annotation, nor is it easy to directly transfer unimodal knowledge to multimodal data. Unfortunately, there is little related data augmentation work in multimodal domain, especially for image–text data. In this article, to address the scarcity problem of labeled multimodal data, we propose a Multimodal Data Augmentation framework for boosting the performance on multimodal image–text classification task. Our framework learns a cross-modality matching network to select image–text pairs from existing unimodal datasets as the multimodal synthetic dataset, and uses this dataset to enhance the performance of classifiers. We take the multimodal sentiment analysis and multimodal emotion analysis as the experimental tasks and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework for boosting the performance on multimodal classification task.},

To get a sharper picture of the public opinion as expressed on social media, user-related information must be incorporated in the analysis. Relying on a dataset of tweets about vaccination and on an established text classification system, we present the results of a stance monitoring campaign with advanced analysis on temporal and spatial scales.

However, such approaches ignore the rich semantic information that can be obtained from other sentences. This article shows that the contexts of aspects with similar meanings should be considered global semantic information that can be incorporated as domain knowledge. Then, a novel global semantic memory network (GSMNet) is proposed to share the global semantic information of various aspects and generate a domain-specific representation. With the help of domain knowledge, crucial words can be focused on more precisely. Moreover, instead of employing the concatenating operation for vectors before classification, GSMNet adopts a fine-grained information fusion layer to capture the importance of representations for efficiently extracting the valid parts of each dimension.

The k-modes were among the first algorithms developed for categorical clustering using the notion of modes as cluster centroids. However, their major drawback is the random update of the modes in each iteration. In this article, it is proposed to identify the most adequate modes among a list of candidate ones in the mode update step of the process. The proposed algorithm, called density rough k-modes (DRk-M), computes the modes’ density to characterize its observations’ distribution and the rough set theory (RST) to deal with the uncertainty involved in this process. The DRk-M was experimented using UCI datasets and compared to many state-of-the-art methods such as the k-modes (1998), the Ng&#39;s method (2007), Cao&#39;s method (2012), and their variants. The obtained results pointed an average performance improvement reaching 17% in some cases and more than 25.5% of the total experiments with an average improvement more than 7% between these methods.},

This work introduces CAPTURE, a novel CAPTCHA scheme based on adversarial examples. Typically adversarial examples are used to lead an ML model astray. With CAPTURE, we attempt to make a “good use” of such mechanisms in order to increase the robustness and security of existing CAPTCHA schemes. Our empirical evaluations show that CAPTURE can produce CAPTCHA challenges that are easy for humans to solve, while at the same time, CAPTURE can effectively thwart sophisticated ML-based bot solvers.},

To enable effective privacy-preserving multiparty topic modeling, we propose a novel federated general-purpose topic model named private and consistent topic discovery (PC-TD). On the one hand, PC-TD seamlessly integrates differential privacy in topic modeling to provide privacy guarantees on sensitive data of different parties. On the other hand, PC-TD exploits multiple sources of semantic consistency information to retain the accuracy of topic modeling while protecting data privacy. We verify the effectiveness of PC-TD on real-life datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art general-purpose topic models.},

The proposed approach provides a framework for searching for possible project completion scenarios, which allow us to reach the target cost. The focus of this article is a project prototyping problem described in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem. The proposed method uses artificial neural networks, to identify relationships between variables, and constraint programming, to search for project completion scenarios within the company&#39;s resources and project requirements. The results of an experiment indicate that constraint programming provides effective search strategies for finding admissible solutions.

In FAug, devices share a tiny fraction of their local data, i.e., seed samples, and collectively train a synthetic sample generator that can augment the local datasets of devices. To further improve FAug, we introduce a multihop-based seed sample collection method and an oversampling technique that mixes up collected seed samples. Both approaches enjoy the benefit from the crowd of devices, by hiding data privacy from preceding hops and feeding diverse seed samples. In the image classification tasks, simulations demonstrate that the proposed FAug frameworks yield stronger privacy guarantees, lower communication latency, and higher on-device ML accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation models have been widely embedded in various online services, while most of which are designed with the assumption that users’ original behaviors are available in a central server. This may cause the privacy issue. As a response, we follow a recent work called federated collaborative filtering (FCF) for item recommendation with implicit feedback and propose a novel and generic federated recommendation (FedRec) framework for rating prediction with explicit feedback. Specifically, we federate some basic and advanced factorization-based recommendation models both in batch style and in stochastic style. More importantly, in order to protect the private information of which items each user has rated, as well as not to significantly increase the computational and communication cost, we design two simple but effective strategies, i.e., user averaging and hybrid filling, in which some (instead of all) unrated items are randomly sampled and assigned with some virtual ratings accordingly. Empirical studies on two public datasets show the effectiveness of our FedRec in terms of the closeness of a federated model and an unfederated one, and the usefulness of the two filling strategies.},

  abstract     = {To protect user privacy and meet law regulations, federated (machine) learning is obtaining vast interests in recent years. The key principle of federated learning is training a machine learning model without needing to know each user’s personal raw private data. In this article, we propose a secure matrix factorization framework under the federated learning setting, called FedMF. First, we design a user-level distributed matrix factorization framework where the model can be learned when each user only uploads the gradient information (instead of the raw preference data) to the server. While gradient information seems secure, we prove that it could still leak users’ raw data. To this end, we enhance the distributed matrix factorization framework with homomorphic encryption. We implement the prototype of FedMF and test it with a real movie rating dataset. Results verify the feasibility of FedMF. We also discuss the challenges for applying FedMF in practice for future research.},

For example, failing to identify neologisms can reduce the accuracy of the lexical sentiment analysis if opinions are frequently expressed in words that are too new to be in the sentiment dictionary. This article proposes a method based on orthographic pleonasm to identify emotion-related neologisms in the social web: finding words with the most different letter repetition spelling variations. For this method, nondictionary words are extracted from a large social web corpus, spelling standardization is applied, and then words are ranked in a decreasing order of spelling variation frequency. Words with the most spelling variations are then keyword-in-context-analyzed for semantic context. Applied to a collection of comments on YouTube influencers, this method founds neologisms such as slay and early as positive terms, mixed with traditional sentiment words, exclamations, and nouns. Although orthographic pleonasm was originally used to express the speaker’s rhythm and tone of voice, it is also used for initialisms in a way that is difficult to vocalize. The method is, therefore, a practical way to identify new sentiment slang, including both normal words and initialisms.},

LiDAR can provide high-precision point clouds of traffic objects, making it a promising choice for the surveillance device. This article focuses on the traffic object detection with roadside LiDAR: estimating both positions and categories of them. To overcome the challenges posed by point clouds, we propose GC-net, which is based on a three-stage pipeline, including gridding, clustering, and classification. First, we design a one-to-one mapping on raw point cloud as data preprocessing, which transforms the data structure from the graph to the grid. Then, we propose an efficient clustering algorithm: Grid- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise to search the traffic objects. It exploits index information in the grid data to simplify the computational complexity. Last, we train a CNN-based classifier to categorize the found objects by extracting the local features, which performs well even the global shapes are defective. It only employs object-wise supervision, which reduces the difficulty of creating datasets. Based on the point clouds collected in real urban traffic scenarios, comparative experiences show that the proposed GC-net achieves a superior performance both in detection accuracy and computational speed, which are significant indicators for the real-time traffic surveillance systems.},

Weak supervision has shown to be effective in mitigating the scarcity of labeled data by leveraging weak labels or injecting constraints from heuristic rules and/or extrinsic knowledge sources. Social media has little labeled data but possesses unique characteristics that make it suitable for generating weak supervision, resulting in a new type of weak supervision, i.e., weak social supervision. In this article, we illustrate how various aspects of social media can be used as weak social supervision. Specifically, we use the recent research on fake news detection as the use case, where social engagements are abundant but annotated examples are scarce, to show that weak social supervision is effective when facing the labeled data scarcity problem.

In this article, we propose a methodology based on the integrated use of regularized regression and clustering for generating predictive models of future heating load in DHNs. The methodology is tested on a real case study based on a dataset provided by AGSM, an Italian utility company that manages a DHN in the city of Verona, Italy. We generate a set of multiple-equation models having different degrees of complexity and show that models generated by the proposed approach outperform those trained by standard methods.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used successfully in solving many challenging visual perception tasks facing mobile robots and self-driving cars. To facilitate deploying such models on embedded hardware onboard mobile robots that have limited resources, multitask learning approaches have become common. In typically used multitask learning, a shared encoder network extracts features from inputs whereas multiple task-specific decoders transform these features into their target output. However, properly combining different tasks’ losses into the final network loss such that each task is making progress learning is a major challenge in these approaches. In this article, we present an innovative approach to extend a typical single-task network with the capability of performing two tasks without multiple decoders, i.e., a single-stream two-task network. The two output tasks are semantic segmentation and monocular depth prediction which are essential tasks in visual perception for autonomous driving. The method is centered on solving semantic segmentation with a regression loss function rather than a classification one. With our approach, we seize multitask learning benefits of reduced overhead and enhanced generalization while alleviating the need to balance different loss functions.

First, we employ traditional transfer learning methods to adapt and reconstruct the target rating matrix. Second, we propose a cluster rating bias restoration framework specifically to minimize the effect of the negative transfer from the source domain and to restore the context-information-based rating bias trend in the target domain.

Generally, two kinds of dependencies considered are intra-transaction dependence and inter-transaction dependence.

However, as not all recent transactions are relevant to the current and next items, the relevant ones should be identified and prioritized. In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical attentive transaction embedding (HATE) model to tackle these issues. Specifically, a two-level attention mechanism integrates both item embedding and transaction embedding to build an attentive context representation that incorporates both intra- and inter-transaction dependencies. With the learned context representation, HATE then recommends the next item.

We provide a review covering recent progresses to tackle algorithmic fairness problems of deep learning from the computational perspective. Specifically, we show that interpretability can serve as a useful ingredient to diagnose the reasons that lead to algorithmic discrimination. We also discuss fairness mitigation approaches categorized according to three stages of deep learning life-cycle, aiming to push forward the area of fairness in deep learning and build genuinely fair and reliable deep learning systems.},

Most of traditional crowdsourcing e-markets focus primarily on individual incentives to motivate workers to participate. However, workers generally have heterogeneous values, which brings forth an undesirable outcome that workers with larger values monopolize a fixed total payment. This monopolization discourages the workers with smaller values from participating, thereby severely reducing the quality of individual-oriented crowdsourcing e-markets. Thus, this article proposes a team formation (TF) games-based mechanism in which workers are incentivized to form teams and obtain payments according to their contributions. Moreover, the existence of Nash equilibrium for a given TF game is rigorously analyzed. Finally, the experimental results in terms of both simulated and realistic datasets demonstrate that, as compared with state-of-the-art methods, our mechanism can achieve higher crowdsourcing e-markets quality.},

However, VSE faces the computational challenge due to the large scale image-class data and the constrained system processing power. To speed up model training, many researchers resort to different sampling strategies by involving only a small portion of the classes at each training step. However, these methods are greatly biased especially when the sampling distribution deviates from the true data distribution. In order to retain VSE models fidelity, we adopt the regular full-sample in our algorithm. We also devise two separate optimization strategies to reduce time complexity, and derive more effective updating rules. The experimental results on four real datasets demonstrate that our approach not only converges much faster than the state-of-the-art sampling models, but also generates more accurate class retrieval.},

In this method, the multimodal tensor is utilized to guide the evolution of each separated modality representation. To save the computational expense, Tucker decomposition is introduced, which leads to a general extension of the low-rank tensor fusion method with more modality interactions. The method, in turn, enhances our modality distillation processing.

Next, in the regional stage, a self-attention mechanism is used to expand the receptive field from one superpixel to its surrounding and relevant regions. And last, saliency scores are sampled by the Gumbel–Softmax trick in a global regression model. In the experiments, we compare our models including two variations (networks without self-attention or prior weights) with 12 previous methods and test them on several benchmark datasets. Different kinds of strategies are also adopted for evaluation and the results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance.},

The classifier is applied to different synthetic and real-world datasets where imbalance and ambiguity are present. In this article, it is novel to apply a hybrid localized learning algorithm to the HAR problem. When compared to different global and local approaches, higher classification performances could be obtained by using the proposed localized learning approach.

Outlier detection could help with diagnosis, but these confounding factors result in data that are not independent and identically distributed (IID) with respect to a specific patient. To address this non-IID problem, we propose the modeling of confounding factors using metric learning. A distance metric is learned on the confounding factors in order to model their impact on the plantar pressures. This metric is then employed to weight plantar pressures from healthy controls when generating a patient-specific statistical baseline. Statistical parametric mapping is then used to compare the patient to this statistical baseline. We show that using metric learning reduces variance in these statistical baselines, which then improves the sensitivity of the outlier detection. These improvements in outlier detection get us one step closer to accurate computer-aided diagnosis of foot complaints.},

In this article, we propose a generic isolation forest based ensemble framework named EDBHiForest, which can be universally applied to data spaces with arbitrary distance measures. It is realized through embedding the isolation forest structure with extended distance-based hashing (EDBH), which can significantly enhance the versatility and applicability of isolation forest based anomaly detection. This framework overcomes the limitations of existing isolation forest based methods that can only be applied to datasets with a very limited range of distance measure types. Extensive experiments on various non-independent and identically distributed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

To address this challenge, we first detect the tendency of the member who may potentially leave. Here, the outlierness is defined with respect to familiarity, which is quantified by using collaboration intensity. It is assumed that if a team member has a higher familiarity with scholars outside the team, then this member might probably leave the team. To minimize the influence caused by the leaving of such an outlier member, we propose an optimization solution to find a proper candidate who can replace the outlier member. Based on random walk with graph kernel, our solution involves familiarity matching, skill matching, as well as structure matching.

It has significant implications in a myriad of real-world applications, ranging from financial risk, network security, to medical diagnosis. Moreover, outliers usually appear in data streams. The issue of class imbalance or anomaly itself could negatively affect the performance of the underlying learning algorithms, and their combination makes the learning problem harder. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection aided budget online weighted learning method (BOW-LM) to identify positive and negative instances from imbalanced data streams. BOW-LM is based on the widely used Feedforward Networks with Random Weights. An agile lightweight anomaly detector is designed based on the nonlinear mapping of the network. To reduce computational complexity and to response promptly, BOW-LM employs a matrix correction technique to update the learning model by only $\mathcal {O}(L^2)$O(L2) operations for each data chunk with $L$L hidden layer nodes. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BOW-LM.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection has been widely applied in modern data-driven security applications to detect abnormal events/entities that deviate from the majority. However, less work has been done in terms of detecting suspicious event sequences/paths, which are better discriminators than single events/entities for distinguishing normal and abnormal behaviors in complex systems such as cyber-physical systems. A key and challenging step in this endeavor is how to discover those abnormal event sequences from millions of system event records in an efficient and accurate way. To address this issue, we propose NINA, a network diffusion based algorithm for identifying anomalous event sequences. Experimental results on both static and streaming data show that NINA is efficient (processes about 2 million records per minute) and accurate.},

  abstract     = {Outlier detection, also known as anomaly detection, aims at identifying data instances that are rare or significantly different from the majority of instances. Due to its significance in many critical domains like cybersecurity, fintech, healthcare, public security, and AI safety, outlier detection has been one of the most active research areas in various communities, such as machine learning, data mining, computer vision, and statistics. Traditional outlier-detection techniques generally assume that data are independent and identically distributed (IID), which are significantly challenged in complex contexts where data are actually non-IID. These contexts are ubiquitous in not only graph data, sequence data, spatial data, temporal data, and streaming data, but also traditional multidimensional, textual, and image data.4–6 This demands for advanced outlierdetection approaches to address those explicit or implicit non-IID data characteristics.},

However, systems able to automatically understand the content and sentiment of a video are still in their infancy. Linguistic information transported in spoken parts of a video is known to convey valuable properties in regards to context and emotions. In this article, we explore a lexical knowledge-based extraction approach to obtain such understanding from the video transcriptions of a large-scale multimodal dataset (MuSe-CAR). To this end, we use SenticNet to extract natural language concepts and fine-tune several feature types on a subset of MuSe-CAR. With these features, we explore the content of a video as well as learning to predict emotional valence, arousal, and speaker topic classes. Our best model improves the linguistic baseline from the MuSe-Topic 2020 subchallenge by almost 3% (absolute) for the prediction of valence on the predefined challenge metric and outperforms a variety of baseline systems that require much higher computational power than the one proposed herein.},

Adoption of DSS is challenging when such systems lack support, or evidence, for justifying their recommendations. DSSs are widely applied in the medical domain, due to the complexity of the domain and the sheer volume of data that render manual processing difficult. This article proposes a metalevel argumentation-based decision-support system that can reason with heterogeneous data (e.g., body measurements, electronic health records, clinical guidelines), while incorporating the preferences of the human beneficiaries of those decisions. The system constructs template-based explanations for the recommendations that it makes. The proposed framework has been implemented in a system to support stroke patients and its functionality has been tested in a pilot study. User feedback shows that the system can run effectively over an extended period.},

Instead of considering such uncertain information to be useless, knowledge engineers face the challenge of putting it to good use when solving a wide range of problems. Argumentation is a useful approach in this setting: Reasons for and against a claim are analyzed to decide on an outcome, much in the same way as organized human discussions are carried out.1–5 An important byproduct of such analyses is an accompanying explanation that can be leveraged to decide if there is information that should be used differently, discarded, or there is further information to be contemplated.},

  abstract     = {This article takes the lead to study aspect-level sentiment modification (ALSM) without parallel data. Given a sentence, the task of ALSM needs to reverse the sentiment with respect to the given aspect while preserving other content. The main challenge is reversing the sentiment of the given aspect without affecting the sentiments of other aspects in the sentences. To handle this problem, we propose a joint aspect-level sentiment modification (called JASM) model. JASM is a multitask system, which jointly trains two coupled modules: aspect-specific sentiment words extraction and aspect-level sentiment transformation. Besides, we propose a novel memory mechanism to learn aspect-aware sentiment representation and a gating mechanism to dynamically select aspect-aware sentiment information or content information for generating the next words. Experiments show that the proposed model substantially outperforms the compared methods in both aspect-level sentiment transformation and content preservation. For applications, we conduct data augmentation for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) through generating plausible training data with the trained ALSM model. Experiments show that data augmentation with generated data boosts the performance of a broad range of ABSA models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, money laundering has become much easier to be achieved but more challenging to be detected than before, which has enormous adversary effects on finance, military, and other related fields. In the real-time scenario, every money laundering case has a unique structure in terms of transactions. It is not sufficient to detect suspicious behavior by just following the probability theory, where usually the thresholds are given by experts. Since the crime of money laundering is more prevalent and sophisticated nowadays, it will increase the complexity of the detection if the accounts with the personal information are combined with the form of the transaction topology. Hence, the graph topology analysis could be used for antimoney laundering tools. This article proposes eight common topologies based on coupling and connection from simple to much more complicated structures to solve various kinds of problems concerning money laundering in the real world. Moreover, we also propose an efficient solution based on graph and subgraph isomorphism and distance measurement to detect money laundering behavior. In this way, the detection of money laundering behavior will be more efficient and effective for various situations while referencing the proposed eight topological structures.},

  abstract     = {A major goal of systems biology is to model accurately the complex dynamical behavior of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Despite several advancements that have been made in inference of GRNs, two main issues continue to make the problem challenging: 1) nonidentifiability of parameters and 2) limited amounts of data. Thus, it becomes necessary to experimentally perturb or excite the system into different states. This perturbation process disrupts the expression of genes from active to inactive, or vice versa, at each time point. Another issue is the partial observability of the gene states, which must be inferred indirectly from noisy gene expression measurements. In this article, this latter issue is accounted for by employing the partially observed Boolean dynamical system signal model for the data and applying optimal state estimation. Then, the optimal finite-horizon perturbation policy is derived to achieve the highest possible expected performance for the maximum a posteriori estimator under a small perturbation cost. Performance is assessed through numerical experiments using the well-known p53-MDM2 negative-feedback loop regulatory model and synthetic GRNs.},

  abstract     = {Students’ performance prediction is a crucial task in today&#39;s online education. By predicting a student&#39;s final grade in an academic examination, intervene can be applied in advance. Recently, many machine learning models have been designed to couple students’ online activity with their academic performance. However, it is difficult for these models to effectively make prediction due to the excessive difference in feature selection. While in most cases, too many parameters and heterogeneous features can also be one of the main sticking points. To this end, we propose a sequential engagement based academic performance prediction network. It consists of two main components: an engagement detector and a sequential predictor. The engagement detector leverages the advantages of a convolutional neural network to detect students’ engagement patterns through their daily activities. The sequential predictor adopts the structure of long short-term memory and learns the interaction from the engagement feature spaces and demographic features. By comparing with various existing advanced machine learning models, the results show that this method has better performance than the existing ones when involving the engagement detection mechanism.},

How to evaluate the trustworthiness of users and tweets is challenging due to the complex and complicated relationships between/among users and their posts. As existing approaches use a single network to represent users, posts, and their relationships, they have the limitation to reflect the different statistical features of users and tweets, which has reduced the ability to determine the trustworthiness of users and tweets. To address this issue, we develop a trust evaluation method that models users and tweets separately in two networks that are coupled with each other via interactions. We provide mapping functions to map the statistical numbers of actions of users/tweets to trust values that indicate their relevant trust degrees. The proposed method provides a configurable solution that has the capability to consider the effects of users and tweets differently in different trust ranking situations. A set of experiments are conducted against real-data collected from Twitter. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is more effective in trust evaluation compared with several baseline methods.},

Recent works have underlined that a global measure to quantify node homophily necessarily provides a partial, often deceiving, picture of the reality. Moving from such literature, in this work, we propose a novel measure, namely Conformity, designed to overcome such limitation by providing a node-centric quantification of assortative mixing patterns. Different from the measures proposed so far, Conformity is designed to be path-aware, thus allowing for a more detailed evaluation of the impact that nodes at different degrees of separations have on the homophilic embeddedness of a target. Experimental analysis on synthetic and real data allowed us to observe that Conformity can unveil valuable insights from node-attributed graphs.},

  abstract     = {Coupling learning is designed to estimate, discover, and extract the interactions and relationships among learning components. It provides insights into complex interactive data, and has been extensively incorporated into recommender systems to enhance the interpretability of sophisticated relationships between users and items. Coupling learning can be further fostered once the trending collaborative learning can be engaged to take advantage of the cross-platform data. To facilitate this, privacy-preserving solutions are in high demand—it is desired that the collaboration should not expose either the private data of each individual owner or the model parameters trained on their datasets. In this article, we develop a distributed collaborative coupling learning system, which enables differential privacy. The proposed system defends against the adversary who has gained full knowledge of the training mechanism and the access to the model trained collaboratively. It also addresses the privacy-utility tradeoff by a provable tight sensitivity bound. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system guarantees favorable privacy gains at a modest cost in recommendation quality, even in scenarios with a large number of training epochs.},

  abstract     = {Generating the precise semantic representation of a word or concept is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Recent studies which incorporate semantic knowledge into word embedding have shown their potential in improving the semantic representation of a concept. However, existing approaches only achieved limited performance improvement as they usually 1) model a word’s semantics from some explicit aspects while ignoring the intrinsic aspects of the word, 2) treat semantic knowledge as a supplement of word embeddings, and 3) consider partial relations between concepts while ignoring rich coupling relations between them, such as explicit concept co-occurrences in descriptive texts in a corpus as well as concept hyperlink relations in a knowledge network, and implicit couplings between concept co-occurrences and hyperlinks. In human consciousness, a concept is always associated with various couplings that exist within/between descriptive texts and knowledge networks, which inspires us to capture as many concept couplings as possible for building a more informative concept representation. We thus propose a neural coupled concept representation (CoupledCR) framework and its instantiation: a coupled concept embedding (CCE) model. CCE first learns two types of explicit couplings that are based on concept co-occurrences and hyperlink relations, respectively, and then learns a type of high-level implicit couplings between these two types of explicit couplings for better concept representation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show that CCE significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art word embeddings and semantic representation methods.},
