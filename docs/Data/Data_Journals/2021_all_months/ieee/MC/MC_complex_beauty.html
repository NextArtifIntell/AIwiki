  abstract     = {We have more access to data than ever before, but it is difficult to make sense of it when the data is incomplete or inaccurate. As such, data validation is necessary to increase data quality for effective decision making. The authors have discussed some of the essential key concepts and challenges regarding data validation. It is evident that when it comes to data validation, human oversight cannot be completely removed from the practice. Data invaluable human traits that cannot be learned. Even today, no matter how advanced data validation software is, or automated methodologies are, humans are unlikely to proceed with decisions that are not vetted by another human. A data validation dashboard might serve as a means for an experienced data practitioner to monitor data analysis processes from start to finish. The dashboard could enable teams or project managers to allocate resources, tasks, and also more effectively supervise the status and the best outcome possible for projects.},

  abstract     = {Parameter server is a popular distributed processing paradigm for operating distributed deep learning (DL) applications. As a growing number of DL models are trained via shared clusters, machines are in confrontation with the heterogeneous environment, which incurs the unexpected phenomenon with a slow task processing speed called straggler. Straggler addressing is a crucial issue in distributed DL applications, since stragglers significantly hamper system performance. While many techniques have been deployed to mitigate stragglers, they may not achieve their goals with the presence of heterogeneity, where systems consume much longer time until DL training convergence than in a homogeneous environment, as evidenced by our experimental study. With the methodology of straggler projection and abstraction of parallelism, a new synchronization mechanism called elastic parallelism synchronous parallel (EPSP) is proposed, which exploits the superiority of iteration acceleration in stale synchronous parallel and conquers the shortage of barrier wasting time in bulk synchronous parallel. More precisely, EPSP supports both enforced and slack synchronization by adjusting the parameter of staleness.},

Like many of the articles in our list of influential publications, &quot;Mobile Security: Finally a Serious Problem&quot; is actually the second major piece written by the author on that topic. Like many authors, he needed to revisit the subject and refine his ideas. Leavitt&#39;s first article appeared in 2005. There are &quot;a growing number of viruses, worms, and Trojan horses that target cellular phones,&quot; he wrote in his first discussion of the problem. &quot;Although none of the new attacks has done extensive damage in the wild,&quot; he added, but that &quot;it’s only a matter of time before this occurs.&quot; Five years later, he was not so sanguine. After &quot;years of warnings about mobile security, there finally appears to be a reason to worry,&quot; Leavitt explained. The &quot;number and types of mobile threats - including viruses, spyware, malicious downloadable applications, phishing, and spam - have spiked in recent months.&quot;},

It appeared at a time when the conventional development that had been predicted by Moore&#39;s law was coming to an end and mobile cloud computing was just on the horizon. Kim and his coauthors explained the issues of low power computing and gave Computer readers a tutorial on the nature of lower power computing and the problems that would need to be solved to deliver low power computing. They had no interest in having us forget Gordon Moore or his law. They were just telling us that the world was about to change and that we should be prepared.},

This theme issue on computing for autonomy presents responsive and reliable computing for assured autonomy. Autonomous systems have emerged as a key technology for a wide range of use cases. They can be used to inspect remote equipment, deliver packages, and transport people. Types of autonomous vehicles include those that operate on the ground, under the ocean, in the air, and in space. An autonomous system may include multiple vehicles. Vehicles may operate in formation or in swarms to perform a task. They may also cooperate to avoid collisions and traffic jams. Computing for autonomy clearly requires support for artificial intelligence and the large computational load that applications imply. These systems must also satisfy several types of nonfunctional requirements. Assured autonomy requires real-time responsiveness. Real-time operation is not only necessary for correct and efficient operation but also is a requirement for the safe operation of autonomous systems across many application domains. Safety is fundamental to the acceptance},
