  abstract     = {Robotic manipulators require contact force sensing capabilities to sense the contact force between the manipulator and an object. Specifically, for humans and robots to coexist in the work environment, the robot must be able to detect an external force applied by a human. This study presents a new intrinsic force sensing method for robot manipulators that can obtain accurate information of the external force applied by a human during human–robot interaction. The method employs a robot cover, which is typically utilized in robot manipulators. Unlike conventional force sensing methods, a six-axis force/torque sensor is placed between the cover and the link of the robot manipulator. As a result, the proposed method provides information of the three-axis contact force applied to the cover surface and its contact location. Therefore, the cover itself becomes a sensorized cover based on the intrinsic force sensing method. To evaluate its sensing performance, the sensorized cover is experimentally validated using reference sensors. Finally, an experiment is performed in which the robot successfully recognizes letters written on the cover, indicating a high level of contact force sensing performance.},

Time series is used to forecast the base motion using historical state information. Then, a trajectory specified in the inertial frame is transformed to a predicted trajectory with respect to the manipulator. By tracking this transformed trajectory, the manipulator negates the base motion. A model-predictive control problem is formulated via quadratic programming (QP) to track said trajectory over the prediction horizon. Only the first control action in the control sequence is constrained by kinematic feasibility. In this manner, QP can be swiftly solved with linear inequality constraints. It is shown that the actual joint trajectory executed by the manipulator is always kinematically feasible. Moreover, tracking error can still be reduced despite future predicted control actions being infeasible. The method is validated through both simulation and experiment. The proposed method can reduce pose error by over 60\% compared to a proportional–integral feedback controller.},

To date, exoskeleton controllers have excelled in rhythmic and quasi-rhythmic tasks, whereas control methods for assisting discrete movements remain limited by their task-specificity. Inspired by neurophysiological dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), we formulated a novel controller that facilitated a variety of lifting movements using a single adaptive DMP (aDMP), for wearable robotic assistance of discrete movements. For a variety of load lifting tasks, we first benchmarked our method&#39;s trajectory prediction accuracy against the state-of-the-art DMP using passively recorded exoskeleton sensor data (offline), followed by a functional validation of online aDMP trajectory estimates. Finally, we assessed the functional effects of aDMP-based exoskeletal assistance on joint kinematics and muscular activity during repetitive lifting. The new aDMP method accurately predicted and smoothly synchronized robotic assistance with variable movement trajectories, resulting in reduced muscular activation of the erector spinae muscles (up to 47.6\%) while preserving lower-limb joint kinematics and reducing the extension time by 15.5\% compared to unassisted conditions. This method holds promise for use in a wide range of wearable robotic applications, including both clinical rehabilitation and user assistance in activities of daily living and/or manual labor.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a generalizable methodology for data-driven identification of nonlinear dynamics that bounds the model error in terms of the prediction horizon and the magnitude of the derivatives of the system states. Using higher order derivatives of general nonlinear dynamics that need not be known, we construct a Koopman-operator-based linear representation and utilize Taylor series accuracy analysis to derive an error bound. The resulting error formula is used to choose the order of derivatives in the basis functions and obtain a data-driven Koopman model using a closed-form expression that can be computed in real time. Using the inverted pendulum system, we illustrate the robustness of the error bounds given noisy measurements of unknown dynamics, where the derivatives are estimated numerically. When combined with control, the Koopman representation of the nonlinear system has marginally better performance than competing nonlinear modeling methods, such as SINDy and NARX. In addition, as a linear model, the Koopman approach lends itself readily to efficient control design tools, such as linear–quadratic regulator, whereas the other modeling approaches require nonlinear control methods. The efficacy of the approach is further demonstrated with simulation and experimental results on the control of a tail-actuated robotic fish. Experimental results show that the proposed data-driven control approach outperforms a tuned proportional–integral–derivative controller and that updating the data-driven model online significantly improves performance in the presence of unmodeled fluid disturbance.

The interests of agents may be at odds with others, resulting in a stochastic noncooperative dynamic game. Agents must predict others’ future actions without communication, incorporate their actions into these predictions, account for uncertainty and noise in information gathering, and consider what information their actions reveal. Our solution uses local iterative dynamic programming in Gaussian belief space to solve a game-theoretic continuous POMDP. Solving a quadratic game in the backward pass of a game-theoretic belief-space variant of iterative linear-quadratic Gaussian control (iLQG) achieves a runtime polynomial in the number of agents and linear in the planning horizon. Our algorithm yields linear feedback policies for our robot, and predicted feedback policies for other agents. We present three applications: Active surveillance, guiding eyes for a blind agent, and autonomous racing. Agents with game-theoretic belief-space planning win 44\% more races than without game theory and 34\% more than without belief-space planning.},

To implement the Riemannian Staircase in the distributed setting, we develop Riemannian block coordinate descent (RBCD), a novel method for (locally) minimizing a function over a product of Riemannian manifolds. We also propose the first distributed solution verification and saddle escape methods to certify the global optimality of critical points recovered via RBCD, and to descend from suboptimal critical points (if necessary). All components of our approach are inherently decentralized: they require only local communication, provide privacy protection, and are easily parallelizable. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method correctly recovers globally optimal solutions under moderate noise, and outperforms alternative distributed techniques in terms of solution precision and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial filters are formal structures for filtering and reasoning over discrete sensor data. This article presents a series of results addressing the question whether the filter minimization (FM) problem, an NP-hard problem of state-space reduction on such filters, and a variant of it, the filter partitioning minimization (FPM) problem, which requires the reduced filter to partition the state space of the original filter, can be solved via quotient operations under equivalence relations of the state space. We first consider the well-known notion of bisimulation and show that, although bisimulation always yields feasible solutions to FM and FPM problems, it does not necessarily induce optimal solutions. We also establish a connection between filter reduction and the notion of simulation ; specifically, we show that the FM problem is equivalent to the problem of inducing a minimal filter that simulates a given filter. We then introduce a variant of bisimulation, which we call compatibility , and prove that the FPM problem can always be solved by computing the quotient of the input filter under a compatibility equivalence relation having a minimum number of equivalence classes. On the other hand, computing optimal solutions to the FM problem requires to look for relations beyond equivalence relations, and in fact, the FM problem can be solved by computing the quotient of the original filter under a closed covering of the state space with the minimum number of compatibility classes. Subsequently, we introduce two special relations, the union of all compatibility relations and the mergeability relation , which are both computable in polynomial time. By analyzing where these two relations become an equivalence relation, we identify several classes of filters for which FM and FPM problems are solvable in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {Robot grasping with deformable gripper jaws results in nonplanar surface contacts if the jaws deform to the nonplanar local geometry of an object. The frictional force and torque that can be transmitted through a nonplanar surface contact are both 3-D, resulting in a 6-D frictional wrench (6DFW). Applying traditional planar contact models to such contacts leads to overconservative results as the models do not consider the nonplanar surface geometry and only compute a 3-D subset of the 6DFW. To address this issue, we derive the 6DFW for nonplanar surfaces by combining concepts of differential geometry and Coulomb friction. We also propose two 6-D limit surface (6DLS) models, generalized from well-known 3-D LS (3DLS) models, which describe the friction-motion constraints for a contact. We evaluate the 6DLS models by fitting them to the 6DFW samples obtained from six parametric surfaces and 2932 meshed contacts from finite element method simulations of 24 rigid objects. We further present an algorithm to predict multicontact grasp success by building a grasp wrench space with the 6DLS model of each contact. To evaluate the algorithm, we collected 1035 physical grasps of ten 3-D-printed objects with a KUKA robot and a deformable parallel-jaw gripper. In our experiments, the algorithm achieves 66.8\% precision, a metric inversely related to false positive predictions, and 76.9\% recall, a metric inversely related to false negative predictions. The 6DLS models increase recall by up to 26.1\% over 3DLS models with similar precision. 1},

This is particularly relevant in the context of healthcare applications. Indeed, the use for rehabilitation has been proposed of artificial agents able to interact and coordinate their movements with those of patients suffering from social or motor disorders. Moreover, it has also been shown that the level of motor coordination between the avatar and the human patient is enhanced if the kinematic properties of the avatar’s motion are similar to those of the individual it is interacting with. In this article, we discuss, first, a new method based on Markov chains to confer “human motor characteristics” on the motion of a virtual agent so that it can coordinate its motion with that of a target individual while exhibiting specific kinematic properties. Then, we embed such synthetic model in a novel control architecture based on reinforcement learning to synthesize a cyber-agent able to mimic the behavior of a specific human performing a joint motor task with one or more individuals.},

With a simple mouse click, the user can switch between the robots and the collaborative operation mode. The control, subsequently, manages the distribution of the required parameters into the involved robots. Thanks to the introduced virtual hand concept, where each robot is defined as a finger, new robots can be easily added or removed via their kinodynamic parameters. The proposed framework was evaluated with three different experiments: a simulated auscultation on a mock-up patient, a cooperative task where a robot drives the patient on a wheelchair and a different robot performs the auscultation, and a collaborative task where two robots relocate a container. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the framework in terms of adaptability to different robotic platforms, the number of robots involved, and the task requirements.

In this article, a beetle ( Mecynorrhina torquata ) was transformed into a hybrid flying system by mounting an electronic backpack and implanting electrodes on it. Wing trajectories during fictive flight climbing and flight diving were captured to investigate the natural flight-height control of beetles. Compare with the electrically induced wing trajectories via basalar, subalar, and third axillary (3Ax) muscle stimulations, we hypothesized that the basalar muscles are involved in ascending flight, whereas the 3Ax muscles function to reduce the flight-height. By reproducing the electrical stimulations on bilateral muscle pairs during free flights, we found that stimulations of the basalar muscle pair increased vertical accelerations. In contrast, the 3Ax muscle pair&#39;s stimulation decreased vertical accelerations gradually as a function of the electrical stimulation frequency. Accordingly, a proportional-derivative feedback controller was proposed to maintain the beetles&#39; flight-height using frequency-dependent electrical pulses on the basalar and 3Ax muscles. In this article, the altitude control of a free-flying beetle was demonstrated for the first time.},

  abstract     = {Insect-sized ( $\sim$ 100 mg) aerial robots have advantages over larger robots because of their small size, low weight, and low materials cost. Previous iterations have demonstrated controlled flight but were difficult to fabricate because they consisted of many separate parts assembled together and were also unable to perform locomotion modes besides flight. This article presents a new design of a 74-mg flapping-wing robot that dramatically reduces the number of parts and simplifies fabrication. The robot also has a lower center of mass, which allows the robot to additionally land without the need for long legs, even in case of unstable flight. We also show that the new design allows for wing-driven ground and air–water interfacial locomotion, improving the versatility of the robot. During surface ambulation, forward thrust is generated by increasing the speed of the upstroke relative to the downstroke of the flapping wings. Adjusting relative wing stroke amplitudes also allows for steering. The ability to land and subsequently move along the ground first presented here allows the robot to negotiate extremely confined spaces and underneath obstacles. We present results demonstrating these capabilities, as well as hovering flight and controlled landing.},

With timing fixed, the state variables can be optimized efficiently using convex optimization, and the timing variables can be optimized in a separate NLP, which forms a bilevel optimization problem. The challenge of obtaining the gradient of the timing variables is solved by sensitivity analysis of parametric NLPs. The exact analytic gradient is computed from the dual solution as a by-product, whereas existing finite-difference techniques require additional optimization. The bilevel optimization framework efficiently optimizes both timing and state variables which is demonstrated on generating trajectories for an UAV. Numerical experiments demonstrate that bilevel optimization converges significantly more reliably than a standard NLP solver, and analytical gradients outperform finite differences in terms of computation speed and accuracy. Physical experiments demonstrate its real-time applicability for reactive target tracking tasks.},

However, high-speed navigation still remains a significant challenge. Given very limited time, existing methods have no strong guarantee on the feasibility or quality of the solutions. Moreover, most methods do not consider environment perception, which is the key bottleneck to fast flight. In this article, we present RAPTOR, a robust and perception-aware replanning framework to support fast and safe flight, which addresses these issues systematically. A path-guided optimization approach that incorporates multiple topological paths is devised, to ensure finding feasible and high-quality trajectories in very limited time. We also introduce two perception-aware planning approaches to actively observe and avoid unknown obstacles. A risk-aware trajectory refinement ensures that unknown obstacles which may endanger the quadrotor can be observed earlier and avoid in time. The motion of yaw angle is planned to actively explore the surrounding space that is relevant for safe navigation. The proposed methods are tested extensively through benchmark comparisons and challenging indoor and outdoor aggressive flights. We release our implementation as an open-source package 1 for the community.},

The challenge is rendered harder by the fact that robots may be heterogeneous and that their plans may be posted asynchronously. Most existing approaches require constraints on the infrastructure or unrealistic assumptions on robot models. In this article, we propose a centralized, loosely-coupled supervisory controller that overcomes these limitations. The approach responds to newly posed constraints and uncertainties during trajectory execution, ensuring at all times that planned robot trajectories remain kinodynamically feasible, that the fleet is in a safe state, and that there are no deadlocks or livelocks. This is achieved without the need for hand-coded rules, fixed robot priorities, or environment modification. We formally state all relevant properties of robot behavior in the most general terms possible, without assuming particular robot models or environments, and provide both formal and empirical proof that the proposed fleet control algorithms guarantee safety and liveness.},

To achieve this, a closed formation (StringNet) of defenders is formed around the adversarial swarm. A combination of open-loop, near time-optimal controllers (that result in forming the defenders’ formation), and state-feedback controllers with finite-time convergence guarantees under bounded inputs (that guide the formation around attackers and toward the safe area) synthesize the herding strategy. For demonstration purpose, we consider that the attacking swarm moves under a flocking model, which however is unknown to the defenders. Collision-free trajectory generation for the defenders, as well as their convergence to the desired formations, is proved formally, and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

In contrast to a single specialized robot, the MRS can be designed to offer flexibility, reconfigurability, robustness to faults, and cost-effectiveness in solving complex and challenging tasks. In this article, we aim to develop a unified cluster formation containment coordination framework for networked robots that can be decomposed into two layers containing the leaders and the followers. According to the proposed methodology, the leader robots are first distributed into a set of distinct and nonoverlapping clusters depending on the positions and priorities of the targets exploiting a game-theoretic rule. Then, they are steered to attain the desired formations around the corresponding targets. Subsequently, the follower robots are made to converge into the convex hull spanned by the leaders of the individual clusters. A prototype search and rescue operation is considered to highlight the usefulness of the proposed coordination framework. Furthermore, real-time hardware experiments were conducted on miniature mobile robots to validate the feasibility of the theoretical results.},

First, infinitesimal shape-similarity, a property of frameworks for which maintaining certain angles between robots ensures that the formation is invariant to translation, rotation, and uniform scaling, is examined; the shape-similarity matrix is redeveloped, and results on its nullspace are presented. Second, triangulations, a class of frameworks, are shown to be infinitesimally shape-similar. Finally, the coupling between network topology and robot capabilities is examined through the design of a decentralized heterogeneous formation-control strategy for a class of triangulations in which all robots are equipped with bearing-only sensors and a single robot can measure distances; the formation-control strategy is demonstrated on a team of differential-drive robots.},

They can, however, access a common state measurement, either from one robot broadcasting its measurements to the team, or by all robots communicating and averaging their state measurements to estimate the state of their centroid. To solve this problem, we propose a decentralized adaptive control scheme wherein each agent maintains and adapts its own estimate of the object parameters in order to track a reference trajectory. We present an analysis of the controller’s behavior, and show that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, and that the system trajectory will almost always (except for initial conditions on a set of measure zero) converge to the desired trajectory. We study the proposed controller’s performance using numerical simulations of a manipulation task in 3-D, as well as hardware experiments which demonstrate our algorithm on a planar manipulation task. These studies, taken together, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller even in the presence of numerous unmodeled effects, such as discretization errors and complex frictional interactions.},

  abstract     = {Sampling-based planning methods often become inefficient due to narrow passages. Narrow passages induce a higher runtime, because the chance to sample them becomes vanishingly small. In recent work, we showed that narrow passages can be approached by relaxing the problem using admissible lower dimensional projections of the state space. Those relaxations often increase the volume of narrow passages under projection. Solving the relaxed problem is often efficient and produces an admissible heuristic we can exploit. However, given a base path, i.e., a solution to a relaxed problem, there are currently no tailored methods to efficiently exploit the base path. To efficiently exploit the base path and thereby its admissible heuristic, we develop section patterns, which are solution strategies to efficiently exploit base paths in particular around narrow passages. To coordinate section patterns, we develop the pattern dance algorithm, which efficiently coordinates section patterns to reactively traverse narrow passages. We combine the pattern dance algorithm with previously developed multilevel planning algorithms and benchmark them on challenging planning problems like the Bugtrap, the double L-shape, an egress problem, and on four pregrasp scenarios for a 37 degrees-of-freedom shadow hand mounted on a KUKA LWR robot. Our results confirm that section patterns are useful to efficiently solve high-dimensional narrow passage motion planning problems.},

The first main novelty is a tightly integrated visual-inertial SLAM system that fully relies on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, even during IMU initialization, resulting in real-time robust operation in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, being two to ten times more accurate than previous approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system relying on a new place recognition method with improved recall that lets ORB-SLAM3 survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting them. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information from high parallax co-visible keyframes, even if they are widely separated in time or come from previous mapping sessions, boosting accuracy. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 3.5 cm in the EuRoC drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of TUM-VI dataset, representative of AR/VR scenarios.

  abstract     = {This article surveys the literature on human–robot object handovers. A handover is a collaborative joint action, where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical exchange starts when the receiver first contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: a prehandover phase and the physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (human-to-robot handovers). We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception, motion planning, and learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, and grip release) of the handover, we also discuss safety. We compare the behaviors displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable to human interactions. Finally, we propose a minimal set of metrics that should be used in order to enable a fair comparison among the approaches.},

The two techniques include a batch design and a sequential design technique that seek to maximize the expected Shannon information gain of the parameter distribution using either an online or offline approach (respectively). We apply and compare the techniques in both simulation and real-world experiments with a wheeled vehicle. In our simulation experiments, both of our proposed designs provide superior Shannon information gains relative to an unoptimized benchmark technique.

The resulting approach, named PHD-SLAM, has demonstrated its effectiveness, especially when measurements provided by the sensors onboard the vehicle are highly contaminated by missdetections and clutter. However, since the proposal distribution (PD) of standard PHD-SLAM does not take into account most recently received measurements, a huge amount of particles are typically needed in order to achieve satisfactory performance. In this article, a new PD, which aims to approximate the vehicle pose posterior, is proposed for PHD-SLAM. The resulting algorithm, named PHD-SLAM 2.0, allows for drastically reducing the number of particles, and hence, the computational burden, while preserving the SLAM performance. The computational complexity of PHD-SLAM 2.0 is analyzed, and its performance is assessed via both simulated and real-data experiments.},

  abstract     = {Force sensing is highly desirable in minimally invasive medical applications, since this feature shows great potential for reducing tissue damage and enhancing manipulation safety. However, embedding force sensors in medical devices is challenging and costly. This article explores the possibility to use shape sensing as a measure to extract force information. In this work, a model-based approach that allows simultaneous shape and force sensing is proposed. Shape information is reconstructed employing a multicore fiber with fiber Bragg grating sensors spaced over the fiber length. This fiber is capable of distributed 3D shape sensing. It is shown how by making use of extended Kalman filter and a mechanics model of the flexible instrument, it becomes possible to estimate both the magnitudes and locations of externally applied forces. Experiments were carried out to validate the proposed method for both one and two external forces applied at arbitrary locations in different directions on a flexible instrument. Results show that one-directional force magnitude and location can be estimated with an average error of 23.08 mN (15.39\%) and 11.06 mm (6.51\%), respectively. For two-directional forces, results of the load near the base show an average error of 52.01 mN (30.59\%) for the magnitude and 29.24 mm (17.20\%) for the location. For the load applied simultaneously near the tip, the mean magnitude error is 16.79 mN (11.19\%) and the average location error is 10.18 mm (5.99\%). The force sensing algorithm can run in real time with an approximate frequency of 59 Hz. In these experiments, it can be observed that the force-sensing accuracy, which depends on the sensitivity of the shape of flexible instruments with respect to the external force, can vary drastically in function of the force application point and force direction.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an active ball joint mechanism (ABENICS) enhanced by interactions of spherical gears. The gear-based joint drives three rotational degrees of freedom (RDoF) without slippage. The capabilities were inspired by the unique interactions between two different innovative gears [the cross spherical gear (CS-gear) and monopole gear (MP-gear)] and the superimposition of those interactions by the CS-gear&#39;s quadrature spherical tooth structure. One MP-gear constrains two of the three RDoF of the CS-gear. The driving module which drives the MP-gear converts this “constraint” into a “drive” and drives the CS-gear with two RDoF. The CS-gear orthogonally superimposes the interactions caused by two MP-gears to achieve three RDoF driving forces. The principle was revealed by analyzing an equivalent linkage modeled on the mechanism of ABENICS. The linkage also led to the kinematics and torque equations. The theory and physical characteristics of ABENICS were verified in comprehensive and continuous positioning experiments on manufactured prototypes. The flexibility of the actuator placement was also verified in different configurations of the driving modules. The active ball joint, ABENICS can transmit high torque and reliable positioning in three RDoF without an orientation sensor, which applies to robot joints and orientation control mechanisms.},

RST builds the trajectory recursively as a smooth polynomial path, thus a closed form trajectory satisfying any arbitrary dynamic limitation that translates into kinematic constraints (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration, etc.). Uncertainties and perturbations in the constraints are also discussed, modeled, and finally included in the calculation of the polynomial trajectory coefficients. Moreover, due to its recursive formulation, RST enables an immediate extension toward the solution of a trajectory optimization problem. In particular, it is shown that the minimum-snap piecewise polynomial trajectory can be interpreted as a special case of RST. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated numerically via two illustrative scenarios. Its application to a UAV structure is also discussed to highlight the advantage of a smooth path over a piecewise one. Finally, the computational complexity and memory requirements are analyzed.},

Therefore, the robot programs need to be verified for each individual product. A crucial aspect is to avoid collisions between robots by velocity tuning: This involves an efficient analysis of pairs of robot paths and determining if swept volumes of (sub) paths are disjoint. In general, velocity uncertain motions require disjoint sweep volumes to be safe. We optimize a clearance lower bounding function to provide new sample points for clearance computations. Due to the computational cost of each distance query, our sampling strategy aims to maximize the information gained at each query. The algorithm terminates when robot paths are verified to be disjoint or a collision is detected. Our approach for disjoint paths is inspired by the technique for continuous collision detection known as conservative advancement . Our tests indicate that the proposed sampling method is reliable and computationally much faster than creating and intersecting octrees representing the swept volumes.},

The proposed geometric method reveals the relationship between the position of the center of mass (CoM) and the rotor placement of a multirotor UAV with upward-oriented rotors to satisfy hoverability. It can be applied to a multirotor UAV with any number and positioning of rotors. This article also demonstrates that our proposed method can be applied to the investigation of a robust structure against rotor failures. This investigation provides a geometric proof that a pentarotor UAV with robustness against an arbitrary rotor failure cannot be developed. Furthermore, a quantitative measure of hoverability is newly presented based on the analysis method. This enables us to design a multirotor UAV with an optimal structure by maximizing it.

As they fly through cluttered natural environments, they can demonstrate aggressive acrobatic maneuvers such as backflip, rapid escape, and in-flight collision recovery. Current state-of-the-art subgram microaerial-vehicles (MAVs) are predominately powered by rigid actuators such as piezoelectric ceramics, but they have low fracture strength (120 MPa) and failure strain (0.3\%). Although these existing systems can achieve a high lift-to-weight ratio, they have not demonstrated insect-like maneuvers such as somersault or rapid collision recovery. In this article, we present a 665 mg aerial robot that is powered by novel dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA). The new DEA achieves high power density (1.2 kW/kg) and relatively high transduction efficiency (37\%). We further incorporate this soft actuator into an aerial robot to demonstrate novel flight capabilities. This insect-scale aerial robot has a large lift-to-weight ratio (&gt;2.2:1) and it achieves an ascending speed of 70 cm/s. In addition to demonstrating controlled hovering flight, it can recover from an in-flight collision and perform a somersault within 0.16 s. This work demonstrates that soft aerial robots can achieve insect-like flight capabilities absent in rigid-powered MAVs, thus showing the potential of a new class of hybrid soft-rigid robots.},

  abstract     = {Insects and hummingbirds are capable of acrobatic maneuvers such as rapid turns and tight 360 $^\circ$ body flips. It is challenging for bio-inspired flapping wing micro aerial vehicles to achieve animal-like performance during such maneuvers due to their limitation in mechanism sophistication and flight control. Besides being significantly underactuated compared to their natural counterparts, flight dynamics is highly nonlinear with rapidly changing, unsteady aerodynamics which remains largely unknown during aggressive maneuvers. As a result, conventional model-based control methods are inadequate to address such maneuvers effectively due to the lack of control references and aerodynamic models. In addition, during acrobatic maneuvers such as body flips, conventional control methods with underlying stabilization mechanisms would temporarily contradict the maneuvering requirements when the vehicle undergoes a full body flip including turning upside-down. In this article, reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to complement model-based control to enable animal-like maneuverability. The learned control policy serves in two different ways to either aid or even completely takeover the conventional stabilization controller in certain cases. We experimentally demonstrate animal-like maneuverability on an at-scale, dual-motor actuated flapping wing hummingbird robot. Two test cases have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of such integrated control methods: 1) a rapid escape maneuver recorded from hummingbirds, 2) a tight 360 $^\circ$ body flip inspired by houseflies. By leveraging RL, the hummingbird robot demonstrated a shorter completion time in escape maneuvers compared to the traditional control-based method. It also performed 360 $^\circ$ body flip successfully within only one wingspan vertical displacement.},

  abstract     = {State estimation is one of the key requirements in robot control, which has been achieved by kinematic and dynamic models combined with motion sensors in traditional robotics. However, it is challenging to acquire accurate proprioceptive information in soft robots due to relatively high noise levels and hysteretic responses of soft actuators and sensors. In this article, we propose a method of estimating real-time states of soft robots by filtering noisy output signals and including hysteresis in the models using a Bayesian network. This approach is useful in constructing a state observer for soft robot control when both the kinematic model of the actuator and the model of the sensor are used. In our method, we regard a hysteresis function as a conditional random process model. We then introduce a dynamic Bayesian network composed of the actuator and the sensor models of the target system using distribution hysteresis mapping. Finally, we show that solving a Bayesian filtering problem is equivalent to suboptimal state estimation of the soft system. This article describes two ways for defining modeling and filtering; one is by Gaussian process regression combined with an extended Kalman filter, and the other is based on variational inference with a particle filter. While the first approach relaxes the uncertainty level in modeling to Gaussian, the second approach illustrates a general probability distribution. We experimentally validate the proposed methods through real-time state estimation of a sensor-integrated soft robotic gripper. The result shows significant improvement in state estimation compared to conventional estimation methods.},

We detail the overall structure and parameters of TenFiBot, which can achieve body stiffness distribution with high stiffness controllability over a wide range. The effective variable stiffness principle is based on antagonistic stiffness that results from the prestress of tension structures in a kinematically singular configuration. We validate the effectiveness of variable stiffness for one variable-stiffness tensegrity joint (VSTJ) and demonstrate that the virtual rotational centers are always in the acceptable range during stiffness variation. We exemplify some cases of the stiffness distribution to verify the validity of body stiffness variation. The experimental results show that swimming performance, such as swimming velocity, varied dramatically when the stiffness distribution was varied for the robotic fish. The swimming performance of the robotic fish can be enhanced tremendously by changing the stiffness distribution.

We first find that the motion at the connection point between two motions must coincide with the tangential movement during motion transition across different environments. We then design a gait called the circular pedal wave. This circular pedal wave allows a hoop-passing motion in which the whole body moves as if it is passing through a virtual hoop fixed in space in sequence from its head through combination with a proposed shift part. The hoop-passing motion allows motion transition across different environments. We propose three application examples of this hoop-passing motion, namely passing through a hole in a wall, entering an underfloor, and attaching to a ladder. We report on experiments conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and to realize the described motions.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of efficient computation of physically consistent multicontact behaviors. Recent work showed that under mild assumptions, the problem could be decomposed into simpler kinematic and centroidal dynamic optimization problems. Based on this approach, we propose a general convex relaxation of the centroidal dynamics leading to two computationally efficient algorithms based on iterative resolutions of second-order cone programs. They optimize centroidal trajectories, contact forces, and importantly the timing of the motions. We include the approach in a kinodynamic optimization method to generate full-body movements. Finally, the approach is embedded in a mixed-integer solver to further find dynamically consistent contact sequences. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency of the approach, suggesting that it could be used in a fast receding horizon control loop. Executions of the planned motions on simulated humanoids and quadrupeds and on a real quadruped robot further show the quality of the optimized motions.},

  abstract     = {Shooting methods are an efficient approach to solving nonlinear optimal control problems. As they use local optimization, they exhibit favorable convergence when initialized with a good warm-start but may not converge at all if provided with a poor initial guess. Recent work has focused on providing an initial guess from a learned model trained on samples generated during an offline exploration of the problem space. However, in practice, the solutions contain discontinuities introduced by system dynamics or the environment. Additionally, in many cases, multiple equally suitable, i.e., multimodal, solutions exist to solve a problem. Classic learning approaches smooth across the boundary of these discontinuities and thus generalize poorly. In this work, we apply tools from algebraic topology to extract information on the underlying structure of the solution space. In particular, we introduce a method based on persistent homology to automatically cluster the dataset of precomputed solutions to obtain different candidate initial guesses. We then train a mixture-of-experts within each cluster to predict state and control trajectories to warm-start the optimal control solver and provide a comparison with modality-agnostic learning. We demonstrate our method on a cartpole toy problem and a quadrotor avoiding obstacles, and show that clustering samples based on inherent structure improves the warm-start quality.},

In our previous article, we theoretically analyzed finite-time Lyapunov stability for a minimal model of planar rigid body with two frictional point contacts. Assuming inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction, conditions for stability and instability of an equilibrium configuration have been derived. In this article, we present for the first time an experimental demonstration of this stability theory, using a variable-structure rigid “biped” with frictional footpads on an inclined plane. By changing the biped&#39;s center-of-mass location, we attain different equilibrium states, which respond to small perturbations by divergence or convergence, showing remarkable agreement with the predictions of the stability theory. Using high-speed recording of video movies, good quantitative agreement between experiments and numerical simulations is obtained, and limitations of the rigid-body model and inelastic impact assumptions are also studied. The results prove the utility and practical value of our stability theory.},

The calibration is solved with a nonlinear least squares method, and the reprojection error is used as a metric to guide the optimization procedure. Our approach is seamlessly integrated with the robot operating system framework and allows for the interactive positioning of sensors and labeling of data, facilitating both the data acquisition and labeling and the calibration procedures.

  abstract     = {Recently, various soft universal grippers have been developed due to their reduced control complexity and satisfying grasping capability. The gripping range of a gripper plays a key role in its universality. This article presents a pneumatically actuated soft-rigid hybrid multifinger gripper that has a wide gripping range by adjusting its initial grasp postures. The gripper is compact (dimensions: $\text{100} \times \text{60} \times \text{170}$ mm), lightweight (weight: 380 g), and modular. It consists of four modules, with each module containing three pneumatic actuators (a distance-adjusting actuator, an angle-adjusting actuator, and a finger actuator) and rigid connectors. Through initial grasp posture adjustment, and fingers with tapered angles to generate nonconstant bending while grasping, the gripper can grasp objects of a wide variety of sizes and weights, thus increasing its universality. The gripper is tested to characterize its distance adjustment range, angle adjustment range, and stiffnesses in load-bearing directions, at continuously changing pneumatic pressures. The distance adjustment range and angle adjustment range of the gripper are 0–64.4 mm (64.4\% of the initial gripper length) and 0 $^{\circ}$ –140 $^{\circ}$ , respectively. The maximum stiffnesses of distance-adjusting actuator and angle-adjusting actuator are 3331 and 1.15 N $\cdot$ m/rad, respectively. Finally, grasping experiments show that our gripper can successfully grasp objects with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 180 mm, lengths ranging from 10 to 325 mm, and the heaviest object it can grasp is 2.1 kg (more than five folds of its own weight). The results demonstrated that our pneumatic gripper has an increased gripping range without adding other types of energy sources and its enhanced universality will expedite various applications in daily life and industry.},

This design linearizes the gripper&#39;s deformation-force relationship and enables an intrinsic force sensing ability without any tactile sensor. Experimental results show that the finger has high accuracy in sensing the external force applied at its middle part (average error less than 3\%) but much larger errors appear near its two ends. Further experiments indicate that the gripper functions well in sensing the total grasping force (average error less than 8\%). Although larger errors are observed in estimating the force distribution at each node, the variation tendency of the sensed force coincides well with the ground truth. Experiments are also carried out on grasping free-form objects and performing pick-and-place operations to further prove the gripper&#39;s adaptive grasping and intrinsic force sensing abilities.},

EIT-NN learns a computationally efficient, nonlinear reconstruction attribute, achieving high-resolution tactile sensation and well-generalized reconstruction capability to address arbitrary complex touch modalities. We train EIT-NN by presenting a sim-to-real dataset synthesis strategy for computationally efficient generalizability. Furthermore, we propose a spatial sensitivity aware mean-squared error loss function, which uses an intrinsic spatial sensitivity of the sensor to guarantee a well-posed EIT operation. We validate an outperformance of EIT-NN against conventional EIT sensing methods by conducting a simulation study, a single-touch indentation test, and a two-point discrimination test. The results show improved spatial resolution, sensitivity, and localization accuracy. The beneficial features of the generalized sensing of EIT-NN were demonstrated by examining touch modality discrimination performance.},

This method inherently introduces practical shortcomings, as interpretability and transferability of the learned model typically decreases as more features are introduced into the learning framework in order to handle increasing task complexity. In this article, we examine the problem of developing transferable learned models for dexterous manipulation that are able to accurately predict the behavior of physically distinct systems without retraining. We introduce the notion of learning from visually-extracted grasp mechanics-based features, which are formulated by combining geometrically-inspired, analytical representations of the gripper into the feature set to more holistically represent the state of varied systems performing manipulation. We characterize the added utility of using such features through simulation and incorporate them into a classifier to predict specific phenomena, or modes of manipulation, that occur during prehensile within-hand movement. Four modes of manipulation—normal (rolling contact), drop, stuck, and sliding—are defined, collected physically, and trained via a self-supervised learning approach. The classifier is first trained on a single sensorless underactuated hand variant for all four modes. We, then, investigate the transferability of the learned classifier on five different planar gripper variants—analyzing applicability of this approach with both online and offline evaluation.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a task and motion planning method for retrieving a target object from clutter using a robotic manipulator. We consider dense and cluttered environments where some objects must be removed in order to retrieve the target without collisions. To ensure a successful execution, the interplay between task planning ( what to remove in what order ) and motion planning ( how to remove ) is crucial. Thus, the task and motion planning approach combining a symbolic task planner and a geometric motion planner becomes one of the major paradigms in manipulation planning. However, motion planning in dense clutter often leads to frequent failures, so repetitive task replanning is inevitable. Although symbolic task planners are general and domain-independent, they do not scale; so we need an efficient task planner specialized for dense clutter for fast completion of tasks. We propose a polynomial-time task planner for object manipulation in clutter that can be combined with any motion planner. We aim to optimize the number of pick-and-place actions which often determines the efficiency of object manipulation tasks. We consider common situations that could occur in clutter: 1) all object locations are known, 2) some hidden objects are revealed while relocating some front objects, and 3) the target is hidden until some objects are removed. Our method is shown to reduce the number of pick-and-place actions compared to baseline methods (e.g., at least 28.0\% of reduction in a known static environment with 20 objects). We also deploy the proposed method to two physical robots with vision systems to show that our method can solve real-world problems.},

We establish bounds for estimation performance and show that this hybrid method produces unbiased conservative estimates that are better than covariance intersection. The performance of the hybrid method is evaluated extensively, including comparisons with competing algorithms, with a hypothetical “full history” yardstick, and centralized performance.

The proposed method can handle data fusion problems whose uncertainty has both independent and dependent parts. Different from the existing methods, the uncertainties of the various states or measurements are modeled on the Lie algebra and projected to the manifold through the exponential map, which is more precise than that modeled in the vector space. The correlation is based on the theory of covariance intersection, where the independent and dependent parts are split to yield a more consistent result. In this article, we provide a novel method for the correlated pose fusion algorithm on the manifold. Theoretical derivation and analysis are detailed first, and then, the experimental results are presented to support the proposed theory. The main contributions are threefold: First, we provide a theoretical foundation for the split covariance intersection filter performed on the manifold, where the uncertainty is associated with the Lie algebra. Second, the proposed method gives an explicit fusion formalism on $ \text{SE}(3)$ and $ \text{SE}(2)$ , which covers the most use cases in the field of robotics. Third, we present a localization framework that can work for both single-robot and multirobot systems, where not only the fusion with possible correlation is derived on the manifold but also the state evolution and relative pose computation are performed on the manifold.

However, constructing expressive discrete abstractions makes the synthesis problem computationally intractable. In this article, we propose a new sampling-based LTL planning algorithm that does not require any discrete abstraction of robot mobility. Instead, it incrementally builds trees that explore the product state-space, until a maximum number of iterations is reached or a feasible plan is found. The use of trees makes data storage and graph search tractable, which significantly increases the scalability of our algorithm. To accelerate the construction of feasible plans, we introduce bias in the sampling process, which is guided by transitions in the Büchi automaton that belong to the shortest path to the accepting states. We show that our planning algorithm, with and without bias, is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. Finally, we present numerical experiments showing that our method outperforms relevant temporal logic planning methods.},

  abstract     = {Multirobot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) requires technical ingredients such as systematic construction of multiple SLAM systems and collection of information from each robot. In particular, map fusion is an essential process of multirobot SLAM that combines multiple local maps estimated by team robots into a global map. Fusion of multiple local maps is usually based on interloop detection that recognizes the same scene visited by multiple robots, or robot rendezvous where a member(s) of a robot team is observed in another member&#39;s images. This article proposes a collaborative monocular SLAM including a map fusion algorithm that utilizes rendezvous, which can happen when multirobot team members operate in close proximity. Unlike existing rendezvous-based approaches that require additional sensors, the proposed system uses a monocular camera only. Our system can recognize robot rendezvous using nonstatic features (NSFs) without fiducial markers to identify team robots. NSFs, which are abandoned as outliers in typical SLAM systems for not supporting ego-motion, can include relative bearing measurements between robots in a rendezvous situation. The proposed pipeline consists of the following: first, a feature identification module that extracts the relative bearing measurements between robots from NSFs consisting of anonymous bearing vectors with false positives, and second, a map fusion module that integrates the map from the observer robot with the maps from the observed robots using identified relative measurements. The feature identification module can operate quickly using the proposed alternating minimization algorithm formulated by two subproblems with closed-form solutions.

  abstract     = {Sensor array-based systems, which adopt time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements among the sensors, have found many robotic applications. However, for existing frameworks and systems to be useful, the sensor array needs to be calibrated accurately. Of particular interest in this article are microphone array-based robot audition systems. In our recent work, by using a moving sound source, and the graph-based formulation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), we have proposed a framework for joint sound source localization and calibration of microphone array geometrical information, together with the estimation of microphone time offset and clock difference/drift rates. However, a thorough study on the identifiability question, termed observability analysis here, in the SLAM framework for microphone array calibration and sound source localization, is still lacking in the literature. In this article, we will fill the abovementioned gap via a Fisher information matrix approach. Motivated by the equivalence between the full column rankness of the Fisher information matrix and the Jacobian matrix, we leverage the structure of the latter associated with the SLAM formulation, and present necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing its full column rankness, which lead to parameter identifiability. We have thoroughly discussed the 3-D case with asynchronous (with both time offset and clock drifts, or with only one of them) and synchronous microphone array, respectively. These conditions are closely related to the motion varieties of the sound source and the microphone array configuration, and have intuitive and physical interpretations. Based on the established conditions, we have also discovered some particular cases where observability is impossible. Connections with calibration of other sensors will also be discussed, amongst others. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic work on observability analysis of SLAM-based microphone array calibration and sound source localization. The tools and concepts used in this article are also applicable to other TDOA sensing modalities such as ultrawide band (UWB) sensors.},

  abstract     = {Event-based cameras are bioinspired vision sensors whose pixels work independently from each other and respond asynchronously to brightness changes, with microsecond resolution. Their advantages make it possible to tackle challenging scenarios in robotics, such as high-speed and high dynamic range scenes. We present a solution to the problem of visual odometry from the data acquired by a stereo event-based camera rig. Our system follows a parallel tracking-and-mapping approach, where novel solutions to each subproblem (three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction and camera pose estimation) are developed with two objectives in mind: being principled and efficient, for real-time operation with commodity hardware. To this end, we seek to maximize the spatio-temporal consistency of stereo event-based data while using a simple and efficient representation. Specifically, the mapping module builds a semidense 3-D map of the scene by fusing depth estimates from multiple viewpoints (obtained by spatio-temporal consistency) in a probabilistic fashion. The tracking module recovers the pose of the stereo rig by solving a registration problem that naturally arises due to the chosen map and event data representation. Experiments on publicly available datasets and on our own recordings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method in natural scenes with general 6-DoF motion. The system successfully leverages the advantages of event-based cameras to perform visual odometry in challenging illumination conditions, such as low-light and high dynamic range, while running in real-time on a standard CPU. We release the software and dataset under an open source license to foster research in the emerging topic of event-based simultaneous localization and mapping.},

To address these problems, we leverage a line flow to encode the coherence of line segment observations of the same 3-D line along the temporal dimension, which has been neglected in prior SLAM systems. Thanks to this line flow representation, line segments in a new frame can be predicted according to their corresponding 3-D lines and their predecessors along the temporal dimension. We create, update, merge, and discard line flows on-the-fly. We model the proposed line flow based SLAM (LF-SLAM) using a Bayesian network. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LF-SLAM method achieves state-of-the-art results due to the utilization of line flows. Specifically, LF-SLAM obtains good localization and mapping results in challenging scenes with occlusions, blurred images, and repetitive textures.},

The method estimates time delays with the accuracy up to a fraction of the fastest sensor sampling time, outperforming a state-of-the-art ego-motion method.

In this context, the number of variables might be high, albeit the number of cycles in the graph (loop closures) is relatively low. For sparse problems particularly, the cycle space has a significantly smaller dimension than the number of vertices. By exploiting this observation, in this article, we propose an alternative solution to PGO that directly exploits the cycle space. We characterize the topology of the graph as a cycle matrix, and reparameterize the problem using relative poses, which are further constrained by a cycle basis of the graph. We show that by using a minimum cycle basis, the cycle-based approach has superior convergence properties against its vertex-based counterpart, in terms of convergence speed and convergence to the global minimum. For sparse graphs, our cycle-based approach is also more time efficient than the vertex-based. As an additional contribution of this work, we present an effective algorithm to compute the minimum cycle basis. Albeit known in computer science, we believe that this algorithm is not familiar to the robotics community. All the claims are validated by experiments on both standard benchmarks and simulated datasets.

To this end, rather than the standard VINS paradigm using a minimal sensing suite of a single camera and IMU, in this article, we design a real-time consistent multi-IMU multi-camera (MIMC) VINS estimator that is able to seamlessly fuse multimodal information from an arbitrary number of uncalibrated cameras and IMUs. Within an efficient multi-state constraint Kalman filter framework, the proposed MIMC-VINS algorithm optimally fuses asynchronous measurements from all sensors while providing smooth, uninterrupted, and accurate 3-D motion tracking even if some sensors fail. The key idea of the proposed MIMC-VINS is to perform high-order on-manifold state interpolation to efficiently process all available visual measurements without increasing the computational burden due to estimating additional sensors’ poses at asynchronous imaging times. In order to fuse the information from multiple IMUs, we propagate a joint system consisting of all IMU states while enforcing rigid-body constraints between the IMUs during the filter update stage. Finally, we estimate online both spatiotemporal extrinsic and visual intrinsic parameters to make our system robust to errors in prior sensor calibration. The proposed system is extensively validated in both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experiments.},

We take a step in this direction by tackling the problem of segmenting unseen object instances in tabletop environments. However, the type of large-scale real-world dataset required for this task typically does not exist for most robotic settings, which motivates the use of synthetic data. Our proposed method, unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS)-Net, separately leverages synthetic RGB and synthetic depth for unseen object instance segmentation. UOIS-Net is composed of two stages: first, it operates only on depth to produce object instance center votes in 2D or 3D and assembles them into rough initial masks. Second, these initial masks are refined using RGB. Surprisingly, our framework is able to learn from synthetic RGB-D data where the RGB is nonphotorealistic. To train our method, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of random objects on tabletops. We show that our method can produce sharp and accurate segmentation masks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on unseen object instance segmentation.

This factorization allows our approach, called PoseRBPF, to efficiently estimate the 3-D translation of an object along with the full distribution over the 3-D rotation. This is achieved by discretizing the rotation space in a fine-grained manner and training an autoencoder network to construct a codebook of feature embeddings for the discretized rotations. As a result, PoseRBPF can track objects with arbitrary symmetries while still maintaining adequate posterior distributions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two 6-D pose estimation benchmarks. We open-source our implementation at https://github.com/NVlabs/PoseRBPF .},

The online planner is specifically formulated for a multiple-car autonomous racing game, in which each car tries to advance along a given track as far as possible with respect to the other cars. The algorithm extends previous work on game-theoretic planning for single-integrator agents to be suitable for autonomous cars in the following ways: 1) by representing the trajectory as a piecewise polynomial; 2) incorporating bicycle kinematics into the trajectory; and 3) enforcing constraints on path curvature and acceleration. The game-theoretic planner iteratively plans a trajectory for the ego vehicle and then the other vehicles in sequence until convergence. Crucially, the trajectory optimization includes a sensitivity term that allows the ego vehicle to reason about how much the other vehicles will yield to the ego vehicle to avoid collisions. The resulting trajectories for the ego vehicle exhibit rich game strategies such as blocking, faking, and opportunistic overtaking. The game-theoretic planner is shown to significantly outperform a baseline planner using model-predictive control, which does not take interaction into account. The performance is validated in high-fidelity numerical simulations with three cars, in experiments with two small-scale autonomous cars, and in experiments with a full-scale autonomous car racing against a simulated vehicle (video is available at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmIcLEh8KMje4rYBqRANDuKvqFvj7LCRp).},

In this article, we developed a novel man-machine interface that endows a myoelectric prosthesis (MYO) with artificial perception, estimation of user intention, and intelligent control (MYO-PACE) to continuously support the user with automation while preparing the prosthesis for grasping. We compared the MYO-PACE against state-of-the-art myoelectric control (pattern recognition) in laboratory and clinical tests. For this purpose, eight able-bodied and two amputee individuals performed a standard clinical test consisting of a series of manipulation tasks (portion of the SHAP test), as well as a more complex sequence of transfer tasks in a cluttered scene. In all tests, the subjects not only completed the trials faster using the MYO-PACE but also achieved more efficient myoelectric control. These results demonstrate that the implementation of advanced perception, context interpretation, and autonomous decision-making into active prostheses improves control dexterity. Moreover, it also effectively supports the user by speeding up the preshaping phase of the movement and decreasing muscle use.},

However, the literature is missing a study on benefits and drawbacks of different types of stiffness command interfaces used in bilateral tele-impedance. In this article, we introduce a term called coupling effect, which pertains to the coupling between human-commanded stiffness going to the remote robot and force feedback coming from the remote robot. We hypothesize that, whenever the operator&#39;s commanded stiffness and force feedback are subject to coupling effect (e.g., muscle activity based stiffness command interfaces), force feedback can invoke involuntary changes in the commanded stiffness due to human reflexes. Although the coupling effect takes away some degree of the operator&#39;s control over the commanded stiffness, these involuntary changes can be either beneficial (e.g., during position tracking) or detrimental (e.g., during force tracking) to the task performance on the remote robot side. We examined the coupling effect in an experimental study with 16 participants, who performed position and force tracking tasks by using both coupled type (muscle activity based) and decoupled type (external device based) of interface. The results demonstrate a benefit of the coupling effect when the remote robot is operating in presence of unexpected force perturbations, where lower absolute error in position tracking task was observed. On the other hand, the decoupled type of interface is beneficial for force tracking tasks on the remote robot side, such as establishing or maintaining a stable contact with objects. However, the coupling effect negatively influences the commanding of reference stiffness to the remote robot in both position and force tracking tasks for the coupled type of interface, compared to the decoupled type of interface, which is not affected.},

These methods are naturally immune to bad weather, poor lighting conditions, or other extreme environmental conditions that may hinder exteroceptive sensors such as a camera or a laser ranger finder. These methods depend on proprioceptive sensors such as inertial measurement units and/or wheel encoders. Assisted by magnetoreception, the sensors can provide a rudimentary estimation of vehicle trajectory which is used to query a prior known map to obtain location. Named as graph-based proprioceptive localization, we provide a low cost fallback solution for localization under challenging environmental conditions. As a robot/vehicle travels, we extract a sequence of heading-length values for straight segments from the trajectory and match the sequence with a preprocessed heading-length graph (HLG) abstracted from the prior known map to localize the robot under a graph-matching approach. Using the information from HLG, our location alignment and verification module compensates for trajectory drift, wheel slip, or tire inflation level. We have implemented our algorithm and tested it in both simulated and physical experiments.

  abstract     = {This article presents a unified mathematical approach for modeling, identifying, and solving the friction-inclusive dynamics of robotic mechanisms driven by sliding contact transmission systems. This approach is applied to the most common industrial screw-based drives: 1) the worm drive, 2) the simple lead screw drive, and 3) the antibacklash lead screw drive. The resulting dynamics, handily transferable to single and multiple degree of freedom (DoF) manipulators, are complemented with an algorithm for the solution of the forward dynamics problem as well as a framework for friction identification based on nonlinear optimization. The presented theory is experimentally tested on single-DoF screw-based drives for a variety of payloads and at different operation speeds. Simulation and parameter identification results using the classical Coulomb model, the Coulomb model with Stribeck friction, and the Armstrong model with Stribeck friction, rising static friction, and frictional memory are compared with experimental data, showcasing the effectiveness of the presented approach toward framing the concepts of friction and motion transmission into a robotics setting.},

Motivation dynamics uses a continuous dynamical system to reactively compose low-level control vector fields using valuation functions that capture the potentially competing influences of external stimuli relative to the system&#39;s own internal state. We show that motivation dynamics naturally accommodates external stimuli through standard signal processing tools, and can effectively encode a repetitive higher level task by composing several low-level controllers to achieve a limit cycle in which the robot repeatedly navigates toward two alternatively valuable goal locations in a commensurately alternating order. We show that these behaviors are robust to perturbations, including imperfect models of robot kinematics, sensor noise, and disturbances, resulting from the need to traverse difficult terrain. We argue that motivation dynamics can provide a useful alternative to controllers based on hybrid automata in situations where the control operates at a low level close to the physical hardware.},

The kinematic model is developed based on the constraint conditions of the robot. It is shown that the type II (parallel) singularities can be completely avoided, thereby yielding a very large translational and orientational workspace. A workspace analysis is presented in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the robot. Mechanisms are then introduced to use the redundant DOF of the robot to operate a gripper with the robot actuators, which are mounted on or close to the base, thus reducing the inertia of the moving parts. The architecture of the robot makes it possible to use direct drive motors, thereby making the robot easily backdrivable and allowing the use of a very simple and effective controller. A prototype of the robot is then designed and built and the large workspace of the robot as well as the effortless physical human–robot interaction are demonstrated. The controller of the robot is then described, including a position control mode and a control mode for physical interaction, which does not require the use of a force/torque sensor or joint torque sensors. Because of its backdrivability and low moving inertia, the robot is particularly well-suited for physical human–robot interaction, as demonstrated in the accompanying videos.},

  abstract     = {In robot navigation tasks, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) highway traffic monitoring, it is important for a mobile robot to follow a specified desired path. However, most of the existing path-following navigation algorithms cannot guarantee global convergence to desired paths or enable following self-intersected desired paths due to the existence of singular points where navigation algorithms return unreliable or even no solutions. One typical example arises in vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) navigation algorithms . These algorithms are based on a vector field, and the singular points are exactly where the vector field diminishes. Conventional VF-PF algorithms generate a vector field of the same dimensions as those of the space where the desired path lives. In this article, we show that it is mathematically impossible for conventional VF-PF algorithms to achieve global convergence to desired paths that are self-intersected or even just simple closed (precisely, homeomorphic to the unit circle). Motivated by this new impossibility result, we propose a novel method to transform self-intersected or simple closed desired paths to nonself-intersected and unbounded (precisely, homeomorphic to the real line) counterparts in a higher dimensional space. Corresponding to this new desired path, we construct a singularity-free guiding vector field on a higher dimensional space. The integral curves of this new guiding vector field is thus exploited to enable global convergence to the higher dimensional desired path, and therefore the projection of the integral curves on a lower dimensional subspace converge to the physical (lower dimensional) desired path. Rigorous theoretical analysis is carried out for the theoretical results using dynamical systems theory. In addition, we show both by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations that our proposed method is an extension combining conventional VF-PF algorithms and trajectory tracking algorithms. Finally, to show the practical value of our proposed approach for complex engineering systems, we conduct outdoor experiments with a fixed-wing airplane in windy environment to follow both 2-D and 3-D desired paths.},

  abstract     = {The maximum cable tension is a crucial parameter in the design of a cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) since the various mechanical components of the CDPR must be designed to safely withstand the loads induced by this maximum tension. For CDPRs having a number of cables at least equal to its number of degree of freedoms (DOFs), this article deals with the determination of the smallest maximum cable tension vectors allowing a required wrench set to be feasible. The problem is formulated as the minimization of the maximum cable tension infinity norm under linear inequality constraints, which include the wrench-feasibility constraints. The solution to this minimization problem is not unique, and the solution set is shown to be a convex polytope in the maximum tension space. Hence, various smallest maximum tension vectors generally exist and the computations of two different solution vectors are introduced. The first vector has all its components equal to the minimum infinity norm, which can be directly obtained from the minimization problem inequality constraints. An algorithm is proposed to determine the second vector as the solution vector having the least possible value for each of its components. The computation of the smallest maximum tension vectors for general required wrench sets are then presented. The cases of particular wrench set definitions relevant to heavy payload manipulation applications are also introduced. Finally, these contributions are applied to the configuration (geometry) optimization of a large-dimension 6-DOF CDPR installed on a building facade to manipulate heavy payloads.},

In this article, the problem of multicoordinates calibration for a dual-robot system is formulated to a matrix equation AXB = YCZ. A novel approach for simultaneously solving the unknowns in equation AXB = YCZ is proposed, which is composed of a closed form method based on the Kronecker product and an iterative method which converts the calculation of a nonlinear problem to an optimization problem of a strictly convex function. The closed form method is used to quickly obtain an initial estimation for the iterative method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of iteration. In addition, a series of conditions on the solvability of the problem are proposed to guide the operators to select appropriate robot attitudes during the calibration process. To show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed iterative method, two other calibration methods are chosen to be compared to the proposed method through simulation and practical experiments. The comparison results verify the superiority of the proposed method in accuracy, efficiency, and stability.},

Most robots attempting the same tasks either lack a tail or employ one with high inertia, which can induce impractical payload and energy costs. Inspired by nature&#39;s solution to this tradeoff, we explore the use of aerodynamic drag tails in reorientation tasks. In this article, we present a model of the aerodynamic drag and from this derive a metric that allows for direct comparison between aerodynamic and inertial tails. Motivated by this model, we construct a tail to maximize this effectiveness while minimizing inertia. We demonstrate the utility of this tail for two dynamic behaviors executed on a quadrupedal robot. First, in aerial reorientation the robot achieves a 90 ° rotation within one body length of fall at the same performance as an inertial tail but with just 37\% of the normalized inertia. Second, the forward acceleration of the robot is improved by 12\% despite increasing the system mass by 10\% over a tailless version. These results show that aerodynamic drag can provide significant control authority for a robot while decreasing the payload and energy cost.},

We instead argue that a unified kinodynamic identification leads to more accurate identification of both the kinematic and mass-inertial parameters.

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on pose estimation dedicated to nonholonomic ground robots with low-cost sensors, by probabilistically fusing measurements from wheel odometers and an exteroceptive sensor. For ground robots, wheel odometers are widely used in pose estimation tasks, especially in applications in planar scenes. However, since wheel odometer only provides two-dimensional (2D) motion measurements, it is extremely challenging to use that for accurate full 6-D pose (3-D position and 3-D orientation) estimation. Traditional methods for 6-D pose estimation with wheel odometers either approximate motion profiles at the cost of accuracy reduction, or rely on other sensors, e.g., inertial measurement unit, to provide complementary measurements. By contrast, we propose a novel motion-manifold-based method for pose estimation of ground robots, which enables to utilize wheel odometers for high-precision 6-D pose estimation. Specifically, the proposed method, first, formulates the motion manifold of ground robots by a parametric representation, second, performs manifold-based 6-D integration with wheel odometer measurements only, and third, reparameterizes manifold representation periodically for error reduction. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithmic module, we integrate that into a sliding-window pose estimator by using measurements from wheel odometers and a monocular camera. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments are conducted for evaluation, and the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform competing the state-of-the-art algorithms by a significant margin in pose estimation accuracy, especially when deployed in complex, large-scale real-world environments.},

This article has reported a bioinspired design of a soft gripper that integrates flat dry adhesive, soft actuator, and microspine to improve the comprehensive grasping ability of the soft gripper on smooth or rough surfaces. The adhesive strength of flat dry adhesives with different thickness or cross-linking ratios was investigated to ensure that a large grasping force can be provided. Soft actuators with uniform and nonuniform cross-sectional heights were compared, and results indicated that the soft actuator with a nonuniform cross-sectional height exhibited remarkable advantages for designing the integrated gripper. A microspine-spring-shape memory alloy coil structure was designed to control the retraction and protrusion of microspine and distribute the load on rough surfaces evenly. The proposed integrated gripper with the aforementioned design can lift regularly or irregularly shaped objects with smooth or rough surfaces and provide a higher adhesive force than the nonadhesive gripper. After inserting a flexible pressure film sensor into the soft gripper, the surface property of the grasped object can be measured, which is beneficial for the selection of a suitable grasping strategy in unknown environments. The designed gripper can be used in many applications, such as in unmanned aerial vehicles, industrial manipulators, and climbing robots.},

In this article, we present an abdominal phantom for palpation training with controllable stiffness liver nodules that can also sense palpation forces. The coupled sensing and actuation approach is achieved by pneumatic control of positive-granular jammed nodules for tunable stiffness. Soft sensing is done using the variation of internal pressure of the nodules under external forces. This article makes original contributions to extend the linear region of the neo-Hookean characteristic of the mechanical behavior of the nodules by 140\% compared to no-jamming conditions and to propose a method using the organ level controllable nodules as sensors to estimate palpation position and force with a root-mean-square error of 4\% and 6.5\%, respectively. Compared to conventional soft sensors, the method allows the phantom to sense with no interference to the simulated physiological conditions when providing quantified feedback to trainees, and to enable training following current bare-hand examination protocols without the need to wear data gloves to collect data.},

The majority of the solutions from the literature focus either on fast computation or on path optimality, the former at the expense of suboptimal paths, the latter by making unbearable the computation in case of a high-dimensional workspace. In this article, we implement a three-dimensional path planner for neurosurgical applications, which keeps the computational cost consistent with standard preoperative planning algorithms and fine-tunes the estimated pathways in accordance to multiple optimization objectives. From a user-defined entry point, our method confines a sample-based path search within a subsection of the original workspace considering the degree of curvature admitted by the needle. An evolutionary optimization procedure is used to maximize the obstacle avoidance and reduce the insertion length. The pool of optimized solutions is examined through a cost function to determine the best path. Simulations on one dataset showed the ability of the planner to save time and overcome the state of the art in terms of obstacle avoidance, insertion length, and probability of failure, proving this algorithm as a valid planning method for complex environments.},

The current standard-of-care involves a range of affordable, manual, hand-held rigid tools, whose limited dexterity and range of adoptable shapes can prevent access to confined spaces. In contrast, recently developed roboticized tools that can provide increased accessibility and dexterity to navigate and perform complex tasks often come at the cost of larger, heavier, and grounded devices that are teleoperated, posing a new set of challenges. In this article, we propose a new hand-held concentric tube robot with an associated position control method that has the dexterity and precision of large roboticized devices, while maintaining the footprint of a traditional hand-held tool. The device shows human-in-the-loop control performance that meets the requirements of the targeted application, percutaneous abscess drainage. In addition, a small user study illustrates the advantage of combining rigid body motion of the device with more precise motions of the tip, thus showing the potential to bridge the gap between traditional hand-held tools and grounded robotic devices.},

Provided with a robot design and a set of example deformations, we continuously co-optimize the routing of actuators, and their actuation, to approximate example deformations as closely as possible. We introduce a data-driven model for McKibben muscles, modeling their contraction behavior when embedded in a silicone elastomer matrix. To enable the automated routing, a differentiable hyperelastic material simulation is presented. Because standard finite elements are not differentiable at element boundaries, we implement a moving least squares formulation, making the deformation gradient twice differentiable. Our robots are fabricated in a two-step molding process, with the complex mold design steps automated. While most soft robotic designs utilize bending, we study the use of our technique in approximating twisting deformations on a bar example. To demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in soft robotic design, we show a continuum robot, a tentacle, and a four-legged walking robot.},

In contrast to many existing robotic motion planning methods, we explicitly consider the uncertainty of the robot state by modeling the system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Recent work on general purpose POMDP solvers is typically limited to discrete observation spaces, and does not readily apply to the proposed problem due to the continuous measurements from LIDAR. In this article, we build upon an existing Monte Carlo tree search method, partially observable Monte Carlo planning (POMCP), and propose a new algorithm POMCP++. Our algorithm can handle continuous observation spaces with a novel measurement selection strategy. The POMCP++ algorithm overcomes overoptimism in the value estimation of a rollout policy by removing the implicit perfect state assumption at the rollout phase. We validate POMCP++ in theory by proving it is a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. Through comparisons with other methods that can also be applied to the proposed problem, we show that POMCP++ yields significantly higher success rate and total reward.},

Predefined-time convergence of a robotic task means that the task error is regulated to the origin at a desired preset time, independently of the initial state of the robot. The strict hierarchy of tasks is ensured by the so-called dynamic consistency, which avoids conflicts between decoupled task constraints. Thus, it enables the robot with more dexterity for reaching targets in its workspace while overcoming obstacles and joint limits. Predefined-time convergence facilitates the design of a time schedule to execute sequential and simultaneous tasks. All these features are supported by a stability analysis and experiments with two torque-controlled mobile manipulators in pick-and-place applications.},

This approach is data driven, yet yields an explicit control-oriented model rather than just a “black-box” input-output mapping. This work describes a Koopman-based system identification method and its application to model predictive control (MPC) design for soft robots. Three MPC controllers are developed for a pneumatic soft robot arm via the Koopman-based approach, and their performances are evaluated with respect to several real-world trajectory following tasks. In terms of average tracking error, these Koopman-based controllers are more than three times more accurate than a benchmark MPC controller based on a linear state-space model of the same system, demonstrating the utility of the Koopman approach in controlling real soft robots.},

Maximizing such force magnitude is defined as an optimization problem which is used to find the optimal values of the proposed mechanism&#39;s design parameters. By comparing the SW of different CDPRs with and without the proposed mechanism, effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated. In some examples, it is shown that the effects of the proposed method on the SW size increment is more than doubling the size and number of actuators.

To assess the utility of this region estimator, multimodal control is used to allow for autonomous navigation of the Endoculus, a robotic capsule endoscope, within a benchtop, to-scale, simulated colon. The estimation approach is presented and tested, demonstrating successful tracking of fixed velocity rotations at speeds up to 40 ° /s and allowing for curve anticipation approximately 10 cm before entering a curved section of the simulator. Finally, the multimodal control strategy utilizing this estimator is tested within the simulator over a variety of anatomic configurations. This strategy proves successful for navigation in both straight sections of this simulator and in tightly curved sections as small as 8 cm radius of curvature, with average velocities reaching 2.61 cm/s in straight sections and 0.99 cm/s in curved sections.},

The demonstrations are used to learn a parameterized policy to execute the skill and a goal model, as a hidden Markov model (HMM), to monitor executions. The rewards are learned from the HMM structure and its monitoring capability. The HMM is converted to a finite-horizon Markov reward process (MRP). A Monte Carlo approach is used to calculate its values. Then, the HMM and the values are merged into a partially observable MRP to obtain execution returns to be used with PS for improving the policy. In addition to reward learning, a black box PS method with an adaptive exploration strategy is adopted. The resulting framework is evaluated with five PS approaches and two skills in simulation. The results show that the learned dense rewards lead to better performance compared to sparse monitoring signals, and using an adaptive exploration lead to faster convergence with higher success rates and lower variance. The efficacy of the framework is validated in a real-robot settings by improving three skills to complete success from complete failure using learned rewards where sparse rewards failed completely.},

Our strategy can be applied to any robot with serial kinematics composed of revolute and prismatics joints. First, the algorithm identifies the robot kinematic structure, i.e., a high-level description of the robot geometry that defines the connections between the rigid-bodies composing the robot. Then, the algorithm derives the forward kinematics relying on a Gaussian process (GP) model. More precisely, the GP model is based on a polynomial kernel, defined exploiting the kinematic structure previously identified.

  abstract     = {A number of coordinated behaviors are proposed for achieving specific tasks for multirobot systems. However, since most applications require more than one such behavior, one needs to be able to compose together sequences of behaviors while respecting local information flow constraints. Specifically, when the interagent communication depends on interrobot distances, these constraints translate into particular configurations that must be reached in finite time in order for the system to be able to transition between the behaviors. To this end, we develop a distributed framework based on finite-time convergence control barrier functions that enables a team of robots to adjust its configuration in order to meet the communication requirements for the different tasks. In order to demonstrate the significance of the proposed framework, we implemented a full-scale scenario where a team of eight planar robots explore an urban environment in order to localize and rescue a subject.},

In contrast to usual approaches, it is based on the nonlinear parameterization of the beam shape by its strain fields and their reduction on a functional basis of strain modes. While remaining geometrically exact, the approach provides us with a minimal set of ordinary differential equations in the usual Lagrange matrix form that can be exploited for analysis and control design. Inspired from rigid robotics, the calculation of the matrices of this Lagrangian model is performed with a new reduced inverse Newton-Euler algorithm. To assess the approach, this Lagrangian model is compared against a well-validated finite element method through several benches of nonlinear structural statics and dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-type decision-making is ubiquitously required in robotic systems and has attracted significant research interests. Examples include, but not limited to, the integrated task and motion planning and optimal control of hybrid systems involving both continuous and discrete dynamic behaviors. For decision-making of robotic systems to improve operational efficiency, safety, and/or mission success rate, they involve both discrete variables representing task allocation or transitions between discrete modes and continuous variables representing trajectories of the planned motion or states governed by differential equations. This paper formulates a class of mixed-type decision-making problems with polynomial objective and constraints as quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems and a nonconvex optimization method based on alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve the QCQP. The proposed optimization method consists of three sequential subproblems, all of which admit closed-form solutions. Moreover, convergence proof of the optimization algorithm is provided. Two representative problems, traveling salesman with obstacle avoidance and rendezvous and docking of a charging station with distinct phase constraints, are described and solved via the proposed method. Numerical simulations as well as experimental verification of both problems are presented and compared with a state-of-art method to validate the effectiveness, efficacy and robustness of the nonconvex optimization method.},

  abstract     = {To move while using new sensor information, mobile robots use receding-horizon planning, executing a short plan while computing a new one. A plan should have dynamic feasibility (obeying a robot&#39;s dynamics and avoiding obstacles), liveness (planning frequently enough to complete tasks), and optimality (minimizing, e.g., distance to a goal). Reachability-based trajectory design (RTD) is a method to generate provably dynamically feasible plans in real time by solving a polynomial optimization program (POP) in each planning iteration. However, RTD uses a derivative-based solver, which may converge to local minima that impact liveness and optimality. This article proposes a parallel constrained Bernstein algorithm (PCBA) branch-and-bound method to optimally solve RTD&#39;s POP at runtime; the resulting optimal planner is called RTD*. The specific contributions of this article are the PCBA implementation, proofs of PCBA&#39;s bounded time and memory usage, a comparison of PCBA with state-of-the-art solvers, and a demonstration of PCBA/RTD* on hardware. RTD* shows better optimality and liveness than RTD in dozens of environments with random obstacles.},

Our verification technique is real-time capable and operates under the premise that intended trajectories are only executed if they have been verified as safe. The benefits of our proposed approach are demonstrated in different scenarios on an actual vehicle. Moreover, we present the first in-depth analysis of our verification technique used in dense urban traffic.

In this article, we derive an efficient implementation of the method and develop a convergence theory thereof. A structural parameter appears in the proof, which has a significant influence on the convergence basin. In this article, we show that this structural parameter is the norm of the inverse of the reduced graph Laplacian and obtains the explicit relation of this parameter for special graph structures. We also present another method that directly solves the pose synchronization using both relative rotation and translation observations. Experimental results show that our rotation synchronization method can be successfully used to initialize iterative PGO solvers.

Control of SEA-generated forces or torques makes allowance for the user&#39;s own volitional control and allows implementing a wide variety of assistive strategies. A novel force control method for a SEA-driven lower-limb assistive exoskeleton is presented. The device features variable-structure SEAs coupled via Bowden cables. The actuator alternates between two discrete levels of stiffness depending on the amplitude of the commanded force. The algorithm features a switching force-tracking control based on the forward-propagating Riccati equation. A disturbance-rejection component increases the device&#39;s transparency in zero assistance mode. The force control was used to implement an assistive strategy that aims to correct the asymmetric gait typical of stroke survivors. Assistive joint torques synchronize with the user&#39;s gait by means of an adaptive frequency oscillator, which extracts the continuous phase and frequency of the patient&#39;s gait using data from both the paretic and the healthy sides. The control was tested with healthy subjects wearing the exoskeleton while subject to a simulated knee flexion impairment.

To enable high flexibility, high stability, and high biomimicry degree for the robotic rat, we drew inspirations from three agile rat movements, namely, the pitch, yaw, and U-turn movements. First, we proposed key movement joints (KMJs) to capture a decent representation of the rat with a reduced-order model. By extracting the primary KMJs, we determined the number and distribution of robotic joints for the design of a bioinspired spine mechanism. Second, to meet the demand of high biomimicry degree, we generated an optimal compensation term to minimize the trajectory error introduced by simplifying the model. Moreover, we calculated the optimal minimum motion cycle based on the constraints of equilibrium under extreme conditions to ensure high flexibility without compromising the stability. Finally, the proposed method was successfully verified through simulation and experimental tests with a robotic rat endowed with the bioinspired spine mechanism.},

A fast algorithm for finding a small set of potential grasps is proposed followed by a local shape completion method to infer the occluded parts of the object. Finally, we propose an optimization-based refinement of the hand poses and finger configurations to achieve a power grasp of the target object. The proposed approach is validated extensively both on a simulated and a real world environment.

In this work, we present the study of one of the first systems in which a human is physically connected to an aerial vehicle by a cable. We want the robot to be able to pull the human toward a desired position (or along a path) only using forces as an indirect communication-channel. We propose an admittance-based approach with a controller, inspired by the literature on flexible manipulators, that computes the desired interaction forces that properly guide the human. The stability of the system is formally proved with a Lyapunov-based argument. The system is also shown to be passive, and thus robust to nonidealities like model and tracking errors, additional human forces, time-varying inputs, and other external disturbances. We also design a maneuver regulation policy to simplify the path following problem. The global method has been experimentally validated on a group of four subjects, showing a reliable and safe pHRI.},

These submanifolds, which we call adjoint-invariant submanifolds in this article, are known in the literature as persistent submanifolds, since they are strictly related to the concept of persistent screw systems. The difference is that in this article, just as Lie subgroups and symmetric subspaces, we put forward adjoint-invariant submanifolds as independent geometric objects from mechanisms and their associated local screw systems. Adjoint invariance relaxes the strict left and right invariance of Lie subgroups and the reflective invariance of symmetric subspaces by allowing generic moving reference frame in the aforementioned adjoint map. It turns out such adjoint invariance can be studied under the framework of distributions on manifolds, which allows us to explore global geometric properties of adjoint-invariant submanifolds. We classify adjoint-invariant submanifolds into reflective-type and product-type submanifolds and derive the conditions for their adjoint invariance. We then propose geometric methods and algorithms for synthesizing the kinematic generators for reflective-type submanifolds, as demonstrated with a number of examples.},

Despite concise in mathematical formulation, the accurate analytical representation of the SLIP model is unaccessible due to its intrinsic nonlinearity. This article extends the traditional SLIP model from sagittal hopping into spatially running. A novel perturbation-based approach is proposed to obtain an analytical approximate solution for the 3-D-SLIP model, resulting in a straight-forward closed-form formulation wherein the numerical integration or iteration is avoided. The derived solution does not rely on the negligible gravity assumption as conventional simplification reported in the existing literature and offers satisfactory prediction performance in a wide range of model parameter combinations. The merits of the acquired approximate solution in both critical state of the apex return map and trajectory prediction with high accuracy have been demonstrated via performance evaluation, endowing this approximation the potential in motion planning and gait control for legged robots.},

  abstract     = {Electronic skin (eSkin) with various types of sensors over large conformable substrates has received considerable interest in robotics. The continuous operation of large number of sensors and the readout electronics make it challenging to meet the energy requirements of eSkin. In this article, we present the first energy generating eSkin with intrinsic tactile sensing without any touch sensor. The eSkin comprises a distributed array of miniaturized solar cells and infrared light emitting diodes (IRLEDs) on soft elastomeric substrate. By innovatively reading the variations in the energy output of the solar cells and IRLEDs, the eSkin could sense multiple parameters (proximity, object location, edge detection, etc.). As a proof of concept, the eSkin has been attached to a 3-D-printed hand. With an energy surplus of 383.6 mW from the palm area alone, the eSkin could generate more than 100 W if present over the whole body (area ~1.5 m 2 ). Further, with an industrial robot arm, the presented eSkin is shown to enable safe human-robot interaction. The novel paradigm presented in this article for the development of a flexible eSkin extends the application of solar cell from energy generation alone to simultaneously acting as touch sensors.},

  abstract     = {Recent use scenarios involving human-robot collaboration have revealed that the robots require elastic joints to safely interact with humans. It is also critical to know applied force/torque (f/t) during the interaction for control and motion planning purposes. In this article, we estimate the external f/t values without using any sensors other than low-cost encoders by exploiting the inherent elastic properties of the joint. For estimation, the following two different approaches are used: model based and model free. In the model-based approach, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an external force observer (EFOB) are used considering the dynamical behavior of the system to estimate the interaction force. In the model-free approach, the artificial neural network (ANN) utilizes the data gathered from mechanical systems. In comparative analysis, we have, therefore, considered three different estimation methods, two of which are model based and the remaining one is model free (i.e., data driven). Implementing these estimation algorithms experimentally on a variable stiffness joint, we performed an extensive evaluation of their performances. All methods show similar level of performance in terms of the root-mean-square (RMS) error with 0.0847, 0.0841, and 0.1082 N for the EKF, EFOB, and ANN, respectively. Model-based methods do not require continuous data stream through the experimental set up. On the other hand, the ANN does not need an explicit model of the system; therefore, it may become preferable when the detailed model derivation is not possible.},

  abstract     = {Considering a simplified model of cables is an essential assumption in the design of state-estimator and vibration control of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs). Such an assumption however, impacts the effectiveness of controllers and state-estimators in such systems. This article presents a reaction-based stabilizer for nonmodel-based vibration control of CDPRs to address such model dependence. It is proved analytically that by using only three actuators and not involving the cable-connected winches, the proposed stabilizer regulates all undesired vibrations of the platform. It is also shown that the proposed stabilizer needs only the directly measurable position and velocity of its actuators to form its closed-loop control feedback signals. Effectiveness of the proposed system is more significant in CDPRs with considerable nonlinear effects of cables, where such effects are computationally costly to model, such that the performance of real-time controllers and state-estimators are spoiled. To provide a case study, a multibody nonlinear dynamic model of a suspended CDPR equipped-with the proposed stabilizer with zero cable damping effects is developed in SimMechanics/MATLAB, where a fine-tuned proportional-derivative controller is applied on each actuator to suppress all vibrations of the system. In addition, a suspended CDPR with extremely stretchable nonlinear-stiffness elastomer cables is fabricated and tested, where performance of the proposed stabilizer to suppress the high-amplitude nonlinear oscillations of the whole system is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The collinear Mecanum drive (CMD) is a novel robot locomotion system, capable of generating omnidirectional motion while simultaneously dynamically balancing, achieved using a collinear arrangement of three or more Mecanum wheels. The CMD has a significantly thinner ground footprint than existing omnidirectional locomotion methods, which does not need to be enlarged with increasing robot height as to avoid toppling during acceleration or external disturbance. This combination of omnidirectional manoeuvrability and a thin ground footprint allows for the creation of tall robots that are able to navigate through much narrower gaps between obstacles than existing omnidirectional locomotion methods. This allows for greater manoeuvrability in confined and cluttered environments, such as that encountered in the personal service and automated warehousing robotics sectors. This article derives the kinematics and dynamics models of the CMD, analyzes controllability and accessibility, and determines the degree to which a CMD can be linearized by feedback. A partial feedback linearization is then performed, and three practically useful nonlinear controllers are derived using a backstepping design approach, all with convergence and stability guarantees for the fully coupled nonlinear model. These are demonstrated both in simulation and on a real-world CMD experimental prototype.},

This article focuses on the relation between the graphical structure of pose-graph SLAM and Fisher information matrix (FIM), Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB), and its optimal design metrics (T-optimality and D-optimality). As a main contribution, based on the assumption of isotropic Langevin noise for rotation and block-isotropic Gaussian noise for translation, the FIM and CRLB are derived and shown to be closely related to the graph structure, in particular, the weighted Laplacian matrix. We also prove that total node degree and weighted number of spanning trees, as two graph connectivity metrics, are, respectively, closely related to the trace and determinant of the FIM. The discussions show that, compared with the D-optimality metric, the T-optimality metric is more easily computed but less effective. We also present upper and lower bounds for the D-optimality metric, which can be efficiently computed and are almost independent of the estimation results. The results are verified with several well-known datasets, such as Intel, KITTI, sphere, and so on.},

The proposed surface-based path following control concept extends the classical path following control by a novel parallel contact frame and a parallel projection operator. Using a static state feedback, the robotic system is transformed into a system with linear input-output behavior in the path coordinates. This allows to traverse a path on a 3-D object with a draping roll without turning around the surface normal vector. The latter prevents distortions and wrinkles of the applied tape.

A multiagent visual model is developed and analyzed for an individual agent operating in a group of other agents. The theoretical model indicates a stable equilibrium trajectory within the neighboring agents. When a minority of agents conducting bioinspired visual feedback are introduced into a planar swarm simulation, results show robustness of agents to perturbations from reference condition. The bioinspired feedback rule is implemented experimentally using ground microbots for two cases identified by a theoretical observability condition. The experimental performance of the single agent in an established swarm is consistent with the theoretical stability and observability predictions. The results indicate insect visuomotor response can help participate in established swarms, and indicate the importance of optic flow input in maintaining group motion.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and robust calibration is crucial to a multisensor fusion-based system. The calibration of heterogeneous sensors is particularly challenging because of the huge difference of the captured sensor data. On the other hand, many calibration approaches ignore temporal calibration that is in fact as important as spatial calibration. In this article, we focus on the temporal calibration of heterogeneous sensors, and the corresponding extrinsic rotation is also derived. Most existing methods are specialized for a certain sensor combination, such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) camera or a camera-Lidar system. However, heterogeneous multisensor fusion is a tendency in the robotics area, so a unified calibration method is desired. To this end, we leverage the 3-D rotational motion feature for calibration, and auxiliary calibration boards are not needed since multiple odometry methods are available to capture 3-D sensor motion. Using a high-frequency IMU as the calibration reference, an IMU-centric scheme is designed to achieve a unified framework that adapts to various target sensors that can independently estimate 3-D rotational motion. By combining independent IMU-centric calibration pairs, an arbitrary pair of sensors can also be calibrated using the same reference IMU. Due to a novel 3-D motion correlation quantification and analysis mechanism, the temporal offset can be first estimated in real time. Given temporally aligned sensor motion, the extrinsic rotation can be derived in closed-form in the same 3-D motion correlation mechanism. Experimental results of certain sensor combinations show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method through comparison with state-of-the-art calibration approaches, and the calibration result of a heterogeneous multisensor set demonstrates the scalability and versatility of our method.},

MFP robots are modular fluid networks. To propel, they route fluid through themselves. In this article, both hydraulic and pneumatic implementations are considered. The robots move towards a goal by way of a decentralized controller that runs independently on each module face, uses two bits of sensory information and requires neither run-time memory, nor communication. We prove that 2-D MFP robots reach the goal when of orthogonally convex shape, or reach a morphology-dependent distance from it when of arbitrary shape. We present a 2-D hydraulic MFP prototype and show, experimentally, that it succeeds in reaching the goal in at least 90\% of trials, and that 71\% less energy is expended when modules can communicate. Moreover, in simulations with 3-D hydraulic MFP robots, the decentralized controller performs almost as well as a state-of-the-art and centralized controller. Given the simplicity of the hardware requirements, the MFP concept could pave the way for modular robots to be used at sub-centimeter-scale, where effective modular propulsion systems have not been demonstrated.},

The design of the robotic tool uses two types of a tendon-driven joint known as a bending flexure joint that allows us to control each degree-of-freedom by minimizing interjoint coupling by design. Pure kinematic modeling and control for these robots may not provide precise control performance due to kinematic uncertainties arising from tendon elongation, tendon slacking, gear backlash, etc. We propose a static model for each of the joints of the robotic tool that avoids several of these problems. Depending on the direction of tendon tension application, the proximal joint displays considerable hysteresis due to the superelastic material characteristics and this is included in our static model. The statics of a highly compliant distal joint is also modeled and validated using finite element analysis and experimental data. Using these models, we develop a control system that comprises of a disturbance observer and the proposed static model to provide precise force control and compensate for joint hysteresis.},

  abstract     = {Tactile sensing is used by humans when grasping to prevent us dropping objects. One key facet of tactile sensing is slip detection, which allows a gripper to know when a grasp is failing and take action to prevent an object being dropped. This study demonstrates the slip detection capabilities of the recently developed Tactile Model O (T-MO) robotic hand by using support vector machines to detect slip and test multiple slip scenarios including responding to the onset of slip in real time with 11 different objects in various grasps. In this article, we demonstrate the benefits of slip detection in grasping by testing two real-world scenarios: adding weight to destabilize a grasp and using slip detection to lift up objects at the first attempt. The T-MO is able to detect when an object is slipping, react to stabilize the grasp, and be deployed in real-world scenarios. This shows the T-MO is a suitable platform for autonomous grasping by using reliable slip detection to ensure a stable grasp in unstructured environments.},

  abstract     = {Origami provides a unique tool for the design of robotic frames owing to its simple shaping principle by “folding.” However, achieving the fast and reversible activeness of a highly reconfigurable structure remains challenging owing to the limitations of accessible actuators. In particular, it is difficult to find an actuator that can realize a simultaneously large, rapid, reversible, and stable movement while leading to a favorable form factor for the origami. To overcome this, in this article, we propose a 3-D shape-shifting system consisting of a morphing origami block that complements the stability problem of shape memory alloy wire actuators by tuning its structural characteristics. This cooperative scheme improves the reversibility and stability of the shape-shifting system, which enables the rapid transformation with high degrees of freedom unlike in existing programmable origami. As a stand-alone unit of transformation, morphing block equipped with deployable mechanism and actuators weighs 6 g and has a volume change factor of ten. Furthermore, the transformation time in both directions is less than 5 s, and the block can carry more than 120 g of payload in the deployed state. The proposed system composed of multiple origami blocks can reconfigure itself into diverse 3-D target shapes.},

It is shown through dynamics simulations that the magnitude of the net rotation is dependent upon the amplitude of the angular displacement of the joints. With realistic joint limitations, the robot, which includes rotary actuators only, can perform a 180 ° reorientation about its longitudinal axis, similar to the cat righting reflex. The second manoeuvre allows the robot to accomplish rotations of smaller magnitude about a different axis. A physical prototype and a VICON motion tracking system are used to experimentally validate the simulation results.

  abstract     = {Mobile robots operating in unknown urban environments encounter a wide range of complex terrains to which they must adapt their planned trajectory for safe and efficient navigation. Most existing approaches utilize supervised learning to classify terrains from either an exteroceptive or a proprioceptive sensor modality. However, this requires a tremendous amount of manual labeling effort for each newly encountered terrain as well as for variations of terrains caused by changing environmental conditions. In this article, we propose a novel terrain classification framework leveraging an unsupervised proprioceptive classifier that learns from vehicle-terrain interaction sounds to self-supervise an exteroceptive classifier for pixelwise semantic segmentation of images. To this end, we first learn a discriminative embedding space for vehicle-terrain interaction sounds from triplets of audio clips formed using visual features of the corresponding terrain patches and cluster the resulting embeddings. We subsequently use these clusters to label the visual terrain patches by projecting the traversed tracks of the robot into the camera images. Finally, we use the sparsely labeled images to train our semantic segmentation network in a weakly supervised manner. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative results that demonstrate that our proprioceptive terrain classifier exceeds the state-of-the-art among unsupervised methods and our self-supervised exteroceptive semantic segmentation model achieves a comparable performance to supervised learning with manually labeled data.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a trajectory planning algorithm that enables autonomous surface vessels to perform socially compliant navigation in a city&#39;s canal. The key idea behind the proposed algorithm is to adopt an optimal control formulation in which the deviation of movements of the autonomous vessel from nominal movements of human-operated vessels is penalized. Consequently, given a pair of origin and destination points, it finds vessel trajectories that resemble those of human-operated vessels. To formulate this, we adopt kernel density estimation (KDE) to build a nominal movement model of human-operated vessels from a prerecorded trajectory dataset, and use a Kullback-Leibler control cost to measure the deviation of the autonomous vessel&#39;s movements from the model. We establish an analogy between our trajectory planning approach and the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEntIRL) approach to explain how our approach can learn the navigation behavior of human-operated vessels. On the other hand, we distinguish our approach from the MaxEntIRL approach in that it does not require well-defined bases, often referred to as features, to construct its cost function as required in many of inverse reinforcement learning approaches in the trajectory planning context. Through experiments using a dataset of vessel trajectories collected from the automatic identification system, we demonstrate that the trajectories generated by our approach resemble those of human-operated vessels and that using them for canal navigation is beneficial in reducing head-on encounters between vessels and improving navigation safety.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a data-driven approach to obtain the static image of a scene, eliminating dynamic objects that might have been present at the time of traversing the scene with a camera. The general objective is to improve vision-based localization and mapping tasks in dynamic environments, where the presence (or absence) of different dynamic objects in different moments makes these tasks less robust. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework to turn images of an urban environment that include dynamic content, such as vehicles or pedestrians, into realistic static frames suitable for localization and mapping. This objective faces two main challenges: detecting the dynamic objects, and inpainting the static occluded background. The first challenge is addressed by the use of a convolutional network that learns a multiclass semantic segmentation of the image. The second challenge is approached with a generative adversarial model that, taking as input the original dynamic image and the computed dynamic/static binary mask, is capable of generating the final static image. This framework makes use of two new losses, one based on image steganalysis techniques, useful to improve the inpainting quality, and another one based on ORB features, designed to enhance feature matching between real and hallucinated image regions. To validate our approach, we perform an extensive evaluation on different tasks that are affected by dynamic entities, i.e.,visual odometry, place recognition, and multiview stereo, with the hallucinated images.

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a model and a control approach for herding a swarm of “follower” agents to a target distribution among a set of states using a single “leader” agent. The follower agents evolve on a finite state space that is represented by a graph and transition between states according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), whose transition rates are determined by the location of the leader agent. The control problem is to define a sequence of states for the leader agent that steers the probability density of the forward equation of the Markov chain. For the case, when the followers are possibly interacting, we prove local approximate controllability of the system about equilibrium probability distributions. For the case, when the followers are noninteracting, we design two switching control laws for the leader that drive the swarm of follower agents asymptotically to a target probability distribution that is positive for all states. The first strategy is open-loop in nature, and the switching times of the leader are independent of the follower distribution. The second strategy is of feedback type, and the switching times of the leader are functions of the follower density in the leader&#39;s current state. We validate our control approach through numerical simulations with varied numbers of follower agents that evolve on graphs of different sizes, through a 3-D multirobot simulation in which a quadrotor is used to control the spatial distribution of eight ground robots over four regions, and through a physical experiment in which a swarm of ten robots is herded by a virtual leader over four regions.},

To tackle this problem, we present an autonomous suturing framework that encompasses a novel needle path planner, as well as an accurate needle pose estimator and a six degrees-of-freedom controller. A novel needle grasper is developed that enables needle pose estimation both inside and outside the tissue. The framework was evaluated experimentally using the Raven IV surgical system and important suture parameters were quantified. The experiment results confirmed a needle pose estimation accuracy of ° in orientation across all directions. Moreover, the results revealed that using the proposed framework enabled following the reference needle trajectories with errors of 2.07 mm in position and 4.29 ° in orientation. These are drastic improvements of more than 10× in position and 5× in orientation compared to the Raven IV kinematic controller. Additionally, the results verified that our framework delivered the desired clinical suture parameters successfully across tissue phantom environments with different mechanical properties and under various needle trajectories.

Touch is even more crucial for robots, as robots equipped with thorough tactile sensation can more safely interact with their surroundings, including humans. This article describes a recently developed large-scale tactile sensing system for a robotic link, called TacLINK, which can be assembled to form a whole-body tactile sensing robot arm. The proposed system is an elongated structure comprising a rigid transparent bone covered by continuous artificial soft skin. The soft skin of TacLINK not only provides tactile force feedback but can change its form and stiffness by inflation at low pressure. Upon contact with the surrounding environment, TacLINK perceives tactile information through the three-dimensional (3-D) deformation of its skin, resulting from the tracking of an array of markers on its inner wall by a stereo camera located at both ends of the transparent bone. A finite element model (FEM) was formulated to describe the relationship between applied forces and the displacements of markers, allowing detailed tactile information, including contact geometry and distribution of applied forces, to be derived simultaneously, regardless of the number of contacts. TacLINK is scalable in size, durable in operation, and low in cost, as well as being a high-performance system, that can be widely exploited in the design of robotic arms, prosthetic arms, and humanoid robots, etc. This article presents the design, modeling, calibration, implementation, and evaluation of the system.},

For n-DOF devices, methods to stabilize target manifolds of dimensions 1 to n-1 are of interest. In this article, we contribute constraint field methods that stabilize n$-$1 dimensional target manifolds while leaving the orthogonal subspace free to the control of the operator. We also contribute force-modulated single degree of freedom (DOF) velocity fields, which add between 1 and n-2 virtual DOFs to the motion of devices whose physical constraints leave one DOF. Control performance is demonstrated in simulation for 3-DOF devices capable of imposing 1-D or 2-D constraints and in experiment for 2-DOF devices imposing 1-D constraints.

Grasping with hand-like end effectors often requires careful selection of hand orientation and finger placement. Here, we present a fingerless soft gripper capable of efficiently generating multiple grasping modes. It is based on a soft, cylindrical accordion structure containing coupled, parallel fluidic channels, which are controlled via pressure supplied from a single fluidic port. Inflation opens the gripper orifice for enveloping an object, while deflation allows it to produce grasping forces. The interior is patterned with a gecko-like skin that increases friction, enabling the gripper to lift objects weighing up to 20 N. Our design ensures that fragile objects, such as eggs, can be safely handled, by virtue of a wall buckling mechanism. In reverse, the gripper can be deflated to reach into an opening or orifice then inflated to grasp objects with handles or cavities. The gripper may also integrate a lip that enables it to form a seal and, upon inflating, to generate suction for lifting objects with flat surfaces. In this article, we describe the design and fabrication of this device and present an analytical model of its behavior when operated from a single fluidic port. In experiments, we demonstrate its ability to grasp diverse objects, and show that its performance is well described by our model. Our findings show how a fingerless soft gripper can efficiently perform a variety of grasping operations. Such devices could improve the ability of robotic systems to meet applications in areas of great economic and societal importance.},

  abstract     = {We propose the first fast and certifiable algorithm for the registration of two sets of three-dimensional (3-D) points in the presence of large amounts of outlier correspondences. A certifiable algorithm is one that attempts to solve an intractable optimization problem (e.g., robust estimation with outliers) and provides readily checkable conditions to verify if the returned solution is optimal (e.g., if the algorithm produced the most accurate estimate in the face of outliers) or bound its suboptimality or accuracy. Toward this goal, we first reformulate the registration problem using a truncated least squares (TLS) cost that makes the estimation insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. Then, we provide a general graph-theoretic framework to decouple scale, rotation, and translation estimation, which allows solving in cascade for the three transformations. Despite the fact that each subproblem (scale, rotation, and translation estimation) is still nonconvex and combinatorial in nature, we show that 1) TLS scale and (component-wise) translation estimation can be solved in polynomial time via an adaptive voting scheme, 2) TLS rotation estimation can be relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP) and the relaxation is tight, even in the presence of extreme outlier rates, and 3) the graph-theoretic framework allows drastic pruning of outliers by finding the maximum clique. We name the resulting algorithm TEASER ( Truncated least squares Estimation And SEmidefinite Relaxation ). While solving large SDP relaxations is typically slow, we develop a second fast and certifiable algorithm, named TEASER++, that uses graduated nonconvexity to solve the rotation subproblem and leverages Douglas-Rachford Splitting to efficiently certify global optimality. For both algorithms, we provide theoretical bounds on the estimation errors, which are the first of their kind for robust registration problems. Moreover, we test their performance on standard benchmarks, object detection datasets, and the 3DMatch scan matching dataset, and show that 1) both algorithms dominate the state-of-the-art (e.g., RANSAC, branch-&amp;-bound, heuristics) and are robust to more than $\text{99}\%$ outliers when the scale is known, 2) TEASER++ can run in milliseconds and it is currently the fastest robust registration algorithm, and 3) TEASER++ is so robust it can also solve problems without correspondences (e.g., hypothesizing all-to-all correspondences), where it largely outperforms ICP and it is more accurate than Go-ICP while being orders of magnitude faster. We release a fast open-source C++ implementation of TEASER++.},

  abstract     = {In corneal transplantation, 16 submillimeter-sized sutures are generated around the circular-shaped graft cornea. A major challenge in corneal transplantation is the generation of uniformly shaped sutures, where the suture shapes need to be changed depending on the patient. In this study, a corneal suturing robot that can produce sutures of the desired shape with high uniformity is described. The proposed robot manipulates the corneal tissue deformation before inserting the needle for suture shape control. A simulation using the finite element method was proposed to predict the suture shape. The suturing experiment was conducted on a porcine model, and the result was compared with the simulation. As a result, the proposed robot was able to generate sutures with a standard deviation of 108 μm in length and 36 μm in depth. The mean absolute error between the simulation and the experiment was 95 μm in length and 31 μm in depth. This is the first study to suggest a method for controlling the suture shape and quantitatively analyzing it in ophthalmic surgery.},

Our approach intertwines Shape-from-Template (SfT) and Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) techniques to deal with the exploratory sequences typical of SLAM. A deformation tracking thread recovers the pose of the camera and the deformation of the observed map, at frame rate, by means of SfT processing a template that models the scene shape-at-rest. A deformation mapping thread runs in parallel with the tracking to update the template, at keyframe rate, by means of an isometric NRSfM processing a batch of full perspective keyframes. In our experiments, DefSLAM processes close-up sequences of deforming scenes, both in a laboratory-controlled experiment and in medical endoscopy sequences, producing accurate 3-D models of the scene with respect to the moving camera.},

Most of today&#39;s lidars collect geometric information about the surrounding environment by sweeping lasers across their field of view. Consequently, 3-D points in one lidar scan are acquired at different timestamps. If the sensor trajectory is not accurately known, the scans are affected by the phenomenon known as motion distortion. The proposed method leverages preintegration with a continuous representation of the inertial measurements to characterize the system&#39;s motion at any point in time. It enables precise correction of the motion distortion without relying on any explicit motion model. The system&#39;s pose, velocity, biases, and time shift are estimated via a full batch optimization that includes automatically generated loop closure constraints. The autocalibration and the registration of lidar data rely on planar and edge features matched across pairs of scans. The performance of the framework is validated through simulated and real-data experiments.},

A wide literature exists on the topic, both resorting to reactive (i.e. collision avoidance) and to deliberative (i.e. motion planning) techniques. In this work, null space-based inverse kinematics (NSB-IK) methods are applied to the problem of fleet management. Several NSB-IK approaches existing in the literature are reviewed, and compared with a reverse priority approach, which originated in manipulator control, and is here applied for the first time to the considered problem. All NSB-IK approaches are here described in a unified formalism, which allows (i) to encode the property of each controller into a set of seven main key features, (ii) to study possible new control laws with an opportune choice of these parameters. Furthermore, motivated by the envisioned application scenario, we tackle the problem of task-switching activation. Leveraging on the iCAT TPC technique Simetti and Casalino, 2016, in this article, we propose a method to obtain continuity in the control in face of activation or deactivation of tasks, and subtasks by defining suitable damped projection operators. The proposed approaches are evaluated formally, and via simulations. Performances with respect to standard methods are compared considering a specific case study for multivehicles management.},

For most applications, these remote magnetic microrobots are located relatively far from the magnetic field generation sources. In this condition, all microrobots receive approximately the same driving magnetic field (which we term a homogeneous field). While some solutions have been presented to allow for the creation of simple onboard tools, the full potential of the homogeneous magnetic field for multi-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) actuation has not been exploited. Here we introduce a design framework to utilize the maximum number of independently controlled DOFs on a microrobot system. We make use of three classes of mechanisms which are commonly used in practice and allow for more complex microrobots with up to eight DOFs. To verify the functionality of our framework, we used it to design an optimized drug delivery robot equipped with a 3-DOF drug-releasing mechanism and a 4-DOF motion mechanism. Experiments are performed to actuate each one of the robot&#39;s seven DOFs individually, where the cross-talk error between these seven DOFs averaged 7\% with a max error of 18.3\%.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a distributed formation control strategy for agents with a variety of dynamics to achieve a desired planar formation. Our approach is based on the barycentric-coordinate-based (BCB) control, which is fully distributed, does not require interagent communication or a common sense of orientation, and can be implemented using relative position measurements acquired by agents in their local coordinate frames. This removes the need for global positioning or alignment of local coordinate frames, which are required across several existing strategies. We show how the BCB control for agents with the simplest dynamical model, i.e., the single-integrator dynamics, can be extended to agents with higher order dynamics such as quadrotors, and nonholonomic agents such as unicycles and cars. Specifically, our extension preserves the desired convergence and robustness guarantees of the BCB approach and is provably robust to saturations in the input and unmodeled linear actuator dynamics for unicycle and car agents. We further show that under our proposed BCB control design, the agents can move along a rotated and scaled control direction without affecting the convergence to the desired formation. This observation is used to design a fully distributed collision avoidance strategy, which is often not considered in the formation control literature. We demonstrate the proposed approach in simulations and further present a distributed robotic platform to test the strategy experimentally. Our experimental platform consists of off-the-shelf equipment that can be used to test and validate other multiagent algorithms.

The concept of security is based on the control-theoretic notion of left invertibility, which depends on the existence of disjoint paths and subcuts in the topology describing robot interactions. To model uncertainties in interactions, we associate the existence of edges with a probability distribution. We, then, derive a probability expression based on disjoint paths and subcuts that defines the probability of security of the MRS. The exact probability is computed using the concept of binary decision diagrams (BDDs), a graphical method used to represent Boolean functions. To improve computational complexity, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to bound the probability of security. Since MRSs are inherently dynamic, we leverage the graphical properties of BDDs to adapt to any topological changes. To demonstrate the validity of our results, we first track the probability of security of an MRS performing an environmental monitoring task, with Monte Carlo simulations as a baseline for comparison. Finally, we study the behavior of a probabilistic MRS when under attack in three different scenarios.},

Here, we introduce a novel technique, called the bisection algorithm (BA), which is fully implemented in C++ and extends dynamic programming approaches to the problem. These approaches, which rely on dividing the global problem into a series of simpler subproblems, become increasingly advantageous compared to direct transcription methods as the number of problem constraints increases. In contrast to nearly all other dynamic programming approaches, BA does not rely on finding a maximum-velocity curve or explicitly finding acceleration switching points during the trajectory planning process. Additionally, only one forward and one backward integration are used, during which all constraints are imposed. This approach is made feasible through careful control of the numerical integration process and the use of a bisection algorithm to resolve constraint violations during integration. BA is shown to be significantly simpler, faster, and more robust than recently proposed algorithms: a direct comparison is made for a series of paths to be followed by a serial manipulator, subject to kinematic constraints. The wide applicability of BA is then established by solving the time-optimal problem for a parallel manipulator following a complex path, subject to both kinematic and dynamic constraints.},

The incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion approach which excels in handling model uncertainties is adopted to compensate for the significant unknown aerodynamic effects. The internal dynamics of such an underactuated system have been analyzed, and subsequently stabilized by redefining the control output. The proposed method can be generalized to control a quadrotor under single-rotor-failure and nominal conditions. For validation, flight tests have been carried out in a large-scale open jet wind tunnel. The position of a damaged quadrotor can be controlled in the presence of significant wind disturbances.

  abstract     = {Kinodynamic rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) planners are effective tools for finding feasible trajectories in many classes of robotic systems. However, they are hard to apply to systems with closed-kinematic chains, like parallel robots, collaborative arms manipulating an object, or legged robots keeping their feet in contact with the environment. The state space of such systems is an implicitly-defined manifold that complicates the design of the sampling and steering procedures, and leads to trajectories that drift from the manifold if standard integration methods are used. To address these issues, this article presents a kinodynamic RRT planner that constructs an atlas of the state space incrementally, and uses this atlas to generate random states, and to dynamically steer the system toward such states. The steering method exploits the atlas charts to compute locally optimal controls based on linear quadratic regulators. The atlas also allows the integration of the equations of motion using local coordinates, which eliminates any drift from the state space manifold and results in accurate trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first kinodynamic planner that explicitly takes closed kinematic chains into account. In this article, we illustrate the planner performance in significantly complex tasks involving planar and spatial robots that have to lift or throw a load using torque-limited actuators.},

  abstract     = {As a promising branch of robotics, imitation learning emerges as an important way to transfer human skills to robots, where human demonstrations represented in Cartesian or joint spaces are utilized to estimate task/skill models that can be subsequently generalized to new situations. While learning Cartesian positions suffices for many applications, the end-effector orientation is required in many others. Despite recent advances in learning orientations from demonstrations, several crucial issues have not been adequately addressed yet. For instance, how can demonstrated orientations be adapted to pass through arbitrary desired points that comprise orientations and angular velocities? In this article, we propose an approach that is capable of learning multiple orientation trajectories and adapting learned orientation skills to new situations (e.g., via-points and end-points), where both orientation and angular velocity are considered. Specifically, we introduce a kernelized treatment to alleviate explicit basis functions when learning orientations, which allows for learning orientation trajectories associated with high-dimensional inputs. In addition, we extend our approach to the learning of quaternions with angular acceleration or jerk constraints, which allows for generating smoother orientation profiles for robots. Several examples including experiments with real 7-DoF robot arms are provided to verify the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we report system and algorithmic developments for a sensing suite comprising a camera and a ground penetrating radar (GPR) with a wheel encoder designed for both surface and subsurface infrastructure inspection, which is a multimodal mapping task. To fuse different sensor modalities properly, we solve a novel GPR-camera calibration problem and a synchronization-challenged sensor fusion problem. First, we design a calibration rig, model the GPR imaging process, introduce a mirror to obtain the joint coverage between the camera and the GPR, and employ the maximum-likelihood estimator to estimate the relative pose between the camera and the GPR with error analysis. Second, we propose a data collection scheme using the customized artificial landmarks to synchronize camera images (temporally evenly spaced) and GPR/encoder data (spatially evenly spaced). We also employ pose graph optimization with location discrepancy as penalty functions to perform data fusion for 3-D reconstruction. We have tested our system in physical experiments. The results show that our system successfully fuses encoder-camera-GPR sensory data and accomplishes a metric 3-D reconstruction. Moreover, our sensor fusion approach reduces the end-to-end distance error from 6.4 to 0.7 cm in a real bridge inspection experiment if comparing to the counterpart that only uses encoder measurements.},

  abstract     = {This article describes motion planning networks (MPNet), a computationally efficient, learning-based neural planner for solving motion planning problems.MPNet uses neural networks to learn general near-optimal heuristics for path planning in seen and unseen environments. It takes environment information such as raw point cloud from depth sensors, as well as a robot&#39;s initial and desired goal configurations and recursively calls itself to bidirectionally generate connectable paths. In addition to finding directly connectable and near-optimal paths in a single pass, we show that worst-case theoretical guarantees can be proven if we merge this neural network strategy with classical sample-based planners in a hybrid approach while still retaining significant computational and optimality improvements. To train the MPNet models, we present an active continual learning approach that enables MPNet to learn from streaming data and actively ask for expert demonstrations when needed, drastically reducing data for training. We validate MPNet against gold-standard and state-of-the-art planning methods in a variety of problems from two-dimensional to seven-dimensional robot configuration spaces in challenging and cluttered environments, with results showing significant and consistently stronger performance metrics, and motivating neural planning in general as a modern strategy for solving motion planning problems efficiently.},

Background signals may be highly heterogeneous and can mislead algorithms that are based on receding horizon control. We propose AdaSearch, a general algorithm for adaptive source seeking in the face of heterogeneous background noise. AdaSearch combines global trajectory planning with principled confidence intervals in order to concentrate measurements in promising regions while guaranteeing sufficient coverage of the entire area. Theoretical analysis shows that AdaSearch confers gains over a uniform sampling strategy when the distribution of background signals is highly variable. Simulation experiments demonstrate that when applied to the problem of radioactive source-seeking, AdaSearch outperforms both uniform sampling and a receding time horizon informationmaximization approach based on the current literature. We also demonstrate AdaSearch in hardware, providing further evidence of its potential for real-time implementation.},

We show that the correlation coefficient of the automatically learned DCNN features of two object images carries robust information on their similarity, and can be utilized to significantly improve the robot&#39;s classification accuracy, without additional training. More specifically, we first probabilistically analyze how the feature correlation carries vital similarity information and build a correlation-based Markov random field (CoMRF) for joint object labeling. Given query and motion budgets, we then propose an optimization framework to plan the robot&#39;s query and path based on our CoMRF. This gives the robot a new way to optimally decide which object sites to move close to for better sensing and for which objects to ask a remote human for help with classification, which considerably improves the overall classification. We extensively evaluate our proposed approach on two large datasets (e.g., drone imagery and indoor scenes) and several real-world robotic experiments. The results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear controllers for floating base systems in contact with the environment are often framed as quadratic programming (QP) optimization problems. Common drawbacks of such QP-based controllers are: the control input often experiences discontinuities; no force feedback from force/torque (FT) sensors installed on the robot is taken into account. This article attempts to address these limitations using jerk-based control architectures. The proposed controllers assume the rate-of-change of the joint torques as control input, and exploit the system position, velocity, accelerations, and contact wrenches as measurable quantities. The key ingredient of the presented approach is a one-to-one correspondence between free variables and an inner approximation of the manifold defined by the contact stability constraints. More precisely, the proposed correspondence covers completely the contact stability manifold except for the socalled friction cone, for which there exists a unique correspondence for more than 90\% of its elements. The correspondence allows us to transform the underlying constrained optimization problem into one that is unconstrained. Then, we propose a jerk control framework that exploits the proposed correspondence and uses FT measurements in the control loop. Furthermore, we present Lyapunov stable controllers for the system momentum in the jerk control framework. The approach is validated with simulations and experiments using the iCub humanoid robot.},
