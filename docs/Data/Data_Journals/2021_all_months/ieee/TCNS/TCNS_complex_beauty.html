  abstract     = {We examine a control problem where the states of the components of a system deteriorate after a disruption, if they are not being repaired by an entity. There exist a set of dependencies in the form of precedence constraints between the components, captured by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The objective of the entity is to maximize the number of components, whose states are brought back to the fully repaired state within a given time. We prove that the general problem is NP-hard and, therefore, we characterize near-optimal control policies for special instances of the problem. We show that when the deterioration rates are larger than or equal to the repair rates and the precedence constraints are given by a DAG, it is optimal to continue repairing a component until its state reaches the fully recovered state before switching to repair any other component. Under the aforementioned assumptions and when the deterioration and the repair rates are homogeneous across all the components, we prove that a control policy that targets the healthiest component at each time-step while respecting the precedence and time constraints fully repairs at least half the number of components that would be fully repaired by an optimal policy. Finally, we prove that when the repair rates are sufficiently larger than the deterioration rates, the precedence constraints are given by a set of disjoint trees that each contain at most &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; nodes, and there is no time constraint, a policy that targets the component with the least value of health minus the deterioration rate at each time-step while respecting the precedence constraints fully repairs at least &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1/k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; times the number of components that would be fully repaired by an optimal policy.},

The PdI transformation enables the use of classical control techniques for solving leaderless consensus problems. Following this approach, we address for the first time the problem of leaderless consensus of heterogeneous multiagent systems in unknown pure-feedback form with state and communication time-delays and unknown disturbances. A general form of state delays is studied, which includes time-varying and distributed state delays among others. Retarded functional differential equations formalism is adopted in order to allow agent dynamics with such general state delays. The proposed algorithm guarantees that all closed-loop signals remain uniformly bounded and that the multiagent system achieves approximate consensus with prescribed steady-state error. Numerical simulations on a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles verify the validity of the theoretical analysis.},

In an event-triggered mechanism, the information interaction process of the network is controlled by a set of trigger conditions. The trigger condition of each agent only requires its own state information and its neighboring agents’ state information. Each agent updates its own states only at the triggering time. In order to achieve the optimal result of the optimization problem and reduce the cost of communicatio, we propose a distributed event-triggered algorithm based on gradient descent. Moreover, we analyze the convergence of the algorithm by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. Furthermore, we prove that the Zeno behavior can be avoid.

  abstract     = {A swarm of robots has several macroscopic properties that are extraneous to an individual robot. This is a direct consequence of the fact that a swarm is a coupled high-dimensional system that is characterized by interactions between individual robots. In a smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics-based control of a swarm of robots, the equations of motion may be parameterized by key parameters that affect the macroscopic properties of the swarm such as separation, compressibility, cohesivity, and velocity matching. In this article, we analyze this relation between the parameters in the equations of motion and the properties of the swarm. The resulting analysis enables the design of a versatile, scalable controller that may be modified and adopted to suit the desired objectives of individual applications. We also present a new interaction potential that enables controlling the robot-robot separation, beyond maintaining the robot density, and providing a swarm cohesive force that keeps the robots in the swarm together. The constructed interaction potential is conservative, and the overall swarm stability may still be established using passivity arguments in the presence of a dissipative process. In this article, we use Lyapunov methods on the total energy to establish this stability. The salient features of the proposed controller are verified using simulations and experiments. The experiments are conducted using two real physical airplanes to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed controller.},

The proposed methodology is based on the sufficient condition for the small-signal stability, developed as a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI), and uses network structure-preserving differential algebraic equation modeling of the power system. The proposed formulation is based on semidefinite programming and objective penalization that has been proposed for feasible solution recovery, making the method computationally efficient for large-scale systems. A vector-norm based objective penalty function has also been proposed for feasible solution recovery while working over large and dense BMIs with matrix variables. An effectiveness study carried out on WECC 9-bus, New England 39-bus, and IEEE 118-bus test systems shows that the proposed method is capable of achieving a stable equilibrium point without inflicting a high stability-induced additional cost.},

A distributed filtering algorithm is proposed to estimate system state, and a sufficient condition is established to guarantee mean-square boundedness of the estimation error. Moreover, a critical attack probability above which the steady-state estimation error covariance will exceed a preset value is found. In addition, a minimum attack magnitude is given to ensure that the attack signal is able to be completely detected.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the system identification problem for sparse linear time-invariant systems. We propose a sparsity promoting block-regularized estimator to identify the dynamics of the system with only a limited number of input-state data samples. We characterize the properties of this estimator under high-dimensional scaling, where the growth rate of the system dimension is comparable to or even faster than that of the number of available sample trajectories. In particular, using contemporary results on high-dimensional statistics, we show that the proposed estimator results in a small elementwise error, provided that the number of sample trajectories is above a threshold. This threshold depends polynomially on the size of each block and the number of nonzero elements at different rows of input and state matrices, but only logarithmically on the system dimension. A by product of this result is that the number of sample trajectories required for sparse system identification is significantly smaller than the dimension of the system. Furthermore, we show that, unlike the recently celebrated least-squares estimators for system identification problems, the method developed in this work is capable of exact recovery of the underlying sparsity structure of the system with the aforementioned number of data samples. Extensive case studies on switching networks and power systems are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Unlike most of the existing works on economic dispatch, where the distributed consensus-based algorithms are conducted continuously or periodically, the event-triggered mechanism is employed for saving communication resources. For uncertainties, whose upper bounds may be even more significant than nominal weights, we design a general framework for the distributed event-triggered algorithm and an adaptive law for adjusting the coupling weights. The upper bounds of the communication uncertainties are not required in the design, and the adaptive tuning of coupling weights is proved to be able to compensate for the adverse effects caused by uncertainties in the consensus-seeking phase. Noteworthy, the design of event-triggered parameters is independent of the communication topology, which makes the proposed algorithm fully distributed. We also prove that the Zeno triggering of the event-triggered algorithms does not exist. Finally, a case study with the communication network represented by the random multiradius geographical graph is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the derived algorithms.},

However, there are major challenges in scaling up the throughput of such networks. Lightning network and Spider network are alternates that build bidirectional payment channels on top of cryptocurrency networks using smart contracts, to enable fast transactions that bypass the Blockchain. In this article, we study the problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We first propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid model that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a two-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless there is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment processing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of on-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a throughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within the capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed-loop policies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open-loop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature. We investigate this through simulations.},

Furthermore, we establish a lower bound on the information gain of positive networks, i.e., weighted networks with positive weights. This bound reveals that the information gain may exhibit an exponential dependence on the graphical distance between the transmitter and the receiver nodes.

  abstract     = {We present a parallel data-driven strategy to identify finite-dimensional functional spaces invariant under the Koopman operator associated to an unknown dynamical system. We build on the Symmetric Subspace Decomposition (SSD) algorithm, a centralized method that under mild conditions on data sampling provably finds the maximal Koopman-invariant subspace and all Koopman eigenfunctions in an arbitrary finite-dimensional functional space. A network of processors, each aware of a common dictionary of functions and equipped with a local set of data snapshots, repeatedly interact over a directed communication graph. Each processor receives its neighbors’ estimates of the invariant dictionary and refines its estimate by applying SSD with its local data on the intersection of the subspaces spanned by its own dictionary and the neighbors’ dictionaries. We identify conditions on the network topology to ensure the algorithm identifies the maximal Koopman-invariant subspace in the span of the original dictionary, characterize its time, computational, and communication complexity, and establish its robustness against communication failures.},

To this end, one technique lemma is first given, which provides computed formulations of several induced norms and the characteristic polynomial of a constant matrix. Then, by employing Brouwer&#39;s fixed-point theorem, it is shown that the considered CGRNs have at least one nonnegative equilibrium. Furthermore, a novel approach is presented to prove that the CGRNs under consideration have a unique nonnegative equilibrium, which is globally exponentially stable. These exponential stability criteria can be verified by solving several simple linear matrix inequalities or computing an induced norm of a constant matrix, which can be easily realized by usual software tools. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is worth emphasizing that after a simple modification, the approach proposed in this article can be applied to many models of nonlinear systems with bounded time-varying delays, including GRNs and neural networks.},

The synthesis method decomposes the problem into a set of smaller problems, one for each agent by leveraging the structure in the model, and the specifications. We show that the running time of the method is linear in the number of agents. The size of the problem for each agent is exponential only in the number of neighboring agents, which is typically much smaller than the number of agents. We demonstrate the applicability of the method in case studies on disease control, urban security, and search and rescue. The numerical examples show that the method scales to hundreds of agents with hundreds of states per agent and can also handle significantly larger state spaces than our prior work.},

Second, given a period for the scheduling sequence, we identify sufficient conditions on the plant dynamics and the network parameters such that the plants admit static state-feedback controllers that are favorable for the stability conditions presented. The main apparatus for our analysis is a switched system representation of the individual plants in an NCS whose switching signals are time-inhomogeneous Markov chains. Our stability conditions involve the existence of sets of symmetric and positive definite matrices that satisfy certain (in)equalities. We identify the existence of stabilizing periodic scheduling sequences and their corresponding favorable state-feedback controllers under ideal communication between the plants and their controllers as special cases of our results.

First, from the perspective of cooperative tracking of heterogeneous multiagent systems, a hierarchical finite-time control framework is established, which consists of an upper-level interactive observer layer and a lower-level local controller layer. By separating neighboring information interaction from local dynamics control, the proposed framework allows to design upper-level observers and lower-level local controllers separately. Second, by introducing a potential function related to the consensus and observing errors, a distributed finite-time observer is designed for each CV to observe a startup reference trajectory available for only part of the CVs. Third, a distributed local finite-time controller is designed for each CV to track its observed startup reference trajectories. Within the proposed framework, finite-time observing and tracking of the startup reference trajectory are strictly proved to guarantee cooperative startup control.

  abstract     = {Important complex networks, including critical infrastructure and emerging industrial automation systems, are becoming increasingly intricate webs of interacting feedback control loops. A fundamental concern is to quantify the control properties and performance limitations of the network as a function of the structure of its dynamics and control architecture. We study performance bounds for networks in terms of both optimal and robust feedback control costs as a function of the system dynamics and actuator structure. For unstable network dynamics, we demonstrate a tradeoff between feedback control performance and the number of control inputs, in particular, showing that optimal cost can increase exponentially with the number of unstable nodes in the network. Likewise, we demonstrate a tradeoff between robustness and the numbers of control and adversarial inputs, which shows that either an increase in the number of unstable nodes or the number of adversarial inputs can make optimal cost increase exponentially or become infinite. We also derive a bound on the performance of the worst-case actuator subset for open-loop stable networks, providing insight into dynamics properties that affect the potential efficacy of actuator selection in terms of measures for how close the open-loop dynamics are to instability. However, we show that such a bound is generally not guaranteed even for open-loop stable networks in terms of robustness to adversarial inputs. When the open-loop network dynamics has a finite &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H_\infty$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; norm with respect to the adversarial inputs, we find an analogous performance bound of the worst case actuator set.

However, the operation of train platoons faces great challenges induced by model uncertainties, unpredictable resistances, and time-varying disturbances. To address these problems, consensus-based robust cooperative control schemes are presented in this article for both homogeneous and heterogeneous train platoons. Taking the physical connection between carriages into consideration, each train in the platoon is modeled as a negative-imaginary (NI) system, and the NI property is rigorously proved in this article. In the foundation of cooperative control theories of NI systems, robust strictly NI controllers considering the network topology are utilized to track a predefined motion reference. The proposed controllers are robust to both mass uncertainties and external disturbances. Moreover, the line utilization for the railway system and the ride comfort for the passengers are improved using the proposed control schemes. Numerical simulations are given to showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controllers.},

In many engineering applications, however, one subsystem can also affect others via “unintended” interactions that can significantly change the intended network&#39;s behavior. Although unintended interactions can be modeled as disturbance inputs to the subsystems, these disturbances depend on the network&#39;s states. Thus, a disturbance attenuation property of each subsystem is insufficient to ensure that the network is robust to unintended interactions. Here, we provide conditions on subsystem dynamics and interaction maps, such that a network is robust to unintended interactions. These conditions require that each subsystem asymptotically attenuates constant external disturbances, is monotone or “near-monotone,” the unintended interactions are monotone, and the prescribed interactions do not contain feedback loops. We apply this result to guide the design of resource-limited genetic circuits composed of feedback-regulated subsystems.},

Then, we investigate the region of attraction and derive an explicit relation between the initial states and the DoS parameters to guarantee convergence of the state trajectories. Furthermore, we investigate a destabilization problem from the perspective of malicious attackers and present an instability condition.

It is proven that at the MESE and MSE points, the system achieves the lowest possible cumulative cost, while each user individually is penalized with the minimum cost compared to the corresponding cost of any efficient satisfaction equilibrium (ESE) and of any SE, respectively. A decentralized low complexity algorithm, based on the best response dynamics, is proposed, which converges to the MSE equilibrium, while it can efficiently handle the dynamic behaviors of the users in the network.

  abstract     = {This article studies the moving-target enclosing control problem for a group of mobile agents, under the assumption that the amplitude of the target&#39;s velocity is unknown a priori . The target&#39;s velocity is time-varying and can be viewed as a signal generated by an exogenous linear system. The neighbor topology of the agents is determined by their positions relative to the target at each time instant. Based on the relative positions, a distributed observer is proposed for the agents to cooperatively estimate the velocity of the target. Then, a novel distributed control law is proposed based on the obtained estimates. It is shown that under the proposed control law, the agents eventually move along a common circle of the desired radius around the moving target and achieve any desired spaced pattern along the circle. Furthermore, conditions are derived under which the collision between each agent and the target is avoided, and the interagent collision avoidance is also guaranteed by preserving the counterclockwise order of the agents around the target. Finally, a simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control law.},

To address this problem, the subsystem connection topology of the NDS is utilized and a sufficient and necessary condition is derived for its controllability and observability in this article. It is observed that the effects of the transmission zeros and the uncontrollable/unobservable modes of subsystems should be eliminated by subsystem connections to guarantee the controllability/observability of an NDS. Moreover, a sufficient condition and a necessary condition are provided for constructing controllable/observable NDSs in the view of subsystem connection topology and subsystem internal input/output signal, respectively.

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamics of complex systems is a central task in many different areas ranging from biology via epidemics to economics and engineering. Unexpected behavior of dynamic systems or even system failure is sometimes difficult to comprehend. Such a data-mismatch can be caused by endogenous model errors, including misspecified interactions and inaccurate parameter values. These are often difficult to distinguish from unmodeled process influencing the real system like unknown inputs or faults. Localizing the root cause of these errors or faults and reconstructing their dynamics is only possible if the measured outputs of the system are sufficiently informative. Here, we present criteria for the measurements required to localize the position of error sources in large dynamic networks. We assume that faults or errors occur at a limited number of positions in the network. This invariable sparsity differs from previous sparsity definitions for inputs to dynamic systems. We provide an exact criterion for the recovery of invariable sparse inputs to nonlinear systems and formulate an optimization criterion for invariable sparse input reconstruction. For linear systems, we can provide exact error bounds for this reconstruction method.},

The objective of the ride-sharing company is to improve the customer experience by minimizing the wait-time before pickup. Meanwhile, the drivers attempt to maximize their profit by choosing the best location to wait in the environment between the ride requests assigned to them. The objectives of the ride-sharing company and the drivers are not aligned, and the company has no direct control over the waiting locations of the drivers. The focus of this article is to provide two indirect control methods for the ride-sharing company to optimize the set of waiting locations of the drivers, thereby minimizing one of two objectives: 1) the expected wait-time of the customers or 2) the maximum wait-time of customers. The proposed indirect control methods are: 1) sharing information to a subset of the drivers on the location of other waiting drivers and 2) paying drivers to relocate. We show that the problem of finding the optimal control is NP-hard for both objectives and both control methods. For the information sharing method, we provide an LP-rounding algorithm to minimize the expected wait-time and a three-approximation algorithm to minimize the maximum wait-time. To incentivize the drivers to relocate with payments, we provide three-approximation algorithms for both objectives. Finally, we evaluate the proposed control methods on real-world data and show that we can achieve up to 80% improvement for both objectives.},

We show that this approach encompasses results existing in the literature, and provides a systematic approach for studying bearing rigidity on any differential manifold in &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$SE(3)^n$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of agents. The second contribution is the derivation of a general form of the rigidity matrix, a central construct in the study of rigidity theory. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the infinitesimal rigidity of a bearing framework as a property of the rank of the rigidity matrix. Finally, we present two examples of multiagent systems not encountered in the literature and we study their rigidity properties using the developed methods.},

The cost of the remote estimator is the estimation error covariance, whereas the cost of the self-interested strategic sensor includes an additional term related to its private information. A Stackelberg game is employed to model the interaction between the strategic sensor and the remote estimator, where the leader (strategic sensor) first designs the encoder, and the follower (remote estimator) then determines the decoder. We derive the optimal encoder and decoder based on the mismatched cost functions, and characterize the equilibrium for some special cases. One interesting result is that the equilibrium can be achieved by transmitting nothing under certain conditions. The main results are illustrated by numerical examples.},

We consider a setting where the links between networks have small weights, or are used less frequently than links within each subnetwork. Using spectral perturbation theory, we analyze the diffusion rate and convergence rate of the investigated systems. Our analysis shows that the first-order approximation of the diffusion and convergence rates is independent of the topologies of the individual graphs; the rates depend only on the number of nodes in each graph and the topology of the connecting edges. The second-order analysis shows a relationship between the diffusion and convergence rates and the information centrality of the connecting nodes within each subnetwork.

  abstract     = {We consider a discrete-time system, comprising a first-come-first-served queue, a nonpreemptive server, and a scheduler that governs the assignment of tasks in the queue to the server. The server has an availability state that indicates, at each instant, whether the server is busy working on a task or is available. In the latter case, if the queue is nonempty, then a task-assignment control policy implemented by the scheduler either assigns a new task to the server or allows it to rest. The server also has an integer-valued activity state that is nonincreasing during rest periods, and is nondecreasing otherwise. An instantaneous service rate function ascribes to each possible value of the activity state a probability that the server can complete a task in one time step. For a typical instantaneous service rate function, the completion probability decreases (server performance worsens) as the activity state increases. The scheduler policy has access to the queue size and the entire state of the server. In this article, we study the problem of designing scheduler policies that stabilize the queue. We show that stability, whenever viable, can be achieved by a simple policy that bases its decisions on the availability state, a threshold applied to the activity state, and a flag that indicates when the queue is empty. The supremum of the service rates achievable by stabilizing policies can be determined by a finite search. Our results remain valid even when the instantaneous service rate function is not monotonic.},

Despite its nonlinearity, time-varying OPF is commonly solved every 5–15 min using local-search algorithms. Failing to obtain the globally optimal solution of power optimization problems jeopardizes the grid&#39;s reliability and causes financial and environmental issues. The objective of this article is to address this problem by understanding the optimality behavior of OPF solution trajectories. An empirical study on California data shows that, with enough variation in the data, local search methods can solve OPF to global optimality, even if the problem has many local minima. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a backward mapping that relates the time-varying OPF&#39;s global solution at a given time to a set of desirable initial points. We show that this mapping could act as a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm on an implicitly convexified formulation of OPF, justifying the escape of poor solutions over time. This work is the first to mathematically explain how temporal data variation affects the complexity of solving power operational problems.},

This is reminiscent of the so-called Jump-Markov Systems in control theory, allowing the network topology to change over time and, thus, facilitating to model a plethora of useful applications in wireless communication, traffic, or logistics. We argue that the common back-pressure control policy is inadequate to control such network dynamics and propose a novel control policy inspired by the paradigms of Model-Predictive Control. Specifically, by defining a suitable but arbitrary prediction horizon, our policy takes into account future network states and possible control actions. This stands in clear contrast to most other policies which are myopic, i.e., only consider the immediate next state. We show numerically that such an approach can significantly improve the control performance and introduce several variants of the policy, thereby trading off performance versus computational complexity. In addition, we prove so-called throughput optimality of our policy, which guarantees stability for all network flows that can be maintained by the network topology. Interestingly, in contrast to general stability proofs in model-predictive control, our proof does not require the assumption of a terminal set, i.e., the prediction horizon is not required to be large enough as to reach a predetermined set of states with special properties. Finally, we provide several illustrating examples, one of which being a network of assembly-queues. This network, in particular, constitutes an interesting system class for which our policy exerts superiority over general backpressure policies, with the latter ones even losing their throughput optimality.},

In contrast to the existing works by Liu and Chopra, Wang, Wang, Liang et al., and Zhang et al. that provide asymptotic convergence and require all the robots to have full access to the desired global task reference and communicate via either undirected or strongly connected graphs, the goal of this article is to propose an estimation and control framework so that task-space coordinated tracking can be achieved in a finite-time and robust manner over a directed graph with a spanning tree. Specifically, a supertwisting-based distributed estimator is developed first for each robot to estimate the desired global task trajectory in the finite time. By incorporating this estimated information, finite-time distributed adaptive control laws are designed to achieve task-space coordinated tracking irrespective of uncertain robot dynamics and disturbances. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations are presented.},

This article presents a plug-and-play safety framework that can be applied together with high-performance control algorithms, e.g., emerging from learning techniques. The framework ensures constraint satisfaction for a network of uncertain linear control systems during control, learning, and during topology changes in the form of agents joining or leaving the network with prior plug-in or plug-out requests. The presented approach is based on safe sets and tube-based tracking controllers, which can be designed in a distributed fashion, i.e., using only local information. The presented plug-and-play procedure requires only the update of the safe sets of the agents directly involved in the plug-and-play operation making the operation computationally efficient compared to completely redesigning all safe sets. The capabilities of the safety framework are illustrated using numerical examples.},

The proposed DEAN algorithms allow each node to repeatedly perform a local approximate Newton update, which leverages tracking the global Newton direction and dissipating the discrepancies among the nodes. Under less restrictive problem assumptions in comparison with most existing second-order methods, the DEAN algorithms enable the nodes to reach a consensus that can be arbitrarily close to the optimum. Moreover, for a particular DEAN algorithm, the nodes linearly converge to a common suboptimal solution with an explicit error bound.

A key challenge is the large number of (partially uncertain) variables that increase the computational burden and that complicate the structured consideration of uncertainties. Reducing the number of decision variables by means of aggregation can help alleviate these issues. However, despite the frequent use of aggregation for populations of storage devices, few works in the literature provide formal justification. In this article, we investigate aggregation of heterogeneous (storage) devices with time-varying power and energy constraints. In particular, we propose mild conditions on the constraints of each device, guaranteeing the applicability of an aggregated model in scheduling without any loss of optimality in comparison to the complete problem.

Agents communicate their updated values to each other, though we do not impose any restrictions on the timing with which they do so, nor on the delays in these transmissions. Furthermore, we allow agents to independently choose their stepsizes, subject to mild restrictions. We further provide the means for agents to independently regularize the problems they solve, thereby improving convergence properties while preserving agents’ independence in selecting parameters. Larger regularizations accelerate convergence but increase the error in the solution obtained, and we quantify the tradeoff between convergence rates and quality of solutions.

It is assumed that multiagent systems are subject to some external disturbances, and the control inputs of the agents satisfy Lispchitz continuity. These two distinguished features render the existing distributed optimization algorithms, especially the subgradient-based algorithms inapplicable due to the employment of discontinuity of subgradients. To solve such a challenging resource allocation problem, a new kind of continuous-time proximal algorithm is designed with the aid of convex optimization theory and the internal-model technique. The proximal algorithm is further augmented by introducing an event-based communication scheme such that the continuous-time communication among the agents is avoided successfully. The theoretical analysis shows that the multiagent systems under the proposed algorithms can converge to the optimal solution of the considered problem, while the external disturbances are rejected. Besides, the Zeno behavior can be excluded for the proximal algorithm with event-based communication. Finally, the numerical simulations are given to verify the established theoretical results.},

A new class of improved Laplacian potential functions is proposed by presenting two notions of any signed digraph: induced unsigned digraph and mirror (undirected) signed graph, based on which two distributed averaging protocols are designed using the nearest neighbor rules. It is shown that with any of the designed protocols, signed-average consensus (respectively, state stability) can be achieved if and only if the associated signed digraph of signed network is structurally balanced (respectively, unbalanced), regardless of whether weight balance is satisfied or not. Further, improved Laplacian potential functions can be exploited to solve fixed-time consensus problems of signed networks with directed topologies, in which a non-linear distributed protocol is proposed to ensure the bipartite consensus or state stability within a fixed time. Additionally, the convergence analyses of directed signed networks can be implemented with the Lyapunov stability analysis method, which is realized by revealing the tight relationship between convergence behaviors of directed signed networks and properties of improved Laplacian potential functions.

Computing the gradient of this penalty function in a distributed way is challenging even under the separability assumptions on the original optimization problem. Our technical approach shows that the distributed computation problem for the gradient can be formulated as a system of linear algebraic equations defined by separable problem data. To solve it, we design an exponentially fast, input-to-state stable distributed algorithm that does not require the individual agent matrices to be invertible. We employ this strategy to compute the gradient of the penalty function at the current network state. Our distributed algorithmic solver for the original constrained optimization problem interconnects this estimation with the prescription of having the agents follow the resulting direction.

Inspired by vast applications of this kind of problem in large-scale machine learning, the local cost function of each node is further set as an average of a certain amount of local cost subfunctions. For this scenario, most existing solutions based on the proximal method tend to ignore the cost of gradient evaluations, which results in degraded performance. We instead develop a distributed stochastic proximal-gradient algorithm to tackle the problems by employing the local unbiased stochastic averaging gradient method. At each iteration, only a single local cost subfunction is demanded by each node to evaluate the gradient, then the average of the latest stochastic gradients serves as the approximation of the true local gradient. An explicit linear convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is established with constant dual step-sizes for strongly convex local cost subfunctions with Lipschitz-continuous gradients. Furthermore, it is shown that, in the smooth cases, our simplified analysis technique can be extended to some notable primal-dual domain algorithms, such as DSA, EXTRA, and DIGing.

On the other hand, the minmax strategy, recently developed in solving graphical games, provides distributed solutions but prevents the agents from reaching a global Nash equilibrium. In this article, we propose a novel differential graphical game formulation, which promises the existence of solutions that 1) lead to global Nash equilibrium and 2) are distributed in the sense that each agent only uses the state information of its own and its direct neighbors.

  abstract     = {Communication technologies are being continuously developed to provide improved support of real-time links for an industrial Internet of Things. This article considers a general and flexible distributed control architecture over real-time links. No bounds are assumed on the value of delays that are modeled as random variables. An accurate modeling and analysis framework is provided and the exact value of a control performance cost function is calculated. The results provide the required tools for optimization-based design of distributed networked control systems. A case study is presented in which networked controllers are designed based on the consensus algorithm for coordination of multiple parallel power electronic converters. It is shown that consideration of the communication effects in the controller design process is crucial for achieving superior performance.},

We study the behavior of an asynchronous algorithm based on dual decomposition and block coordinate subgradient methods under assumptions weaker than those used in the literature. At the same time, we allow different agents to use local stepsizes with no global coordination. Sufficient conditions are provided for almost sure convergence to the solution of the optimization problem. Under additional assumptions, we establish a sublinear convergence rate that, in turn, can be strengthened to the linear convergence rate if the problem is strongly convex and has Lipschitz gradients. We also extend available results in the literature by allowing multiple and potentially overlapping blocks to be updated at the same time with nonuniform and potentially time-varying probabilities assigned to different blocks.

In this article, we construct and implement forced variational integrators for the formation control of autonomous agents modeled by double integrators. In particular, we provide an accurate numerical integrator with a lower computational cost than traditional solutions. We find error estimations for the rate of the energy dissipated along with the agents&#39; motion to achieve desired formations. Consequently, this permits to providing sufficient conditions on the time step for the convergence of discrete formation control systems such as the consensus problem in discrete systems.

The collective behavior of structured populations governed by these dynamics can vary significantly. Particularly in social dilemmas, myopic optimizations typically lead to Nash equilibrium payoffs that are well below the optimum, e.g., the tragedy of the commons , whereas imitations can hinder equilibration while allowing higher cooperation levels and payoffs. Motivated by economic and behavioral studies, in this article, we investigate how the benefits of the two dynamics can be combined in an intuitive decision rule, rational imitation , that is to mimic successful others only if it earns you a higher payoff. In contrast to purely rational (best-response) or purely imitative decision rules, the combination in rational imitation dynamics both guarantees finite time convergence to an imitation equilibrium profile on arbitrary networks and can facilitate high levels of cooperation for small public goods multipliers.},

Indeed, paradoxically, an approximate network with fewer edges could be more informative in terms of how a system operates than a more accurate representation including a large number of “weak” links. Broadly, this article explores the meaning of approximating a network belonging to a certain class using another network belonging to a subset of its class (the set of approximators). We posit that any network approximation algorithm is expected to satisfy at least a congruity property. By congruity, we mean that if the approximated network belongs to the set of approximators, then the algorithm should map it into itself. From a technical perspective, we choose a class of dynamic networks with a directed tree (polytree) structure as a set of approximators and analytically derive a technique, which asymptotically satisfies the congruity property when the observation horizon approaches infinity. Also, we test such a technique using high-frequency financial data. Financial data provide a challenging benchmark since they are not expected to meet the theoretical assumptions behind our methodology, such as linearity or stationarity.},

High computational cost is the main obstacle for a more frequent online cascading failure search, which is essential to improve system security. We propose a more efficient search framework with the aid of a graph convolutional network (GCN) to identify as many critical cascading failures as possible with limited attempts. The complex mechanism of cascading failures can be well captured by training a GCN offline. Subsequently, the search for critical cascading failures can be significantly accelerated with the aid of the trained GCN model. We further enable the interpretability of the GCN model by a layerwise relevance propagation algorithm. The proposed method is tested on both the IEEE RTS-79 test system and China&#39;s Henan Province power system. The results show that the GCN-guided method can not only accelerate the search of critical cascading failures, but also reveal the reasons for predicting the potential cascading failures.},

Then, a unified adaptive hybrid attitude control law is designed such that the command attitude, which is extracted from the command force, can be tracked globally. In addition, three auxiliary systems are proposed to guarantee the boundedness of the thrust, to avoid the singular problem of command attitude extraction, to obviate the usage of the acceleration information, and compensate the adverse of the disturbance. Globally, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved through Lyapunov stable theory. It is shown that the prescribed formation control objective is achieved.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose several novel distributed gradient-based temporal-difference algorithms for multiagent off-policy learning of linear approximation of the value function in Markov decision processes with strict information structure constraints, limiting interagent communications to small neighborhoods. The algorithms are composed of the following: first, local parameter updates based on the single-agent off-policy gradient temporal-difference learning algorithms, including the eligibility traces with state-dependent parameters and, second, linear stochastic time-varying consensus schemes, represented by directed graphs. The proposed algorithms differ in their form, definition of eligibility traces, selection of time scales, and the way of incorporating consensus iterations. The main contribution of this article is a convergence analysis based on the general properties of the underlying Feller-Markov processes and the stochastic time-varying consensus model. We prove under general assumptions that the parameter estimates generated by all the proposed algorithms weakly converge to the corresponding ordinary differential equations with precisely defined invariant sets. It is demonstrated how the adopted methodology can be applied to temporal-difference algorithms under weaker information structure constraints. The variance reduction effect of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by formulating and analyzing an asymptotic stochastic differential equation. Specific guidelines for the communication network design are provided. The algorithms&#39; superior properties are illustrated by characteristic simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Identifying influential nodes in network dynamical systems requires the manipulation of topological and dynamic characteristics within ideal experiments. However, seldom we have access to experimental settings that could afford targeted interventions or to calibrated mathematical models that could support faithful what/if analyses. Our knowledge of the network dynamical system is often limited to the time series of individual nodes in some real experiments. Using these time series, it is possible to undertake a number of inference tasks, from reconstructing the topology of the network to discovering hidden nodes. Whether time series of real experiments could help pinpoint causal influence within the network is an open question. Here, we address this question in the context of synchronization problems, where the influence of a node is defined as the extent to which adding noise at that particular node affects the overall synchronization of the entire network. For linear time-invariant dynamics and undirected topologies, we demonstrate the possibility of exactly detecting the most influential nodes in the network without a calibrated mathematical model, using only time series of a real experiment, where all nodes are plagued by noise. Beyond illustrating our results on classical and second-order consensus protocols, we consider two real-world datasets: 1) 1) firearm prevalence in the USA and 2) players&#39; movements in a soccer game. Just as our conclusions support the emergence of influential states, which have a less stringent legal environment, they hint at the instrumental role of players, who are critical to the offense strategy of the team.},

We consider two types of operator responses: i) coordinated emergency response and ii) uncoordinated autonomous disconnects, which may lead to cascading failures. To evaluate resilience under response i), we consider a bilevel mixed-integer second-order cone program. This problem is computationally challenging to solve due to mixed-integer variables in the inner problem and nonconvex constraints. Our solution approach exploits the properties of power flows on radial DNs operating in a postattack contingency state to refine the classical generalized Benders decomposition method. Specifically, we suggest a modification of the right-hand side of the generalized Benders cut to be a value determined by the sum of values of a subset of inner dual cost coefficients. We show how the size of this subset can be selected to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between solution accuracy and computational effort. Furthermore, we evaluate DN resilience under response ii) by sequentially computing autonomous component disconnects due to operating bound violations resulting from the initial attack and the potential cascading failures. Our approach is useful for estimating the gain in resilience under response i), relative to ii).},

  abstract     = {The computational efficiency of the asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) against its synchronous version has been well documented in recent works. Unfortunately, it usually works only for the situation that all workers retrieve data from a shared dataset. As data get larger and more distributed, new ideas are urgently needed to maintain the efficiency of ASGD for decentralized training. This article proposes a novel ASGD over decentralized datasets where each worker can only access its local privacy-preserved dataset. We first observe that due to the heterogeneity of decentralized datasets and/or workers, the ASGD will progress at wrong directions, leading to undesired solutions. To tackle this issue, we propose a decentralized asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (DASGD) method by weighting the SG via the importance sampling technique. We prove that the DASGD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/K \frac12 ) on nonconvex training problems under mild conditions. Numerical results also substantiate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Decomposing the large distribution grids into interconnected microgrids (MGs) can potentially enhance the power system&#39;s efficiency, sustainability, resiliency, and reliability. However, energy management within the entire network would be more complicated and challenging. This article develops a novel energy management framework for interconnected MGs based on a blockchain technology. Utilizing the blockchain technology can potentially enhance the system security, and also reduce the system risks, mitigate financial fraud, and cut down the operational cost. A priority list is first defined to get into an efficient energy tradeoff within the interconnected MGs. Moreover, the incentive contract is proposed to provide a price discount for a party that purchases more power from one sub-MG. A stochastic framework based on the unscented transform technique is also established to manage the uncertainties associated with hourly load demands and output power of renewable energy sources. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved through the blockchain-based energy/power management algorithm. The case study includes residential, industrial, and commercial MGs-namely, three residential, one commercial, and one critical load (hospital). The simulation results show the high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and validate its economic and reliability merits.},

First, a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition for structural controllability of multiagent networks is derived, that is, a multiagent network is structurally controllable if and only if the communication digraph is leader–follower connected. Next, the minimal controllability problem is studied. It is shown that the minimal controllability problem is solvable, and a method of polynomial complexity to accomplish minimal structural controllability is developed. In addition, the structural controllability of specified Cartesian product networks is discussed and a necessary and sufficient condition concerning the factor networks for the structural controllability is established.

This forms a dynamic linear quadratic Gaussian game with asymmetric information. We show that under certain conditions, players&#39; strategies that are linear in their private types, together with Gaussian beliefs, form a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) of the game. This is a signaling equilibrium due to the fact that future beliefs on players&#39; types are affected by the equilibrium strategies. We provide a backward-forward algorithm to find the PBE. Each step of the backward algorithm reduces to solving an algebraic matrix equation for every possible realization of the state estimate covariance matrix. The forward algorithm consists of Kalman filter recursions, where state estimate covariance matrices depend on equilibrium strategies. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the solution of the algebraic matrix equation for scalar actions. Finally, we present numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In future transportation systems, the charging behavior of electric autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) fleets, i.e., fleets of electric self-driving cars that service on-demand trip requests, will likely challenge power distribution networks (PDNs), causing overloads or voltage drops. In this article, we show that these challenges can be significantly attenuated if the PDNs&#39; operational constraints and exogenous loads (e.g., from homes or businesses) are accounted for when operating an electric AMoD fleet. We focus on a system-level perspective, assuming full coordination between the AMoD and the PDN operators. From this single entity perspective, we assess potential coordination benefits. Specifically, we extend previous results on an optimization-based modeling approach for electric AMoD systems to jointly control an electric AMoD fleet and a series of PDNs, and analyze the benefit of coordination under load balancing constraints. For a case study of Orange County, CA, USA, we show that the coordination between the electric AMoD fleet and the PDNs eliminates 99% of the overloads and 50% of the voltage drops that the electric AMoD fleet would cause in an uncoordinated setting. Our results show that coordinating electric AMoD and PDNs can help maintain the reliability of PDNs under additional electric AMoD charging load, thus significantly mitigating or deferring the need for PDN capacity upgrades.},

We give a series of stable conditions to achieve the local stability and global stability of the SLS manifold, and address the influence of network structure to guarantee the SLS. We find that the existence of a directed spanning tree of the network structure is the necessary condition for achieving the SLS, and design a novel algorithm to regulate the network structure to reach the SLS as well. Extensive examples illustrate the SLS performance with both the Lorenz systems and Chua&#39;s circuits embedded.},

State of the art cell balancing algorithms assume highly accurate SOC estimation which can only be achieved using model-based control solutions. Unfortunately, electrochemical models of batteries are complicated and are still not reliable enough. We propose a simple consensus-based cell balancing algorithm that does not assume any knowledge of the electrochemical model of the battery. Instead, our algorithm only uses SOC estimates from online measurements to make sequential balancing decisions. Using martingale techniques, we prove that our algorithm equalizes the SOC of all cells with probability 1 even with very noisy SOC estimates under a general non-i.i.d. noise model. We then analyze the convergence time of our algorithm as a function of the problem parameters. We also prove performance guarantees for the more challenging case where balancing is done while the battery is charging or discharging. Finally, we present simulations that support our theoretical claims and show the reliability of our algorithm. Our model-free cell balancing is easy to implement and therefore is a major step towards making active cell balancing practical.},

The analysis shows the balance of influence between the two leader nodes. We show that the problem of selecting at most k absolute leaders to shift the average opinion is NP-hard. Then, we reduce the problem to a problem of submodular maximization with a submodular knapsack constraint and an additional cardinality constraint, and propose a greedy algorithm with upper bound search to approximate the optimum solution.

  abstract     = {In the operation of networked control systems (NCSs), where multiple processes share a resource-limited and time-varying cost-sensitive network, communication delay is inevitable and primarily induced by, first, intermittent sensor sampling to restrict nonurgent transmissions, and second, resource management to avoid contentions, excessive traffic, and data loss. In a heterogeneous scenario, where control systems may tolerate only specific levels of sensor-to-controller latency, delay sensitivities need to be considered in the design of control and network policies to achieve the desired performance guarantees. We propose a cross-layer optimal co-design of control, sampling, and resource management policies for an NCS consisting of multiple stochastic linear time-invariant systems which close their sensor-to-controller links over a shared network. Aligned with advanced communication technology, we assume that the network offers a range of latency-varying transmission services for given prices. The performance of the local closed-loop systems is measured by a combination of linear-quadratic Gaussian cost and a suitable communication cost, and the overall objective is to minimize a defined social cost by all three policymakers. We derive optimal control, sampling, and resource allocation policies under different cross-layer awareness models, including constant and time-varying parameters, and show that higher awareness generally leads to performance enhancement at the expense of higher computational complexity. This trade-off is shown to be a key feature to select the proper interaction structure for the codesign.},

The situation is further exasperated when the design needs to be done in a model-free way using schemes such as reinforcement learning (RL). To reduce this computational complexity, we decompose the large-scale LQR design problem into multiple small-size LQR design problems. We consider the objective function to be specified over an undirected graph, and cast the decomposition as a graph clustering problem. The graph is decomposed into two parts, one consisting of independent clusters of connected components, and the other containing edges that connect different clusters. Accordingly, the resulting controller has a hierarchical structure, consisting of two components. The first component optimizes the performance of each independent cluster by solving the small-size LQR design problem in a model-free way using an RL algorithm. The second component accounts for the objective coupling different clusters, which is achieved by solving a least-squares problem in one shot. Although suboptimal, the hierarchical controller adheres to a particular structure as specified by interagent couplings in the objective function and by the decomposition strategy. Mathematical formulations are established to find a decomposition that minimizes the number of required communication links or reduces the optimality gap. Numerical simulations are provided to highlight the pros and cons of the proposed designs.},

The objective is to deploy all the agents in a decentralized manner such that a certain coverage performance metric is minimized. Unlike many prior works that consider multiagent deployment, we explicitly consider applications where more than one agent may be required to serve an event that randomly occurs anywhere in the domain. The proposed method ensures that the distributed agents autonomously cover the area while simultaneously relaxing the requirement of constant communication among agents. In order to achieve the stated goals, a self-triggered coordination strategy is developed which determines how agents should move without having to continuously acquire information, as well as exactly when to communicate and receive new information. Through analysis, the proposed strategy is shown to provide asymptotic convergence similar to that of continuous or periodic methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the number of messages exchanged while accomplishing the deployment task.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale integration of renewables in power systems gives rise to new challenges for keeping synchronization and frequency stability in volatile and uncertain power flow states. To ensure the safety of operation, the system must maintain adequate disturbance rejection capability at the time scales of both rotor angle and system frequency dynamics. This calls for flexibility to be exploited on both the generation and demand sides, compensating volatility and ensuring stability at the two separate time scales. This article proposes a hierarchical power flow control architecture that involves both transmission and distribution networks as well as individual buildings to enhance both small-signal rotor angle stability and frequency stability of the transmission network. The proposed architecture consists of a transmission-level optimizer enhancing system damping ratios, a distribution-level controller following transmission commands and providing frequency support, and a building-level scheduler accounting for quality of service and following the distribution-level targets. We validate the feasibility and performance of the whole control architecture through real-time hardware-in-loop tests involving real-world transmission and distribution network models along with real devices at the Stone Edge Farm Microgrid.},

The optimization objective is to compute a feasible solution within the intersection of a series of constrained sets such that a global payoff function summed by a group of local ones is minimized. Meanwhile, each local payoff function and constrained set are just privately available to their respective agent. To accomplish the concerned constrained optimization objective, a fully distributed continuous-time algorithm resorting to a projection-based auxiliary dynamics is synthesized without using global topology information. The proposed distributed optimization algorithm is privacy-preserving in the sense that no actual state information is exchanged between distinct agents during the seeking progress. Besides, the associated stability analysis is carried out in terms of the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, a source localization example is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed optimization algorithm.},

In this regard, continuous-time coordination dynamics are proposed for two kinds of directed communication topologies including weight-balanced and weight-unbalanced digraphs. When the pseudogradient is strongly monotone and Lipschitz continuous as well as the extended pseudogradient is Lipschitz continuous, it is theoretically shown that the proposed dynamics could solve the generalized Nash equilibrium problem with and without local action sets, respectively.

We formalize this operator theoretic approach, define and characterize restricted parameter sets under which the mapping has a singleton output, independent binding constraints, and is differentiable. We show that for any power network, these analytical properties hold under almost all operating conditions and can thus be relied upon in applications. We further provide a closed-form expression for the Jacobian matrix of the OPF operator and describe how various derivatives can be computed using a recently proposed scheme based on homogenous self-dual embedding.

  abstract     = {Within the context of distributed average tracking (DAT) for multiagent networks (MANs), the convergence rate of DAT algorithms is a key evaluation index. Practically, it is generally required to construct DAT algorithms with a fast convergence rate for engineering MANs. Herein, the fast DAT problem for MANs in the presence of multiple time-varying reference signals generated by linear nonautonomous systems is investigated for the first time. Compared with most existing results on DAT for MANs with multiple time-varying external signals, the present system model is much more generic and the DAT can be guaranteed in finite time. In particular, by using combined tools from the Luenberger canonical form theory of linear multivariable systems and nonsmooth control theory, a new type of distributed observer is developed to estimate the average reference signal based on which a local tracking controller is skillfully designed and utilized. With the designed controller, the considered DAT can be achieved within a finite time depending on the initial states of agents. When the initial state of each individual agent is unavailable, a new type of fixed-time distributed observer for estimating the average reference signals and a local fixed-time tracking controller based on implicit Lyapunov functions are further proposed to solve the DAT problem in fixed time, which is independent of the initial states of agents. In addition, numerical simulations are performed to verify the validity of the designed DAT algorithms.},

The proposed networked estimation is a variant of single time-scale protocol and is based on consensus on a-priori estimates and measurement innovation. The necessary connectivity condition on the sensor network and stabilizing block-diagonal gain matrix is derived based on our previous works. Considering additive faults in the presence of system and measurement noise, the estimation error at sensors is derived and proper residuals are defined for fault detection. Unlike many works in the literature, no simplifying upper-bound condition on the noise is considered and we assume Gaussian system/measurement noise. A probabilistic threshold is then defined for fault detection based on the estimation error covariance norm. Finally, a graph-theoretic sensor replacement scenario is proposed to recover possible loss of networked observability due to the removal of the faulty sensor. We examine the proposed fault detection and isolation scheme on an illustrative academic example to verify the results and make a comparison study with related literature.},

The behavior of agents and targets under optimal control can be described by a hybrid system. This enables the use of infinitesimal perturbation analysis to obtain an online centralized solution through a gradient-based algorithm. We identify conditions under which this centralized solution to the parametric optimization problems can be recovered in a decentralized and event-driven manner. In the decentralized scheme, each agent optimizes its performance based on local information, except for one type of nonlocal event requiring communication from a nonneighbor agent, giving rise to a quantifiable “price of decentralization.” Simulation examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of this “almost decentralized” optimization algorithm and compare it to its fully decentralized counterpart where the aforementioned nonlocal event is ignored.},

The agents are interdependent in a way where the state of security of one agent depends not only on its own effort but also on that of the other agents, and each agent can benefit from other agents&#39; security investment and effort. Since the agents are interdependent, they try to take advantage of others&#39; security investment and effort and choose to under-invest, which leads to an inefficient Nash equilibrium (NE). While this has been analyzed extensively in the literature, in this study, we take a different angle. Specifically, we consider the possibility of allowing agents to pool their resources, i.e., to both invest in themselves as well as in other agents. We show that the interaction of strategic and selfish agents under resource pooling (RP) improves the agents&#39; effort level as well as their utility compared to a scenario without RP. We show that the social welfare (total utility) at the NE of the game with RP is higher than the maximum social welfare attainable in a game without RP but using an optimal incentive mechanism. Furthermore, we show that while voluntary participation in the latter scenario here, is not generally true, it is guaranteed under RP.},

With the purpose of mitigating the effects from possible abnormal data during the signal transmission, an innovation constraint with adaptively determined threshold is imposed on the transmitted innovation during the filter process. The aim of the addressed problem is to design a distributed filtering algorithm, which is capable of confining all the estimation errors within certain ellipsoidal regions with prescribed probability and achieving the required average disturbance attenuation specification. By virtue of a convex optimization method, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the requested filtering algorithm, and the desired filtering parameters are then obtained by iteratively solving the corresponding matrix inequalities. Within the established framework, two optimization problems are put forward to seek locally optimal filtering parameters. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed filtering paradigm.},

Global stabilization is of paramount importance in systems biology since attractors represent key phenotypes of biological systems. Most of the previous attempts resort to either near-brute force or analytical searching with huge computational burden. In this article, we propose a novel control scheme that can achieve global stabilization of complex biological networks by alleviating such issues. For this purpose, a Boolean network model of complex biological networks is considered. We first reduce the Boolean network using a simple coordinate transformation with respect to the desired attractor without loss of the information on connectivity needed for global stabilization. We then identify control inputs by searching for a minimum node set whose perturbation makes the reduced Boolean network acyclic. The proposed control scheme is remarkable since our network reduction procedure needs no structural conditions, and global stabilization is guaranteed with modest computational complexity and scalability. To evaluate its applicability, the proposed control scheme is applied to random Boolean networks as well as to a regulation influence network describing the metastatic process of cells, and the results are analyzed in comparison with other approaches.},

The analysis focuses on the statistical moments (mean and variance) of the modeled system. It is first established that the map between the deterministic input of the system, and the statistical moments of the state and output can be described by a time-invariant system. This fact is then used to provide a frequency-domain analysis framework that allows for computing the mean and bounding the variance of the time response of the system to any deterministic input, based on a graphical method. For the special case of networked control systems with i.i.d. delays and drops, it is formally established that the variance bounds are tighter than the ones provided in the previous work. The results are applied to the remote control of a linear process. The delays are obtained experimentally in a setting where two remote processors communicate wirelessly using two XBee modules. Based on these experimental data, it is concluded that the delays associated with two consecutive transmissions are correlated. The provided tools are then used to analyze the input to output behavior of the system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, pinning stabilization of Boolean networks is further investigated based on semi-tensor product of matrices. First, two novel algorithms are devised to obtain a globally stable Boolean network from new perspectives. One of the two algorithms is to find a globally stable Boolean network by altering the columns of the transition matrix, and the other one aims to apply a perturbation method to find the smallest number of pinning nodes, on which the controls are placed to ensure the global stability of the controlled networks. Then, all the required pinning controllers can be designed. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate security and privacy issues in networked supervisory control systems over multiple channel networks. We consider a networked discrete-event system controlled by a supervisor that receives information from sensors and sends control decisions to actuators via observation channels and control channels, respectively. The security problem is studied for the scenario where some of the communication channels are insecure in the sense there exists a passive intruder (eavesdropper) that can access the information-flow in those insecure communication channels. We adopt the concept of opacity, an information flow security property, to characterize the security status of the supervisory control system. Specifically, we assume that the system has a secret and the system is said to be opaque if the intruder can never determine the secret of the system unambiguously based on the information-flow in the insecure channels. We consider the notions of current-state opacity, &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -step opacity, and infinite-step opacity in the networked control setting.

However, the decentralization constraints and the geometry of the state space make the appearance of stable but undesired configurations inevitable. The presence of these undesired stable configurations precludes global convergence to the target configuration. In this article, we address the issue by considering a controlled formation system on special orthogonal groups over a directed graph. Agents of the system are tasked with stabilizing from others at target relative attitudes. The nominal dynamics of the agents are gradient flows of certain potential functions. These functions are parameter dependent, pretuned by the controller. To prevent the formation system from being trapped at an undesired configuration, we formulate and address the problem of whether the controller can steer the system from any configuration to any other configuration by retuning, on the fly, the parameters of the potential functions. We show that the answer is affirmative provided that the underlying graph is rooted with a single root node being fully actuated. We formulate the result as a main theorem and provide a complete proof of the result.},

In practice, most congestion control mechanisms obtain feedback that is different from the framework&#39;s “cost.” This article focuses on explicit congestion notification (ECN), which has been shown to be advantageous when it is available, e.g., with the popular datacenter transmission control protocol mechanism.

To address the aforementioned challenges, we recursively compute and propagate in time the SAT density. Using the SAT density, we then develop decentralized cooperative look-ahead strategies for efficient SAT of an unknown number of targets inside a bounded surveillance area.},

It aims to cooperatively and distributedly determine the majority opinion of agents in a network, where the agents initially vote “in favor of” or “opposed” a proposal. An interesting aspect of this issue is to clarify the lowest resolution of communication required among the agents to determine the majority. In this study, we address this problem with binary-valued communication. To overcome the limitation of the finite capacity of communication channels, we exploit randomized communication, i.e., sending binary values (0 or 1), which are selected according to a probabilistic distribution. Based on this idea, we develop consensus-type algorithms that approximately solve the problem with an arbitrarily prescribed accuracy.},

In some practical applications, velocity measurements may be unavailable due to technology and space limitations, and it is also usually less accurate and more expensive to implement. Before deriving the event-triggered approach, we first present a base algorithm without using velocity measurements, which sets the stage for the development of the event-triggered algorithm. The base algorithm has an advantage over the existing related works in the sense that there is no global information requirement for parameter design. Building on the base algorithm, we present an event-triggered algorithm that further removes the continuous communication requirement and is free of Zeno behavior. It is suitable for practical implementation, since in reality, the bandwidth of the communication network and power capacity are usually constrained. The event-triggered algorithm overcomes some practical limitations, such as the unbounded growth of the adaptive gain and requirement of additional internal dynamics, by constructing a new triggering strategy. In addition, a continuous nonlinear function is used to approximate the signum function to reduce the chattering phenomenon in reality. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the obtained results.},

Considering that existing distributed geographical load balancing is approaching the limit in reducing the energy cost of DCs, cloud service providers (SPs) are motivated to pursue a higher level of cooperation. In this context, cross-SP workload balancing among the DCs operated by different SPs represents a future trend of the DC industry. This article investigates the optimal cross-SP workload balancing when it couples with the electricity markets. First, we assume that there is a central operator (CO) coordinating the DCs owned by various SPs. A noncooperative game is formulated to model the interaction between utilities and CO, which serves as a price maker. Under the centralized coordination of CO, an optimal solution is obtained with an iterative algorithm. Taking into account the computation and privacy issues, a decentralized algorithm is then proposed by utilizing techniques in a state-based potential game. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Simulations using Google workload trace show that the workload balancing among cross-SP DCs results in a lower DC operation cost than the existing price taker approach.},

A key feature of the wireless channel is the superposition (or broadcast) property. In traditional wireless communication systems, the superposition property is usually undesired since it might cause interference that drastically degrades system performance. In contrast, in the multiagent system considered in this article, different agents aim at achieving max-consensus. Therefore, rather than combatting interference due to the superposition property, we design a communication system that exploits this property for a more efficient usage of wireless resources. By simultaneously accessing the wireless channel, each agent obtains a weighted average of the neighboring agents&#39; information states, where weights (namely, channel coefficients) are unknown and fading. Given that each agent has access to this piece of information, we present a switching consensus protocol employing broadcast authorization for agents and show that max-consensus can be achieved under this protocol within a finite number of iterations.},

By delivering the opinion projection onto his/her confidence interval of each agent, an opinion dynamics over a signed switching directed graph is first proposed. Next, by imposing nonempty intersection assumptions on the confidence intervals, it is shown that the bipartite consensus of the proposed opinion dynamics is achieved, given that the underlying switching graph is uniformly jointly strongly connected, and its total graph is structurally balanced. Also, the consensus opinions are shown to be located within all the confidence intervals. This indicates that the ultimate opinions of all the agents are credible.

We model the strategic interactions between the surveillance robot and the intruder as a Stackelberg game; and optimal and suboptimal Markov chain based surveillance strategies in star, complete, and line graphs are studied. We first derive a universal upper bound on the capture probability, i.e., the performance limit for the surveillance agent. We show that this upper bound is tight in the complete graph and further provide suboptimality guarantees for the random walk.

To deal with disturbances and uncertainties, we employ differential inclusions (DIs). By introducing ETC/STC notions in the context of DIs, we extend well-known results on ETC/STC to perturbed uncertain systems. Given these results, and adapting tools from our previous work, we derive inner approximations of isochronous manifolds of perturbed uncertain ETC systems. These approximations dictate a partition of the state space into regions, each of which is associated with a uniform intersampling time. At each sampling time instant, the controller checks which region the measured state belongs to and correspondingly decides the next sampling instant.},

In particular, it formulates spatial and topological resource constraints on attackers for N - k interdiction problems and illustrates the formulation with two new classes of N - k attacks: spatial N - k attacks where the attack is constrained by geographic distance of a bus chosen by an attacker; and topological N - k attacks where the attack is constrained to connected components. These two specific types of N - k attacks compute interdiction plans designed to better model localized attacks, such as those induced by natural disasters or physical attacks. We then formulate these two resource-constrained interdiction problems as bilevel, max-min optimization problems, and present a novel constraint-generation algorithm to solve these formulations. Detailed case studies analyzing the behavior of spatially and topologically resource-constrained problems and comparing them to the traditional N - k interdiction problem are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Sensor scheduling is a well-studied problem in signal processing and control with numerous applications. Despite its successful history, most of the related literature assumes the knowledge of the underlying probabilistic model of the sensor measurements such as the correlation structure or the entire joint probability density function. Herein, a framework for sensor scheduling for remote estimation is introduced in which the system design and the scheduling decisions are based solely on observed data. Unicast and broadcast networks and corresponding receivers are considered. In both cases, the empirical risk minimization can be posed as a difference-of-convex optimization problem, and locally optimal solutions are obtained efficiently by applying the convex-concave procedure. Our results are independent of the data&#39;s probability density function, correlation structure, and the number of sensors.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of distributed state estimation of a linear dynamical process in an attack-prone environment. Recent attempts to solve this problem impose stringent redundancy requirements on the measurement and communication resources of the network. In this article, we take a step toward alleviating such strict requirements by exploring two complementary directions: 1) making a small subset of the nodes immune to attacks, or “trusted;” and 2) incorporating diversity into the network. We define graph-theoretic constructs that formally capture the notions of redundancy, diversity, and trust. Based on these constructs, we develop a resilient estimation algorithm and demonstrate that even relatively sparse networks that either exhibit node-diversity, or contain a small subset of trusted nodes, can be just as resilient to adversarial attacks as more dense networks. Finally, given a finite budget for network design, we focus on characterizing the complexity of (i) selecting a set of trusted nodes, and (ii) allocating diversity, so as to achieve a desired level of robustness. We establish that, unfortunately, each of these problems is NP-complete.},

The adaptive distributed optimal control approach presented in this article extends online approximate dynamic programming to very-large-scale robotics (VLSR) systems that must operate and adapt to highly uncertain and variable environments. Optimal mass transport theory is used to show that, in the Wasserstein-Gaussian mixture model space, the VLSR system&#39;s cost to go can be represented by a value functional of the robot distribution and dynamic environmental maps. The approach is demonstrated on a cooperative path planning problem in which knowledge of the obstacles in the environment changes incrementally over time based on in situ measurements. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods by finding an approximately optimal solution that avoids obstacles and meets a desired final robot distribution using minimum energy.},

Under the concept of virtual leader and the decentralized control approach, biped robots walking in a large-scale team formation are controlled to track their own reference paths with the robust stochastic H ∞ tracking performance. Consequently, the original robust decentralized stochastic H ∞ large-scale biped robot team formation tracking control design problem can be transformed to a set of independent Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI)-constrained optimization problems for each biped robot. To cope with the difficulties in solving the HJIs for the robust decentralized stochastic H ∞ team formation tracking control design, a numerical framework is introduced to approximate the walking biped robot systems. Based on the tensor-product model transformation technique, the set of independent HJI-constrained optimization problems for the robust decentralized stochastic H ∞ team formation tracking control design is converted into a set of independent linear-matrix-inequality-constrained optimization problems, which can be solved efficiently by the convex optimization methods. Since the robust decentralized stochastic H ∞ team formation tracking control can be designed individually, the magnitude of a biped robot team can be easily increased to a very large scale. Finally, a simulation example of decentralized H ∞ formation tracking control design for a 30-scale biped robot team is given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of enforcing safety in multiagent systems at runtime by modifying the system behavior if a potential safety violation is detected. Traditional runtime enforcement methods that solve a reactive synthesis problem at design time have two significant drawbacks. First, these techniques do not scale as one has to take into account all possible behaviors from every agent, and this is computationally prohibitive. Second, these approaches require every agent to know the state of every other agent. We address these limitations through a new approach where online modifications to behavior are synthesized onboard every agent. There is an enforcer onboard every agent, which can modify the behavior of only the corresponding agent. In this approach, which is naturally decentralized, the enforcer on every agent has two components: 1) a pathfinder that corrects the behavior of the agent and 2) an ordering mechanism that dynamically modifies the priority of the agent. The current priority of an agent determines if the enforcer uses the pathfinder to modify the behavior of the agent. We derive an upper bound on the maximum deviation for any agent from its original behavior; that is, all agents make progress. We prove that the worst case synthesis time is quadratic in the number of agents at runtime as opposed to exponential at design time for the existing methods that rely on design-time computation merely. Additionally, we prove the completeness of the technique under some mild assumptions; that is, if the agents can progress safely, then enforcers will find this behavior. We test the technique in collision avoidance scenarios. For 50 agents in a 50 × 50 grid world modeling the common workspace for the agents, the online synthesis requires only a few seconds per agent whenever a potential collision is detected. In contrast, the centralized design-time synthesis of shields for a similar setting is intractable beyond four agents in a 5 × 5 grid world.},

We study air traffic management (ATM) for vehicles in a UAM fleet, while guaranteeing system safety requirements such as traffic separation. Existing ATM methods for unmanned aerial systems, such as UAS traffic management, utilize alternative approaches which do not provide strict safety guarantees. No established infrastructure exists for providing ATM at scale for UAM. We provide a decentralized, hierarchical approach for UAM ATM that allows for scalability to high traffic densities as well as providing theoretical guarantees of correctness with respect to user-provided safety specifications. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a novel UAM ATM architecture that divides the control authority between vertihubs that are each in charge of all UAM vehicles in their local airspace. Each vertihub also contains a number of vertiports that are in charge of UAM vehicle takeoffs and landings. The resulting architecture is decentralized and hierarchical, which not only enables scalability, but also robustness in the event of any individual vertihub or vertiport no longer being operational. Second, we provide a contract-based correct-by-construction reactive synthesis approach that provably guarantees safety properties with respect to user-provided specifications in linear temporal logic. We demonstrate the approach on large-volume UAM air traffic data.},

The contribution of this work is to decentralize random finite set (RFS)-based control of large collaborative swarms for controlling individual agents. The RFS-based control formulation assumes a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density approximation and a complete topology for centralized swarm control. To generalize the control topology in a localized or decentralized manner, a sparse linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is used to sparsify the RFS-based control gain matrix obtained using iterative LQR. This allows agents to use information of agents near each other (localized topology) or only the agent&#39;s own information (decentralized topology) to make a control decision. Sparsity and performance for decentralized RFS-based control are compared for different degrees of localization in feedback control gains which show that the stability and performance compared to centralized control do not degrade significantly in providing RFS-based control for large collaborative swarms.},

  abstract     = {Graphon control has been proposed and developed in [1]-[3] to approximately solve control problems for very large-scale networks of linear dynamical systems based on graphon limits. This article provides a solution method based on invariant subspace decompositions for a class of graphon linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems, where the local dynamics share homogeneous parameters but the graphon couplings may be heterogeneous among the coupled agents. Graphon couplings in this article appear in states, controls, and costs, and these couplings may be represented by different graphons. By exploiting a common invariant subspace of the couplings, the original problem is decomposed into a network coupled LQR problem of finite dimension and a decoupled infinite dimensional LQR problem. A centralized optimal control solution, and a nodal collaborative optimal control solution, where each agent computes its part of the optimal solution locally, are established. The application of these solutions to finite network LQR problems may be via 1) the graphon control methodology [3], or 2) the representation of finite LQR problems as special cases of graphon LQR problems. The complexity of these solutions involves solving one nd×nd dimensional Riccati equation and one n×n Riccati equation, where n is the dimension of each nodal agent state and d is the dimension of the nontrivial common invariant subspace of the coupling operators, whereas a direct approach involves solving an nN ×nN dimensional Riccati equation, where N is the size of the network. For situations where the graphon couplings do not admit exact low-rank representations, approximate control is developed based on low-rank approximations. Finally, an application to the regulation of harmonic oscillators coupled over large networks with uncertainties is demonstrated.},

This cost function uses an automated problem-dependent scaling and introduces an activator function for quadratic convergence of far off Gaussians. The cost function also depends on a target planner to transform user-defined waypoints into “way-areas” by calculating a covariance matrix. These covariances are based upon the given distribution of the target/reference geometry. Then an extended linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) is defined for the swarm problem as an improvement to the iterative LQR (ILQR).

Consider that the network connection is a directed spanning tree and the time-varying communication delays are bounded. Theoretical analyses of the proposed control algorithms for both leaderless and leader-follower (static leader) consensus are studied by employing the Lyapunov technique and function analysis. It revealed that the network achieved global stability and asymptotical convergence with avoidance of Zeno behavior. We experimented with a system of four robotic manipulators and performed numerical simulations for a networked mobile manipulator to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed consensus algorithms.},

In this article, we develop a rigorous notion of “locality” that quantifies the degree to which agents can compute their portion of the global solution of such a distributed optimization problem based solely on information in their local neighborhood. We build upon the results of Rebeschini and Tatikonda to develop a more general theory of locality that fully captures the importance of problem data to individual solution components, as opposed to a theory that only captures response to perturbations. This analysis provides a theoretical basis for a rather simple algorithm in which agents individually solve a truncated subproblem of the global problem, where the size of the subproblem used depends on the locality of the problem, and the desired accuracy. Numerical results show that the proposed theoretical bounds are remarkably tight for well-conditioned problems.},

  abstract     = {We consider the synchronization problem in the leader-follower framework with a single leader in the network. For a leader-follower network, the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix decreases toward zero with an increase in the network size for undirected graphs when the nodes in the graph have bounded neighborhood (fixed number of neighbors) and bounded edge weights. This affects the controller gain of standard nonlinear control approaches used for achieving synchronization as the controller gain is inversely proportional to the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix. As a result, it becomes difficult to realize the controllers in practice due to the significant high gain. In this article, we propose a scalable distributed algorithm for the synchronization of second-order nonlinear heterogeneous multiagent systems. First, we assume that the relative state derivates are available for feedback, and we show that the synchronization error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning a particular controller parameter. It is shown that the control signal is bounded uniformly with respect to this controller parameter, and the system performance does not degrade with an increase in network size. Next, we realize the controller using a reduced-order high-gain observer, and we show that the synchronization error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning a controller and observer parameter, respectively. We show that the control signal is bounded uniformly with respect to these parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller with two examples: 1) a network of oscillators on the IEEE 300-bus system and 2) a platoon of vehicles.},

By sharing and coordinating information, plans, and decisions, these very-large-scale robotic (VLSR) networks can dramatically improve their performance and operate over long periods of time with little or no human intervention. Controlling many collaborative agents to this day presents significant technical challenges. Besides requiring satisfactory communications, the amount of computation associated with most coordinated control algorithms increases with the number of agents. It is well-known, for example, that the optimal control of N collaborative agents for path planning and obstacle avoidance is a PSPACE-hard problem. Also, while necessary for performing basic tasks such as localization and mapping, many sensing and estimation approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and their performance may degrade as uncertainties from disparate sources propagate through the network.},

We first give algebraic conditions for detectability, and isolability of arbitrary parameter perturbations for a lumped plant and then derive graph-theoretical necessary and sufficient conditions for generic detectability and isolability of topology failures for the networked systems. On the basis of these results, we consider the problems of deploying the smallest set of sensors for generic detectability and isolability.

To handle the large state dimension of such systems, an assume-guarantee contract is used to break the large synthesis problem into smaller subproblems. Parameterized signal temporal logic (pSTL) is used to formally describe the behaviors of the subsystems which we use as the template for the contract. We show that robust control invariant sets (RCIs) for the subsystems can be composed to form a robust control invariant set (RCI) for the whole network system under a valid assume-guarantee contract. An epigraph algorithm is proposed to solve for a contract that is valid, an approach that has linear complexity for sparse networks, which leads to a RCI for the whole network system. Implemented with control barrier function (CBF), the state of each subsystem is guaranteed to stay within the safe set. Furthermore, we propose a contingency tube model predictive control approach based on the RCI, which is capable of handling severe contingencies, including topology changes of the network. A power grid example is used to demonstrate the proposed method. The simulation result includes both set point control and contingency recovery, and the safety constraint is always satisfied.},

Given the water injection or pressure at each WDS node, finding the WFs within pipes and pumps along with the pressures at all WDS nodes, constitutes the WF problem. The latter entails solving a set of (non)-linear equations. We extend uniqueness claims on the solution to the WF equations in setups with multiple fixed-pressure nodes and detailed pump models. For networks without pumps, the WF solution is already known to be the minimizer of a convex function. The latter approach is extended to networks with pumps but not in cycles, through a stitching algorithm. For networks with nonoverlapping cycles, a provably exact convex relaxation of the pressure drop equations yields a mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic program (MI-QCQP) solver. A hybrid scheme combining the MI-QCQP with the stitching algorithm can handle a WDS with overlapping cycles, but without pumps on them. Each solver is guaranteed to converge regardless of initialization, as numerically validated on a benchmark WDS.},

The attacker can feed fictitious sensor readings to the controller using its estimate of the plant dynamics and mimic the legitimate plant operation. The controller, in contrast, is constantly on the lookout for an attack; once the controller detects an attack, it immediately shuts the plant off. In the case of scalar plants, we derive an upper bound on the attacker&#39;s deception probability for any measurable control policy when the attacker uses an arbitrary learning algorithm to estimate the system dynamics. We then derive lower bounds for the attacker&#39;s deception probability for both scalar and vector plants by assuming an authentication test that inspects the empirical variance of the system disturbance. We also show how the controller can improve the security of the system by superimposing a carefully crafted privacy-enhancing signal on top of the “nominal control policy.” Finally, for nonlinear scalar dynamics that belong to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we investigate the performance of attacks based on nonlinear Gaussian process learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article offers a physics-based automation with two operation modes: 1) homogeneous deformation mode (HDM) and 2) containment exclusion mode (CEM), to safely plan a large-scale group coordination and resiliently recover safety in the presence of unpredicted agent failures. HDM becomes active when all agents are healthy, where the group coordination is defined by homogeneous transformation coordination functions. At HDM, a desired n-D homogeneous transformation (n = 2, 3) is uniquely related to the desired trajectories of n + 1 leaders and acquired by the remaining followers in real-time through local communication. At CEM, agent coordination is treated as an ideal fluid flow, where the desired agents&#39; paths are defined along stream lines inspired by fluid flow field theory to circumvent exclusion spaces surrounding failed agent(s). This article formally specifies the transitions between the HDM and CEM by using local proximity and applying the continuum deformation properties. More specifically, local proximity is used by agents to define interagent communication in an unsupervised fashion once they recover safety and HDM is activated. On the other hand, properties of homogeneous transformation are applied to quickly detect each arising anomalous situation and exclude failed agent(s) from group coordination of healthy agents.},

This model unifies the traditional constrained optimization problem, the resource allocation problem, and the economic dispatch problem. Unlike the majority of literature where each local objective function is required to be convex, we only require a milder condition that the global objective function is convex. The gradient of the global Lagrangian is estimated locally by each agent using the dynamic average consensus protocol. Synchronously, modified primal-dual dynamics produce the optimal solution via the estimated gradient. The generalized Lagrange multiplier method is introduced to avoid the usual positive projections in the presence of inequality constraints. This leads to smooth dynamics and a continuous Lyapunov derivative, which enables the exponential stability analysis. Simulation examples support the proposed distributed methods.},

First, we establish the relationship between the control invariant sets and the strongly connected components of the state transition graph (STG), and propose a new algorithm to compute the largest control invariant subset. Second, both set stabilizability and time-optimal set stabilization via state feedback are characterized by a breadth-first tree of the STG. Though the prior two problems have been attempted by existing algebraic methods, the primary advantage of our alternative graphical approach is the enhanced computational efficiency. Third, we consider for the first time, the optimal set stabilization problem with general cost criteria, not limited to time optimality. A state feedback controller is constructed for general optimal set stabilization using a shortest-path tree of the STG. Finally, it is straightforward to extend the proposed approach to handle various constraints as well as other types of logical networks by slightly modifying the STG. Two biological networks are used to test the performance of our approach. Results show that in accordance with time complexity analysis, our algorithms can dramatically reduce the running time for the first two problems compared with existing work, and effectively solve the general optimal set stabilization problem.},

Therefore, this article bounds the probability that individual random graphs are connected and bounds the same probability for connectedness of unions of random graphs.

The goal of such systems is to ensure that the state stays in some security set (e.g., magnitudes of nodal voltages and branch currents are within safety bounds). A common practice is to implicitly control the state by controlling the injection; a difficulty is that the number of states that correspond to a given injection can be zero or many. Further, the injection is subject to some uncertainty. The admissibility problem is whether it is possible to ensure that the state stays in the security set, given that the only available information is some uncertainty set that constrains the injection. We extend the recently proposed V-control theory, design a solution framework to test if a given uncertainty set is admissible, and develop a concrete method for ac electrical networks.},

The communication constraint is considered that only a subset of followers have access to the leader, and a quaternion-based nonlinear hybrid distributed observer is first proposed to estimate the leader&#39;s trajectory for each follower. In particular, the proposed distributed attitude observer always evolves on the 3-D unit sphere S 3 . This property guarantees the feasibility of the observer-based distributed control scheme, since the separation principle is satisfied. By incorporating a hysteresis-based switch of a binary logic variable for each pair of neighboring rigid bodies, the proposed hybrid distributed observer achieves the global asymptotic stability for any initial attitude and avoids the unwinding phenomenon. Next, an observer-based attitude tracking control law is developed by combining adaptive technique and hybrid theory, which does not require precise model information and has good robustness to the disturbances. In addition, it is shown that the attitude tracking errors converge to the origin globally asymptotically. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical results.},

These preferences are measured by means of convex and anisotropic (direction-dependent) quadratic proximity metrics, which can be different for each agent. These proximity metrics induce Voronoi-like partitions of the network&#39;s workspace, whose cells may not always be convex (or even connected) sets but are necessarily contained in a priori known ellipsoids. The main contributions of this article are as follows: 1) a distributed algorithm for the computation of a Voronoi-like partition of the workspace of a heterogeneous multiagent network and 2) a systematic process to discover the network topology induced by the latter partition. The distributed implementation of the proposed algorithms is enabled by the utilization of a hypothetical agent which determines when the performance of each agent is acceptable.

RL is an effective way of designing model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) networks with unknown state-space models. However, when the network size is large, conventional RL can result in unacceptably long learning times. The proposed approach is to construct a compressed state vector by projecting the measured state through a projective matrix. This matrix is constructed from online measurements of the states in a way that it captures the dominant controllable subspace of the open-loop network model. Next, an RL controller is learned using the reduced-dimensional state instead of the original state such that the resulting cost is close to the optimal LQR cost. Numerical benefits as well as the cyber-physical implementation benefits of the approach are verified using illustrative examples including an example of wide-area control of the IEEE 68-bus benchmark power system.},

Under this framework, it is shown that a typical algorithm, called surplus-based dual averaging (SDA), can successfully achieve the convergence to the optimal value of the considered optimization problem, which exhibits the robustness to the node errors. Technically, in the proof of this result, an important augmentation of the node errors in the fusion and surplus variables is first introduced, and then by means of the random process theory and the attenuation effect of diminishing step size on node errors, the robustness of SDA is proved.

Each node only knows a common cost function and its local uncertain constraint set. We propose a randomized, distributed algorithm working under asynchronous, unreliable, and directed communication. The algorithm is based on a local computation and communication paradigm. At each communication round, nodes perform two updates: 1) A verification in which they check-in a randomized fashion-the robust feasibility of a candidate optimal point, and 2) an optimization step in which they exchange their candidate basis (the minimal set of constraints defining a solution) with neighbors and locally solve an optimization problem. As a main result, we show that processors can stop the algorithm after a finite number of communication rounds (either because verification has been successful for a sufficient number of rounds or because a given threshold has been reached) so that candidate optimal solutions are consensual. The common solution has proven to be-with high confidence-feasible and, hence, optimal for the entire set of uncertainty except a subset having an arbitrarily small probability measure. We show the effectiveness of the proposed distributed algorithm using two examples: a random, uncertain mixed-integer linear program and a distributed localization in wireless sensor networks. The distributed algorithm is implemented on a multicore platform in which the nodes communicate asynchronously.},

In particular, we design attack-resilient primal-dual algorithms for static and dynamic impersonation attacks by means of robust statistics. For static impersonation attacks, we formulate a robustified optimization model and show that our algorithm guarantees convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution of the robustified problem. On the other hand, a robust optimization model is not required for the dynamic impersonation attack scenario and we are able to design an algorithm that is shown to converge to a near-optimal solution of the original problem.

  abstract     = {Distributed multiagent optimization finds many applications in distributed learning, control, estimation, etc. Most existing algorithms assume knowledge of first-order information of the objective and have been analyzed for convex problems. However, there are situations where the objective is nonconvex, and one can only evaluate the function values at finitely many points. In this article, we consider derivative-free distributed algorithms for nonconvex multiagent optimization, based on recent progress in zero-order optimization. We develop two algorithms for different settings, provide detailed analysis of their convergence behavior, and compare them with existing centralized zero-order algorithms and gradient-based distributed algorithms.},

We assume that the controller remotely controls the plant and the control packet is transmitted over a delayed and fading channel. We formulate the integrated system as an uncertain discrete-time stochastic system with both input delay and multiplicative noise. The innovative contributions of this article are described as follows. We propose a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizing an uncertain-free system. Moreover, for the general uncertain model, we derive the necessary and sufficient stabilization condition in terms of symmetric matrix homogeneous polynomials, which can be verified by linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility test. As an application, under the parallel transmission strategy, we derive an explicit formula for computing the maximum allowable delay bound, which is uniquely determined by system parameters and signal-to-noise ratio.},

The connectivity of the underlying graph of the network system is reduced by an attacker who removes some of the edges, whereas the defender attempts to recover them. Both players are subject to energy constraints so that their actions are restricted and cannot be performed continuously. For this two-stage game, we characterize the optimal strategies for the attacker and the defender in terms of edge connectivity and the number of connected components of the graph. The resilient graph game is then applied to a multiagent consensus problem, where the game is played repeatedly over time. In this article, we study how the attacks and the recovery on the edges affect the consensus process. Finally, we also provide numerical simulation to illustrate the results.},

  abstract     = {In addition to perfectly steering the output concentration of a process network to an exogenous set-point, a desired synthetically implemented biological controller should be able to robustly maintain this regulated output in the face of the extrinsic disturbances and inherent uncertainties due to an ever-varying environment besides the imprecise modeling. Such an ability, which is called robust perfect adaptation (RPA), can be achieved by integral feedback control (IFC). Answering how IFC is (biochemically) constructible in generally unknown synthetic networks has been a research focus in the community. One of these answers, which has been well investigated previously, is to utilize a simple (Hill-type) integral negative feedback controller. Another effective solution, which has made significant progress, is the increasingly being used antithetic integral feedback controller. In this article, by applying these two RPA-achieving controllers in control of an uncertain process network with an arbitrary number of species, the behavior of the resulting closed-loop systems, in which the effect of molecular dilution is also considered, is analyzed. Through this analysis, by assuming that the stability is preserved, it is shown that the latter controller can be approximately reduced to the former (simpler) one by individually increasing one of its parameters (the annihilation rate). Furthermore, to address the stability assumption, exact parametric conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the control systems. These findings can lead us to gain a deeper insight into and to simplify the robust design, performance analysis, and implementation of such living circuits. Simulation results accompany this article&#39;s analytical elaborations.},

For two scenarios, controllers as well as combined time-based and event-based triggering mechanisms are designed such that three goals can be jointly achieved. The first goal is to guarantee asymptotic stability by using the deterministic slots, independent of any knowledge about the use of opportunistic transmissions. Second, the triggering mechanisms are designed such that the opportunistic transmissions satisfy a given token bucket traffic specification. As a third goal, the opportunistic transmission decisions should be dependent on the possible performance improvement attributed to the transmitted message. This property is formalized in the newly defined concept of performance-oriented triggering. The two derived controllers and triggering mechanisms are demonstrated using a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Controlling a preselected subset of nodes (named “target control”) of complex networks with minimal control energy is a critically important physical issue. To address this issue, first, an energy cost function is established by designing an optimal controller, in which an input matrix B is involved as a matrix variable to be determined so as to minimize the control cost. In particular, we integrate the design equations to obtain an equivalent expression of the cost function without solving the Riccati differential equation directly. Second, based on this expression, we derive its gradient with respect to B by introducing some methods for matrix differentiation. Two different constraints, i.e., trace and positive element constraints, which are imposed on the matrix variable B of the cost function, are considered. Last but not least, we propose two corresponding algorithms to solve these two different constraint optimization problems. Numerical examples in directed networks are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This work suggests that the target control of complex networks can reduce both the minimum number of external control sources and the control cost.},

How does the complexity of an adversary&#39;s strategy affect its ability to degrade performance? This article focuses on these questions in the context of graphical coordination games where an adversary can influence a given fraction of the agents in the system, and the agents follow log-linear learning, a well-known distributed learning algorithm. Focusing on a class of homogeneous ring graphs of various connectivity, we begin by demonstrating that minimally connected ring graphs are the most susceptible to adversarial influence. We then proceed to characterize how both the sophistication of the attack strategies (static versus dynamic) and the informational awareness about the network structure can be leveraged by an adversary to degrade system performance. Focusing on the set of adversarial policies that induce stochastically stable states, our findings demonstrate that the relative importance between sophistication and information changes with the influencing power of the adversary. In particular, sophistication far outweighs informational awareness with regards to degrading system-level damage when the adversary&#39;s influence power is relatively weak. However, the opposite is true when an adversary&#39;s influence power is more substantial.},

Then, we derive a linearization for the power flow equations, called generalized three-phase simplified DistFlow, which accounts for shunt elements. Also, it is exact at a freely chosen point while having globally good performance. Using it, we extend the heuristic iterative OPF algorithm, CoDistFlow, to unbalanced three-phase networks. At convergence, three-phase CoDistFlow gives a solution that satisfies the exact nonlinear power-flow equations and the exact security constraints. To theoretically guarantee the convergence of three-phase CoDistFlow, we develop the forced convergent three-phase CoDistFlow. Moreover, we show how to adapt the three-phase CoDistFlow to solve a scenario-based OPF in the presence of uncertainties, whereas other existing OPF solution methods may not offer this possibility. Finally, we perform evaluations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder and comparisons with Ipopt.},

The latter motivates the so-called γ-stabilization problem, which requires the closed-loop system render a particular input-to-output gain, viewing from external perturbation to output to be less than a specified value. It is shown that an H ∞ controller solves the y-stabilization problem and thus is sufficient for the robust output synchronization problem. Nevertheless, when an H ∞ controller does not exist, a new approach is proposed to convert a particular class of MIMO systems into a normal form via repeated singular value decomposition, for which a stabilization controller can be explicitly constructed. By integrating the reference model and internal model techniques, the robust output synchronization problem is solved by the developed approach.},

Specifically, there exist uncertainties in system matrices and inner coupling simultaneously, described by Gaussian noise or deterministic norm-bounded matrices. For each kind of uncertainty, a novel class of resilient estimation algorithms is designed from “centralized” and “distributed” perspectives, respectively. Here, “centralized” means that global information is utilized by each node while “distributed” indicates that only the local information of each node&#39;s own and its neighbors is used in the estimation process. Particularly, for norm-bounded uncertainties, an extended-state method is proposed, where adaptive system matrices are introduced to improve the estimation performance. A recursive upper bound of the estimation error covariance for each node is derived to obtain the estimator gains. Such designed estimation algorithms avoid solving linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, an easy-to-check condition only about the system matrices is provided to guarantee the feasibility of the estimation algorithms on the infinite horizon. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated by several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article studies epidemic processes over discrete-time periodic time-varying networks. We focus on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model that accounts for a (possibly) mutating virus. We say that an agent is in the disease-free state if it is not infected by the virus. Our objective is to devise a control strategy which ensures that all agents in a network exponentially (respectively asymptotically) converge to the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). Toward this end, we first provide 1) sufficient conditions for exponential (respectively, asymptotic) convergence to the DFE and 2) a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic convergence to the DFE. The sufficient condition for global exponential stability (GES) [respectively global asymptotic stability (GAS)] of the DFE is in terms of the joint spectral radius of a set of suitably defined matrices, whereas the necessary and sufficient condition for GAS of the DFE involves the spectral radius of an appropriately defined product of matrices. Subsequently, we leverage the stability results in order to design a distributed control strategy for eradicating the epidemic.},

First, an impulsive control algorithm is proposed for the network by utilizing both current and previous sampled positions. A necessary and sufficient condition is established such that the impulsive-controlled network can exhibit convergent behaviors, including bipartite synchronization, interval bipartite synchronization, and global stabilization. Second, some discussions are further provided to analyze two additional impulsive control algorithms designed with either current or previous sampled positions, in which it is shown that the former algorithm cannot lead to the convergent behaviors of the network, while the latter algorithm can solve the distributed impulsive control problem of the network under some appropriate conditions.

  abstract     = {We consider uplink power control in wireless communication when a large number of users compete over the channel resources. The code-division multiple-access (CDMA) protocol, as a supporting technology of 3G networks accommodating signals from different sources over the code domain, represents the orthogonal multiple-access techniques. With the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is introduced to improve the efficiency of channel allocation. Our goal is to investigate whether the power-domain NOMA protocol can introduce performance improvement when the users interact with each other in a noncooperative manner. It is compared with the CDMA protocol, where the fierce competition among users jeopardizes the efficiency of channel usage. In this work, we conduct analysis with an aggregative game model, and show the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium strategy. Next, we adopt the social welfare of the population as the performance metric, which is the average utility achieved by the user population. It is shown that under the corresponding equilibrium strategies, NOMA outperforms CDMA by the higher efficiency of channel access for uplink communications.},

To articulate this (fixed-) time-synchronized consensus problem, we first propose time-synchronized stability and fixed-time-synchronized stability, a special kind of fixed/finite-time stability, where all the elements of the system state synchronously arrive at the equilibrium at the same time, with the upper bound of the synchronized settling time dependent/independent of initial conditions. Based on fixed-time-synchronized stability, a singularity-free sliding mode control law is designed to solve the fixed-time-synchronized consensus problem. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness, and further exploration of the merit of the proposed controller is provided.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on solving disagreement behavior analysis problems for cooperative-antagonistic networks (CANs) subject to switching topologies, for which the extended structural balance theory is developed by concerning the local nodes instead of global CANs. A notion of simultaneously structurally balanced nodes is proposed, which helps get a role identification framework of all nodes by integrating a generalized leader-follower structure for CANs. It is shown that for any switching CANs, the behavior analysis can be performed by identifying the roles of nodes, where the disagreement behaviors are caused because of the existence of different roles of nodes. A specific class of quasi-interval bipartite consensus behaviors is characterized for CANs by the equivalence between the impact index and the number of simultaneously structurally balanced nodes. In particular, the behavior analysis results for CANs can be applied to analyze the dynamic behaviors for cooperative networks despite any switching topologies. Two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the disagreement behavior results for CANs with switching topologies.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the asymptotic behavior of deterministic, continuous-time imitation dynamics for population games over networks. The basic assumption of this learning mechanism-encompassing the replicator dynamics-is that players belonging to a single population exchange information through pairwise interactions, where they become aware of the actions played by the other players and the corresponding rewards. Using this information, they can revise their current action, imitating one of the players they interact with. The pattern of interactions regulating the learning process is determined by a community structure. First, the set of equilibrium points of such network imitation dynamics is characterized. Second, for the class of potential games and for undirected and connected community networks, global asymptotic convergence is proved. In particular, our results guarantee convergence to a Nash equilibrium from every fully supported initial population state in the special case when the Nash equilibria are isolated and fully supported. Examples and numerical simulations are offered to validate the theoretical results, and counterexamples are discussed for scenarios when the assumptions on the community structure are not verified.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the convex optimization problem with general local constraints including N equality constraints, N inequality constraints, and N closed convex set constraints. Especially, the objective function of the considered problem is the sum of N convex functions, which are seen as local objective functions. First, for the distributed setting, a weight-unbalanced digraph with N nodes is introduced to describe the communication topology. Clearly, in the distributed setting, each node is responsible for a local objective function accompanied with an equality constraint, an inequality constraint, and a closed convex set constraint, which are viewed as local constraints. The aim of this article is to solve the considered convex optimization problem in a distributed manner, i.e., to lead the states of all nodes to a common optimal solution of the considered problem under the condition that each node only knows its own local objective function, and local constraints, and the information of its neighbors&#39; states. Towards this end, by resorting to the exact penalty function method and the gradient descent-like method, two distinct distributed discrete-time algorithms are developed for two different cases, respectively. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the designed algorithms are rigorously analyzed under some common and standard assumptions, and the convergence rates are described in detail. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the stability of a nonlinear dynamical model describing the noncooperative strategic interactions among the agents of a finite collection of populations. Each agent selects one strategy at a time and revises it repeatedly according to a protocol that typically prioritizes strategies whose payoffs are either higher than those of the current strategy or exceed the population average. The model is predicated on well-established research in population and evolutionary games, and has two components. The first is the payoff dynamics model (PDM), which ascribes the payoff to each strategy according to the so-called social state vector whose entries are the proportions of every population adopting the available strategies. The second component is the evolutionary dynamics model (EDM) that accounts for the revision process. In our model, the social state at equilibrium is a best response to the strategies&#39; payoffs, and can be viewed as a Nash-like solution that has predictive value when it is globally asymptotically stable (GAS). We present a systematic methodology that ascertains GAS by checking separately whether the EDM and PDM satisfy appropriately defined system-theoretic dissipativity properties. Our work generalizes pioneering methods based on notions of contractivity applicable to memoryless PDMs, and more general system-theoretic passivity conditions. As demonstrated with examples, the added flexibility afforded by our approach is particularly useful when the contraction properties of the PDM are unequal across populations.},

Yet, in many application domains, data are only available sequentially overtime via compute nodes in different geographic locations. In this article, we consider the problem of learning a model when streaming data cannot be transferred to a single location in a timely fashion. In such cases, a distributed architecture for learning which relies on a network of interconnected “local” nodes is required. We propose a distributed scheme in which every local node implements stochastic gradient updates based upon a local data stream. To ensure robust estimation, a network regularization penalty is used to maintain a measure of cohesion in the ensemble of models. We show that the ensemble average approximates a stationary point and characterizes the degree to which individual models differ from the ensemble average. We compare the results with federated learning to conclude that the proposed approach is more robust to heterogeneity in data streams (data rates and estimation quality). We illustrate the results with an application to image classification with a deep learning model based upon convolutional neural networks.},

In this article, we consider the false data injection (FDI) attacks employed on two communication channels-namely: 1) sensor-to-controller and 2) controller-to-actuator channels. The FDI attacker aims to disturb the systems by injecting external control inputs and fake sensor measurements in the form of Gaussian noises. The problems of attack allocation with resource constraints are studied, i.e., the attacker decides instants of attack occurrence as well as the allocation of attack energy in order to obtain the optimal attack strategy. Also, the optimal attack strategies with respect to both time-invariant and time-varying attack covariances are proposed for two channels, where the time-varying attack covariances suffer a given budget.
